However, variations in sampling layouts such as plot sizes and shapes in forest inventory can cause discrepancies in the estimation of tree biomass carbon, thus hindering planning, sustainable forest management, and conservation of tropical forests. We estimated tree growing stocks (tree density, seedling density, basal area, stand volume, and above-ground biomass carbon) and tree species diversity (Shannon-Wiener Index and Jaccard Index) using different sampling layout in Hazarikhil Wildlife Sanctuary (HWS) of Southeastern Bangladesh. The results obtained from different plot sizes and shapes were compared to those derived from a complete enumeration of 1 ha (10,000 m2) of the same forest land. We also estimated coefficient of variation (CV%) and evaluated optimal plot size and shape in terms of estimation accuracy and time efficiency. The survey was carried out in 450 concentric plots (50 points with three sample plot sizes of 400, 900, and 1134 m2 under circular, rectangular, and square plot shapes) where all trees and bamboo with a DBH of ≥ 5 cm were measured. Moreover, three subplots with a size of 4, 9, and 20 m2 were placed to count the number of seedlings in three different shapes, thus making a total of 450 subplots in 50 points. Our results revealed that tree density, basal area, stand volume and AGBC were 4652, 38 m2, 526 m3, and 98 Mg per hectare, respectively, in the complete enumeration. Tree growing stocks and Shannon-Wiener index estimated in the large (1134 m2) circular plots were close to those in the complete enumeration. The seedling density in small circular subplots was highest. The lower CV% values observed for all these attributes in large circular plots indicated higher accuracy in estimation. We recommend, large (1134 m2) circular plots to estimate growing stocks and tree species diversity while large (19 m2) circular subplots to estimate seedling density in hill forests. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.","Above ground biomass and Biomass carbon estimation and Forest inventory, Growing stocks and Plot size and shape and Tree species diversity and Biomass and Carbon and Density and Estimation and Forests and Sampling and Shape and Trees and Bangladesh and Aboveground biomass and Biomass carbon estimation and Carbon estimations and Forest inventory and Forest inventory, growing stock and Growing stocks and Plot size and shape and Size and shape and Tree species diversity and Tropical forest and aboveground biomass and bamboo and conservation management and estimation method and forest inventory and forest management and sampling and seedling and species diversity and tropical forest and volume and Forest ecology",10.1016/j.foreco.2025.122679,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105000855123&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2025.122679&partnerID=40&md5=5431082b7e945609a51e0e632b19f661,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,﻿TY  - JOUR,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,JUN 1,0378-1127 and 1872-7042,WOS:001459193200001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1001, 3807"

We assessed the temporal dynamics of forest fragments in the eastern direct influence area of Iguaçu National Park and identified the predominant factors for the current landscape configuration. We used Geoprocessing techniques for the automatic delimitation of the sub-basin and Remote Sensing for the spatiotemporal analysis of Landsat images at 15-year intervals (1986, 2001, and 2016) to determine the history of land use and land cover changes. We obtained metrics and indices of the fragments composing the landscape of the agricultural matrix in 2016. Our spatiotemporal analysis revealed that the agricultural matrix was already fragmented in 1986 and that there was an increase in native forest cover during the analyzed period. We identified physical constraints for the implementation of agricultural activities, which were related to the native forest cover rate and its distribution. Of the 204 forest fragments identified in the landscape, 90% have an area below 50 ha.

We conducted a comprehensive plant succession experiment in the greenhouse, utilizing vase soil samples for next-generation sequencing of 16 S rDNA, enzymatic activity assays, and soil chemical properties analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to understand better the prokaryotic interactions within soil environments influenced by ADEs and U. brizantha roots, including differential abundance, diversity, and network analyses. Our findings reveal a complementary relationship between U. brizantha and ADEs, each contributing to distinct positive aspects of soil bacterial communities and quality. The combined influence of U. brizantha roots and ADEs exhibited synergies that enhanced prokaryotic diversity and enzyme activity. This balance supported plant growth and increased the general availability of beneficial bacteria in the soil, such as Chujaibacter and Curtobacterium while reducing the presence of potentially pathogenic taxa.

While the overall global increase in emissions is due to fossil fuel operations, Brazil has as its primary emitter from forestry and land use, and agriculture sectors. Though these sectors can emit, both can play an important role in mitigating global warming, due to the natural ecosystem and agroecosystem capability of carbon absorption. We aimed to understand the impact of carbon removal on Brazil's national inventory. For that, we compared two GHG inventories - Climate TRACE and SEEG - and explored how precipitation and photosynthesis impact their estimates to determine how the inventories capture seasonal variability. First, we compared the GHG emissions and removals estimates for each sector between both inventories, especially the Forestry and Land Use sector. Moreover, we performed correlation analysis and linear regressions between them, at a biome and pixel level between 2015 and 2022. Our results show that differences between the GHG inventories could reach 1 Giga ton of CO2 eq in some years, mainly due to the forestry sector. Furthermore, in some ecosystems, such as Caatinga, precipitation, and photosynthesis were increasing between 2015 and 2022, thus boosting the removal capacity in this biome. In 2022, the Caatinga GHG removal represented almost 50 % of the total removals in Brazil. A higher removal capacity could significantly contribute to achieving net-zero GHG emissions, especially if deforestation and other anthropogenic disturbances to ecosystems are halted. Our findings suggest that the Climate TRACE inventory captures more seasonal variability than SEEG. This outcome highlights the open issue of carbon removal estimates and also that seasonal aspects could be incorporated to improve our understanding. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Carbon removals and Climate change and GHG inventory and Greenhouse gases and Brazil and Carbon sequestration and Low emission and aluminum and chlorophyll a and fossil fuel and nitrogen fertilizer and petrochemical agent and carbon and Caatinga and Carbon removal and Comparative analyzes and Ecosystem carbons and Gas removal and Greenhouse gas emissions and Greenhouse gas inventory and Greenhouses gas and Removal capacity and Seasonal variability and absorption and anthropogenic effect and carbon emission and climate change and comparative study and deforestation and emission inventory and global warming and greenhouse gas and absorption and agroecosystem and Article and artificial intelligence and Brazil and carbon absorption and climate change and coal mining and ecosystem and greenhouse effect and greenhouse gas and machine learning and photosynthesis and precipitation and scrub and soil management and solid waste management and waste water management and agriculture and article and biome and carbon dioxide equivalent and climate change and correlation analysis and deforestation and forestry and fossil fuel and greenhouse gas emission and human impact (environment) and land use and linear regression analysis and nonhuman and pharmaceutics and temperature and Greenhouse gas emissions,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.177932,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85211215300&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2024.177932&partnerID=40&md5=a726b9f62ceddb8a3dadbd1dac959708,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1012

Remote sensing techniques, including multi-spectral data, lidar-based canopy height and vertical structure detection, and radar interferometry, have significantly improved our ability to map forest composition, estimate height and biomass, and detect degradation and deforestation features at a finer scale. Machine learning approaches further enhance these capabilities by integrating multiple data sources to produce improved maps of forest attributes and track changes over time. Despite these advancements, uncertainties remain due to limited ground-truth validation, and the structural complexity and large spatial heterogeneity of African forests. Future developments in remote sensing should examine how multi-sensor integration of high-resolution data from instruments such as Planet, Tandem-X, SPOT and improved AI methods can refine forest composition, carbon storage and function maps, enhance large-scale monitoring of tree height and biomass dynamics, and improve forest degradation and deforestation detection down to tree level.

This study examined the resources, capabilities and perspectives of land users, i.e., farmers, in relation to reforestation in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (BAF), an ecoregion that hosts 70 % of the Brazilian population while is also a biodiversity hotspot with only 28 % of native vegetation cover remaining. 78 % of the territory of this ecoregion is occupied by rural private properties, indicating the importance of on-farm forest restoration. We studied the pathways of how variation in forest cover can be explained by farmers’ perceptions of incentives, like pro-nature attitudes, and farmers’ resources and capabilities to engage in reforestation. Data were collected through a quantitative survey involving 257 farmers and their properties and forest cover derived from geo-spatial imagery. Using multiple regression models that underlie a path analysis, we found small and non-significant effects of both positive and negative perceptions of farmers on forest cover, but in combination with farmers’ resources and capabilities, these models could explain up to 36 % of variation on forest cover. The capability “slope”, as a proxy for production suitability, and the resource “farm size”, as a proxy for available capital, were always highly positively associated with forest cover in the models excluding and including farmers’ perceptions. These results highlight that reforestation decision making of farmers is complex and should be assessed accordingly, since it does not only regard the perceptions of the forest itself, but also the available resources and capabilities for restoration. Forest conservation and restoration initiatives can benefit from considering the variables assessed in this study; resources, capabilities, and perceptions of incentives and pro-nature motivation, while potential solutions, such as positive policy mechanisms, need to consider the heterogeneity of land and different types of landowners. © 2025 The Authors",Capabilities and Forest cover and Path analysis and Reforestation efforts and Resources and Social perceptions and Atlantic Forest and Brazil and decision making and environmental restoration and forest cover and path analysis and perception and reforestation and smallholder,10.1016/j.landusepol.2025.107559,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002286379&doi=10.1016%2fj.landusepol.2025.107559&partnerID=40&md5=2c3f267314ece0d2d9ae971f2b7d0e68,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1015

The climate-change mitigation potential of the practice, although hypothesized, has not been assessed vigorously. The objective of this research was to measure the extent of SOC accumulation under SPS involving C3 and C4 plants and other prevalent land-use systems in an Oxisol-dominated location in Minas Gerais, Brazil. We determined the overall δ13C in three soil fraction-size groups within six land-use systems. These systems consisted of 8-year-old planted forests, native forest, managed pastures, and three variations of 8-year-old SPS with diverse tree-planting layouts. In the SPS and planted forest treatments, the tree species was Eucalyptus hybrid, and Urochloa decumbens was the grass species in the SPS and pasture treatments. For each treatment, soil samples were collected at depths of 0–10, 10–30, 30–60, and 60–100 cm. These samples were fractionated into three size classes (2000-250 μm, 250-53 μm, and <53 μm) and analyzed for δ13C. The native forest had higher C3 contribution in the topsoil layers. The highest C3 derived SOC stock up to 1 m depth was in the pasture (137 Mg ha-1), and the lowest in the forest (74 Mg ha-1). The pasture also had the highest C4 derived SOC stock and the forest the lowest, but not significantly. The SPS had intermediate values. We infer that the study site had a mixed vegetation in the past, and after the conversion of the land to planted forest/SPS/pasture, the “native” SOC stock could be maintained better in a well-managed pasture than in a degraded native forest. The higher C3-derived SOC stock in the pasture treatment suggests that managed SPS could help retain more soil C in a stable form than in degraded forests. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Agroecosystems and Agroforestry and Carbon sequestration and Climate change mitigation,10.1016/j.geodrs.2024.e00907,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85211594268&doi=10.1016%2fj.geodrs.2024.e00907&partnerID=40&md5=bc49dd816a742b8caf3f9a9fd1b99b05,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAR,2352-0094,WOS:001388726200001,DEC 2024,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1021, 5397"

Such richness may reflect its environmental heterogeneity, which includes different vegetation types (from grasslands to forests). Several endemic species in the Cerrado are strongly associated with open vegetation types. Recent studies have shown that woody encroachment can negatively impact several components of biodiversity. In the present study, we provide information on variation in lizard diversity across different vegetation types in a protected area located in the southern portion of the Cerrado and evaluated the effect of vegetation density on lizard taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity. We predicted that the three aspects of lizard diversity would be negatively affected by vegetation density and that Beta diversity would vary significantly across the vegetation gradient. We confirmed nearly all of our predictions, except for functional diversity, which, contrary to our expectations, was positively influenced by vegetation density. We also found that Beta diversity indices based on both species composition/abundance and phylogenetic features of communities experience a significant turnover across the vegetation density gradient. This study greatly strengthens previous studies that suggest a negative impact of vegetation density (and, consequently, woody encroachment) on lizard diversity.

Estuarine ecosystems dominated by mangrove vegetation are critical for climate change mitigation. However, these ecosystems continue to be degraded at multiple levels. Indonesia, with the largest mangrove forest area in the world, requires conservation and restoration efforts to effectively mitigate climate change impacts. This study aims to analyze the role of estuarine ecosystems in storing carbon for climate change mitigation. This research uses bibliometric analysis method to produce an in-depth and comprehensive analysis. The data source is the Scopus database, visualized using the VOSviewer application. After limitation, 219 out of 1485 documents that fit the inclusion criteria were obtained. The results showed a significant increase in interest in the topic of the role of estuarine ecosystems for climate change mitigation in the last two years. This research underscores the importance of mangroves restoration in estuarine ecosystems, as their condition has significant impacts on climate change and coastal communities. Nature-based solutions such as the use of green energy, implementation of new technologies such as remote monitoring, and ecosystem balance-based policy-making are recommended. The integration of multi-disciplinary and multi-technology approaches is crucial to build resilient, natural estuarine ecosystems and restore ecosystem services.

The study investigates the impact of the Sumatran Fault's active segments on geological instability and examines how human activities and climatic factors contribute to landslide risks. A quantitative approach integrates geological conditions, slope analysis, land cover classification, and rainfall data, validated through field testing. Data sources include geological maps, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data, Landsat 9 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) 2024, and historical rainfall records. Supervised classification using the Maximum Likelihood algorithm and overlay analysis facilitated the identification of landslide-prone zones. The results reveal that igneous rocks dominate 41 % of the area, followed by sedimentary (33 %) and metamorphic rocks (25 %), with steep slopes (24–45%) covering 39 %. Annual rainfall exceeds 1500 mm, with areas receiving >2500 mm constituting 46 % of the region. These factors, combined with deforestation and unsustainable land practices, heighten landslide risks, particularly in the western fault zone. High-vulnerability areas account for 13 % of the region, concentrated in steep and fault-affected zones, while medium-vulnerability zones dominate at 86 %. The study concludes that Pasaman Regency requires integrated strategies, including slope stabilization, reforestation, and sustainable land-use practices, to mitigate landslide risks. Infrastructure resilience, community-based disaster management, and climate adaptation measures are critical for reducing socioeconomic impacts and enhancing environmental sustainability. The findings provide actionable insights for disaster risk reduction and land-use planning, emphasizing the interplay between natural and anthropogenic factors in landslide vulnerability. © 2025, Asociatia Geographia Technica.

The majority of sponges are marine species that play an important role in benthic habitat by maintaining the stability of marine ecosystems through nutrient cycling, habitat provision, and bioerosion. However, marine sponges are not easily identifiable because of their lack of species-level distinctive morphological features, which limits efforts to monitor actual species biodiversity. Indonesia is home to approximately 850 identified species of marine sponges, and Raja Ampat archipelago of West Papua province is known for its exceptional marine biodiversity. Despite the species abundance, the exact number of sponges in the region is not well-documented due to the lack of specific studies providing comprehensive data on their diversity. Therefore, this study aimed to conduct a DNA barcoding analysis using the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene as a marker, combined with morphological analyses of 22 individuals collected in the waters of Sapokreng, Besir, and Mansuar Islands in Raja Ampat. The results showed that 3 samples were identified at the species level (Halichondria sp. and Stylissa carteri) with good query cover and percent identity. This showed the possible presence of undescribed or cryptic species, suggesting a severe lack of reference data for both morphology and molecular analyses of marine sponges in the region.

Based on a 30-year case study of forest restoration on a university campus in Brazil, we assessed (1) how project objectives relate to contemporary multifunctionality and social attributes; (2) how the current state of the forest meets social goals; and (3) how stakeholders perceive the importance of the forest and the project itself. We used documents, interviews, and questionnaires, applying content analysis and narrative interpretation with the “social benefits wheel” and the “five-star social system” to assess how the initial project objectives corresponded to contemporary social development goals and its progress toward social goals. The results revealed that socioecological goals were incorporated from the beginning of the project, ensuring a multifunctional approach. Respondents highlighted ecological, social, and cultural functions, with 84% expressing positive feelings toward the forest.

This paper systematically reviews studies that have assessed the economic costs and benefits of peatland restoration in Indonesia. It summarizes the substantial economic stakes involved in peatland restoration efforts, ranging from millions to billions of dollars. The collective findings emphasize the significant costs required for restoration, alongside the potential economic benefits derived from environmental conservation, climate change mitigation, and sustainable land management. These economic valuations are complemented by a holistic consideration of ecological, social, and cultural factors, providing valuable insights for policymakers and decision-makers. However, while these studies have offered valuable insights into various aspects such as local preferences, willingness to pay, financial costs, and potential economic benefits, none have comprehensively explored the potential trade-offs or forgone opportunities resulting from the proposed restoration programs.

Biodiversity typically influences forest carbon through two primary mechanisms: niche complementarity (complementary utilization of resources among species) and selection effects (dominance of species with specific functional traits). However, the relative importance of these mechanisms in involving subtropical forest carbon storage under varying environmental conditions remains unclear. This study assessed diversity attributes within tree, shrub, and herb layers across three subtropical forest types: coniferous, coniferous/broad-leaved mixed, and broad-leaved forests. We quantified forest aboveground, belowground, and total carbon storage and examined the relationships between forest diversity and carbon storage, and the impact of environmental factors on these relationships. Our findings showed that broad-leaved forests were more conducive to creating carbon storage. In subtropical forests, belowground carbon, a major component of carbon storage, was most affected by environmental factors, followed by species diversity. Functional diversity most strongly exerted influences on aboveground and total carbon stocks, followed by functional trait composition and environmental factors. Environmental factors directly affected forest carbon storage and also indirectly influenced it through plant functional attributes. Notably, the biodiversity of the herb layer exhibited a significant linear correlation with carbon storage. Our results indicate that niche complementarity and selection effects contribute to carbon fixation, with selection effects being more predominant. Based on these findings, we recommend that afforestation policies prioritize enhancing broad-leaved tree species to improve carbon sequestration, as evergreen broad-leaved forests represent the zonal climax vegetation, while also acknowledging the importance of understory vegetation. Thus, in the context of global climate change, it is imperative to thoroughly evaluate the impact of environmental factors on biodiversity and carbon sequestration in forest ecosystems. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",biodiversity-carbon sequestration and environmental factors and forest types and functional diversity and functional traits and niche complementarity and selection effect and species diversity and stand structure and subtropical forest and Biodiversity and Carbon and Carbon Sequestration and China and Ecosystem and Forests and Soil and Trees and Tropical Climate and carbon and biodiversity and carbon storage and environmental factor and niche and selection and species diversity and stand structure and tropical forest and biodiversity and carbon sequestration and chemistry and China and ecosystem and forest and metabolism and soil and tree and tropic climate,10.1111/gcb.70120,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105000094493&doi=10.1111%2fgcb.70120&partnerID=40&md5=ce3175e355a08c6fdf3a403db9af2f0c,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,JOUR,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1037

This study examines the effects of transitioning from extensive pastures to silvopastoral systems on soil ecosystem services (SES) in the Colombian Amazon. We identified sensitive soil indicators to monitor SES changes in response to livestock management, and synergies and tradeoffs between them. Soil samples were collected from three locations to a depth of 30 cm across three land uses: traditional pastures, 15-years-old silvopastoral systems implemented on former pastures, and secondary vegetation. We assessed five critical soil-related ecosystem services: support for plant growth, carbon storage, nutrient cycling, erosion control, and water regulation and aeration. Our findings reveal significant enhancements in multiple soil ecosystem services in silvopastoral systems, with increases of 32 % in plant growth support, 34 % in nutrient cycling, and 16 % in erosion control compared to traditional pastures. Although soil carbon (C) storage showed no significant differences between pastures and silvopastoral systems, both systems exhibited values 16 % higher than secondary vegetation. A positive interconnection among carbon storage, nutrient cycling, and erosion control services was revealed, highlighting them as major drivers of synergies. Seven soil properties were identified as sensitive indicators of changes in land management, which may serve as key proxy for monitoring soil ecosystem services: i) soil organic carbon, ii) pH, iii) soil base saturation, iv) copper, v) magnesium, vi) zinc, and vii) aluminum. These results highlight the potential of silvopastoral systems to improve soil health and resilience, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional livestock management.

In comparison to CK, the SOC content was relatively high in SD (12.82 ± 0.59 g/kg–18.50 ± 0.97 g/kg) and SH (14.67 ± 0.22 g/kg–20.15 ± 0.91 g/kg) following vegetation restoration in the 0–20 and 20–40 cm soil layers (P < 0.05). This depends on the difference in biomass produced by different tree species' combinations, and high plant carbon inputs in SD (388.45 ± 44.61 g/kg) and SH (424.88 ± 18.92 g/kg) treatments will accelerate the return of carbon to soil. The results of the random forest and PLS-PM models identified that microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and microbial necromass carbon (MNC) were the two most important SOC predictors, which promote SOC accumulation in conjunction with plant-derived carbon. Further, it was also found that soil nutrient availability enhanced SOC accumulation by promoting the production of MNC.

Due to various abiotic and biotic factors these forests are under threat and continuously degrading. Anthropogenic influences such as illicit tree felling, grazing, and fuelwood collection in these protected forests have increased significantly. There is little information on biomass, carbon (C) storage, and fluxes in these forest ecosystems. Thus, the present work explores the plant biomass and C dynamics of tropical forest in Pali ranges of Katghora (Chhattisgarh), India. This region (located at 22°22.45' N latitude and 82°19.54' E longitude at 303 m altitude) is amongst the least studied and unexplored. This study is based on the hypothesis that anthropogenic disturbances significantly impact forest biomass production, and C storage patterns, affects C sequestration (Cseq), and regulates C pools and fluxes. The biomass and C storage were measured using a random sampling method in the least disturbed forest (LDF), moderately disturbed forest (MDF), and highly disturbed forest (HDF). The net primary production (NPP) (Mg ha−1 yr−1) in these forests were: 20.08 (LDF), 22.95 (MDF), 6.85 (LDF)., Biomass, C storage, C mitigation (an attempt to reduce the atmospheric CO2), and Cseq ranged from 58.33–145.71 Mg ha−1, 214.06–534.74 Mg ha−1 and 2.40–9.02 Mg C ha−1 yr−1, respectively. The NPP and Cseq were higher at the MDF, whereas plant biomass and C storage were the greatest in the LDF and lowest in HDF. We suggest that the forests need optimal tree density, species composition, and distribution in girth classes to sequester higher amounts of aboveground and belowground C. Besides, the sustainable tree harvesting can help maintain vegetation composition and structure, leading to higher C assimilation and Cseq. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.",Anthropogenic disturbance and Biomass and Carbon sequestration and Carbon stock and Productivity,10.1007/s11258-025-01522-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002716806&doi=10.1007%2fs11258-025-01522-0&partnerID=40&md5=88ec68223fffe0ffa81904de63364358,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1043

This is particularly true in highly biodiverse tropical forests, where increasing nutrient availability can threaten their biodiversity. Hence, our objectives were to compare the kinetics of element release by weathering along an elevation gradient and between forest and pasture in a tropical montane forest region in south Ecuador. We collected soil samples from three plots in both natural forest and pasture, at elevations of 1000, 2000, and 3000 m above sea level (a.s.l., i.e., 18 in total). The sites at 2000 and 3000 m a.s.l. had similar parent material and allowed for evaluating the climatic effect. To assess element mobilization from the soil, we conducted a weathering experiment at a constant pH value (pHstat). During the experiment, ions were released from the soil into solution at pH 3 and removed from the solution using an ion-exchange resin. We described the release of base cations (Ca, Mg, K), Mn, Al, and Fe with a two-step first-order reaction, distinguishing a fast-reacting pool (FP) and a slow-reacting pool (SP), with their associated rate constants. The FP of Ca, Mg, K, and Mn closely correlated with and corresponded in size to the concentrations of the exchangeable cations of these elements (r = 0.78 – 0.96). The FP of Ca, Mg, K, and Mn was significantly larger in the soils under pasture than under forest vegetation, likely because of the input of alkaline ashes during slash-and-burn practices. The sizes of the FP and the SP of all studied elements under both land covers/uses were not significantly different between the sites at 2000 and 3000 m a.s.l., possibly because the opposing effects of increasing precipitation and decreasing temperature canceled each other out. Metal release kinetics differed markedly among sites with different parent materials, indicating that weathering is strongly influenced by the chemical composition of the parent rocks. Our study illustrates that element release by weathering in the soils of south Ecuador is strongly influenced by differences in land cover/use and chemical composition of parent rocks. © 2025 The Authors",Base cations and Chemical weathering and Eastern Cordillera and Element mobilization and Nutrient availability and pHstat experiment and Cordillera Oriental [Ecuador] and Ecuador and Activation energy and Alkalinity and Biogeochemistry and Deforestation and Elastin and Hydrochemistry and Hydrolysis and Ion exchange and Liquid sugar and Weathering and Base cations and Chemical weathering and Eastern Cordillera and Ecuador and Element mobilization and Mobilisation and Nutrient availability and Parent materials and pH-Stat and Phstat experiment and cation and chemical composition and chemical weathering and climate change and concentration (composition) and land cover and land use change and nutrient availability and soil nutrient and weathering profile and Rate constants,10.1016/j.geoderma.2025.117263,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105000550088&doi=10.1016%2fj.geoderma.2025.117263&partnerID=40&md5=5829ff337df9c3c40e46ff1f8439819e,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1044

Landowners must register their land, indicate whether native vegetation needs to be restored (i.e. if there is an environmental debt), and submit a restoration plan to the state government for analysis, validation, and approval. Due to the high cost of forest restoration, natural regeneration has most likely become a viable strategy for Amazonian landowners to meet their environmental debts.

Biodiversity, social adoptability, and preference toward managing medicinal plants in homegardens across elevations in the Menoreh Mountains, Kulonprogo District, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 26: 1316-1324. Pekarangan, or ""homegarden"" is an agroforestry system that provides various products, including low-cost medicinal plants for maintaining family and community health. The Menoreh Mountains in Yogyakarta province, Central Java, is a center of production for medicinal plants that have been utilized by local people for generations. This research was conducted at three elevation levels—100-200 masl (lowland), 400-500 masl (mid-elevation), and >800 masl (highland)—in the Menoreh Mountains, to measure the biodiversity of homegardens, to predict adoption level of and people's preference toward medicinal plants, and to discuss pharmacological activity of the plants against potential epidemics. It involved direct observation of 30 homegardens, and interviews with 45 respondents using 22 close-ended questions from the ADOPT Tool framework. Diversity indices among locations were compared using one-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD post-hoc test, and results from the interviews were analyzed using the ADOPT Tool. The pharmacological activities of the medicinal plants were analyzed through a literature study. The results showed that plant species in the homegardens had five main functions, i.e., food-producing, medicinal, fodder, estate crops, and ornamental plants. A total of 22 species from 13 families of medicinal plants deeply rooted in the local culture were cultivated in the homegardens. Peak adoption of medicinal-plant management in lowland, mid-elevation, and highland communities was predicted at 17%, 98%, and 98% within a period of ten, five, and two years, respectively. Highland people can more easily adopt the cultivation system of medicinal plants than mid-elevation and lowland communities. Turmeric (Curcuma longa) and ginger (Zingiber officinale) were the two most preferred medicinal plants in all locations, that increase immunity via antiviral, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant. This suggests people in the Menoreh Mountains have good resilience to potential epidemics. Still, future research to increase the diversity and characterization of specific compounds of medicinal plants is needed. © 2025, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

In this context, a review of the adoption, composition, and dynamics of AFSs in the Amazon biome was conducted to identify the origin, institutions, and researchers of published studies with results on this scientific topic, focused on trends and characteristics of AFSs diversity in the Amazon. The methodology adopted was a scoping review, based on searches in the Scopus and Web of Science databases, using specific keywords to ensure that the articles addressed topics related to the adoption, composition, and dynamics of AFSs in the Amazon. Following the selection of subtopics, 66 articles were selected and analyzed. The analysis revealed that research on AFSs in the Amazon highlights interactions among traditional knowledge, innovations, and sustainability. The analysis of research published between 1996 and 2023 indicated growth in studies with an interdisciplinary focus, primarily from Brazil. However, internationalization, collaborative networks, and funding factors contribute to the prominence of foreign institutions. Research studies often address topics such as species diversity, agrobiodiversity, and tree growth in agroforestry intercrops. In this context, homegarden agroforestry (HAF) emerges as one of the main subjects of study, encompassing multifunctional environments, richness diversity, and ongoing experimentation with plant species. The choice of species for AFSs is influenced by factors such as labor, personal preferences, and market demands, although loggers and commercial forestry systems tend to have lower diversity, contrasting with HAF. AFSs implementation methods vary according to financing, management, and the farmer’s education and gender. Environmental conservation, food security, ecosystem services, and production flexibility are highlighted as benefits of AFSs, while challenges include technical and economic limitations. This research highlights the strengthening and consolidation of AFSs by addressing scientific gaps and demonstrating the need for studies on the adoption, consolidation, and management of these systems, as well as the relationship between diversity and yield. Future research should be concentrated on deepening studies on the relationship between diversity and yield in AFSs, as well as on management strategies that support the consolidation of these systems in the Amazon biome, integrating innovation, public policy support, and traditional knowledge of farmers. © 2025 by the authors.",agrobiodiversity and bibliometrics and forest plantation and homegarden and polyculture and thematic analysis and Amazonia and agroforestry and biodiversity and biome and conservation management and database and environmental management and future prospect and home garden and innovation and plantation forestry and polyculture and research work,10.3390/land14030524,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001161824&doi=10.3390%2fland14030524&partnerID=40&md5=ee8af2acccf4028671a66a0a562d6842,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,JOUR,3,NA,NA,NA,MAR 3,2073-445X,WOS:001453203100001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1050, 4801"

This study investigates land use and forest area control models in the Anai River basin, West Sumatra Province, Indonesia. Remote sensing data from 2000 to 2022 were used to compile the LULC data, employing CA-Markov Chain approaches to project LULC into 2030. The CA model’s validity and reliability were confirmed using Kappa accuracy, achieving high agreement levels (Kstandard = 88.3%, Kno = 89.3%, Klocation = 91.2%, and KlocationStrata = 90.2%), ensuring the integrity of LULC predictions. Additionally, the development of forest area control policies involved the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), engaging 20 stakeholders from various institutions through focus group discussions. Findings reveal significant shifts from natural vegetation to cultivated areas, notably forest loss (− 40.287 km2) and an increase in built-up areas (75.317 km2), highlighting escalating human pressures. The proposed control model emphasizes sustainable land management practices, including consistent law enforcement, clear regulatory frameworks, conservation efforts, and greening initiatives. The model also explores alternative economic opportunities for local communities, promotes social forestry, fosters stakeholder collaboration, and strengthens traditional institutions. These policy innovations, derived from stakeholder inputs and the AHP analysis, are strategically designed to balance ecological preservation with socio-economic development. The proposed strategies include promoting agroforestry practices, reforesting degraded lands, and implementing payment for ecosystem services (PES) schemes.

However, climate mitigation scenarios have primarily focused on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation/reforestation, and recently direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS). This narrow focus exposes future climate change mitigation strategies to technological, institutional, and ecological pressures by overlooking the variety of existing CDR options, each with distinct characteristics—including, but not limited to, mitigation potential, cost, co-benefits, and adverse side-effects. This study expands the scope by evaluating CDR portfolios, consisting of any single CDR approach—BECCS, afforestation/reforestation, DACCS, biochar, and enhanced weathering—or a combination of them. We analyse the value of deploying these CDR portfolios to meet 1.5 °C goals, as well as their global and regional implications for land, energy, and policy costs. We find that diversifying CDR approaches is the most cost-effective net-zero strategy. Without the overreliance on any single approach, land and energy impacts are reduced and redistributed. A diversified CDR portfolio thus exhibits lower negative side-effects, but still poses challenges related to environmental impacts, logistics or accountability. We also investigate a CDR portfolio designed to support more scalable and sustainable climate mitigation strategies, and identify trade-offs between reduced economic benefits and lower environmental impacts. Rather than a one-size-fits-all scaling down, the CDR portfolio undergoes strategic realignment, with regional customization based on techno-economic factors and bio-geophysical characteristics. Moreover, we highlight the importance of nature-based removals, especially in Brazil, Latin America, and Africa, where potentials for avoided deforestation are the greatest, emphasizing their substantial benefits, not only for carbon sequestration, but also for preserving planetary well-being and human health. Finally, this study reveals that incentivizing timely and large-scale CDR deployment by policy and financial incentives could reduce the risk of deterring climate change mitigation, notably by minimizing carbon prices. © 2025 The Author(s).

A critical and demanding challenge, especially in sandy soils, is ceasing the slash-and-burn in smallholder farming livelihoods to preserve ecosystem services of primary and secondary forests. Here, we examined (i) the recovery of secondary forests in structure, litter layer, and soil health, as well as C storage post-agricultural abandonment of extremely sandy Amazonian soils (> 89 % sand), and (ii) the extent of loss of these gains when a secondary forest is burned for agricultural reconversion. We tracked secondary forests at 2, 5, 10, and 20 years, including slash-and-burning the 20-year-old forest. Our methods included analyzing C stocks in soil, litter, and plants, forest vegetation ecological indexes, litter quality assessed through nitrogen (N), C, and lignocellulose contents, δ13C to indicate organic matter origin, and seven additional soil health indicators. Soil δ13C ranged from −27.1 to −28.8 ‰ across the sites, indicating a negligible influence of tropical grasses on the soil's organic matter and suggesting that pastures were not previously cultivated in these areas. Secondary forest growth accumulated 0.24 and 2.97 Mg C ha−1 y−1 in litter and trees, respectively. Yet, soil C stocks did not show significant changes during 20 years of forest regeneration. Over 18 years, the forest increased the vegetation diversity fourfold and litter N by 41 %, improving forest structure and litter quality. This progress in organic matter aboveground contributed to improved soil biological activity and nutrient storage, facilitating soil health and multifunctionality regeneration as the forest aged. However, slash-and-burn resulted in a 67.6 Mg C ha−1 loss, reverting levels below those of the 2-year-old forest. Returning to agriculture also depleted soil cation exchange capacity, bulk density, and fauna activity, degrading soil's chemical, physical, and biological functions to levels comparable to or worse than those in the youngest forest. We conclude that Amazonian lands abandoned after long-term agriculture still offer potential for ecological restoration, with secondary forests capable of regenerating multiple ecosystem functions, even in sandy soils. However, a single slash-and-burn reverses 20 years of progress and degrades soil health further. Recognizing smallholder farmers' poverty and reliance on slash-and-burn, we advocate for educational and socioeconomic support to stop fires and encourage sustainable agriculture, including bioeconomy incentives and environmental compensation to sustain the perpetuation and benefits of secondary forests in the Amazon. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Biomass and Chronosequence and Ecological restoration and Land degradation and Litter and Soil health and δ<sup>13</sup>C and Amazonas [Brazil] and Brazil and carbon storage and cation exchange capacity and compensation system and ecosystem function and organic matter and restoration ecology and secondary forest and smallholder and soil fertility,10.1016/j.agee.2024.109413,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85211118042&doi=10.1016%2fj.agee.2024.109413&partnerID=40&md5=047c4b8c0da814d327b792185f7d08f0,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1056

Utilizing high-resolution GIS and remote sensing data, the study integrated spatial analysis with carbon stock calculations to assess the implications of forest cover transitions across different forest functions. The findings reveal that production forests experienced the highest deforestation (1,008 ha), contributing to peak carbon emissions of 2,218,017 tons of CO₂ during 2018–2020. Concurrently, carbon sequestration peaked at 1,174,395 tons of CO₂, primarily due to reforestation and natural regeneration in secondary forests and shrubs. Protected forests retained the most extensive carbon stocks, reaching 22,649,615 tons of CO₂ in 2017, underscoring their critical role in carbon storage. This research highlights the balance between carbon loss from deforestation and gains from recovery, offering actionable insights for targeted reforestation, agroforestry systems, and community-based forest management.

However, long-term monitoring using appropriate indicators is necessary to ensure successful ecological restoration. In the State of São Paulo, Brazil, legal instruments define ecological indicators and reference values for monitoring AFS-mediated ecological restoration. OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether biodiverse coffee AFS of different age groups achieved legal reference values in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and recommended strategies for improving legal instruments. METHODS: We evaluated four ecological indicators in AFS areas of two age groups and compared them with reference values. Additionally, we analyzed the relationships among the ecological indicators under study. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Half of the AFS sites did not achieve reference values for all ecological indicators, primarily owing to the management practices used. Additionally, we found that canopy cover had a direct relationship with soil cover; thus, not only did most AFS areas where farmers pruned native trees had canopy cover values lower than those required by legislation but, indeed, lower than the reference value for soil cover. However, this is subject to improvement via ecological restoration-friendly practices, reinforcing the feasibility of establishing this AFS design in protected areas. Despite proper choice of ecological indicators, we recommend that tree and sapling population density be measured separately. SIGNIFICANCE: Despite its narrow scope, this study provided novel insights into the effects of coffee AFS management on the trajectory of ecological restoration and on the construction of proper monitoring frameworks using ecological indicators evaluated in other Brazilian regions or countries. © 2024",Atlantic forest and Ecological restoration and Environmental legislation and Management and Shade coffee and Brazil and Sao Paulo [Brazil] and agroforestry and coffee and environmental policy and population density and protected area and restoration ecology and sapling,10.1016/j.agsy.2024.104245,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85212555756&doi=10.1016%2fj.agsy.2024.104245&partnerID=40&md5=3bb91fd4fef20d82811114dedbab28ae,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAR,0308-521X and 1873-2267,WOS:001394279200001,DEC 2024,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1063, 5029"

This study integrates machine learning with climate and land use data to model current and future fire dynamics in the Caatinga. Using MaxEnt, fire probability maps were generated based on historical fire scars from Landsat imagery and environmental predictors, including bioclimatic variables and human influences. Future projections under SSP1-2.6 (low-emission) and SSP5-8.5 (high-emission) scenarios were also analyzed. The baseline model achieved an AUC of 0.825, indicating a strong predictive performance. Key drivers of fire risk included the mean temperature of the driest quarter (with an importance of 14.1%) and isothermality (12.5%). Temperature-related factors were more influential than precipitation, which played a secondary role in shaping fire dynamics. Anthropogenic factors, such as proximity to farming and urban areas, also contributed to fire susceptibility. Under the optimistic scenario, low-fire-probability areas expanded to 29.129 Mha, suggesting a reduced fire risk with climate mitigation. However, high-risk zones persisted in the Western Caatinga. The pessimistic scenario projected an alarming expansion of very-high-risk areas to 12.448 Mha, emphasizing the vulnerability of the region under severe climate conditions. These findings underline the importance of temperature dynamics and human activities in shaping fire regimes.

In these systems, many conservation initiatives aiming to sustain biodiversity against the trend of intensifying agroforestry management focus on promoting biodiverse tree overstories but engage less with conservation opportunities and challenges associated with agroforest understories. In coffee agroforests with native shade trees, weeding of natural regeneration constitutes lost conservation opportunities. We explore the potential for reducing such losses by rescuing native tree seeds and naturally regenerating seedlings from coffee agroforests and developing local native plant nurseries, which are a critical bottleneck for restoration. For this, we draw on floristic surveys using 42 0.3 ha plots in eight polyculture shade coffee agroforests and collaborative pilot rescue, nursery development and restoration initiatives in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, India. Ninety restoration-relevant native tree species (inferred from species distributions, traits and practitioner knowledge) constituted 37% of all trees recorded in coffee agroforests. The species list included 30 conservation-priority species (endemic to the Western Ghats and/or classified as threatened or near-threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature), most of which were not stocked in existing public nurseries. Experiences from pilot rescue efforts, which collected over 18,000 seeds and seedlings spanning 56 restoration-relevant species in 12 months, underscore the importance of efficient rescue planning focussed on mapping target trees and monitoring phenology, fostering partnerships with agroforest landowners to enhance rescue opportunities and developing nursery infrastructure to house rescued plants and support local restoration efforts. Synthesis and applications. Shade coffee agroforests can contribute to conservation beyond their boundaries as sources of native plants that can help expand and diversify local nurseries and scale up restoration, while alleviating the need to exploit remnant natural forests as plant sources for nurseries and restoration. Harnessing this opportunity requires the development of strategies and partnerships for integrating native plant sourcing, nursery and restoration efforts, backed by policies and initiatives that promote landscape-level benefits of agroforestry for biodiversity and conservation. © 2025 The Author(s).

This study aims to analyze the species richness of WEFs, evaluate their contributions to local livelihoods, and identify challenges to sustainable management. Field surveys were conducted in 40 agroforestry home gardens, representing 40 households actively engaged in these systems. Data were gathered through direct observation and interviews with 228 respondents, all of whom manage their agroforestry areas. A total of 61 WEFs from 16 plant families were discovered, with Phyllanthaceae and Moraceae being the most prominent. High-value species such as Durio kutejensis and Artocarpus integer significantly contributed to household income. However, despite these advantages, land tenure insecurity, limited market access, pest management issues, and the erosion of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) pose major threats to the long-term sustainability of agroforestry systems. The decline of TEK is largely attributed to urban migration among younger generations, disrupting the intergenerational transmission of traditional knowledge. Sustainable harvesting strategies, such as selective hand-picking, were found to be effective in preserving productivity, whereas more aggressive methods were linked to lower yields and tree damage. Policy interventions should focus on securing land rights for uncertified land and social forestry areas by accelerating land certification, simplifying permit processes, and strengthening legal recognition of agroforestry to ensure long-term security for smallholder farmers and indigenous communities. In addition, policymakers should prioritize rural infrastructure development, enhance market access, and support the integration of TEK with contemporary agroforestry practices. These strategies are essential for strengthening the ecological and economic sustainability of agroforestry systems while safeguarding rural livelihoods amid socioeconomic transformations. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.",Agroforestry and Biodiversity and Kalimantan and Sustainable management and Wild fruit and Central Kalimantan and Indonesia and agroforestry and biodiversity and dicotyledon and edible species and fruit and harvesting and land rights and land tenure and smallholder and species richness and sustainability,10.1007/s10457-025-01165-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105000168847&doi=10.1007%2fs10457-025-01165-0&partnerID=40&md5=f3ba1c02cbad29ab64a437a15b08ec55,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,JOUR,3,NA,NA,NA,MAR,0167-4366 and 1572-9680,WOS:001446444400003,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1067, 5493"

All parts of the sugar palm plant organs, from the leaves to the roots, can be utilized, giving it great potential as a superior commodity such as coconut and oil palm. Our review highlighted there are several limitations for developing A. pinnata on an industrial scale. Currently, the A. pinnata industry operates mainly on a household scale, with raw materials sourced from natural stands rather than large-scale cultivation. Additionally, there is no breeding program for A. pinnata trees, resulting in variety and often low sap yields. Traditional management practices further hinder business development and market competitiveness. To promote A. pinnata as a superior commodity for food, energy, and water conservation in Indonesia, several strategies can be implemented: 1) Training and capacity building to increasing farmers' knowledge and skills in cultivating this species, 2) Optimizing the production process and product value chain development of palm sugar and other products such as candy seed, starch, and fibres, 3) Fostering collaboration among stakeholders, especially the government, through policies that support farmers in developing and marketing their products, 4) Promote A. pinnata in watershed rehabilitation and agroforestry for its deep roots that enhance water infiltration, prevent erosion, boost biodiversity, and retain soil moisture.

Despite their importance, peatlands outside protected areas face degradation by grazing and fires, threatening their ability to regulate ecosystem processes sensitive to temperature, such as greenhouse gas emissions, water cycling, biological activity, and organic matter decomposition. Since 2016, we have monitored peat temperatures in two contrasting peatlands–one preserved (within a protected area) and one disturbed (outside the protected area)–to understand how anthropogenic disturbances and climate variability impact these fragile ecosystems. Seasonal patterns dominated temperature variation, accounting for 60% of air and 81%–92% of peatland temperature variation. However, average temperatures and amplitudes differed between peatlands and depths. Interannual variability revealed stronger trends in the disturbed peatland, where a 1°C increase in air temperature caused the trend to increase 0.70°C–0.87°C on average at depths of 0.85 m–0.92 m. By contrast, the preserved peatland showed smaller increases (0.20°C–0.24°C) at comparable depths (1.06 m–1.24 m), suggesting a greater resilience. Temperature variation in the monitored peatlands was majorly driven by seasonal patterns, as revealed by time series decomposition and sinewave fit. Average temperature and amplitude varied between the two peatlands and among sampling sites, reflecting differences in environmental conditions and measurement depth. Interannual variability also exhibited distinct effects between peatlands and monitoring sites. The time series trend component showed more pronounced fluctuations at shallower depths and in the disturbed peatland. For every 1°C increase in the trend component of the air temperature, the trend component of the peatland time series increased by 0.70°C and 0.87°C on average at depths of 0.85 m and 0.92 m, respectively, in the disturbed peatland. In contrast, the preserved peatland exhibited smaller increases of 0.20°C and 0.24°C at comparable depths (1.06 m and 1.24 m). These findings highlight the potential for feedback responses between peatland disturbance and climate change, threatening their critical role in regulating carbon and water cycles.

We evaluated the interactions between edaphic and floristic factors in impacted and reference sites to understand how the impact of the tailings affected the riparian plant communities along the river. The species richness of the adult and sapling strata was, respectively, 46.4 % and 61.5 % lower in the impacted sites relative to the reference sites. A similar pattern was observed for both species and phylogenetic diversity. We also recorded large changes in species composition in the adult and sapling strata in impacted sites relative to the reference sites along the river. These negative changes in the plant community were correlated with drastic increases in soil iron and phosphorus concentration, and fine sand proportion, and decreases in the proportion of carbon and coarse sand in the sites impacted by the mining tailings. We observed a close relationship between plant composition in both the adult and sapling strata with edaphic factors. The alterations in species composition triggered by the deposition of mining tailings may induce significant shifts in ecosystems, potentially prompting numerous tipping points throughout the river basin, as indicated by the different sapling species, some of which are invasive species of highly difficult eradication.

The farming sector in Brazil was responsible for this mobilization and sought alternatives for less impacting soil management allowing a sustainable intensification of agriculture. This sector corresponds to the farmer's organizations and the companies responsible for the supply of inputs and equipment. Academia and research institutions acted in the background in the initial phases, assuming a proactive stance more recently. In this 52-year period of NTS evolution, Brazil went from being a major importer of agricultural products to one of the largest producers and exporters in the world. Many technologies were developed and used during this period, but these technologies demonstrate their potential in a healthy environment, promoted by NTS. One aspect to be considered is that from the beginning, NTS developed in Brazil had an environmental connotation, since it was introduced by farmers to control erosion and protect the soil. NTS evolved with technical support from companies and research, to expand the interaction of agricultural activity with water protection. It finally reached its peak when research institutions observed the effects of crop rotation on carbon sequestration from the atmosphere and on increasing soil biodiversity, disseminating the best strategies for this. The complexity of this process can be assessed and understood when the importance of the interaction of all sectors of the agricultural production chain is recognized, and the Brazilian case can be used to stimulate successful projects for the sustainable intensification of agriculture in other regions of the world. © 2025","Agricultural systems and Conservation agriculture and No-Tillage farming and Research, technology and innovation and Soil and water conservation and Sustainable agriculture",10.1016/bs.agron.2025.02.001,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002493440&doi=10.1016%2fbs.agron.2025.02.001&partnerID=40&md5=3393f150aaac401fb9429c21ae4243cb,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,JOUR,NA,115,146,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1073

Twelve socio-economic factors including demographics, livelihood strategies, and resource accessibility were obtained from local people using a semi-structured questionnaire during May – June 2023. Household knowledge and practices, including valuation of peatland importance, threats, and community participation in protection schemes were measured. Findings showed moderate to high levels of knowledge of peatland characteristics and importance, but a distinct gap between knowledge and practice, especially on sustainable agriculture. Age, education, and training/workshop attendance determined knowledge levels, whereas length of residence and household income influenced peatland protection. Key recommendations to bridge the knowledge-practice gap included dissemination of best management practices, diversifying local-initiative livelihood options, scaling up successful sustainable agriculture, and providing financial incentives.

This study was conducted to develop site-specific scale land cover maps using remote sensing to monitor and quantify mangroves, alongside assessing community perceptions to identify the direct drivers of mangrove cover changes. Results showed that in Balangkayan, (Philippines), the mangrove cover increased by approximately 500 ha between 2014 and 2021, following a decline in 2013 due to Typhoon Haiyan. In Muaragembong (Indonesia), mangrove cover increased by about 176.13 ha between 2000 and 2022 after years of conversion to fish and shrimp ponds. Community perceptions in both sites revealed that natural disturbances, such as strong typhoons and coastal erosion, were the primary drivers of mangrove cover changes.

We use a new genome assembly for Brazil nut to analyze 270 individuals sampled at areas with varying intensities of archaeological evidence. We demonstrate that overall low genetic diversity, with a notable decrease since the Late Pleistocene, is accompanied by significant geographic structure, where evidence for improved gene flow and regeneration by long-term traditional human management is linked to increased genetic diversity.

Apart from being a staple food for coastal communities and playing a role in peatland conservation, sago in Papua also has important social, economic and cultural values. However, due to the pressure of the need for infrastructure development, the area of sago in Papua decreasing and has decreased by 62.5% over 4 years from 2017 to 2021. This paper analyses the potential and use of peatlands for sago development in Papua and reviews the availability of cultivation technology. Data are collected from various sources especially journals, the relevant data are rolled into one, compared and interpreted to get strong conclusions according to the objectives. Several primary sources mention that the distribution of peatlands in Papua are at Mappi, Membramo Raya, Asmat, Mimika, Sarmi, Boven Digoel, Tolikara, Bintuni Bay, South Sorong, Sorong, Kaimana, Nabire, Jayapura, Jayawijaya and Paniai.

A greater understanding of how carbon storage in agroforestry systems varies, and particularly how it is intertwined with the productivity of these systems, could enable farmers and policymakers to make changes that simultaneously increase carbon storage and alleviate poverty. In this study, we used allometric equations to evaluate the carbon storage in the biomass of two complex agroforestry systems in Bali, Indonesia—rustic where a native tree canopy is still present, and polyculture where all native trees have been removed, and the canopy consists only of cropping trees. We then compared these figures to that of a nearby primary forest and linked carbon storage to productivity for both agroforestry systems. We found that the primary forest (277.96 ± 149.05 Mg C ha−1) stored significantly more carbon than either the rustic (144.72 ± 188.14 Mg C ha−1) or polyculture (105.12 ± 48.65 Mg C ha−1) agroforestry systems, which were not significantly different from each other. We found productivity and carbon storage to be significantly positively correlated with each other within the polyculture system but not within the rustic system. We also found that for the rustic system, an increase in the density of native trees is accompanied by an increase in carbon storage, but no significant change in productivity. Consequently, we conclude that within the rustic system, carbon storage can be increased or maintained at a high value by the preservation and encouragement of large native trees, and that this need not necessarily result in a decrease in productivity. © 2025 by the authors.",agroforestry and biomass and carbon and climate change and Indonesia and polyculture and productivity and rustic and Bali and Indonesia and Lesser Sunda Islands and Sunda Isles and agroforestry and biomass and carbon storage and climate change and cropping practice and ecosystem service and polyculture and poverty alleviation and productivity,10.3390/land14020344,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85218857202&doi=10.3390%2fland14020344&partnerID=40&md5=e0ea2ac198b886ed482deee3a0c1e295,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,JOUR,2,NA,NA,NA,FEB,2073-445X,WOS:001431119600001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1085, 4914"

The study aimed to compare the effect of dung removal performed by two functional groups, among themselves and with mineral fertiliser, on improving soil and forage grass characteristics. An experiment in mesocosms was conducted in Southern Brazil during the summer/autumn of 2021, sowing Urochloa brizantha in the treatments: (1) telecoprid species (Canthon rutilans cyanescens), (2) paracoprid species (Dichotomius sericeus), (3) both species together, (4) mineral fertiliser and control with cattle dung. Dung removal was quantified weekly. At the end of the experiment, the soil's physical, chemical and microbiological characteristics, dry biomass and macronutrients (N, P and K) of the leaves and roots, and photosynthetic pigments of grasses were analysed. The dung beetle species studied increased total nitrogen and organic matter contents and their particulate fractions of C and N. Paracoprids decreased the soil bulk density and improved its soil aggregation, influencing the pH and Mg contents, with a reduction in Al levels. They were as efficient as mineral fertiliser in incorporating K into the soil. Treatments with beetles had values similar to mineral fertiliser in the foliar concentrations of P, and paracoprids promoted increases in the K concentration in the leaves and roots of the grass. This functional group was also more efficient in removing cattle dung, which was positively related to the amounts of N, organic matter and its particulate fractions, P, macroaggregates and the cation exchange capacity (CECpH7.0) of the soil.

Nusantara is planned as a sustainable forest city, with 65% of the area designated as a protected zone. The forest city development strategy includes measures to control deforestation, promote reforestation, protect biodiversity, involve local and indigenous communities, and impose a moratorium on mining and plantation licenses. One of the main challenges in implementing these strategies is the condition of the forest ecosystems in the last decades, which have been damaged due to resource extraction and conversion of primary forests for various land uses. This has led to a threat to biodiversity and the habitat of endemic flora and fauna. Efforts are being made to establish a robust regulatory framework to achieve ecological justice goals by protecting biodiversity and local wisdom. This paper will present data, information, and analysis on existing land use, biodiversity potential, regulations, and policy rules aimed at protecting biodiversity and local wisdom. The special authority of Nusantara provides an opportunity to achieve ecological justice in development, but there are still challenges that need to be addressed, such as resolving socio-ecological problems due to past policy issues. © 2025 Institute of Physics Publishing.

However, monitoring the forest understory—a critical area for assessing logging impacts—remains challenging due to limitations in conventional methods such as field inventories and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) surveys, which are time-consuming, costly, and often lack accuracy in complex environments. Additionally, aerial and satellite imagery frequently underestimate the full extent of disturbances as the forest canopy obscures understory impacts. This study examines the effectiveness of the relative density model (RDM), derived from airborne LiDAR data, for mapping and monitoring understory disturbances. A field-based validation of LiDAR-derived RDM was conducted across 25 sites, totaling 5504.5 hectares within the Jamari National Forest, Rondônia, Brazil. The results indicate that the RDM accurately delineates disturbances caused by logging infrastructure, with over 90% agreement with GNSS field data. However, the model showed the greatest discrepancy for skid trails, which, despite their lower accuracy in modeling, accounted for the largest proportion of the total impacted area among infrastructure. The findings include the mapping of 35.1 km of primary roads, 117.4 km of secondary roads, 595.6 km of skid trails, and 323 log landings, with skid trails comprising the largest proportion of area occupied by logging infrastructure. It is recommended that airborne LiDAR assessments be conducted up to two years post-logging, as impacts become less detectable over time. This study highlights LiDAR data as a reliable alternative to traditional monitoring approaches, with the ability to detect understory impacts more comprehensively for monitoring selective logging in SFM areas of the Amazon, providing a valuable tool for both conservation and climate mitigation efforts. © 2025 by the authors.",airborne laser scanner and Amazon understory monitoring and public forest concessions and reduced-impact logging and relative density model and sustainable forest management and Air Craft and Data and Deforestation and Density and Monitoring and Selective Cutting and Skids and Sustainable Forest Management and Amazonia and Aerial photography and Air navigation and Carbon sequestration and Deforestation and Logging (forestry) and Airborne laser scanners and Amazon understory monitoring and Density modeling and Forest concessions and Public forest concession and Public forests and Reduced-impact logging and Relative density and Relative density model and Sustainable forest management and Understorey and accuracy assessment and airborne survey and biodiversity and carbon sequestration and disturbance and environmental impact assessment and forest management and forestry practice and GNSS and lidar and model validation and satellite data and selective logging and understory and vegetation mapping and Global positioning system,10.3390/f16010130,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85216220090&doi=10.3390%2ff16010130&partnerID=40&md5=d07c9e5343a107ad5e716bd499accfaf,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,JOUR,1,NA,NA,NA,JAN,1999-4907,WOS:001404102700001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1094, 5206"

Satellite images and aerial photography have been widely utilized to map the dynamics of mangrove ecosystems. These photos were used as inputs for international policy agreements, including Indonesia, in defining regulations about carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere caused by deforestation and land use changes. This study aimed to map forest to identify deforested areas and assess the effect of illegal logging on mangrove forest carbon stocks in Lubuk Kertang Village, North Sumtera, Indonesia using unmanned aerial vehicle imagery and field. METHODS: Photometric data analysis was obtained from high-resolution satellite imagery using a da-Jiang innovations Phantom 4 Professional at 150 meters’ altitude. Careful deployment of flight paths to obtain high accuracy in optimal image capture overlapped with 90 percent was conducted from August 5 to 8, 2023. Satellite imagery was captured in some areas considered important, such as rehabilitated mangrove forests and oil palm plantations. Both research sites produced orthophotos and digital surface models, and the integration of unmanned aerial vehicle with the photometry approach led to the development of the structure from motion method of data processing. FINDINGS: This study compared carbon stores in the mangrove forest of Lubuk Kertang Village in 2022 with carbon stock in 2023 or after the recurrence of illegal logging using an unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetric field survey. The distribution of aboveground biomass in the mangrove covers an area of 253.4 hectares with total carbon in 2022 of 15.819 megagrams per hectare. Meanwhile, in 2023, the aboveground biomass was 70.94 megagrams per hectare with total carbon of 8.927 megagrams per hectare. This study shows that the mangrove forest in Lubuk Kertang Village has lost around 56 percent from the previous year. CONCLUSION: Illegal logging poses a significant threat to carbon sequestration/stock lost. This phenomenon highlights the need for improved monitoring and conservation strategies. The combination of remote sensing techniques and field surveys offers a powerful tool for blue carbon inventories, mangrove conservation planning, and monitoring climate, community, and biodiversity projects in coastal ecosystems. © 2025 The author(s).

This research evaluates the diversity, carbon stock, and economic valuation of mangrove ecosystems within the Wakatobi Biosphere Reserve. Data collection occurred at 11 stations distributed among four primary islands: Kaledupa, Wangi-Wangi, Tomia, and Binongko. Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) measurements were utilized to estimate biomass and carbon storage, employing species-specific allometric equations. Economic valuation utilized carbon trading data from the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX Carbon) as of 3 January 2025, alongside the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) and Voluntary Market (VM) prices. The mangrove ecosystem of the Wakatobi Biosphere Reserve covers an area of 10,994 hectares and is in excellent ecological condition. The Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index values for tree and pole strata demonstrate moderate diversity (1-3), with Kaledupa and Binongko classified as moderate, whereas Wangi-Wangi and Tomia are categorized as low (<1). The evenness score indicates a high classification for tree strata (>0,6), with the exception of Wangi-Wangi, which is classified as medium (0,4-0,6). Wangi-Wangi Island is classified as low for splinter strata (<0,4), whereas Tomia, Kaledupa, and Binongko Islands are classified as medium. The composition of mangrove species differed across islands, with Sonneratia alba, Rhizophora mucronata, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, and Ceriops tagal identified as the most prevalent species and significant contributors to carbon sequestration. The total carbon stock was estimated at 329,82.06 tons, with Kaledupa Island exhibiting the highest stock at 317,226.51 tons, while Binongko Island recorded the lowest at 2,053.8 tons. The economic valuation of carbon storage indicates significant potential: IDR 18,763,377,420 or USD 1,159,307 (IDX Carbon), IDR 266,390,582,055 or USD 16,459,103 (SCC), and IDR 43,155,274,293 or USD 2,666,375 (VM), underscoring the financial importance of mangrove conservation.

This paper provides a systematic literature review towards an evaluation of the current knowledge on the influence of biochar addition in tropical soils on the development of plants. A total of 97 publications on the development of various species, particularly maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza), were chosen. The evaluation involved various parameters, which identified positive and negative effects and no significant differences from the control. Some of them also evaluated the contribution of biochar to the development of trees in degraded soils. Tropical soils from 24 different countries, with specific focus on Brazil and Malaysia, were studied. Most biochars were derived from agricultural biomass or wood and produced at temperatures close to 500 °C and with alkaline pH (8.3 average value). Subsequently, 25 articles that combined the most studied plant (Z. mays) with the most adopted test type (field) were selected—in this case, the main endpoints evaluated were grain yield and biomass, which generally showed a positive effect or no significant variation in relation to the control. Although the number of studies on biochars has increased in recent years, scientific knowledge shows several gaps, given the variety of physical and chemical characteristics of biochars and the complexity of natural ecosystems. Future research can potentially yield promising results by exploring a wider range of plant species, soil types, and climatic conditions in long-term trials. Appropriate indicators must be considered for assessments of the reduction in negative effects from the addition of biochar on soil health and quality of ecosystem services. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University 2024.",Field experiments and Soil amendments and Soil fertility and Waste management and Zea mays and Brazil and Malaysia and Alkalinity and Ecosystems and Grain (agricultural product) and Soils and Tropics and Waste management and Biochar and Crop performance and Field experiment and Land degradation and Soil amendment and Soil fertility and Systematic Review and Tropical climates and Tropical soils and Zea mays and biochar and biomass and climate change and crop performance and crop plant and maize and soil amendment and soil fertility and soil-vegetation interaction and terrestrial ecosystem and waste management and Crops,10.1007/s13762-024-05854-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197688213&doi=10.1007%2fs13762-024-05854-8&partnerID=40&md5=985120487f865a29793d860d37b5e1c6,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 1,NA,JOUR,3,1995,2020,NA,FEB,1735-1472 and 1735-2630,WOS:001263496500004,JUL 2024,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1099, 4922"

Lidar measurables are not directly relatable to most physical attributes of interest, including biomass, and therefore must be related through statistical models. Further, GEDI observations are not spatially complete, necessitating methods to convert the incomplete samples to predictions of area averages/totals. Such methods can face challenges in equatorial and persistently cloudy areas, such as Indonesia, where the density of quality observations is diminished. We developed and implemented a hierarchical model to produce gap-free maps of aboveground biomass density (AGBD) at various resolutions within the lowlands of Jambi province, Indonesia. A biomass model was trained between local field plots and a metric from GEDI waveforms simulated with coincident airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. After selecting a locally suitable ground-finding algorithm setting, we trained an error model depicting the discrepancies between the simulated and GEDI-observed waveforms. Finally, a geostatistical model was used to model the spatial distribution of the on-orbit GEDI observations. These three models were nested into a single hierarchical model, relating the spatial distribution of GEDI observations to field-measured AGBD. The model allows spatially complete predictions at arbitrary resolutions while accounting for uncertainties at each stage of the relationship. The model uncertainties were low relative to the predicted biomass, with a median relative standard deviation of 8% at the 1 km resolution and 26% at the 100 m resolution. The spatially consistent information on AGBD provided by our model is beneficial in support of sustainable forest management, carbon sequestration initiatives and the mitigation of climate change. This is particularly relevant in a dynamic tropical landscape like Jambi, Indonesia in order to understand the impacts of land-use transformations from forests to cash crops like oil palm and rubber. More generally, we advocate for the use of hierarchical models as a framework to account for multiple stages of relationships between field and sensor data and to provide reliable uncertainty audits for final predictions. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",Bayesian and Biomass and Geostatistics and Lidar and Small area estimation and Indonesia and Jambi [Indonesia] and Abiotic and Deforestation and Aboveground biomass and Bayesian and Biomass density and Ecosystem dynamics and Geo-statistics and Hierarchical model and Indonesia and Small area estimation and Uncertainty and Waveforms and aboveground biomass and algorithm and Bayesian analysis and estimation method and forest inventory and geostatistics and in situ measurement and lidar and lowland environment and vegetation mapping and waveform analysis and Forest ecology,10.1016/j.rse.2024.114384,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201780783&doi=10.1016%2fj.rse.2024.114384&partnerID=40&md5=20ad7ffce6918b31f1d267f0394b16f9,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 5,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NOV 1,0034-4257 and 1879-0704,WOS:001301283300001,AUG 2024,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1101, 5287"

Local communities encroach on forest land converted into oil palm plantations. Expanding oil palm plantations into forest areas led to biodiversity loss and massive carbon emissions. The annual net carbon emissions of oil palm transformation from the forest in Indonesia is around 12.41-25.83 ton-1ha-1year-1. Oil palm agroforestry is considered to be able to increase carbon sequestration and the biodiversity level. CRC-990/EFForTS has established an oil palm agroforestry experimental plot in Jambi Province, Indonesia, namely B11 plot. This study compares the carbon sequestration and biodiversity level between oil palm monoculture and agroforestry. The data collected in this study was obtained from the CRC-990 experimental plots. We collected data on the CRC-990 oil palm agroforestry plot in 6 plots of 40 m × 40 m and 6 plots of 20 m × 20 m. We chose the location and theme of this research because, until now, no research has been conducted yet to calculate the potential carbon absorption capacity and biodiversity level of oil palm agroforestry patterns in B11 plot. This study uses an allometric equation and IPCC guidelines to estimate biomass and carbon sequestration. SNI 8014 is used to evaluate the biodiversity level. This study found that oil palm agroforestry has more significant carbon sequestration. Increasing intercropping in oil palm agroforestry will increase the amount of carbon sequestration. This study also found that oil palm agroforestry has a higher biodiversity level. The species diversity of oil palm agroforestry is moderate, while oil palm monoculture is low. These potential ecological impacts can be considered an initial step in restoring the Harapan Rainforest.

Herbaceous species, such as native species, can be used for surface protection, soil aggregation, and nutrient cycling. However, it is necessary to know the functional traits above and below ground, and how soil attributes and climatic variables can affect morphological variables. A 3-year field experiment was conducted to evaluate the aboveground and root growth dynamics of native herbaceous species for rapid ground cover, and their relationship to soil chemical variables was evaluated in a subtropical climate. Four perennial and herbaceous plant species native to Brazil, Arachis pintoi, Axonopus affinis, Paspalum notatum, and Sphagneticola trilobata, were propagated in a greenhouse and then planted in randomized plots in 2018, with 36 plants in each plot. Over time, we evaluated vegetation cover (%), aboveground biomass production (AGB) and root morphology dynamics using a minirhizotron system. A. affinis, A. pintoi, P. notatum, and S. trilobata present great potential for quick establishment required in restoration projects for soil erosion control. After 12 months at transplantation, all species had covered more than 94% of the soil surface. However, their aboveground (AGB) and belowground (number of roots, length of roots, surface area of roots, root length density) functional traits decreased under conditions of low rainfall and low P, Ca, Mg, pH in water, and base saturation. The grass species, especially P. notatum, are more resistant to precipitation changes, maintaining great amounts of biomass above ground (816 kg ha−1) and root system with a higher number of thin roots and high RLD (42.2 km m−3) in the surface layers of the soil, even in conditions of water limitation.

This traditional system allows to reconcile the production with the maintenance of the portion of original biodiversity. However, increased deforestation and intensified agroforestry management aimed at boosting productivity may impact the diversity of native species and the services they provide. In this context, our aim was to disentangle the role of landscape forest cover and the local vegetation complexity on predation of caterpillars and herbivory of cacao plants located in agroforestry systems. The study was conducted across 18 cacao agroforest sites in southern Bahia located in landscapes with different amounts of forest cover. We assessed predation rate using dummy caterpillars, sampling understory birds and arthropods and collected leaves of cacao trees to analyze damage by herbivory. We also measured shading levels and the abundance of cacao trees in each agroforestry. Predation pressure on dummy caterpillars was positively influenced by the abundance of total predators and the level of landscape forest cover and negatively by the number of cacao trees. Even so, we found no evidence that landscape, local features or the actual invertebrate assemblages (predators or herbivores) influenced the cacao leaf damage. The findings highlight the multifaceted interactions between ecological factors, predation pressure, and leaf damage within cacao agroforestry systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Agroforestry system and Anthropogenic changes and Atlantic forest and Deforestation and Herbivory and Pest control and Animals and Coverings and Damage and Deforestation and Invertebrates and Pressure and Production and Trees and Atlantic Forest and Bahia and Brazil and Abiotic and Anthropogenic and Invertebrates and Livestock and Macroinvertebrates and Plant diseases and Agroforestry and Agroforestry system and Anthropogenic changes and Atlantic forest and Forest cover and Herbivory and Leaf damage and Native trees and Traditional systems and Vegetation structure and agroforestry and anthropogenic effect and cocoa and community structure and deforestation and forest cover and herbivory and landscape structure and native species and pest control and predation risk and Forest ecology,10.1016/j.foreco.2024.122286,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204205207&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2024.122286&partnerID=40&md5=06deb4b78afd4d2ec824a96718bf704b,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NOV 15,0378-1127 and 1872-7042,WOS:001318425300001,SEP 2024,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1107, 5543"

Despite this, there is an intense process of degradation in these environments. In addition to providing socio-environmental services, mangrove replanting can also alter the dynamics of nutrients in soils. Therefore, this study aims to understand the changes in soil phosphorus (P) fractions after a mangrove restoration. Soil samples from an unvegetated area (NV), a mature mangrove (R) and 7 and 9 year old replanted mangroves at SE-Brazil (APA Guapi-mirim, Rio de Janeiro state) were collected and analyzed to characterize the redox conditions (Eh), pH, and iron (Fe) fractionation, Total Organic Carbon (TOC) contents and P fractionation (exchangeable P; P associated with reducible Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides; associated with Al silicates and hydroxides; associated with humic acids; associated with Ca and Mg; associated with humin). The results indicate an increase in TOC as the age of the mangrove restoration increases (from 8.6 to 17.9%). The pH values were significantly lower, reaching very acidic values, associated with an increase in Eh. Both parameters also showed strong seasonal variation, with a drop in Eh during the wet period (from 165% to −46%) and an increase in pH in the same period (from 6.0 to 6.7). Regarding P fractionation, the main P pool was organic P forms, which showed the highest concentrations in all studied sites. Unvegetated areas showed higher organic P forms (NV: 108.8 μg g−1) than vegetated areas (M7: 55.7 μg g−1, M9: 83.6 μg g−1, R: 87.3 μg g−1). Vegetated sites also showed lower levels of the PEx, PFeMn and Papatite fractions (total forest mean: 2.4 μg g−1, 5.8 μg g−1, 3.0 μg g−1, respectively). Besides no clear trend on P fractionation through seasons and forest age, pseudo-total P increased following the forest recovery (e.g. M7<M9<R), showing the re-establishment of temporary nutrient retention capacity with the replanting of the mangrove. Mangroves replanting affected P dynamics, promoting an accumulation of P in soils, also indicated the reestablishment of ecosystem services, such as nutrient cycling. Seasonal variations influenced the ability of P retention and release for adjacent areas. Our findings indicate that mangrove restoration affected the key parameters (pH, Eh, TOC) which controlled soil processes (redox reactions, organic matter degradation), impacting the cycles of Fe, C, and P cycles. Therefore, crucial soil ecosystem services (e.g., nutrient regulation and C storage) were improved by replanting mangroves. However, seasonal trends on nutrient dynamics still need further studies to better understand soil processes, especially in replanting environments. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Blue carbon ecosystems and Ecosystem services and Hydromorphic soils and Mangrove restoration and Carbon and Ecosystem and Phosphorus and Soil and Wetlands and Brazil and Rio de Janeiro [Brazil] and Aluminum compounds and Biogeochemistry and Climate change and Forestry and Iron compounds and Manganese compounds and Nutrients and Organic carbon and Phosphorus and Plants (botany) and Restoration and Soils and calcium and humic acid and hydroxide and iron and manganese and organic matter and phosphorus and silicate and carbon and phosphorus and Blue carbon ecosystem and Ecosystem services and Hydromorphic soils and Mangrove restoration and Nutrients cycle and P fractionation and Phosphorus dynamics and Seasonal variation and Soil process and Total Organic Carbon and climate change and ecosystem service and fractionation and mangrove and nutrient dynamics and phosphorus and redox conditions and restoration ecology and soil ecosystem and Article and Brazil and carbon sequestration and climate change and controlled study and degradation and dynamics and ecosystem and forest and fractionation and mangrove and nonhuman and nutrient cycling and nutrient dynamics and oxidation reduction reaction and pH and seasonal variation and soil property and soil treatment and total organic carbon and chemistry and ecosystem and soil and wetland and Ecosystems,10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.121915,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199030230&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2024.121915&partnerID=40&md5=c2f76978e65412077137702a8364b473,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 1,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,AUG,0301-4797 and 1095-8630,WOS:001277324500001,JUL 2024,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1108, 3610"

Intercropping with food crops leads to equal or higher productivity than monoculture and results in food production for industry and subsistence. Low rubber price and low labor productivity in smallholdings have led to a dramatic conversion of rubber plantations to more profitable crops. The literature analysis performed in this paper aimed at better understanding the ins and outs that could make rubber-based agroforestry more attractive for farmers. A comprehensive search of references was conducted in March 2023 using several international databases and search engines. A Zotero library was set up consisting of 415 scientific references. Each reference was carefully read and tagged in several categories: cropping system, country, main tree species, intercrop type, intercrop product, level of product use, discipline of the study, research topic, and intercrop species. Of the 232 journal articles, 141 studies were carried out on rubber agroforestry. Since 2011, the number of studies per year has increased. Studies on rubber-based agroforestry systems are performed in most rubber-producing countries, in particular in Indonesia, Thailand, China, and Brazil. These studies focus more or less equally on perennials (forest species and fruit trees), annual intercrops, and mixed plantations. Of the 47 annual crops associated with rubber in the literature, 20 studies dealt with rice, maize, banana, and cassava. Agronomy is the main discipline in the literature followed by socio-economy and then ecology. Only four papers are devoted to plant physiology and breeding. The Discussion Section has attempted to analyze the evolution of rubber agroforestry research, progress in the selection of food crop varieties adapted to agroforestry systems, and to draw some recommendations for rubber-based agroforestry systems associated with food crops. © 2024 by the authors.",annual crop and fruit tree and industrial crop and intercropping and plantation,10.3390/agriculture14071038,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199663991&doi=10.3390%2fagriculture14071038&partnerID=40&md5=7b6e0a0d112dc462583091c7f3deb9b8,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 4,NA,JOUR,7,NA,NA,NA,JUL,2077-0472,WOS:001276760100001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1112, 4921"

However, in recent decades, the intensification of human activities, directly influencing changes in use and coverage, has caused severe environmental problems. Thus, this study proposed a dynamic environmental zoning model for the Pântano River watershed (PRW) based on the CA-Markov model and Multicriteria Analysis. The methodological procedures were based on predictive modeling of land use and land cover, analysis of environmental fragility, and estimation of soil losses and sediment delivery rate from the InVEST model for the years 1984, 2007, 2013, 2020, 2030, and 2050. The results showed that over the time analyzed and projected, in the category of Legal Restrictions Zone, there was a slight decrease in the extension of Permanent Preservation Areas, while the Natural Vegetation cover increased considerably, indicating possible changes in the environmental patterns of the region. The areas classified as Plains maintained minimal variations throughout the period studied. With regard to the Rural Productive Zone, there was a notable increase in areas with Low Restriction, suggesting an expansion of less restrictive agricultural and land use activities. On the other hand, the areas with Medium and High Restrictions showed decreasing trends, signaling possible improvements in environmental management and conservation of natural resources. Also noteworthy is the significant reduction in areas classified as High Restriction, associated with the high rate of soil loss. This trend is particularly relevant as it indicates practical efforts to mitigate adverse environmental impacts and promote sustainable soil management practices. Finally, the areas designated as Special Protection Zones, including Incongruities and Reservoirs, remained stable throughout the period analyzed, demonstrating the importance of preserving these areas to conservation of biodiversity and water resources. In conclusion, the results obtained in this study contribute to guiding public policies and environmental management practices in the PRW region.

Unfortunately, there are too few measurements of carbon fluxes from these ecosystems to estimate the climate change mitigation potential from such conservation efforts. Here, we measured carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes as well as fluvial organic carbon export over the peat swamp forest within an undrained tropical peatland landscape in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Our measurements throughout one year (Oct 2022–Sep 2023) showed that despite its water-logged condition, peat and water overlying the swamp forest on average emits 11.02 ± 0.49 MgCO2 ha−1 yr−1 of CO2 and 0.58 ± 0.04 MgCO2e ha−1 yr−1 of CH4. Further, the fluvial organic carbon export contributes to additional carbon loss of 1.68 ± 0.06 MgCO2e ha−1 yr−1. Our results help improve the accuracy of carbon accounting from undrained tropical peatlands, where we estimated a total carbon loss of 13.28 ± 0.50 MgCO2e ha−1 yr−1. Nevertheless, the total carbon loss reported from our sites is about half than what is reported from the drained peatland landscapes in the region and resulted in a larger onsite carbon sink potential estimate compared to other undrained peat swamp forests. Together, these findings indicate that conserving the remaining undrained peatland ecosystems in Indonesia from drainage and degradation is a promising natural climate solution strategy that avoids significant carbon emissions. © The Author(s) 2024.",carbon and carbon dioxide and methane and organic carbon and peat and water and article and carbon emission and carbon sequestration and carbon sink and climate and climate change mitigation and controlled study and degradation and ecosystem and forest and hypoxia and Indonesia and nonhuman and peatland and swamp,10.1038/s41598-024-62233-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193713568&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-024-62233-6&partnerID=40&md5=5f1042948a78a17a52d132d08b36c0ba,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 3,NA,JOUR,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1118

Here we present a monitoring system that relies on sampling soils in the field, as opposed to a modeling approach. The high spatial variability of SOC was addressed by requiring that the participating farms divide their land according to management zones, based on soil type, slope position and land use history, and the sampling density was established as one sampling point per one hundred hectares, while for environments smaller than 500 ha minimum of five points must be used. These points are georeferenced and will be revisited for annual monitoring of sustainable soil management, and every five years for soil sampling for SOC, texture, bulk density, pH, electric conductivity (if indicated), and available phosphorus determinations. The monitoring of sustainable soil management will be carried out through a visual evaluation of 12 soil quality parameters, as described in the handbook published by the AGSUS group. The data obtained from the visual evaluation and the soil analyses (bulk density, particle size fractions, C content, and pH) in the baseline monitoring of Argentinean and Brazilian farms during 2022 were analyzed for the relation between visual evaluation score and the means of these soil parameters. The organic matter indicator (OMI)was calculated by the formula OMI = OM/clay plus silt*100. The data base contained visual soil evaluation scores at 80 georeferenced sampling points, representing 12 farms located in different agroecological zones of the Argentinean Pampas, and 47 sampling points on two farms in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Our results showed a relationship between the VE (Visual Evaluation) score and SOC contents of the soils, especially when these were expressed in relation to their fine mineral particles as with the OMI for the soils of the Argentinean Pampa and the Brazilian Mato Grosso.

Direct potable reuse (DPR) has been considered a promising strategy to guarantee public supply in regions with severe problems with water scarcity and high-water demand. The success of reuse practices mainly depends on the triad technology, regulation, and public acceptance. This study investigated public acceptance as a technical parameter to assess the implementation feasibility of DPR in large cities of developing countries. Residents of Campinas City (São Paulo, Brazil) were consulted through a multiple-response questionnaire addressing sociodemographic aspects, personal environmental perceptions, and the acceptable uses for wastewater reuse. The results showed a low rejection rate (∼7%) to DPR despite this not being regulated in Brazil. A total of 47% of the volunteers declared that they would accept the DPR of domestic sewage after appropriate treatments and technologies approved by the World Health Organization (WHO), and 46% would accept it after more information. Age was an essential factor for DPR acceptance, being greater among those between 30 and 45 years old. No statistically significant differences in potable reuse acceptability were observed among participants' sex and self-declaration of race. The majority of volunteers (85%) considered water reuse very important, and most participants (51%) already practice non-potable household water reuse daily and do so out of environmental awareness.

One of the main contributors to human disturbances is livestock farming, which degrades native habitats through cattle grazing and trampling. To understand these impacts, we investigated the effects of cattle trampling on the structure and diversity of fruit-feeding butterflies in Restinga forests of southern Brazil. We addressed questions regarding the effects of cattle raising on butterfly diversity and composition, identified indicator species, and examined the influence of environmental variables on butterfly richness, dominance, abundance, and species composition. Our dataset comprises the long-term monitoring of fruit-feeding butterflies in Restinga forests from 2014 to 2019, across sites with low, medium, and high levels of disturbance due to cattle trampling. We found that medium and high levels of disturbance increased butterfly richness and abundance, whereas low-level disturbance was associated with lower abundance. Additionally, the species composition of butterflies in medium to highly disturbed sites differed from that in preserved Restinga forests, indicating that any perturbation can markedly alter alpha and beta diversity parameters. These changes simplify the native forest structure, open the canopy, disrupt the understory, and favor butterfly species commonly associated with disturbed forests. © 2024 by the authors.",Atlantic Forest and cattle raising and conservation and indicator species and Nymphalidae and Pampa and subtropical region and taxonomic diversity and Brazil and butterfly and cattle and conservation and fruit and habitat loss and human activity and livestock farming and subtropical region and taxonomy and trampling,10.3390/d16080467,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85202542357&doi=10.3390%2fd16080467&partnerID=40&md5=5d94dd82166f6f25f3244f4969085fbd,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,JOUR,8,NA,NA,NA,AUG,1424-2818,WOS:001305544900001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1124, 5395"

The diversity index (H') ranged from 0.40 to 2.29, indicating a medium category of diversity. The stand structure did not follow the expected ""J"" curve pattern. The total biomass and carbon stock across all growth levels were found to be 228.35 and 107.22 tons/ha, respectively. In conclusion, the agroforestry system in HKm Wana Lestari demonstrates notable species diversity and carbon storage potential, although its stand structure deviates from the ideal ""J"" curve, suggesting opportunities for further forest management improvements. © 2024, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

The observation began with the planting of 1200 seedlings of R. mucronata and A. marina, respectively. Furthermore, the monitoring of life graduation and diameter growth in the 2021-2023 period was carried out. Existing carbon stocks were analyzed by an allometric equation approach and carbon fraction values. Meanwhile, the prediction of future carbon stocks was modeled using Stella v.9.0.2 software concerning the growth rate of seedling stand diameter. The results of the study showed that carbon stocks reached 0.275 tons C in 2021, 3.66 tons C in 2022, and 5,765 tons C in 2023. Meanwhile, future carbon stock predictions indicate that the largest carbon stock in the 10-year growth projection is found in R. mucronata, with a value of 107.79kg C/tree, which includes 5.80kg AGC and 31.99kg BGC. In contrast, A. marina has the lowest carbon stock at 75.54kg C/tree (52.54kg AGC and 22.99kg BGC). The total contribution of carbon sequestration by 2033 is projected to reach 807.36 tons of CO2e, comprised of 474.69 tons of CO2e from R. mucronata and 332.67 tons of CO2e from A. marina.The carbon sequestration indicates that mangrove planting in the REMAJA PHE ONWJ program contributes to the reduction of CO2 gas concentrations in the atmosphere and climate change mitigation and can realize the principles of sustainable development (SDGs). © 2024, Egyptian Society for the Development of Fisheries and Human Health.

This ongoing environmental issue arises from the persistent exploitation of protected forest areas by local communities, leading to further deforestation and the degradation of remnant forests. Although several organizations have implemented restoration measures, these efforts have primarily focused on reforestation. However, replacing once-diverse forests with only a single type of vegetation or non-native species undermines the fundamental objectives of restoration and exacerbates the vulnerability of these ecosystems, particularly affecting biodiversity and ecosystem functions, making them more susceptible to collapse. This paper reviews the application of paleoecology to conservation and restoration efforts in forests worldwide, with a specific focus on SEA, through a systematic review. Out of 833 documents related to palynology and forest restoration worldwide, 19 studies were selected for review based on their clear topical focus on SEA. Of these, 18 studies concentrate on Holocene sediments, while one examines the Pleistocene to Holocene transition. Most studies were conducted in Indonesia, primarily focusing on wetland restoration, particularly in peat swamps. The use of palynological methods in these conditions proves valuable for restoration strategies. Additionally, the review examined challenges and opportunities associated with the palynological approach to forest restoration in Thailand. The findings indicate that there is currently no up-to-date, in-depth palynological analysis in Thailand that incorporates forest restoration efforts. Nevertheless, the palynological approach offers valuable opportunities for forest restoration in Thailand and similar regions. © 2024",Chronology and Forest degradation and Holocene and Nature-based solutions and Paleoecology and Sustainable and Thailand and chronology and conservation and degradation and Holocene and paleoecology and palynology and restoration ecology and sustainability,10.1016/j.tfp.2024.100714,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207159060&doi=10.1016%2fj.tfp.2024.100714&partnerID=40&md5=794afad8b077a53f0e6d97fdeb5400ec,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,DEC,2666-7193,WOS:001342470900001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1127, 5059"

Peatland ecosystems, known for their high organic content, are particularly vulnerable to environmental management. The study aimed to examine the alterations in land use and land cover that occurred between 1998 and 2022, spanning a 24-year duration. Additionally, it sought to assess the associated variations in carbon stocks within the designated Kepau Jaya specific purpose forest area. The area under investigation encompasses a peatland ecosystem that has experienced substantial changes in land cover and land use. This study investigated the fluctuations in carbon stock caused by these alterations and provides valuable perspectives on the potential of agroforestry systems to promote a wider range of land uses. Additionally, it highlights their role in ecosystem restoration initiatives and the better management of forest peatland regions. METHODS: A spatial analysis was conducted on Landsat 5 and 8 satellite images by using shapefile data stored within the Google Earth Engine platform. Data analysis was carried out using Classification and Regression Tree, a decision tree algorithm used in machine learning for guided classification. Furthermore, purposive sampling was utilized to gather socioeconomic data, followed by the implementation of a benefit-cost analysis. FINDINGS: The results revealed significant changes in the land cover within the Kepau Jaya specific purpose forest area over a 24-year period, with forested areas and open areas decreasing by 23.15 hectares per year and 16.94 hectares per year respectively, and oil palm plantation areas expanding by 40.10 hectares per year. From 1998 to 2022, there has been a consistent annual decline in carbon stocks, resulting in a reduction of 1, 933.11 tons of carbon per year. The changes in land use and cover are closely linked to this decline. In an effort to increase plant species diversity in the area and support the gradual transition away from monoculture, a participatory agroforestry scheme was implemented by intercropping Coffea liberica and Shorea balangeran between oil palm rows in a 2-hectare oil palm plantation block within the agroforestry demonstration plot. According to measurements taken at breast height, the aboveground biomass of these species was measured, leading to projected estimates of carbon stocks in Kepau Jaya specific purpose forest area reaching 19, 455 tonnes of carbon by the year 2030, with Coffea liberica contributing 4, 148 tonnes carbon and Shorea balangeran contributing 15, 307 tonnes carbon. CONCLUSION: The study area experienced a substantial reduction in forest cover, whereas the extent of oil palm areas expanded significantly. The findings underscore the need for proactive measures to strengthen the governance of specific-purpose forest areas through community empowerment and the establishment of demonstration plots to promote agroforestry development. The results of this study provide insights for long-term forest rehabilitation strategies aimed at fostering sustainable forest management that yields environmental and socio-economic benefits in the long run. © 2024 The author(s).

In this study we quantified SOC accruals in a very clayey (662 g kg−1) Rhodic Ferralsol during the evolution of a 11-year-old crop-livestock-forestry system in the municipality of Cachoeira Dourada, Central-West region of Brazil. CLF was implemented in 2009 in a conventional non-managed Pasture area, and soil samples were collected in 2012 and 2020 under two land uses, CLF, and the Pasture as time-zero reference. The soil in CLF was evaluated within the tree lines (CLF-Tree) and in the alley pasture between the tree lines (CLF-Alley) having palisade grass. SOC dynamics was different in the upper 30 cm and in the underlying 70 cm layer. In the 0.0–0.3 m layer, after an initial decline in SOC stocks due to soil preparation for the implementation of CLF, SOC accumulation rates were positive in CLF (0.23–0.56 Mg ha−1 yr−1), but negative in the Pasture (-0.05). At 0.3–1.0 m SOC stocks were higher both in 2012 and 2020 in CLF-Tree (86.70 and 83.74 Mg ha−1) than in the reference Pasture (71.81 and 74.96 Mg ha−1), however, CLF SOC was declining. Total soil N under CLF, compared to the reference Pasture, was lower and declining.

The ecological and, more recently, the agronomic literature have indicated that functional trait aspects of diversity offer a more comprehensive explanation for ecosystem functions compared to species richness alone. In this study, we apply the trait-based approach during experimental agroforest succession in subtropical Southern Brazil to investigate the main factors of crop functional structure, differentiating the effects of functional diversity (FD) from functional identity (CWM - community weighted mean), on Nature's Contributions to People (NCP). The experiment was designed varying crop FD, based on leaf nitrogen concentration, while maintaining crop species richness constant across all treatments. To assess FD and CWM, we measured six crop traits; maximum plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen content, leaf dry-matter content, and stem-specific density. Additionally, we evaluated four material NCP (green manure, forage, germplasm, and food) based on data collected during the initial four years of the experiment (2017–2020). To analyze the data, we employed principal component analysis to reduce the number of variables and subsequently fitted linear mixed-effect models. Our findings provide support for the hypothesis that crop functional structure, particularly in relation to leaf traits (leaf area and leaf nitrogen content) and vegetative height, significantly influences material outputs and predicts above-ground biomass production that can be utilized as green manure and animal feed in agroforestry and silvopastoral systems. Both FD and CWM were important drivers of NCPs, showing that both niche complementarity and selection effects contribute to explain agroecosystem functioning.

Our analyses are based on 2023 forest inventory plots (1 ha) that provide abundance data for a total of 5188 tree species. Within-plot species composition reflected both local environmental conditions (especially soil nutrients and hydrology) and geographical regions. A broader-scale view of species turnover was obtained by interpolating the relative tree species abundances over Amazonia into 47,441 0.1-degree grid cells. Two main dimensions of spatial change in tree species composition were identified. The first was a gradient between western Amazonia at the Andean forelands (with young geology and relatively nutrient-rich soils) and central–eastern Amazonia associated with the Guiana and Brazilian Shields (with more ancient geology and poor soils). The second gradient was between the wet forests of the northwest and the drier forests in southern Amazonia. Isolines linking cells of similar composition crossed major Amazonian rivers, suggesting that tree species distributions are not limited by rivers. Even though some areas of relatively sharp species turnover were identified, mostly the tree species composition changed gradually over large extents, which does not support delimiting clear discrete biogeographic regions within Amazonia. © The Author(s) 2024.",Biodiversity and Brazil and Forests and Geography and Phylogeography and Soil and Trees and biodiversity and Brazil and chemistry and forest and geography and phylogeography and soil and tree,10.1038/s42003-024-06937-5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85205528215&doi=10.1038%2fs42003-024-06937-5&partnerID=40&md5=a35785d72515fdd54f467a627e21bb0a,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 1,NA,JOUR,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1136

Evidence of community-wide responses to fire is largely based on taxonomic and functional descriptors, while the phylogenetic dimension is overlooked. Here we evaluated how the taxonomic and phylogenetic structure of grassland plant communities responded to a time since fire (TSF) gradient. We sampled 12 communities in Southern Brazil under varying TSF and calculated taxonomic species richness (S) and dominance (D), phylogenetic diversity (PD), and mean phylogenetic distances (MPD). We used Structural Equation Models to test the relationships between the environmental gradient and community descriptors. Communities with longer TSF presented higher PD and MPD but lower species richness and increased taxonomic dominance. These sites were dominated by monocots, specifically C4 grasses, but also presented exclusive clades, whereas recently-burned sites presented lower taxonomic dominance and more species distributed in a wider variety of clades. Our results indicate that these scenarios are interchangeable and dependent on fire management. Fire adaptation was not constrained by phylogenetic relatedness, contrasting with previous findings for tropical savannahs and indicating that temperate and tropical non-forest ecosystems from South America respond differently to fire, possibly due to different evolutionary histories. © The Author(s) 2024.",Community assembly and Disturbance and Environmental filters and Human activities and Mean phylogenetic distance and Overdispersion and Pampa and Phylogenetic diversity and Vegetation and Biodiversity and Brazil and Ecosystem and Fires and Grassland and Phylogeny and Plants and Poaceae and biodiversity and Brazil and classification and ecosystem and fire and genetics and grassland and phylogeny and plant and Poaceae,10.1038/s41598-024-68188-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199791970&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-024-68188-y&partnerID=40&md5=3f041c0919de246d2ccf06cf99e302d8,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,JOUR,1,NA,NA,NA,JUL 26,2045-2322,WOS:001279108900011,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1140, 5450"

In recognition of the role of mangroves in providing coastal protection and the delivery of other ecosystem services, the Government of Indonesia has engaged in several policy actions, among others the use of nature based solutions and has set a target to restore or enhance the protection of 600,000 ha of mangroves by 2025. The objective of the analysis presented in this paper is to inform the design and development of a national-scale mangrove conservation and restoration policy for Indonesia through a spatially explicit cost-benefit analysis. The analytical framework involves the integration of maps, data and models to estimate the costs and benefits of mangrove restoration at a high spatial resolution. On the benefit side, we make use of meta-analytic value transfer methods to value changes in fisheries, raw materials, coastal protection, carbon sequestration and avoided emissions, and mangrove tourism. On the cost side, we assess the opportunity and implementation costs using country specific data. Through a spatial overlay of cost and benefit estimates, cost-benefit indicators are calculated per district for investing in additional mangrove restoration and conservation. Using a discount rate of 5.5% and a 30-year project lifetime, the benefit-cost ratios of mangrove conservation and restoration are found to be >1 in most districts indicating positive social returns on investment. We find that mangrove conservation generally has higher benefit-cost ratios than restoration due to both the higher cost of restoration implementation and the additional time that it takes for restored mangroves to deliver ecosystem services. The spatially explicit framework to estimate district-level costs and benefits reveals tradeoffs with agriculture and aquaculture and enables the evaluation of investment scenarios and the spatial prioritisation of investments in mangrove conservation and restoration across Indonesia. Strategic allocation of conservation and restoration investments across districts can potentially significantly increase the economic viability of this nature-based solution.

These distinctive ecosystems are frequently regarded as peripheral areas that are not suitable for agricultural purposes. Peatlands serve as efficient carbon storage systems in a consistent climate, however, they are vulnerable to alterations. This study focuses on analyzing the dynamic of peatland use land cover changes, its driver and impact on green house gas emission, and rehabilitating degraded peatlands in Jambi province, Indonesia, specifically in the Bram Itam and Londerang peat forest reserves. This study was depicted into 3 objectives consisted of 1) Utilize spatial analysis to examine the dynamics of peatland use change and the trajectory of peatland use, as well as to identify the drivers behind these changes; 2) describe the effects of altering peatland utilization; and 3) describe seedling performance planted on the peatland forest of Jambi province, as Tanjung Jabung Barat and Tanjung Jabung Timur. METHODS: Land-use and land-cover change analysis was carried out utilizing various map resources. Cellular Automata-Markov is employed to forecast forthcoming land cover alterations by evaluating the likelihood of land cover transitions throughout a given period. Planting trials using native peatland tree species were conducted at 2 locations with 2 different rehabilitation models following social typology of the sites. FINDINGS: Key findings indicate that peatland conversion to non forest use significantly increases greenhouse gas emissions, while rehabilitation with native tree species shows promising results in carbon sequestration. Peatland use land cover alteration in anthropogenically disturbed peat areas significantly contributes to emissions through peat decomposition and fires. Biophysical analysis reveals variations in peat depth, water table levels, and precipitation between these sites. The two locations exhibit notable disparities in terms of peat soil attributes, such as potential of hydrogen, nutrient composition, and exchangeable cations. This study examines the growth performance of several native tree species that were planted on degraded peatlands. Native peatland tree species like Shorea balangeran, Ilex cymosa, and Fagraea crenulata show promising survival and growth rates. Areca nut (Areca catechu), a non native peatland species, was planted for non-timber forest product purposes. This study delivers significant insights for policymakers looking to strike a balance between economic priorities and environmental conservation. CONCLUSION: Land use change that results in the degradation of peatlands must be avoided because it will be a source of greenhouse gas emissionsThe selection of suitable indigenous tree species holds significant importance in the restoration of peatlands, taking into account ecological, social, and economic considerations. The findings support potential for wet agroforestry and paludiculture to restore peatlands, mitigate carbón dioxide emissions, and enhance livelihoods while emphasizing the need for inclusive governance and technical capacity. © 2024 The author(s).

This study analyses the Eco-DRR praxis at mangrove ecosystems at North Jakarta. The research employs semi-structured in-depth interviews with informants to reveal the mangrove management in the urbanized area of North Jakarta. The data collected are verified through triangulation of data sources. The sustainability of mangrove is assessed using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) Rapfish Analysis. Additionally, comparative analysis is conducted by contrasting the two revealing findings of mangrove sustainability in protected and unprotected areas. The findings reveal that protected mangrove areas exhibit higher sustainability compared to unprotected ones distinguished by its Eco-DRR praxis. This research suggests that Eco-DRR praxis such as mangrove conservation, effectively minimize tidal flood risk, generate ecosystem services, and perform as an indicator to sustain the environment. The government policies govern the management of protected areas, emphasizing their role in providing ecosystem services and mitigating tidal floods. In contrast, unprotected areas face challenges due to less effective management, leading to suboptimal ecosystem services and reduced disaster risk reduction capacity. The key takeaway is the significance of community-based organizations, in enhancing and sustaining mangrove ecosystems, with strong participation and involvement among various stakeholders, ensures the services of mangrove ecosystems in both protected and unprotected areas, contributing to Eco-DRR and long-term environmental resilience.

This mini-review examines the adsorption of REEs onto pyrolytic carbon-based materials as a sustainable recovery method from secondary raw materials. The review covers different types of carbon-based adsorbents used in several research works, such as activated carbon, chars, and biochar, and discusses their adsorption mechanisms and influencing factors. Comparative analyses of adsorption capacities highlight the significance of surface area and functionalization in enhancing adsorption efficiency. Despite promising results, the variability in adsorption performance due to experimental conditions and the scarcity of real-world application studies are noticed.

Fungi, as one of the most important soil microbial communities, play a crucial role in enhancing nutrient and water uptake by plants through mycorrhizal associations. However, the impact of overgrazing-induced desertification on fungal community structure, particularly in the Caatinga biome of semiarid regions, remains unclear. In this study, we assessed the changes in both the total fungal community and the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community (AMF) across 1. Natural vegetation (native), 2.

Our assessment, conducted during both the dry and rainy seasons in Irauçuba, Ceará, utilized Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) gene sequencing via Illumina® platform. Our findings highlighted the significant roles of the AMF families Glomeraceae (∼71% of the total sequences) and Acaulosporaceae (∼14% of the total sequences) as potential key taxa in mitigating climate change within dryland areas. Moreover, we identified the orders Pleosporales (∼35% of the total sequences) and Capnodiales (∼21% of the total sequences) as the most abundant soil fungal communities in the Caatinga biome.

The importance of planted forests in beef cattle pasture-based integrated systems has been widely recognized in the context of GHG emission mitigation. Adopting the intensification and integration with forest and crops of pasture-based livestock production systems are alternatives to optimizing the soil and tree carbon (C) sequestration; however, research on tropical conditions is still necessary. This long-term trial evaluated the potential of C sequestration (soil + trees) of the forest and the grazing systems with two replicate areas of 3 ha each: 1. continuous stocking rate (CLS) – pasture under continuous stocking; 2. agropastoral or crop-livestock system (AGROP) – pasture under rotational stocking in rotation with corn; 3. agrosilvipastoral or crop-livestock-forestry system (AGROSIL) - similar to AGROP but including eucalyptus; 4. silvipastoral or livestock-forestry system (SIL) - pasture under rotational stocking + eucalyptus and 5. Atlantic Forest (FOR). Soil samples were analysed for texture, C and bulk density in eight soil layers from three to eight trenches for each treatment, then C stock and C accumulation rates were calculated. Data from Eucalyptus urograndis of the SIL and AGROSIL systems with 333 trees. ha−1 during five first years and 166 trees. ha−1 in subsequent years were collected (five- and eight-years old trees) and used to define the wood volume and acquire wood rings. Elemental analyzer CHN performed soil and trees C content. Equations for determining stem volume and tree biomass and, afterward, the C pools of the tree trunks were proposed. The potential of GHG emission mitigation (t CO2 e.. ha−1. year−1) by annual C sequestration (soil or soil + trees) was calculated, including the wood used for the lumber-mill scenario. The participation of the C stock from the 0–30 cm soil layer was between 45 % and 53 % of the total C stock in the 0–100 cm soil layer. Regardless of the elevated C soil accumulation rates, 0.88, 2.54, and 1.74 t C. ha-1. year−1 in the conversion stages CLS → AGROP; AGROP → SIL; AGROP → AGROSIL, respectively, it was not possible to compensate for the negative result of the Forest → CLS conversion (-2.55 t C. ha-1. year−1) because this stage lasted 12 years, while the implementation of AGROSIL and SIL systems had only six years. However, when C tree accumulation rates were considered, the potential of GHG emission mitigation (t CO2 e. ha−1. year−1) by annual C sequestration (soil +trees) was 19.89 to AGROSIL and 18.97 to SIL, including the wood used for the lumber-mill scenario. Based on these results, it can be concluded that C sequestration in trees-pasture integrated systems occurs in layers deeper, with the diverse species contributing in different soil layers; there is a positive effect of improved land-use management, with the use of integrated systems on annual C soil sequestration and the trees consists of an important strategy to improve the GHG mitigation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Beef cattle and Carbon sequestration and Eucalyptus urograndis and Tree biomass and Urochloa brizantha and Atlantic Forest and Brazil and biomass and biome and bulk density and cattle and dicotyledon and greenhouse gas and livestock farming and pasture and soil carbon,10.1016/j.eja.2024.127219,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194463916&doi=10.1016%2fj.eja.2024.127219&partnerID=40&md5=4220d3c84a5ec7baa838054b5df24e5a,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 2,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,AUG,1161-0301 and 1873-7331,WOS:001248387800001,MAY 2024,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1167, 5469"

We evaluated how plant and hummingbird species vary across the urban landscape of a tropical city in Brazil, identifying traits of species taking part in shared interactions between areas. We recorded plant-hummingbird interactions in five green spaces and two remnants of native vegetation, and: (1) contrasted species traits and species-level indices of both plants and hummingbirds; (2) evaluated how species and interactions vary among pairs of areas; (3) used a meta-network approach to identify which pairs of interacting species are more important in connecting areas. Species turnover was the component that better explained the beta-diversity of interactions among sites. In green spaces, plant species presented greater centrality and longer corollas than in remnants. However, both plants and hummingbirds were similarly specialized regardless of the type of area. Trees with large floral displays and with longer corollas shared more interactions and were present in more networks. Most interactions recorded in remnants are unique to them, due to the exclusiveness of some hummingbirds and plant species in such native habitat and are, thus, more sensitive to habitat conversion. Our findings support the importance of preserving remnants and using mass flowering native species in urban afforestation to maintain plant-hummingbird interactions and promote urban biodiversity.

Reinforcing local social and institutional capital to enhance mangrove ecosystems is crucial for understanding the intricate social systems necessary to conserve, manage, and restore mangrove ecosystem services. The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between social capital and social institutions with the sustainability of mangrove rehabilitation in the Teluk Pandan and Padang Cermin districts of Lampung, Indonesia, in 2023. METHODS: This study analyzes the role of local social and institutional capital in the welfare of communities residing around mangrove forests in the Way Ratai district of Pesawaran Regency. This study employs a survey research approach, drawing samples from the population, and utilizes both quantitative and qualitative data analysis. A sample of 300 respondents was selected based on the guidelines for Structural Equation Model analysis. The study was carried out in two sub-districts of Pesawaran Regency. The districts were deliberately chosen due to the fact that they are designated mangrove forest rehabilitation areas. Data collection took place from July to December 2023. Data analysis involved tabulation techniques and Structural Equation Model analysis using Linear Structural Relations. FINDINGS: The findings suggest that social institutions, such as customary practices, sanctions, and conflict, have a negative impact on mangrove rehabilitation and welfare. Increasing the social capital of communities surrounding mangrove forests has a significant influence on mangrove rehabilitation and welfare, including the fulfillment of basic needs like shelter, food, access to healthcare, and education. Community leaders oversee activities, encourage community involvement in mangrove rehabilitation, and ensure the smooth running of government programs. CONCLUSION: Social capital can be enhanced through group meetings, social gatherings, initiatives to raise awareness about tourism, and mangrove conservation groups. The goal of empowerment is to create self-sufficient and socially empowered communities capable of meeting their physical, economic, and social needs. This fosters self-confidence and allows them to voice their aspirations, secure their livelihoods, engage in social endeavors, and face life independently.

In those biomes, the forest fires initiated to clear land for pasture are the most worrying because promote ecological and socioeconomic consequences, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and impacts the regional flora and biogeochemical cycles. As a strategy to understand and identify areas at risk of forest fires, this study aimed to develop a risk zoning framework for fire hotspots in the biomes of Brazilians. This framework combines multiple variables, incorporating factors like physical terrain, land use, and climatic data, to assess the potential fire risk. The areas with greater fire risk are located in the Caatinga, Cerrado, and Pantanal biomes, in which the physical and climate variables influence directly in incidence and propagation of fire. In the Amazon biome there is a fire risk, some possibly intentional, but can be regulated by elevated precipitation in the region. The identification of areas at high fire risk allows the implementation of proactive strategies for fire prevention for safeguarding Brazil’s biomes and ecosystems, which are integral to the environment and biodiversity. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Environmental sustainability and Fire monitoring and Fire prevention and Forest deforestation and Integrated fire management and Brazil and biome and deforestation and fire management and monitoring and risk assessment and sustainability,10.1007/s00704-024-05163-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85202735966&doi=10.1007%2fs00704-024-05163-7&partnerID=40&md5=8d63b3c703a6d9315709e1683d426eec,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 1,NA,JOUR,9,8815,8824,NA,SEP,0177-798X and 1434-4483,WOS:001302275500001,AUG 2024,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1175, 5369"

Additionally, evidence indicates that interactions between different plant layers promote soil fauna diversity through the variety of resources available. The objective was to assess the edaphic fauna in traditional land use systems, agroforestry systems and natural vegetation, under the influence of rainfall seasonality and plant strata in the semiarid region of Brazil. For this purpose, six types of land use were selected: agroforestry; silvopastoral; slash and burn with intensive use without fallow; slash and burn with six years of fallow; slash and burn with nine years of fallow; and a system representing the natural vegetation of the Caatinga. Edaphic fauna was collected using pitfall traps in the dry and rainy seasons. A total of 43,363 individuals of the edaphic fauna were collected and grouped into taxa, determining abundance, diversity and functional groups. The results revealed higher abundance and diversity of edaphic fauna in the rainy season across all land use systems, but significantly higher numbers in systems with tree strata. The greater the abundance, richness and diversity of trees, the higher the diversity of edaphic fauna (Shannon Index - H: 0.7 < ‾H < 1) for the seasonal effect. Agroforestry systems were intermediate in the diversity of edaphic fauna (‾H < 0.8) compared to other systems. Systems with greater heterogeneity in tree and herbaceous strata were the ones that most increased the diversity and activity of functional groups of edaphic fauna (H < 0.8; 0.5 < r < 0.9).

The water column was characterized into oxic, transitional, and hypoxic layers based on dissolved oxygen concentration. The highest densities and biomasses of prokaryotes were found at the euphotic zone’s depth limit, where bacterial production was low, suggesting inactive or slow-growing bacteria. Cell size differences and filamentous bacteria presence near the surface were observed, likely due to varying predation pressures. Prokaryote community composition differed across depths. At the subsurface level, with high dissolved organic carbon, alphaproteobacteria, betaproteobacteria, and Cytophaga–Flavobacter had similar densities, but the lowest bacterial biomass was recorded. The highest dissolved oxygen concentration depth had the lowest bacterial density, dominated by alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria.

Collectively, they comprise a large but highly uncertain reservoir of the global carbon cycle, with wide-ranging estimates of their global area (441 025-1700 000 km2) and below-ground carbon storage (105-288 Pg C). Substantial gaps remain in our understanding of peatland distribution in some key regions, including most of tropical South America. Here we compile 2413 ground reference points in and around Amazonian peatlands and use them alongside a stack of remote sensing products in a random forest model to generate the first field-data-driven model of peatland distribution across the Amazon basin. Our model predicts a total Amazonian peatland extent of 251 015 km2 (95th percentile confidence interval: 128 671-373 359), greater than that of the Congo basin, but around 30% smaller than a recent model-derived estimate of peatland area across Amazonia. The model performs relatively well against point observations but spatial gaps in the ground reference dataset mean that model uncertainty remains high, particularly in parts of Brazil and Bolivia. For example, we predict significant peatland areas in northern Peru with relatively high confidence, while peatland areas in the Rio Negro basin and adjacent south-western Orinoco basin which have previously been predicted to hold Campinarana or white sand forests, are predicted with greater uncertainty. Similarly, we predict large areas of peatlands in Bolivia, surprisingly given the strong climatic seasonality found over most of the country. Very little field data exists with which to quantitatively assess the accuracy of our map in these regions. Data gaps such as these should be a high priority for new field sampling.

Restoration efforts to mitigate these impacts usually involve peatland rewetting by blocking canals. However, there have been no studies to date of the optimal rewetting approach that will reduce carbon emission whilst also promoting PSF regeneration. Here we present results of a large-scale restoration trial in Sumatra (Indonesia), monitored for 7.5 years. Water levels in a former plantation were raised over an area of 4800 ha by constructing 257 compacted peat dams in canals. We find peat surface subsidence rates in the rewetted restoration area and adjoining PSF to be halved where water tables were raised from ~ − 0.6 m to ~ − 0.3 m, demonstrating the success of rewetting in reducing carbon emission. A total of 57 native PSF tree species were found to spontaneously grow in the most rewetted conditions and in high densities, indicating that forest regrowth is underway. Based on our findings we propose that an effective PSF restoration strategy should follow stepwise rewetting to achieve substantial carbon emission reduction alongside unassisted regrowth of PSF, thereby enabling the peat, forest and canal vegetation to establish a new nature-based ecosystem balance. © The Author(s) 2024.","Biodiversity and Conservation of Natural Resources and Forests and Indonesia and Soil and Trees and Tropical Climate and Wetlands and biodiversity and environmental protection and forest and growth, development and aging and Indonesia and procedures and soil and tree and tropic climate and wetland",10.1038/s41598-024-60462-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192895779&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-024-60462-3&partnerID=40&md5=937e320592d6631856d5286ad3561047,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 5,NA,JOUR,1,NA,NA,NA,MAY 10,2045-2322,WOS:001218726300066,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1184, 5198"

Maximizing productivity and carbon sequestration through such systems demands understanding below-ground interactions and further research into plant root dynamics, which have often been neglected or overlooked. This study examined the effects of integrated farming systems, specifically crop-livestock and crop-livestock-forestry, on fine-root dynamics of crops and pastures (i.e., herbaceous plants). Using an extensive grazing pasture as a control, and intensification through crop-livestock and crop-livestock-forestry, we aimed to evaluate if integrated systems (i) enhance herbaceous root growth and necromass addition, and (ii) accelerate root turnover. We also investigated whether multiple linear regression modeling could predict root production and decomposition using the edaphoclimatic variables monitored in the areas. Herbaceous fine-root dynamics were observed over two years using the minirhizotron technique. Installation involved five 70 cm-deep acrylic tubes in extensive grazing and crop-livestock and fifteen in crop-livestock-forestry (1.9, 4.3, and 7.5m tree inter-row distances). In integrated systems, annual corn cropping was succeeded by grazing on a palisadegrass pasture. The trial measured eight additional soil and climatic parameters for a regression model using a stepwise selection procedure, including average soil temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, available soil water, soil bulk density, soil pH, available soil phosphorus, the sum of soil bases, and cation exchange capacity. Extensive grazing accumulated 124.8 m m−2 of roots, constituting 48% of crop-livestock (259.7 m m−2) and 66% of crop-livestock-forestry (189.5 m m−2). Root growth near Eucalyptus trees was reduced by 51% compared to crop-livestock. Root turnover followed the order of extensive grazing < crop-livestock < crop-livestock-forestry. The peak daily root productivity was from 31 to 80 days of the crop cycle when corn was intercropped with palisade grass in the integrated systems. Multiple regression models were superior for predicting root decomposition, reaching adjusted R2 values of 0.81 and 0.71 for crop and pasture cycles, but were ineffective for root growth (R2 < 0.25). Therefore, additional parameters are needed to fit the root growth accurately. We conclude that integrated farming enhances fine-root production and root necromass accrual, accelerating root cycling compared to extensive pasture. However, as introducing Eucalyptus in crop-livestock impairs herbaceous root development near trees, we recommend adjusting tree density and inter-row spaces to alleviate these adverse effects, especially for annual crop cultivations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Crop-livestock and Minirhizotron and Multiple regression and Root dynamics and Time assessment and Turnover,10.1016/j.rhisph.2024.100930,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197407528&doi=10.1016%2fj.rhisph.2024.100930&partnerID=40&md5=d5a6316e558daafdb1230c65906c2742,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 3,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,SEP,2452-2198,WOS:001284864900001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1190, 5296"

A key parameter to consider when assessing the sustainability of production systems is soil fertility, and of particular interest are macronutrients, pH, electrical conductivity, and microbial communities. To understand which environmental factors influence soil fertility, we studied the abovementioned key parameters in two agroforestry systems (rustic and polyculture) in Bali, Indonesia. Via Generalized Linear Models, we found that agroforestry system, canopy cover, crop richness, tree richness, and yields had differing effects on topsoil (0–5 cm) and subsoil (10–15 cm) properties, including C:N ratios, conductivity, K, organic C, P, and total microbes. We found a higher C:N ratio in topsoil (p = 0.027), higher organic carbon content in topsoil (p = 0.009) and subsoil (p < 0.001), higher total microbes in subsoil (p = 0.001), and lower phosphorus levels in topsoil (p < 0.001) in rustic than in polyculture systems. Rustic systems may foster conditions conducive to soil fertility, and in our study, canopy cover (p < 0.001) and tree richness (p < 0.001) emerge as a key positive drivers of the total number of microbes in topsoil. The positive associations observed between crop and tree richness with electrical conductivity and total microbe counts underscore the importance of biodiversity in enhancing soil fertility, emphasizing the need for diversified agricultural systems to promote soil fertility. With soil fertility declining across the world due to global investments in agricultural intensification, it is vital that food production systems divert to the use of systems such as agroforestry in order to ensure soil sustainability and food security for future generations. © 2024 by the authors.",agricultural intensification and agroforestry and ecosystem services and Indonesia and polyculture systems and rustic systems and sustainability and Bali and Indonesia and Lesser Sunda Islands and Sunda Isles and agricultural land and agroforestry and crop production and ecosystem service and environmental factor and environmental issue and intensive agriculture and microbial community and soil fertility and subsoil and sustainability and topsoil,10.3390/su16187874,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85205217408&doi=10.3390%2fsu16187874&partnerID=40&md5=9bd77dfbd564b2b90c35ae286182e72b,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 2,NA,JOUR,18,NA,NA,NA,SEP,2071-1050,WOS:001326550900001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1195, 4944"

Most of the studies were reported in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, respectively, which were associated with the highest number of vibrant mangrove ecotourism sites and largest mangrove areas compared to the other countries of Southeast Asia. Mangrove-related ecotourism activities in the above countries mainly include boat tours, bird and wildlife watching, mangrove planting, kayaking, eating seafood, and snorkeling. The economic benefits, such as an increase in income associated with mangrove ecotourism, have stimulated infrastructural development in ecotourism destinations. Local communities benefited from increased access to social amenities such as clean water, electricity, transportation networks, schools, and health services that are intended to make destinations more attractive to tourists. Economic benefits from mangrove ecotourism motivated the implementation of several community-based mangrove conservation and restoration initiatives, which attracted international financial incentives and public-private partnerships. Since mangroves are mostly located on the land occupied by indigenous people and local communities, ensuring respect for their land rights and equity in economic benefit sharing may increase their intrinsic motivation and participation in mangrove restoration and conservation initiatives. Remote sensing tools for mangrove monitoring, evaluation, and reporting, and integrated education and awareness campaigns can ensure the long-term conservation of mangroves while sustaining ecotourism's economic infrastructure and social amenities benefits. © 2024","Conservation and restoration initiatives and Ecotourism activities and Ecotourism impacts on mangroves and Mangrove ecosystem services and Mangrove ecotourism sites and Mangrove mapping and Asia, Southeastern and Biodiversity and Climate Change and Conservation of Natural Resources and Wetlands and Indonesia and Malaysia and Philippines and Thailand and Viet Nam and Biodiversity and Climate change and Conservation and Deforestation and Economic and social effects and Ecosystems and Remote sensing and Urban growth and water and Conservation and restoration initiative and Eco-tourisms and Ecosystem services and Ecotourism activity and Ecotourism impact on mangrove and Mangrove ecosystem service and Mangrove ecosystems and Mangrove ecotourism site and Mangrove mappings and climate change and conservation planning and deforestation and ecotourism and health services and incentive and infrastructural development and land rights and mangrove and mapping and restoration ecology and trend analysis and bird and eating and economic incentive and ecosystem service and electricity and environmental protection and fishing and geographic distribution and health service and human and indigenous people and Indonesia and intrinsic motivation and leisure and Malaysia and mangrove and nonhuman and Philippines and public-private partnership and recreation and remote sensing and Review and rowing and school and sea food and Southeast Asia and Thailand and tourism and traffic and transport and Viet Nam and wildlife and biodiversity and climate change and wetland and Restoration",10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.121529,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197294513&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2024.121529&partnerID=40&md5=1eeaa88d64a93aea7c8dd1c989ee07aa,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 15,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,AUG,0301-4797 and 1095-8630,WOS:001268706200001,JUL 2024,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1196, 3644"

Given that the capacity for peatland ecosystems to store carbon depends largely on hydrology, there is a growing interest in rewetting degraded peatlands to shift them back to a carbon sink. Recent estimates suggest that peatland rewetting may contribute up to 13 % of Indonesia's total mitigation potential from natural climate solutions. In this study, we measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes, soil temperature, and water table level (WTL) for drained oil palm plantations, rewetted oil palm plantations, and secondary forests located in the Mempawah and Kubu Raya Regencies of West Kalimantan, Indonesia. We found that peatland rewetting significantly reduced peat CO2 emissions, though CH4 uptake was not significantly different in rewetted peatland compared to drained peatland. Rewetting drained peatlands on oil palm plantations reduced heterotrophic respiration by 34 % and total respiration by 20 %. Our results suggest that rewetting drained oil palm plantations will not achieve low CO2 emissions as observed in secondary forests due to differences in vegetation or land management. However, extrapolating our results to the areas of degraded oil palm plantations in West Kalimantan suggests that successful peatland rewetting could still reduce emissions by 3.9 MtCO2 yr−1. This result confirms that rewetting oil palm plantations in tropical peatlands is an effective natural climate solution for achieving national emission reduction targets. © 2024 The Authors",Climate change mitigation and Greenhouse gas emission and Natural climate solutions and Peatland and Peatland restoration and Rewetting and Indonesia and West Kalimantan and Carbon capture and utilization and Carbon sequestration and Greenhouse gas emissions and fluticasone propionate and palm oil and carbon and carbon dioxide and CH 4 and Climate change mitigation and Greenhouse gas emissions and Indonesia and Natural climate solution and Oil palm plantations and Peat land and Peatland restoration and Re-wetting and carbon emission and climate change and emission control and greenhouse gas and methane and mitigation and peatland and plantation and rewetting and soil temperature and water table and agricultural procedures and air temperature and Article and atmospheric pressure and autocorrelation and bulk density and carbon cycling and climate change mitigation and decomposition and ecosystem and electric conductivity and environmental factor and global warming potential and greenhouse gas emission and linear regression analysis and nonhuman and oxidation reduction potential and peatland and plantation and rewetting and seasonal variation and soil moisture and soil pollution and soil respiration and tropics and article and carbon dioxide emission and carbon sequestration and carbon sink and climate and controlled study and degradation and Elaeis and forest and greenhouse gas emission and Indonesia and land use and peat and pharmaceutics and soil temperature and vegetation and water table and Low emission,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.175829,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203022941&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2024.175829&partnerID=40&md5=36ab4ecb397e53cf8b2a128da0ce23cd,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 3,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NOV 20,0048-9697 and 1879-1026,WOS:001309166800001,SEP 2024,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1200, 5169"

One of the communities affected are benthic invertebrates, that perform important functions such as nutrient cycling and energy transfer in reservoirs. We investigated the influence of the following factors: spatial, abiotic variables, reservoir characteristics and land use on the richness, biomass and composition of benthic invertebrates in 29 reservoirs in southern Brazil. Sediment samples and abiotic variables were collected in the littoral and profundal zones of reservoirs during the dry (July) and rainy (November) seasons in 2001. We used principal coordinates of neighbour matrices to obtain the spatial factors. We analysed the unique and overall effects of the four factors. We found that the factors analysed significantly influenced the composition and biomass of the invertebrates (22%). The percentage of variation explained by the unique effects of the different factors showed similar values, but the spatial factors showed the highest value (4%). This indicates that closer reservoirs have higher similarities in terms of composition and biomass of benthic invertebrates. On the other hand, the abiotic variables had the highest explained value when evaluating the overall effects (10%). Therefore, for invertebrate richness, only the reservoir characteristics were significant for the overall and unique effects (49%). More specifically, we observed lower taxon richness in older reservoirs, probably because the age of such artificial aquatic ecosystems influences other variables, which structure the benthic communities. In conclusion, the structure of benthic invertebrate communities in reservoirs of southern Brazil are mainly driven by spatial and reservoir characteristics. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Biodiversity and Hydrographic basin and Macroinvertebrates and Reservoir age and Spatial analysis and Brazil and benthos and biodiversity and biomass and hydrography and macroinvertebrate and Neotropical Region and reservoir and spatial analysis and species richness,10.1007/s00027-024-01064-z,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190643523&doi=10.1007%2fs00027-024-01064-z&partnerID=40&md5=7051b4ab0cb7549f1888e1d56a24f297,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 1,NA,JOUR,2,NA,NA,NA,APR,1015-1621 and 1420-9055,WOS:001204808100001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1202, 3554"

This study aims to map mangrove cover, estimate biomass and carbon stock in TWAM mangrove. TWAM mangroves were mapped using consumer-grade drones and freely available satellite imagery. In addition, a high-accuracy positioning is carried out to improve and assess the accuracy of the mangrove cover map. An allometric equation is used to estimate the aboveground biomass which can then be converted into carbon stock. The study results showed that the height of the mangrove canopy in TWAM was 8.77 ± 4.05 m, while mangrove cover showed an increase over the last 10 years with an average rate of about 2.9 ha/year. The mangrove ecosystem at the study site has been estimated to have aboveground biomass and carbon stock of 129.70 tons/ha and 64.85 tons/ha, respectively. The study results show that mangrove cover and its potential carbon stock are increasing, indicating the importance of designated conservation areas in mangrove rehabilitation efforts. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",NA,10.1088/1755-1315/1410/1/012041,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85212423545&doi=10.1088%2f1755-1315%2f1410%2f1%2f012041&partnerID=40&md5=c50f52621925437a1a4401fabfe6a8c2,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,CONF,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1203

Home gardens are traditional agroforestry systems that improve plant diversity and ecosystem services while also having a direct and beneficial effect on human well-being. Each plant species in a home garden provides a variety of ecosystem services, which are linked to specific ecological functions and social drives. Although home gardens are biodiversity hotspots and have recently been identified as essential to tropical biodiversit y conservation, the benefits of ecosystem services offered by home gardens are frequently undervalued. This study aims to analyze the diversity, usage, and traditional knowledge of home garden plants among the local communities living near Kerinci Seblat Nati onal Park, Indonesia. This study was carried out in four villages from two districts of Bengkulu Province, Indonesia, i.e. Lebong and Rejang Lebong. Field surveys, plant collections, and interviews with local communities were used in this study. Interviews were conducted with 120 informants (30 in each village) selected at random. A total of 218 plant species belonging to 67 families associated with 12 use categories were recorded in the study area. Capsicum frutescens, Musa x paradisiaca, and Mangifera indica are frequently discovered in home gardens. The most diverse categories of plant use in home gardens encompass food, medicine, and ornament, utilizing various parts such as rhizomes, leaves, flowers, and fruits. Home gardens, with their diverse plant species, are considered to have a significant role in household livelihoods, protecting plant genetic resources, and biodiversity conservation. © 2024, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

Livestock products are part of the needs of the world’s growing population, and the adopted production system to meet this demand, should be sustainable. Therefore, we considered Sachs’ thinking extremely appropriate as biomass is the primary source of nutrients for cattle production in the world. However, biomass is much more than forage. Why? Because biomass is feed and food, organic fertilizer, carbon sink, energy, fuel, promoter of biodiversity and animal welfare, part of the landscape scenario, an important component to regulate the water cycle, and the main component of agroforestry systems and agroecology science. In addition, as the negative effects of global warming are putting at risk the world’s food security, the reduction of biomass could potentiate this risk in pasture monocultures and the increase of biomass could also be part of the solution to enrich the agropastoral ecosystem (e.g. grasses, bushes and trees in the silvopastoral system – SPS). Thinking in a broader perspective, biomass could also be considered an important part of the linkages of the global livestock sector to the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the UN Agenda 2030: no poverty, zero hunger, good health and well-being, gender equality, decent work and economic growth, responsible consumption and production, climate action, life on land and partnerships for the goals. These SDGs also constitute an important framework for the Global Agenda for Sustainable Livestock, which has several actions to analyze and promote sustainable cattle production. SPS is defined as an agroforestry arrangement that aims to combine fodder plants (grass and leguminous forages) with shrubs and trees for animal nutrition and other uses (Murgueitio et al., Native trees and shrubs for the productive rehabilitation of tropical cattle ranching lands. For Ecol Manag 261:1654–1663, 2011). The present chapter will establish a link between the necessity of the world to generate the “biomass revolution”, and the potential of silvopastoral systems studies developed in Brazil and South America, as a possible mechanism to increase biomass, cattle/livestock production and environmental services in a sustainable way. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",Circular food systems and Food security and Nutrient cycling,10.1007/978-3-031-43063-3_4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207572691&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-43063-3_4&partnerID=40&md5=05795ab4c01705297149600d5a30b7e9,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,CHAP,NA,73,83,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1207

Agroforestry practices involve a wide range of context-specific management options, which can be complex and pose challenges due to tradeoffs. OBJECTIVE: To assess the benefits and drawbacks, across a range of contexts, of various cacao-based land use systems on multifunctionality and economic performance. METHODS: We used the process-based Water, Nutrient and Light Capture in agroforestry systems (WaNuLCAS) model to assess the performance of five cacao-based land use systems (cacao monoculture, cacao + annual crops, cacao + fruit tree, cacao + fast-growing tree, and cacao + slow-growing tree), in three climate regimes (tropical rainforest, monsoon, and savannah), two soil textures, and two sources of data for cacao root length density (W Africa and Indonesia, respectively). Several metrics quantified the performance of each land use system, including the Land Equivalent Ratio for production (LERP),multifunctionality (LERM), Net Present Value (NPV), Return to Labour (RtL), and Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Simulated cacao production per tree, positively or negatively influenced by intercrops, responded to the number of days cacao grew under water-limited conditions. High cacao root density supported higher LERP values (an average of 1.15 versus 0.95 in other cases). In the savanna, the LERP difference between cacao with high root density and those with low root density became 0.27. Among agroforestry systems, cacao + annual crops had the highest LERP of 1.13, followed by cacao + slow-growing trees (1.09), while the lowest outcome (0.98) was for cacao + fruit trees. These values were higher in rainforest climates, and lowest for savanna. Soil texture had no effect on the average LERP across other main factors. Tree-based agroforestry had a higher time-averaged carbon stock than monocultures or systems with annual crops. However, their effects on other environmental performance aspects, averaged over a 20-year life cycle, were modest, and variation in LERM was small. Economic performance indicators diverged, with the highest NPV were for cacao + annual crops or cacao + fruit trees, the highest BCR was for cacao + fruit trees, and the highest RtL was for cacao + fruit trees followed by cacao + slow-growing trees. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study highlights that the potential benefits of cacao-based agroforestry practices depend on strong root development by the cacao trees. In selecting for high yields in monocultures, the benefits of intercropping may be forfeited, especially in drier climates with the lower values for root length density measured in W Africa. © 2024",Agroforestry and Environmental services and Land equivalent ratio and Net present value and Root density and Theobroma cacao and Africa and Indonesia and agricultural management and agroforestry and cost-benefit analysis and ecosystem service and evergreen forest and intercropping and land use location and root system and soil texture,10.1016/j.agsy.2024.103895,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186575352&doi=10.1016%2fj.agsy.2024.103895&partnerID=40&md5=4d10a28816a64cd628a6ae98eab48412,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 1,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,APR,0308-521X and 1873-2267,WOS:001210535600001,FEB 2024,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1215, 5000"

However, the conservation of these areas depends on the management of their surroundings to promote landscape connectivity. In agricultural landscapes, the preservation of native vegetation in rural properties is one of the main strategies to promote the connectivity of the protected area. Forest certifications that require compliance with environmental laws can work as an important instrument to maintain native vegetation in forest plantation areas. In Brazil, most commercial plantations consist of exotic species, predominantly eucalyptus, pine, and teak. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the land-use/land-cover (LULC) and the landscape connectivity changes in the surrounding area of a protected area between 1986 and 2019 and understand if commercial forest plantations have contributed to maintaining native vegetation on private lands. For this, we evaluated LULC in 1986, 2008 and 2019, focusing on the application of the so-called New Forest Act (NFA). We compared LULC change with agricultural land suitability to check for trends. The landscape connectivity and the importance of the surrounding native vegetation fragments were verified based on the Graph Theory. Property boundaries were extracted from a land tenure model based on the Rural Environmental Registry. To verify the perception of landowners and planted forest industries, we sent a questionnaire with open and closed questions. Our results showed that pasture was the main LULC in the area but has decreased giving space to native vegetation regeneration and mostly to forest plantation and soybean expansion. Pasture with lower agricultural suitability is converted to forest plantation and native vegetation, while pasture with higher agricultural suitability becomes soybean crops. At the rural property level, forest plantations presented the largest area and the largest native vegetation cover compared to other agricultural sectors but still presented a significant riparian vegetation deficit, according to the NFA. Forest fragmentation has increased over the years, even with the increase in native vegetation in 2019 compared to 2008. Regarding the landowner's perception, farmers and industries have demonstrated knowledge and intent to comply with the NFA, but most do not know the Capão Bonito Nacional Forest (CBNF). Our results show that forest plantations have an important role in protecting native vegetation in the protected area surroundings, and the forest certification helps environmental legislation compliance. However, the conservation strategies between landowners, planted forest industries, and the protected area must be improved, mainly the Permanent Preservation Area deficits (riparian zones) inherited from pastures and which were converted into forest plantations. Furthermore, strategies to engage the local population in conserving the protected area, such as through agroforestry systems promotion, are fundamental. © 2024 Elsevier GmbH",Atlantic Forest and Forest fragmentation and Landscape connectivity and Native vegetation protection law and Tree plantation and Brazil and Capao Bonito and Sao Paulo [Brazil] and biodiversity and conservation management and ecosystem service and forest management and landscape change and protected area and tree planting and vegetation dynamics,10.1016/j.jnc.2023.126551,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183490066&doi=10.1016%2fj.jnc.2023.126551&partnerID=40&md5=900b65de0747dd7d7e9f376804fec6bc,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 1,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1216

To be successful, this effort requires robust monitoring tools to assess land reclamation practices. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of recovery efforts in mined areas by developing a Recovery Quality Index (RQI) based on soil and vegetation indicators. Using the heavily mined Iron Quadrangle region of Brazil as an example, four undisturbed reference areas were selected: Atlantic Forest; ferruginous rupestrian grassland with dense vegetation; ferruginous rupestrian grassland with sparse vegetation; and quartzite rupestrian grassland. Four areas directly or indirectly affected by mining were selected, including an environmental compensation area set aside 5 years prior to the study, two sterile piles that had undergone recovery for 15 and 20 years, and a cave area with 15 years of recovery. Two vegetation parameters and 34 soil attributes were used in a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to select indicators and scores. Vegetative parameters had the lowest RQI weights. Soil physical indicators tended to be the most important. RQI values were lowest when Atlantic Forest was used as the reference, showing that the forest was a unique ecosystem, and the cave site had lower RQI scores than the other restored sites, indicating the high degree of disturbance that occurred in that low-lying area. The oldest sterile pile tended to have higher RQI values than the newest and similar values to the less disturbed compensation areas. The recovery quality index values were similar in all areas, with 5 to 20 years in the recovery process, showing that the rehabilitation process is slow in this environment. © 2024 The Authors",Ecological restoration and Iron mining and Soil indicators and Vegetation indicators and Atlantic Forest and Brazil and Iron Quadrangle and Minas Gerais and Biodiversity and Ecosystems and Forestry and Iron and Land use and Metal recovery and Mining and Piles and Principal component analysis and Quality assurance and Quality control and Reclamation and Soils and Vegetation and Atlantic forest and Ecological restoration and Ecosystem restoration and Index values and Iron minings and Quality indices and Recovery quality and Soil indicator and United Nations and Vegetation indicator and cave and compensation and environmental indicator and environmental monitoring and grassland and index method and land reclamation and mining and recovery plan and restoration ecology and United Nations and vegetation index and Land reclamation,10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.111716,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184951828&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolind.2024.111716&partnerID=40&md5=47dad898827257fa7b0a6c18246ef19c,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,FEB,1470-160X and 1872-7034,WOS:001186919400001,FEB 2024,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1217, 5176"

However, the industry is hindered by several challenges, such as limited species diversity, technological gaps, and competition over marine space. This study aimed to assess the current state, challenges, and prospects of seaweed aquaculture, with a particular emphasis on Indonesia. A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, focusing on the development of species diversity, cultivation technologies, and site suitability in Indonesia. The findings reveal that seaweed aquaculture in Indonesia is primarily dominated by species like Kappaphycus alvarezii, Gracilaria sp., and Euchema cottonii. This underscores the necessity for species diversification and the adoption of advanced cultivation technologies. Key areas identified for future research include the optimization of cultivation techniques, expansion of suitable farming areas, and the integration of digital technologies and genetic analysis to boost productivity and sustainability. In addition to technological advancements, socio-economic research on seaweed farming demonstrates its significant contribution to coastal community livelihoods, offering income opportunities and increased resilience.

We explore rubber and canna integration into agroforestry, emphasizing sustainability, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. This study assesses C. indica's viability beneath 7-8-year-old rubber plantations, examining its impact on soil,microbial communities, and latex production. The research site in Subang, Indonesia, features, at the beginning, six-year-old rubber trees with variations in sunlight under canopies. Wild C. indica rhizomes from Mid Java are planted beneath rubber trees and open ground. No significant difference was found in plant height, rhizome weight, leaf area, number of leaves, r/s ratio, SLA, LWR, and LAR between C. indica cultivated beneath rubber trees (RC agroforestry) and on open ground. Although not significant, RC soil had higher N, P, K, and organic C levels than rubber monoculture (RM) soil two years after adopting the rubber-canna agroforestry system. After six years, RC soil had a greater pH, C, N, P, and K, clay and silt content, and Shannon E index than RM soil. Analysis of soil metagenomics showed the phylum Proteobacteria dominates and enhances soil fertility, particularly in RC soils. These results increase latex output at the RC site over the RM location. In conclusion, the Rubber-Canna agroforestry system enhances sustainability, soil fertility, and crop yield, addressing food security and environmental concerns. The primary novelty of this six-year study lies in the integration of C. indica into Southeast Asia's rubber agroforestry systems, highlighting its unique characteristics such as low-light survival, which can contribute to food security and soil protection. © 2024, Universitas Negeri Semarang.

Despite growing interest in EI, its impact on soil properties, compared with conventional farming practice (FP), remains poorly understood as a result of limited field evidence. This study, conducted over eight seasons in southern Brazil as part of the ‘Global Maize Project’ of the International Plant Nutrition Institute, evaluated EI compared with FP, and FP with silage (FPS) using a split-plot design. Four nitrogen application rates (0, 70, 140 and 210 kg ha−1) were applied to subplots with four replicates. Soil properties were measured to a depth of 1 m. The trial systems consisted of a maize–soybean rotation under no-till during summer and cover crops and fertilizer application during winter. In the FP system, black oats and wheat were cultivated, while FPS utilized white oats and ryegrass. In the EI system, peas (without N application) and wheat were cultivated. In the 4-years preceding the trial, the area was cultivated in a no-till system with maize–soybean during summer and black oat–wheat in winter. Our results reveal distinct differences in soil properties among the systems, with FPS demonstrating greater soil acidity (pH of 4.4 at 0–5 cm) caused by higher N application than FP and EI systems. The lower soil pH altered soil nutrient dynamics, with decreased available Ca, Mg and K and increased Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn. Furthermore, nutrient availability varied, with EI having more inorganic N and DON at 0–40 cm compared with FP, but less in deeper soil (40–100 cm). Notably, EI system had more soil carbon (175 Mg ha−1) compared with FP (161 Mg ha−1), a relative annual increase of 1.8 Mg ha−1 year−1 over 8 years.

Due to the significance of Indonesia in terms of global rainforests and the comprehensive implementation practice of REDD+ programs since 2009, focusing on the case study of Indonesia enables interesting insights regarding the challenges and opportunities of REDD+. Indonesia faced challenges during the project’s implementation, but there were also reductions. This success is attributed to the set program design of REDD+. In this paper, we show that without international development cooperation in the field of climate change mitigation, the countries in the Global South lack locally driven forest conservation or restoration incentives. These incentives emanate exogenously from international development cooperation programs in the field of climate change mitigation. The review of the program also shows that despite the rigorous institutional design of REDD+ in Indonesia, not all the stakeholders could benefit from the program appropriately. Because of the de facto weakness of the smallholder farmers, indigenous population groups, and other vulnerable categories in the political process of Indonesia, these groups’ interests have not come fully to their own in Indonesia. Hence, we conclude that international programs that target environmental protection, while addressing inferior institutional quality, bad governance and operate through more accountable NGOs than government agencies would perform better in terms of global environmental targets and the sustainability of local livelihoods. © The Author(s) 2024.",Capacity building and Climate change mitigation and Deforestation and Forests management and REDD+ and Stakeholder interests,10.1007/s10668-024-05368-w,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204685280&doi=10.1007%2fs10668-024-05368-w&partnerID=40&md5=f357afa3a5aa0c68e4fe509f460babe1,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,2024 SEP 24,1387-585X and 1573-2975,WOS:001318965400004,SEP 2024,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1223, 5197"

The distribution was fairly uniform, encompassing 6 life forms: ferns, herbs, lianas, palms, shrubs, and trees. For fauna, the result indicated the presence of 10 species of mammalia, 37 species of aves, 6 species of reptiles, and 4 species of insects. The secondary forest still supports a high species richness of vegetation and fauna. These findings suggest that the secondary forest is undergoing a successional process in which various vegetation, particularly lianas and herbs, compete to gain more sunlight due to increased canopy openness.

The goal is to enhance both conservation and pollution control strategies for sustainable ecosystem management. Conducted at Lake Tondano in Minahasa, Indonesia, the research followed three main stages: data collection, analysis, and design. The data collection included a vegetation survey of riparian species, land use mapping, and measuring nitrogen and phosphorus levels in lake sediments. A total of 91 plant species from 60 genera and 42 families were documented. Based on their Importance Value Index (IVI), non-invasive status, and nutrient absorption capabilities, 15 species were selected for restoration in areas with high nutrient concentrations, with sediment levels recorded at 0.09% nitrogen and 0.06% phosphorus in impacted zones. These plant species were carefully identified and rigorously tested, originating from intact riparian zones. They will be strategically employed in areas facing significant challenges from nutrient overloading. Using QGIS analysis, a riparian zone measuring 100 × 30 m was designed at coordinates 1.1745604 latitude and 124.8972748 longitude, targeting areas most impacted by nutrient pollution, which poses a risk of eutrophication and negatively affects aquatic ecosystems. The multipurpose riparian zone incorporates distinct wet, transition, and dry zones, employing a zigzag planting pattern to optimize pollutant filtration and nutrient uptake. This design effectively addresses critical issues of erosion and nutrient excessive enrichment, promoting ecological health and biodiversity in the region. The novel contributions of this study include identifying specific plant species capable of thriving in nutrient-rich sediments and quantifying their nutrient absorption capacities, thereby providing a scientifically grounded model for similar conservation efforts in vulnerable ecosystems and enhancing overall resilience.

However, the distribution of spatial financial feasibility is challenging when implementing this strategy on watershed scale. This study aimed to develop payment for ecosystem services model to improve quality in lake water catchment. The model estimated incentive values based on the costs of farmers' losses, water yields, and pollution loads. The potential loss was calculated by determining the income of farmers in lake water catchment spent on land conversion from intensive agriculture to agroforestry. Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) modeling tool was used to calculate water yield and pollution load. The model was tested with case study approach at Lake Rawa Pening in Indonesia, consisting of nine sub-basins and 75 village administrations. The results showed that the reference compensation for farmers was 1, 255.97 USD/ha/year. Considering the spatial distribution of water yields, the incentive for each village varied widely from 891.54 USD/ha/year to 1, 557.06 USD/ha/year, even within the same sub-basin. Ten villages had an incentive above 1, 450.00 USD/ha/year. However, considering the water pollution load, 26 villages had an incentive above 1, 450.00 USD/ha/year with a maximum of 2, 024.17 USD/ha/year. Therefore, village boundary should be an analysis unit for determining spatial incentive feasibility rather than a sub-basin boundary.

Mitigation actions in LULUCF include drastically reducing deforestation (Brazil, Indonesia) and peat degradation (Indonesia), re-/afforestation (all), increased sequestration in standing forests (Brazil, Indonesia) and increasing soil carbon in agricultural lands (India). AFOLU further contributes to mitigation in Brazil and Indonesia by producing biomass feedstock for bioenergy. No country significantly reduces N2O and CH4 emissions from either agriculture or via demand-side actions on diets, due to trade-offs with food security, rural livelihoods and economic growth (although all countries reduce the GHG intensity of agricultural products).

The research aims to evaluate the impact of no-tillage systems combined with various cover crops on soil quality, particularly physical–chemical properties, soil fertility, and carbon sequestration. The experimental design included conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems, with six types of cover crops. Soil samples were collected over three years at multiple time points: before cover crop implementation, after cabbage harvest, and after scarlet eggplant harvest. Chemical analyses measured soil pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil organic carbon (SOC), and nutrient levels. Results indicated that in the short term, CT had higher averages for calcium (Ca), potassium (K), base saturation (BS), and pH, while NT showed higher values for potential acidity (H + Al) and CEC. Over time, pH, H + Al, and SOC increased significantly, suggesting improved soil conditions. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed distinct separation between CT and NT systems, with CT associated with higher pH, K, magnesium (Mg), and BS, and NT showing stronger associations with H + Al and CEC. The PCA also highlighted a positive gradient in SOC and K from year one to year three. The study underscores the benefits of no-tillage systems in enhancing soil quality and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. Despite short-term advantages in CT due to cover crop incorporation, long-term sustainability of soil quality, particularly SOC, may be better maintained in NT systems due to less soil disturbance.

In Brazil, an increasing number of pioneering farmers are establishing agroforestry systems on previously cleared farmland. However, while there are a wide range of agroforestry systems, this diversity has hardly been quantified, and it is not clear how these systems differ in their capacity for nutrient cycling to reverse soil degradation. The objectives of the study were to assess innovative agroforestry systems in terms of taxonomic and functional diversity, spatial structure and management, and to assess how these systems differ in terms of structural complexity and their potential for nutrient cycling. We assessed a LiDAR-derived stand structural complexity index (SSCI), interrow spacing, stem density, tree species richness and diversity, community weighted means (CWM) of foliar nitrogen and wood density, livestock density, pruning and mowing regimes in 30 agroforestry systems in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. We used N, P, K, Ca and Mg stocks in litter as a proxy for nutrient cycling. The agroforestry systems could be broadly categorized into silvopastures, multistrata and successional agroforestry systems. These types spanned a gradient of structural complexity, and this complexity was positively associated with tree species richness and planting density. Litter nutrient stocks were positively associated with pruning and mulching, and negatively associated with CWM of wood density, indicating the importance of pioneer trees. Overall, our results suggest that densely planted, pruned agroforestry systems that contain high species richness, including pioneer trees, contain relatively high amounts of N, P, K, Ca and Mg in their litter. These findings provide insight in the key characteristics of agroforestry systems to support nutrient cycling, and can inform the design of agroforestry systems for the regeneration of degraded agricultural land. © 2023 The Authors",LiDAR and Litter and Multistrata and Regenerative agriculture and Silvopastures and Successional agroforestry and Brazil and agricultural production and agroforestry and lidar and nutrient cycling and species richness,10.1016/j.agee.2023.108828,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179049706&doi=10.1016%2fj.agee.2023.108828&partnerID=40&md5=f00a8eff78a58348eec3dc7b9f9a6ea4,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 7,﻿TY  - JOUR,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAR 1,0167-8809 and 1873-2305,WOS:001135460200001,DEC 2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1232, 3449"

Within this region, the detrimental effects of human activities, particularly unsuitable anthropic actions, have resulted in diminished vegetation cover and an accelerated rate of soil erosion. Notably, practices such as overgrazing and the conversion of native forests into pasturelands have played a pivotal role in exacerbating the process of land desertification. Ultimately, land desertification results in significant losses of soil organic matter and microbial diversity. To address this pressing issue and contribute to the existing literature, various land restoration practices, such as grazing exclusion, cover crops, and terracing, have been implemented in the Brazilian semiarid. These practices have shown promising results in terms of enhancing soil fertility and restoring microbial properties. Nonetheless, their effectiveness in improving soil microbial properties in the Brazilian semiarid region remains a subject of ongoing study. Recent advances in molecular techniques have improved our understanding of microbial communities in lands undergoing desertification and restoration. In this review, we focus on assessing the effectiveness of these restoration practices in revitalizing soil microbial properties, with a particular emphasis on the soil microbiome and its functions. Through a critical assessment of the impact of these practices on soil microbial properties, our research aims to provide valuable insights that can help mitigate the adverse effects of desertification and promote sustainable development in this ecologically sensitive region. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Conservationist practices and Environmental science and Land restoration and Soil microbiome and Brazil and China and Conservation of Natural Resources and Forests and Humans and Soil and Soil Microbiology and Brazil and Arid regions and Climatology and Forestry and Restoration and Sustainable development and environmental marker and soil organic matter and Conservationist practice and Environmental science and Land desertification and Land restoration and Microbiome and Property and Restoration practices and Semi-arid region and Soil microbial and Soil microbiome and desertification and environmental restoration and land management and microbial community and overgrazing and semiarid region and soil conservation and soil fertility and soil microorganism and soil organic matter and sustainable development and vegetation cover and agroforestry and Article and Brazilian and cover crop and desertification and ecosystem restoration and ecosystem service and evapotranspiration and grazing and landscape and microbial community and microbial diversity and nonhuman and semiarid climate and soil and soil degradation and soil fertility and soil health and soil microflora and soil quality and sustainable development and terracing and water conservation and Brazil and China and environmental protection and forest and human and microbiology and Soils,10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.119746,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179124696&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2023.119746&partnerID=40&md5=d7c15431cc1ad459894009b657c9096f,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 14,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1233

Methodology: The land cover and land use values from the MapBiomas project in the years 1985 and 2020 were used. The native forest fragments were classified according to their size, as C1 (< 5 ha), C2 (5-25 ha), C3 (25.1-50 ha), and C4 (> 50 ha). Landscape ecology metrics were calculated using the V-Late 2.0 extension in ArcGIS®. Originality/Relevance: Study of the temporal dynamics of forest cover of hydrographic basins is essential to define strategic forest conservation and restoration actions aimed at protecting water resources. Results: The native forest cover of the GRHB increased by approximately 12%, with an increase in the number and average area of fragments. In general, the forest remnants became closer to each other and demonstrated a higher edge density. A high number of small fragments (< 5 ha) was verified and the largest fragments (> 50 ha) were the main factor responsible for the expansion of the native forest cover in the basin. Social/management contributions: Forest restoration actions in the GRHB should prioritize the connectivity of smaller fragments. In addition to supporting forest restoration projects, the results contribute to the application of methodologies to implement water resource management instruments, helping to define practices and policies for sustainable water use. © 2024 Universidade Nove de Julho-UNINOVE.

Understanding the dynamics of aboveground carbon stocks in underway constructions and urban expansions is crucial to provide a basis for land use management and planning. The objective of this study was to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of aboveground carbon storage and assess how the LULC change is affected by human intervention, as well as how aboveground carbon stocks respond to these changes in the tropical highland landscape of Jatigede. In this study, changes in aboveground carbon stocks were investigated between 2014 and 2021 by using the integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs (InVEST) model. The results revealed that the total aboveground carbon stock decreased between 2014 and 2021. Forests showed the greatest decline in the aboveground carbon stock in terms of space. The primary cause of the reduction in the aboveground carbon stock was the conversion of vegetated land to agricultural and urban land cover. The aboveground carbon stock change was also caused by the continuing construction, which resulted in the extension of construction zones. However, an increase in the aboveground carbon stock was mostly observed in mixed gardens that were close to forest areas. The preservation of mixed gardens as a tree-based agroforestry system can be suggested for enhancing the aboveground carbon stock, as mixed gardens play a significant role in carbon storage in the midst of the increasingly massive deforestation due to the expansion of urban areas. © 2024 by the authors.",aboveground and carbon and dynamics and InVEST model and land use changes and Carbon and Coverings and Deforestation and Dynamics and Ecosystems and Expansion and Land Use and Storage and Indonesia and West Java and Deforestation and Ecosystems and Expansion and Land use and Urban planning and Above-ground carbons and Aboveground and Carbon stocks and Carbon storage and Integrated valuation of ecosystem service and tradeoff model and Land use and land cover change and Landuse change and Service modeling and Tradeoffs modeling and Valuation of ecosystem services and aboveground production and carbon storage and GIS and land cover and land use change and remote sensing and spatiotemporal analysis and urban forestry and urbanization and Dynamics,10.3390/f15050874,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194175467&doi=10.3390%2ff15050874&partnerID=40&md5=07ccc7e42e949d92d4b2f3a167dca5ac,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 1,NA,JOUR,5,NA,NA,NA,MAY,1999-4907,WOS:001232209800001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1239, 4485"

Monitoring climate fluctuation in agricultural areas is a substantial way to maintain food security, especially in Indonesia. The rise of surface temperature contributes to the drought phenomenon that triggers various agricultural problems, such as crop disease, production loss, land conversion, soil nutrient depletion, and biodiversity loss. With this sense, implementing climate-smart agriculture (CSA) schemes is necessary to secure food production, climate resiliency, and environmental sustainability. Land surface temperature (LST) derivation by using satellite-borne technology is an invaluable solution for monitoring climate dynamics in vast agricultural lands. This study were used temperature bands from the TIRS sensor of Landsat 8 and 9 data to estimate LST in the Middle Citarum watershed. This research aimed to estimate LST series during 2013-2023 dry seasons, which acts as an initial warning system for mitigating drought occurrence in Middle Citarum. This study revealed that the average of LST values during 2013-2023 spanned from 22.54°C to 33.14°C, which somewhat unsuits to optimal rice production. The highest temperature during these periods was 38.98°C, occurred in 2015. This condition was also associated with the 2015 drought event, which was an unparalleled warming worldwide. Based on the LST derivation in the study area, since 2018 to 2023, maximum land surface temperature has steadily been above 30°C. This suggests that drought probability has risen, and the figure should warn of potential failure in crop production during the season. With the development of LST time series, these data sets could contribute to an effective strategy as part of CSA adoption to understand and mitigate drought. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",NA,10.1088/1755-1315/1359/1/012094,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198532665&doi=10.1088%2f1755-1315%2f1359%2f1%2f012094&partnerID=40&md5=38ccd9615d4896712ee54069231410ba,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,CONF,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1246

We aim to understand how the EPM made up of eucalyptus plantations and native forest remnants affect the SSB in the Brazilian Pampa. Samples of the SSB of EPM were collected and monitored for 6 months in a shade house. We evaluated seedling emergence, richness, composition, ecological characteristics of the species, diversity, and floristic similarity. We recorded a high rate of seedling emergence, species richness, and different life forms and native species in all EPM treatments; however, the similarity between native remnants and eucalyptus plantations was low. The size and level of conservation of native remnants and the position and management of eucalyptus sites in the EPM influenced the diversity and composition of species. Eucalyptus plantations contain SSBs with potential for natural regeneration when they are in a landscape that maintains conserved native forest remnants. These results expand the knowledge of the SSB in EPM and can support actions in ecological restoration projects. © 2024 The Author(s).",natural regeneration and pampa and resilience and restoration and silviculture and Conservation and Ecology and Natural Reforestation and Resilience and Silviculture and Argentina and Brazil and Pampas and Conservation and Ecology and Reforestation and Eucalyptus plantations and matrix and Native forests and Natural regeneration and Pampa and Resilience and Seedling emergence and Silviculture and Soil seed bank and Southern Brazil and conservation management and cultivation and evergreen forest and forest soil and landscape ecology and native species and plantation forestry and regeneration and restoration ecology and seed bank and seedling emergence and silviculture and vegetation cover and Restoration,10.1139/cjfr-2023-0256,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196279902&doi=10.1139%2fcjfr-2023-0256&partnerID=40&md5=78d8699ea9a7c3ba20951f8671dac3bb,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 1,NA,JOUR,6,674,685,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1254

After years of zero burning policies in fire-Adapted ecosystems, and resulting increases in fire hazards and risks, countries are moving towards integrated fire management (IFM) including prescribed burning (PB). With a primary focus on biodiversity, Brazilian governmental organizations endorsed this paradigm shift in 2014, with the introduction of IFM in a number of protected areas (PA) of the Cerrado. Reducing high intensity mid/late dry season (M/LDS) fires through PB in the early dry season (EDS) has proven successful in other savanna ecosystems, with demonstrated mitigation potential as EDS fires are associated with lower GHG emissions. In the present study, Earth observation data were used to analyze the seasonality of active fires, burned areas and fuel loads. A dynamic performance benchmark (control-Treatment paired sample test) was applied to assess the effectiveness of existing IFM activities in promoting emission abatement over the pre-covid period 2014 2019. Compared against the responses of PAs without IFM-PB, the PAs with IFM-PB showed significant increases in EDS fires (+137% hotspots) and EDS burned areas (from a share of 11.2% to 29.5% of the total yearly burned area). Fuel fragmentation through EDS-PB, tracked through calibrated fuel load maps, also led to a 62% reduction in burned areas in the IFM period 2014 2019. Combined M/LDS burned areas decreased from 85.1% of the total yearly burned area to a share of 67.7%. When applying the observed shift in fire seasonality and the effect of burned area reduction to all the PA of the Cerrado for the same period, we estimate an emission abatement potential of 1085 764 tCO2e/y. Given the fact that IFM followed a biodiversity-centred approach in the Cerrado, an emission abatement-centered approach could result in even higher abatement potentials. © 2024 Institute of Physics.

We comprehensively analyze the incident's environmental, economic, social, and tourism impacts. Environmentally, the fire caused severe damage to the region's ecosystems, upsetting ecological balances and diminishing air quality. This has far-reaching effects on flora, fauna, and the sustainability of natural resources. Forest fires release a significant amount of pollutants into the air, including carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, and other harmful compounds. These pollutants can significantly degrade air quality, leading to health issues for humans and animals. The forest fire in the Bromo region of Indonesia had a profound impact, both economically and environmentally. The closure of the Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park drastically reduced tourism, leading to an 80 % drop in hotel occupancy and severe losses for local businesses like jeep rentals, eateries, and souvenir shops. Economically, this resulted in a significant decrease in Non-Tax State Revenue. Environmentally, the fire destroyed over 50 hectares of land, severely damaging the national park's ecosystems and affecting biodiversity. The smoke and heat from the fire also led to poor air quality and potential health risks for local residents, as well as adverse effects on nearby agriculture, increasing stress and anxiety in the community. The study emphasizes the urgent need for stringent regulations, effective community engagement, and educational initiatives in forest conservation areas, particularly those attracting tourists.

The inherent tension between forest productivity and protection necessitates a model that ensures sustainable utilization. This research proposes a novel framework by integrating fiqh bi'ah (Islamic environmental jurisprudence) with a model for PWFs development. Design/methodology/approach: Using a qualitative approach, the analytical network process (ANP) analyzes data gathered through a literature review of Islamic environmental jurisprudence (fiqh bi'ah) on environment and waqf, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with academics, practitioners and regulators in fiqh bi'ah and waqf forest management. Findings: Three potential PWFs development models emerge from the fiqh bi'ah literature; Harim (maintaining the natural forest state for intangible benefits like oxygen and biodiversity), Hima (sustainable utilization of forest products while preserving ecological components) and Ihya’ al-mawat (developing unproductive land into a future forest). The ANP analysis reveals that Hima is the most preferred model by all stakeholders, followed by Ihya’ al-mawat. The Harim model received lower preference due to limited economic potential. Additionally, experts suggest tourism-based forest management as the most suitable approach for all three PWFs models.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the responses of soil carbon and nitrogen stocks, soil organic matter (SOM) quality, carbon isotopic composition (13C) from C3 and C4 plants and carbon sequestration and emission to silvopastoral systems, natural vegetation (NV), fallow pasture (FP), and intensive management pasture (IMP). Silvopastoral systems had different shading levels: 25 % (SP25), 50 % (SP50) and 75 % (SP75). The grass cultivated in all treatments was Megathyrsus maximus cv. Mombaça. The experimental design consisted of four replicates, and collection sites were distributed in strips throughout the study areas at different soil layers (0.00–0.05; 0.05–0.15; 0.15–0.30; 0.30–0.60 and 0.60–1.0 m deep). The conversion of natural vegetation in FP areas and silvopastoral systems (SP25 and SP75) led to increases in total C and N stocks (up to 1.0 m) when compared to other land use systems (SP50, IMP, and NV), which did not occur with total labile-C and C-POM. FP, SP25 and SP75 significantly increased labile C stocks in MAOM found in the 0.30–0.60 m layer. A greater enrichment of 13C in MAOM was observed with increasing depth for silvopastoral systems (SP25, SP50 and SP75) and NV. C-MAOM stocks derived from C3 plants were higher in soils under SP25 and SP75 and from C4 plants under FP. C-POM stocks were higher in all silvopastoral systems under study. IMP and FP affected δ13C values in MAOM and POM, especially in the 0.00–0.05 m layer. C sequestration increased under FP and SP25, with greater contributions from C4 and C3 plants, respectively. Of the silvopastoral systems, SP25 had the highest C stock in soil and contributed to the sequestration of 1.67 Mg C ha−1 yr−1. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Mineral-associated organic matter and Particulate organic matter and Shading and Stable isotope and Agriculture and Carbon and Forests and Nitrogen and Plants and Poaceae and Soil and Amazonia and Biogeochemistry and Carbon and Forestry and Isotopes and Land use and Nitrogen and Organic carbon and Particles (particulate matter) and Vegetation and carbon and carbon 13 and mineral associated organic matter and nitrogen and organic matter and particulate organic matter and stable isotope and unclassified drug and nitrogen and Carbon and nitrogen and Intensive management and Mineral-associated organic matter and Natural vegetation and Particulate organic matters and Shading and Silvopastoral systems and Soil carbon stock and Soil nitrogen and Stable isotopes and agricultural production and nitrogen and particulate organic matter and pastoralism and shading and silviculture and soil carbon and soil quality and stable isotope and Amazonas (Brazil) and Article and concentration (parameter) and controlled study and experimental study and forest and grass and intensive management pasteur and land use and nonhuman and Panicum maximum and pasture and plant and sandy soil and silvopastoral system and soil layer and soil management and soil property and soil quality and vegetation and agriculture and forest and Poaceae and soil and Soils,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168251,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176938025&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.168251&partnerID=40&md5=966efe14007403ad98da3782e3b1b885,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 14,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1260

In this context, finding tools to detect at early stages the effects of increasing aridity on ecosystems is extremely urgent to avoid irreversible damage. Here, we assess shifts in plant community functional structure along a spatial aridity gradient in tropical dryland (Brazilian Caatinga), to select the most appropriate plant functional groups as ecological indicators likely useful to predict temporal ecosystem trajectories in response to aridity. We identified seven plant functional groups based on 13 functional traits associated with plant establishment, defense, regeneration, and dispersal, whose relative abundances changed, linearly and non-linearly, with increasing aridity, showing either increasing or decreasing trends. Of particular importance is the increase in abundance of plants with high chemical defense and Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) photosynthetic pathway, with increasing aridity. We propose the use of these functional groups as early warning indicators to detect aridity impacts on these dryland ecosystems and shifts in ecosystem functioning.

Consequently, urban forest soils emerge as effective NBS, underscoring their potential to mitigate environmental challenges and foster sustainable urban ecosystems. In these sense, this manuscript aimed at evaluating how soil attributes of the urban forests of São Paulo, Brazil, with different adjacent land uses, influence the capacity to store the excess of C and N from anthropogenic emissions, making this ecosystem an important reservoir of urban anthropogenic emissions. Three hundred urban forest soil samples were collected from the surface to a depth of 50 cm. All samples were analyzed for C and N content (and their stable isotopes). In addition, granulometric tests were also carried out to classify the soils. It was found that the most central forest fragment has the highest C and N contents at all analyzed depths, probably due to the association with physical aspects of soil texture. For all layers, the most central fragment soil sample, the only one with a clay soil, presented approximately twice as many elements when compared to the soil samples of the other sites. In general, C and N stocks (and their stable isotopes, δ13C and δ15N, respectively) varied significantly in forests located in the center-periphery direction (%N - F = 24.58, p < 0.05; %C - F = 22.48, p < 0.05; δ15N - F = 4.27, p < 0.05; δ13C - F = 19.8, p < 0.05; C/N - F = 14.56, p < 0.05). This more central forest fragment with higher vehicle emissions showed greater potential to store these atmospheric elements and with greater neutralizing efficiency than the other forest fragments. δ13C and δ15N contents together with the C:N ratio indicated the efficiency of biogeochemical cycling, through decomposition, in different urban forest fragments. More peripheral fragments showed high efficiency in C and N cycling along the analyzed soil profiles, while in the most superficial layer, the most central fragment was highly efficient. These shed light results how integrating NbS principles into strategic urban planning and city-level climate policies can bolster the effectiveness of urban green areas. The integration not only promotes carbon sequestration and efficient nutrient cycling in the soil but also fosters sustainable practices, contributing to a more resilient urban landscape. © 2024 The Authors",Carbon cycle and Nitrogen cycle and Soil conservation and Urban forests and Urban sustainability and Brazil and Biogeochemistry and Carbon and Clay and Ecosystems and Forestry and Land use and Nitrogen and Soil moisture and Soil surveys and Sustainable development and Textures and Tropics and Anthropogenic emissions and C contents and Carbon cycles and Forest fragments and Forest soils and N content and Nitrogen cycles and Soil sample and Urban forests and Urban sustainability and carbon cycle and carbon isotope and forest soil and megacity and nitrogen cycle and nitrogen isotope and soil carbon and soil conservation and soil nitrogen and subtropical region and sustainability and urban forestry and Efficiency,10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.111743,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187215423&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolind.2024.111743&partnerID=40&md5=61dffe9514f644f82c6e8994ffe7219a,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 3,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAR,1470-160X and 1872-7034,WOS:001202549900001,FEB 2024,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1267, 3612"

Our study aimed to classify the landscape and evaluate its ecology in a highly fragmented region within the Atlantic Forest. We combined satellite image-based data, and spatial data of a region in Southern Brazil with Random Forest (RF) supervised algorithms. Using this combination, we defined the land use and native forest classes and estimated landscape metrics. Overall, native forest fragments varied widely, especially regarding their areas (ha), shape, and the number of core areas. Among all fragments, the one in the Rio Doce State Forest Park (PERD) holds the largest area, most regular shape, and the highest number of core habitats in the study region. However, most (64.4%) of the fragments, especially the small ones (< 0.4 hectares), are close to each other (i.e., average distances up 100 m). Our findings demonstrate that the closely connected fragments may be potential candidates to enhance forest connectivity, and support ecological restoration plans in the study region.

Mangrove land cover changes in North Singkawang, West Kalimantan, Indonesia analyzed using Landsat 8 images. Biodiversitas 25: 3160-3167. North Singkawang Sub-district, located within Singkawang City in West Kalimantan Province, Indonesia is a coastal area with significant potential for mangrove forests. Recently, the district has experienced considerable land use changes, including the conversion of land for settlements, fish ponds, agricultural purposes, and coastal abrasion at various locations. To support the sustainability of mangrove forests, it is crucial to gather data on the area and distribution of these forests. This study aimed to investigate changes in the area and distribution of mangrove forests within this district. A survey method was employed for this investigation. Mangrove vegetation was assessed using visual interpretation of Landsat 8 OLI_TIRS images from 2016, 2019, and 2022. The Geographic Information System (GIS) application, specifically ArcGIS 10.8 software, was utilized to create maps and analyze land cover changes. The total area of mangrove forest was 514.95 hectares. Land cover in the North Singkawang mangrove forest area, in 2016, 2019, and 2022, consisted of mangrove forests, community crop areas, fish ponds, and open fields. Between 2016 and 2019, open fields (45.81 hectares) and community crop areas (9.84 hectares) were converted into mangrove forests through reforestation. During the same period, deforestation occurred as natural mangrove forests were converted into community crop areas (36.49 hectares), and open fields were transformed into community crop areas (0.03 hectares). From 2019 to 2022, community crop areas (6.93 hectares) were converted into mangrove forests, while deforestation resulted in the conversion of mangrove forests to open fields (15.37 hectares). From 2016 to 2022, mangrove forest cover increased by 10.72 hectares, community crop areas expanded by 19.74 hectares, the area of fish ponds remained unchanged, and open fields decreased by 30.46 hectares. The increase in mangrove forest cover was attributed to natural regrowth and reforestation activities, while the reduction in mangrove forests was primarily driven by anthropogenic activities, particularly the conversion of mangrove forests for crop production. © 2024, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

A literature search identified 195 documents with SOCS in layers 0-30 cm and 0-100 cm. The mean SOCS (0-30 cm) in the Latossolos was significantly higher (73.6 Mg ha-1) than the suggested IPCC default (55 Mg ha-1). The highest stocks (237 ± 39 Mg ha-1) were measured in uncultivated Latossolos Brunos in the 0-100 cm layer, especially at higher altitudes and lower mean annual temperature. The most frequently occurring soil Latossolo Vermelho distroférrico-LVdf (25% of the Planalto), also had high SOCS. Surprisingly Latossolos Vermelho Distrófico (LVd) also had high SOCS, in spite of the coarser texture. The estimated SOCS in Latosoolos of the Planalto is 419.9 Tg C, 36% larger than reported previous studies.

Unfortunately, the degradation and deforestation of mangroves has frequently occurred. Therefore, it is important to understand the vulnerability of mangroves and its impact on blue carbon storage for effective mangrove management and coastal planning. This study aims to assess the vulnerability of mangroves and its effect on blue carbon storage in the coral triangle region of Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. The vulnerability assessment included factors such as exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Blue carbon storage was evaluated based on carbon stock in sediment, biomass, and total carbon stock in mangrove ecosystems in both protected and unprotected areas. The mangrove ecosystem in the protected area of Rawa Aopa Watumohai National (RAWN) Park showed lower vulnerability due to lower exposure, lower sensitivity, and higher adaptive capacity. On the other hand, mangrove ecosystems in unprotected areas such as Tinanggea (TNG), Kendari Bay (KDI), and Staring Bay (STR) exhibited moderate to high vulnerability due to higher exposure, sensitivity, and lower adaptive capacity. Mangroves in RAWN Park, which were less vulnerable, had higher blue carbon storage in sediment (381.64 tons C/ha), biomass (312.65 tons C/ha), and the entire ecosystem (706.76 tons C/ha). These values were significantly higher (p<0.05) compared to those in TNG (306.66 tons, 144.15 tons, and 448.37 tons C/ha, respectively), KDI (262.08 tons, 227.73 tons, and 470.76 tons C/ha, respectively), and STR (169.44 tons, 66.66 tons, and 253.27 tons C/ha, respectively). The high vulnerability of mangrove ecosystems resulted in reduced carbon storage in the coastal regions of Southeast Sulawesi. Therefore, efforts such as rehabilitation and restoration, legislation, and conservation should be prioritized to enhance blue carbon storage, and other ecosystem services provided by mangroves in the coral triangle region of Southeast Sulawesi.

Nonetheless, the quality and quantity of soil ecosystem services (SES) delivery over the long term depend on the use of sustainable land management practices. In the present study, we assessed seven SES using a set of soil quality indicators in four production systems based on yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis A. St.-Hil) in the Araucaria Forest biome of Southern Brazil: two sites were under traditional agroecological agroforestry management, one was a silvopastoral system with dairy pasture, and the last one was a monoculture yerba mate production system. The SES measured were soil fertility, carbon sequestration, erosion control, nutrient cycling, plant provision, biodiversity, and health. Soil samples were collected at various depths and analysed for chemical, physical, and biological attributes. A principal component analysis on the dataset showed that the soil quality indicators that best represent the variance between the systems at the 0–10 cm layer were acidity, microbial activity (FDA), total nitrogen, (TN), structural stability index (SSI), cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH, sum of bases (SB), microbial quotient (qMic), density of earthworms (EwD), bulk density (BD), and carbon stocks (Cstock). Soil quality indicators ranging from 0 to 1 were used to graphically represent the set of SES. The indicator-based approach used to explain the differences among the four production systems was able to capture the soil functions and offered a good starting point for quantifying SES provision. © 2024 by the authors.",ecosystem services indicators and principal components analysis and soil attributes and soil conservation and soil quality and traditional and agroecological yerba mate,10.3390/conservation4010009,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85200359451&doi=10.3390%2fconservation4010009&partnerID=40&md5=1c07a7da05d45ccba05a3b5d40b9bfa7,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 2,NA,JOUR,1,115,138,NA,MAR,2673-7159,WOS:001215509400001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1287, 3537"

In Brazil, the largest area of vegetable cropping systems is located in the Oxisols within the Cerrado biome. These areas are characterized by intensive land use and large-scale mechanized agriculture, which may affect the soil physical quality over time. This study aims to understand the effects of vegetable cropping (VG) systems on physical-hydric properties of highly weathered Oxisols. To this end, soil physical properties were assessed in representative VG systems of different ages [15 (VG15), 20 (VG20), and 30 (VG30) years old] and in a native Cerrado vegetation (CV), which was used as a reference of an intact system. Several analyses were conducted, including soil water retention curve, soil bulk density (ρ), soil penetration resistance (PR), saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), disaggregation index, and structural stability index. In addition, a soil physical quality index (SPQI) was developed to assess the effects of soil management on soil functions and ecosystem services in the VG systems evaluated. It was observed that VG systems promoted soil compaction as indicated by the increase in ρ and PR values compared to the CV. This resulted in changes in soil porosity with mesopores being the most affected. The changes in soil porosity reduced Ksat and field capacity, and increased the permanent wilting point, leading to a reduction in available water capacity. The SPQI was reduced by 34, 32, and 43% in VG15, VG20, and VG30, respectively, compared to the CV (0.89). Based on our SPQI, support of root development and resistance to erosion and degradation were the soil functions most affected, regardless of the VG system age. Our results indicate the need to improve the current management used in VG systems to mitigate soil compaction and improve soil physical quality of Oxisols under these systems in the Brazilian Cerrado. This is essential to restore soil functionality and to ensure the sustainable food production of these systems in the long term. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Pore size distribution and Soil functions and Soil structure and Soil water retention curve and Brazil and biome and cerrado and cropping practice and hydraulic property and intensive agriculture and Oxisol and physical property and pore space and size distribution and soil structure and soil water and structural stability and vegetable and water retention,10.1016/j.catena.2023.107651,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177579962&doi=10.1016%2fj.catena.2023.107651&partnerID=40&md5=39d9709eeae76bd0716c616eddc3cb13,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,FEB,0341-8162 and 1872-6887,WOS:001118524500001,NOV 2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1289, 4992"

This paper focuses on the cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis of recovering almost one million hectares of legally protected areas in the Araguaia Biodiversity Corridor (Brazil) following the Brazilian Forest code regulation. We analyze two paths for recovery, ecological and economic (including timber and agroforestry systems). We consider the direct and indirect local costs, as well as monetized environmental benefits using the social cost of carbon and avoided soil erosion. According to our estimates, in 50 years, the recovery of the Araguaia Corridor will lead to net societal benefits with either the ecological (US$ 19.8 billion) or economic (US$ 18.9 billion) pathways in all macro-regions (north, central, and south) and rural property sizes (small, medium and large). The recovery captures 262 million tCO2eq and avoids 527 million tons of soil erosion with the economic path; these estimates are 23% and 1.7% higher, respectively, when using the ecological path. Importantly, we show that the restoration activity is not carbon credit dependent on being profitable when based on the economic path proposed. Additionally, this study highlights the high profitability of agroforestry systems, especially in small farms. There are also relevant local impacts, from 12 to 38 thousand new direct jobs. Even considering a limited menu of ecosystem services (carbon and soil), we show that social benefits from the Araguaia biodiversity corridor restoration exceed its social costs, justifying the subsidization of ecosystem restoration. In this sense, land use policies can incorporate mechanisms for financial support, grants, or incentives to encourage and facilitate ecosystem restoration efforts in the region. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Amazon and Cerrado recovery and Avoided soil erosion and replacement cost and Carbon capture and social cost of carbon and Climate change economics and Cost benefit analysis and Ecological reforestation and Amazon River and Araguaia River and Brazil and agroindustry and biodiversity and carbon sequestration and cost-benefit analysis and reforestation and restoration ecology and sustainability,10.1016/j.landusepol.2024.107122,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189762127&doi=10.1016%2fj.landusepol.2024.107122&partnerID=40&md5=9855b78d682b9ab13ed8a33cecbe659d,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,JUN,0264-8377 and 1873-5754,WOS:001223985100001,APR 2024,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1291, 4938"

Most available studies are limited to plant-pollinator interactions, and do not include grasses, even though knowledge on phenology of this species group is highly relevant, e.g., for grazing management or ecological restoration. In this study, we monthly evaluated flowering and fruiting in Brazilian subtropical grasslands under different grazing intensities (high, moderate, low, very low, ungrazed) over one year. To estimate the effect of the seasonal variation on the phenology of functional groups (C3 grass, C4 grass, monocots, dicots, shrubs) we used circular statistics. The highest flowering activity occurred in October and November, while fruiting peaked in March and April. Shrubs had the highest number of flowers and fruits, and C4 grasses contributed the largest number of fruiting species. The flowering peak of most functional groups occurred in October, except for C4 grasses and shrubs that peaked in February and November, respectively. Fruiting of C3 grasses peaked in December, C4 grasses and shrubs were most abundant in April and dicots, and monocots peaked in October. Grazing treatments differed considerably in flowering and fruiting patterns for all species groups. Monocots and dicots herbs showed high flowering activity under intense grazing. C3 grasses presented highest peaks in moderate and low grazing intensities, while C4 grasses peaked in very low grazing, and shrubs showed the highest peaks in ungrazed plots. Flowering and fruiting occurred throughout the year in our study system, with clear variation among functional groups in response to climatic and management patterns.

Utilizing a Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA), we generated 30 m spatial resolution fragmentation maps for old-growth and secondary forests across the AF. We quantified landscape fragmentation patterns and carbon (C) dynamics over 35 years using MapBiomas data between the years 1985 and 2020. We found that from 1985 to 2020 the forest suffered continuous fragmentation, losing core (nuclei forest fragments) and bridge (areas that connect different core areas) components of the landscape. About 87.5% (290 468.4 km2) of the remaining forest lacked core areas, with bridges (38.0%) and islets (small, isolated fragments) (35.4%) being predominant. Secondary forests (1986-2020) accounted for 99 450.5 km2 and played a significant role in fragmentation pattern, constituting 44.9% of the areas affected by edge effects (perforation, edge, bridge, and loop), 53.7% of islets, and comprising only 1.4% of core forest. Additionally, regeneration by secondary forests contributed to all fragmentation classes in 2020. Even with the regrowth of forests, the total forested area in the biome did not increase between 1985 and 2020. Deforestation emissions reached 818 Tg CO2, closely paralleled by edge effects emissions at 810 Tg CO2, highlighting a remarkable parity in C emissions between the two processes. Despite slow changes, AF biome continues to lose its C stocks. We estimated that around 1.96 million hectares (19 600 km2) of regenerated forest would be required to offset the historical C emissions over the analysed period. Hence, MSPA can support landscape monitoring, optimizing natural or active forest regeneration to reduce fragmentation and enhance C stocks. Our study’s findings are critical for guiding land-use policies focusing on minimizing emissions, promoting forest regrowth, and monitoring its permanence.

This study examines the ecological restoration processes within wakaf forests and offers policy recommendations. It investigates causal relationships affecting wakaf forest populations in Cibunian and Cibeureum villages using an ex post facto design and quantitative methods. Focusing on Cibunian beneficiaries, who generally possess higher education levels, the study explores the link between education and improved forest management. Data were collected via structured questionnaires and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Findings reveal that the Wakaf Forest Institution significantly impacts the socio-economic benefits of the wakaf forest, contributing 26.4% to these benefits. Additionally, the institution enhances the ecological restoration of the wakaf forest by 13.9%. The path coefficient value indicates a positive influence on the sustainability of these socio-economic benefits. Hypothesis testing confirms a significant impact of the Wakaf Forest Institution, validating the alternative hypothesis (Ha). The Wakaf Forest Institution is a vital resource for the local community, offering sustainable forest management and generating income. Managed in accordance with Indonesian laws and Islamic Sharia regulations, the institution strategically selects sites to improve service access and enhance the forest's role in livelihoods.

Our objective was to evaluate, through the Nexus approach, how dynamic (land use and management) and inherent (soil type) factors impact soil physical properties and processes that drive water recharge potential, biomass production, and water erosion in the Cantareira System, Brazil. The assessment considered three soils (Typic Hapludult, Typic Dystrudept, and Typic Usthortent) and four land uses (native forest, rotational grazing, extensive grazing, and eucalyptus), which constitute the main soils and land uses in the Cantareira System region. Representative soil samples were collected at 0–5 and 30–35 cm depth and analyzed for several soil physical quality indicators, which were used to calculate a Soil Physical Quality Index based on soil functions. Converting the native forest to eucalyptus and pasture reduced the overall soil physical quality and water recharge potential. The groundwater recharge potential function in the topsoil has the highest score of 0.72 for Typic Dystrudept in native forest contrasting with 0.16 for extensive pasture. Typic Dystrudept obtained the highest value of the SPQI value (0–5 cm: 0.85; 30–35 cm: 0.90) for native forests when compared to Typic Hapludult (0–5 cm: 0.76; 30–35 cm: 0.57) and Typic Usthortent (0–5 cm: 0.75; 30–35 cm: 0.72).

The coffee plants were intercropped with three forest species: i) Brazilian firetree (Schizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum), ii) Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa), and iii) teak (Tectona grandis). The treatments used in each experiment were four plant densities of plants: zero (coffee plants only, in full sun), 111 plants ha−1 (10 × 9 m), 222 plants ha−1 (10 × 4.5 m), and 444 plants ha−1 (5 × 4.5 m). The experiments were conducted in a split-plot arrangement, with plots consisting of plant densities and subplots consisting of harvest periods (crop seasons). The experimental design was completely randomized, with nine replications. The part of the plot used for data collection consisted of one planted row with 12 coffee plants. The average and accumulated productivities of coffe plants were evaluated over five harvests (2017-2021). Afforestation of the coffee field with Brazilian firetree plants reduces the mean yield and cumulative yield of C. canephora ‘Conilon’ in the first five commercial crop years. Brazil nut and teak planted at densities of up to 222 trees per hectare did not lead to a reduction in the mean and cumulative yield of coffee plants. © 2024 Universidade Estadual de Londrina.

Poor management practises regarding peatlands can lead to land degradation, and peatland degradation typically has negative effects. Recent tropical peatland research in Indonesia has predominantly revolved around the examination of the ecological consequences resulting from various management approaches. There is little study on farmers' agroforestry efforts to preserve and restore degraded peatlands. A comprehensive examination was undertaken to assess a range of facts, information, and scholarly articles pertaining to the practise of agroforestry on peatlands in Indonesia. The primary incentive for farmers to adopt agroforestry systems originates from their recognition of the impending scarcity of trees. By integrating intercrops with cultivated trees, farmers anticipate generating adequate money to fulfil their family's economic requirements. Farmers who choose intensive intercropping practises are motivated by market demand, whereas farmers who do not adopt this approach tend to favour crops that necessitate less rigorous management. The provision of governmental assistance holds significant importance, and there is a pressing need for additional guidance and support. The potential for rehabilitating degraded peatlands by the implementation of agroforestry practises of native tree species is considerable. Their growth patterns contribute to enhanced vegetative coverage, resulting in heightened moisture levels, reduced temperatures, diminished fire hazards, and improved peat soil quality. The relationship between the physiography of the land and the depth of the peat is directly associated with the patterns and components of agroforestry in peatland environments. © 2024 The Author(s).",degraded peat and fire and local communities and restoration,10.15243/jdmlm.2024.112.5453,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182573747&doi=10.15243%2fjdmlm.2024.112.5453&partnerID=40&md5=8d544a7ace611f64ccb013793f531864,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 5,NA,JOUR,2,5453,5474,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1308

However, in order to achieve broad implementation, it is essential to bridge the existing knowledge gap concerning the economic and environmental benefits associated with it. The aim of this study was to assess the four primary services rendered by the Blanakan mangrove silvofishery area in Subang District, West Java: carbon sequestration, fisheries productivity, naturebased tourism, and bird sanctuary. METHODS: Carbon storage was calculated by conducting vegetation surveys and utilizing allometric equations, which took into account both aboveground and belowground biomass. During the vegetation survey, data regarding the types of mangrove plants and the diameter of each tree at breast height was gathered. To quantify fisheries production, interviews were conducted with area managers and pond farmers who are engaged in silvofishery practices within the region. The pointcount method was used to inventory the diversity of bird species. The analysis of natural tourism services encompassed an examination of visitor statistics, the state of the mangroves as a popular tourist destination, and the range of tourist activities available. FINDINGS: The study revealed the high capacity of the mangrove stands at the study location for carbon storage, with an estimated 137.9 tonnes carbon per hectare aboveground and 79 tonnes carbon per hectare belowground. Local communities actively engage in silvofishery practices within the Blanakan mangroves, cultivating fish and shrimp, with an average annual income of around 1,513 United States dollar per hectare. 2. The natural beauty of the Blanakan mangrove area attracts tourists with its diverse ecosystem and opportunities to see crocodile breeding facilities. Visitor numbers vary, averaging around 128 people per month until mid-2023. The Blanakan mangroves are home to a total of 23 bird species, contributing to a species diversity index of 2.1. Two species with significant conservation value were found: the critically endangered Javan Blue-banded Kingfisher (Alcedo euryzona) and the vulnerable Black-capped Kingfisher (Halcyon pileata). CONCLUSION: The results emphasize the importance of advancing and advocating for silvofishery as a primary alternative in Indonesia’s mangrove conservation and rehabilitation initiatives, enhancing coastal environmental management. Community engagement is of utmost importance in the successful development of mangrove silvofishery, as it aims to tackle the issue of limited awareness and participation among the local community. © (2024), All Rights Reserved.",Carbon storage and Climate regulation and Coastal management and Mangrove restoration and Indonesia and aboveground biomass and belowground biomass and carbon sequestration and carbon storage and coastal zone management and conservation management and ecosystem service and endangered species and environmental restoration and fishery management and local participation and mangrove and participatory approach and quantitative analysis and restoration ecology and silviculture and species diversity and species inventory and sustainable forestry,10.22034/gjesm.2024.03.23,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195485290&doi=10.22034%2fgjesm.2024.03.23&partnerID=40&md5=b0a3321bba305cd3df5274b844b60a2c,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 4,NA,JOUR,3,1333,1344,NA,NA,2383-3572 and 2383-3866,WOS:001234304300022,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1309, 4232"

Carbon credits are calculated in advance based on the number of planted trees or, at best, the expected size and wood density of planted trees. However, the contribution of tropical reforestations with native species for carbon sequestration in the long term is still unclear, since most sites being monitored are less than 20 years old, thus limiting the ability to make forecasts of what is a dynamic, multifactor restoration outcome. We used a chronosequence to analyze aboveground biomass (AGB) accumulation in 30 Brazilian semi-deciduous seasonal Atlantic Forest restoration sites sharing the same climate, soil type, and restoration technique. We evaluated the entire age range of 1–19 years, and three age intervals, 1–3 years, 4–8 years, and over 9 years. AGB, basal area, and tree density increased considering all ages (1–19 years). Our results showed, however, that the AGB, tree density, and basal area can increase linearly from 1 to 3 years but present no significant trend after 4 years. Adjusted model r2 values decreased with time, suggesting that the controlled effects of active restoration are quickly replaced by other natural, uncontrolled, and, to some extent, unknown factors. Although continued efforts are needed to make more realistic predictions of long-term carbon stocks based on tree planting, high levels of biomass estimates for time intervals as short as 20 years may never be achieved. © 2023 Society for Ecological Restoration.",active forest restoration and carbon sequestration and chronosequence and native species and reforestation and Brazil and aboveground biomass and carbon sequestration and chronosequence and deciduous forest and environmental management and reforestation and restoration ecology,10.1111/rec.14005,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169676021&doi=10.1111%2frec.14005&partnerID=40&md5=225285e839574216df7655b2c1fcd750,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,JOUR,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1310

In recent years, there have been changes in the land cover of converted and degraded mangrove forests which have resulted in the release of carbon and an imbalance in soil structure, which in turn cause a flux of CO2 into the atmosphere. This research was conducted at the Karang Gading and Langkat Timur Laut Wildlife Reserve (KGLTLWR) in North Sumatra, Indonesia. The study focused on six different land covers, namely natural forests, restoration, mixed agriculture, paddy fields, oil palm plantation, and ponds. This study aimed to measure the total carbon stock of mangrove forests that have been converted to other land covers and estimate the level of CO2 flux in the area. A total of three transects and six plots for each land cover were used in this study; for tree biomass, a non-destructive method was used by recording every DBH > 5 cm, and for soil carbon, drilling was carried out, which was divided into five depths in each plot. CO2 flux was measured using an Eosense Eosgp CO2 sensor with the static closed chamber method. The highest carbon stock was found at 308.09 Mg ha−1 in natural forest, while the lowest 3.22 Mg ha−1 was found in mixed agriculture. The highest soil carbon was found at 423.59 MgC ha−1 in natural forest, while the lowest 50.44 MgC ha−1 was found in mixed agriculture dry land. The highest average CO2 flux value of 1362.24 mgCO2 m2 h−1 was found in mangrove restoration and the lowest in ponds was 123.03 mgCO2 m2 h−1. Overall, the research results inform how much carbon stock is lost when converted to other land covers so that it can be used as a reference for policy makers to provide future management of mangrove forests and develop mitigation measurements to reduce carbon emissions. © 2023 by the authors.",carbon stock and climate change and CO<sub>2</sub> flux and policy makers and restoration and Indonesia and North Sumatra and carbon flux and carbon sequestration and climate change and environmental restoration and land cover and mangrove and nature reserve and policy making and soil carbon,10.3390/su152115196,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185854565&doi=10.3390%2fsu152115196&partnerID=40&md5=c021a0f2488c4ad2b82e9e63528ad0df,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 5,NA,JOUR,21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1313

Resilience to extreme shocks may increase with system diversity, enhancing food and income security and ecosystem services provision; however, the longer term effects of volcanic ash are rarely assessed. To test the hypothesis that tree diversity contributes to the social–ecological resilience of coffee-based agroforestry, we quantified (1) the immediate effects of deposition of a 15-cm ash layer on tree survival, (2) the effect of volcanic ash on aboveground C stocks, tree diversity and wood density frequencies, (3) litter layer dynamics, and (4) farming system and income recovery 3 years after. Observations in four land-use systems before and after ash deposition (remnant forest, coffee-based complex and simple agroforestry, annual crops) were complemented by 46 farmer interviews on tree species’ survival, system, and financial recovery. Based on farmer interviews, low-wood-density trees were most affected by volcanic ash deposition. Ash deposition did not, after 3 years and across land-use systems, significantly change tree density, basal area, or C stocks. In contrast, species richness in coffee-based agroforestry increased significantly. Standing litter stocks in agroforestry decreased, but slower decomposition partially compensated for reduced litter input. Farmers stated that diversity and flexibility in coffee-based agroforestry support a system recovery that is faster than that for annual crops, suppressing income fluctuation. Farmer’s adaptive responses to enhance species diversity contributed to the resilience of farms, by retaining basic system structure and functions of agroforestry, and increasing product diversity and income.

One of the options to mitigate the recurring effects of land use changes is the adoption of wildlife-friendly systems, such as cacao agroforestry systems, which integrates production with biodiversity conservation. Cacao management involves the frequent use of pesticides, such pesticides are comprised of heavy metals that are considered non-point sources of pollution. Animal hair is considered an excellent cumulative bioindicator of contamination. Small mammals are known as bioindicators of pollution, as they provide a warning of adverse effects on ecosystems. The main objective was to determine the concentrations of six heavy metals (Pb, Ni, Cr, Cd, Mn, and Cu) in hair of small mammals in traditional cacao agroforests and Atlantic Forest fragments in the southern region of Bahia, Brazil. The study covered 12 traditional cacao agroforests and 12 Atlantic Forest fragments. A total of 34 small mammals were captured in the traditional cacao agroforests, representing 12 species, while 18 were captured in the Atlantic Forest fragments, representing 6 species. We found that small mammals in both habitats had similar levels of lead in their hair. Heavy metals concentrations in the hair of small mammals were higher in individuals from traditional cacao agroforests than the Atlantic Forest fragments (Cacao agroforest (mg/Kg): Pb - 26.42 ± 16.42; Ni - 5.31 ± 4.3; Mn - 1.64 ± 2.63; Cu - 1.13 ± 1.15; Cd - 1.42; Atlantic Forest (mg/Kg): Pb - 19.28 ± 14.46; Ni - 0.18; Mn - 0.34 ± 0.40; Cu - 1 ± 2.05). Marsupials exhibited higher lead concentrations compared to rodents (Didelphimorphia (mg/Kg): Pb - 28.66 ± 18.73; Rodentia (mg/Kg): Pb - 18.44 ± 9.85), likely due to their distinct eating habits and habitat use. Body condition of the small mammals did not differ between the two habitat types, and there was no relationship between the bioaccumulation of heavy metals in small mammals and body condition. This is the first study to evaluate heavy metal contamination in small mammals in traditional cacao agroforests and Atlantic Forest fragments, thus providing important data that indicate the presence of heavy metals in the hair of the small mammals sampled, and consequently, the presence of these heavy metals in the environment where these small mammals lived. © 2023 The Authors",Agroforestry system and Cacao and Marsupials and Rodents and Trace element exposure and Wildlife ecotoxicology,10.1016/j.gecco.2023.e02620,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171660519&doi=10.1016%2fj.gecco.2023.e02620&partnerID=40&md5=24b2d5d83a14d2a34fa43997d5f95037,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 4,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,OCT,2351-9894,WOS:001072558200001,SEP 2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1319, 4999"

To assess the potential of forage-based livestock systems to offset greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the net carbon (C) balance of four systems in the Brazilian Amazon Biome was estimated: livestock (L) with a monoculture of Marandu palisade grass [Brachiaria brizantha (Hochst. ex A. Rich.) R. D. Webster]; livestock-forestry (LF) with palisade grass intercropped with three rows of eucalyptus at 128 trees/ha; crop-livestock (CL) with soybeans and then corn + palisade grass, rotated with livestock every two years; and crop-livestock-forestry (CLF) with CL + one row of eucalyptus at 72 trees/ha. Over the four years studied, the systems with crops (CL and CLF) produced more human-edible protein than those without them (L and LF) (3010 vs. 755 kg/ha). Methane contributed the most to total GHG emissions: a mean of 85 % for L and LF and 67 % for CL and CLF. Consequently, L and LF had greater total GHG emissions (mean of 30 Mg CO2eq/ha/year). Over the four years, the system with the most negative net C balance (i.e., C storage) was LF when expressed per ha (−53.3 Mg CO2eq/ha), CLF when expressed per kg of carcass (−26 kg CO2eq/kg carcass), and LF when expressed per kg of human-edible protein (−72 kg CO2eq/kg human-edible protein). Even the L system can store C if well managed, leading to benefits such as increased meat as well as improved soil quality. Moreover, including crops and forestry in these livestock systems enhances these benefits, emphasizing the potential of integrated systems to offset GHG emissions. © 2023 The Authors","Agroecology and Agroforestry and Climate change and Ecosystem services and Grazing and Ruminants and Agriculture and Animals and Crops, Agricultural and Ecosystem and Forestry and Greenhouse Gases and Humans and Livestock and Trees and Amazonas [Brazil] and Brazil and Crops and Ecosystems and Environmental impact and Forestry and Gas emissions and Greenhouse gases and Mammals and Proteins and Sustainable development and Timber and carbon and magnesium and methane and nitrogen and Agro ecologies and Agroforestry and Brazilian Amazon and Ecosystem services and Food demand and Grazing and Greenhouse gas emissions and Livestock systems and Ruminant and World population and agroecology and agroforestry and carbon emission and climate change and ecosystem service and forage and grazing and greenhouse gas and mixed farming and ruminant and sustainability and Amazonas (Brazil) and Article and biome and Brachiaria and Brachiaria brizantha and carbon balance and carbon footprint and carbon sequestration and carbon storage and carcass and controlled study and crop production and environmental mitigation and environmental sustainability and Eucalyptus and fermentation technique and forage and forestry and grain and greenhouse gas emission and human and livestock and maize and manure and meat industry and monoculture and nonhuman and soil quality and soybean and agriculture and animal and crop and ecosystem and forestry and greenhouse gas and livestock and tree and Climate change",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167396,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173416065&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.167396&partnerID=40&md5=80e39a5ef11e5c3a9bb830b24eb347b1,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 23,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,JAN 1,0048-9697 and 1879-1026,WOS:001099271200001,OCT 2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1326, 4920"

Therefore, an analysis of the dynamics of land forest cover, carbon stocks of secondary karst forests, and their future projections is necessary. This study aimed to analyze the carbon stocks of secondary forests, forest cover change, and their projections in karst areas. We used 43 sample plots of 20 m x 20 m to measure Above Ground Biomass (AGB) and soil organic carbon stocks. Forest cover data were collected using remote sensing and GIS tools. Data analysis of the ABG of the secondary forest for the karst plain and karst tower was conducted using the Chave equation. Land-cover change was analyzed by delineating the 2011, 2016, and 2021 land-cover data from satellite imagery and testing the accuracy using survey data fields and high-resolution images. Land-cover projections for 2026 and 2031 were obtained using Cellular Automata Markov (CA-Markov) analysis. The results revealed ten land cover types in the karst area of the Bulusaraung Forest Management Unit (FMU). Secondary dryland karst forests (tower and plain karst) were the dominant forest types (60%) in the Maros-Pangkep essential karst ecosystem area. Both karst types of secondary forests are relatively high carbon stores. Data projection shows that the mining area will grow extensively by 2031. Secondary dryland karst forests will be degraded by 15.5% in 20 years due to increased mining activities, conversion to paddy fields, dryland agriculture, and mixed dryland agriculture. Karst ecosystems are vital for carbon and water storage. Therefore, some strategies are required for the sustainable management of Maros-Pangkep Karst are as follows: (i) controlling the opening of mining areas according to sustainable environmental principles, (ii) encouraging the implementation of post-mining land rehabilitation, (iii) increasing public awareness of the importance of preserving karst areas, and (iv) implementing soil conservation rules by prioritizing agroforestry systems in dryland farming. © 2024 The Author(s).

We collected available information in literature on CAPES Portal and Google Scholar (May/2021 to February/2022) for Pinheiral municipality, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which were evaluated by multivariate analysis. Accumulated litter biomass, nutrient content (N, P, K) in total litterfall, pH and P availability in topsoil, leaf litter decomposition constant, and half-life time of leaf litter were the most sensitive attributes to indicate the successional stage in the study area, according to Principal Component Analysis. This multivariate analysis indicated that areas in early successional stage were associated with higher values of leaves contribution, half-life of leaf litterfall, contents of Ca and K in total litterfall, whereas areas in middle successional stage were associated with higher values of pH, total organic carbon, exchangeable Ca2+, K+, and Mg+, sum of bases and cation exchange capacity, and lower values of extractable acidity and exchangeable Al3+ in the topsoil. Areas in advanced stages of succession were associated to higher values of total litterfall and its nutrient content (N, K, Mg), accumulated litter biomass, available P in topsoil, and leaf litter decomposition constant.

In the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, restoration plantations often lack diversity, prompting inquiries into the optimal species count for maximal ecosystem productivity and services. This study aimed to assess aboveground carbon storage in a high-diversity restoration, comparing carbon stocks across 70 native tree species. We examined differences in carbon storage among species groups, employed regression models to project carbon accumulation over time, and identified top-performing species for carbon-focused projects in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Our high-diversity plantation, comprising 70 species, stored 46.04 MgC ha−1 at 8.5 years. The simulation revealed that planting only the most effective species could more than double carbon storage to 114.82 MgC ha−1 at the same age. Notably, filling group species consistently stored more carbon than diversity group species across all ages. We pinpointed seven top-performing filling group species: Guazuma ulmifolia, Croton urucurana, Mimosa scabrella, Trema micrantha, Solanum mauritianum, Croton floribundus, and Piptadenia gonoacantha and six from the diversity group: Inga vera, Zanthoxylum rhoifolium, Peltophorum dubium, Ceiba speciosa, Albizia polycephala, and Ficus enormis, for their superior carbon storage. Prioritizing these species can heighten carbon sequestration rates and effectively address the ongoing climate crisis. An approach combining selected filling and diversity group species emerges as the optimal strategy to achieve short- and long-term goals. Further research on species interactions and carbon stocks in scenarios with fewer planted species is imperative. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Carbon stocks and Climate change and Diversity group species and Filling group species and Functional groups and Reforestation,10.1007/s10113-023-02141-z,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85175804373&doi=10.1007%2fs10113-023-02141-z&partnerID=40&md5=c20e63c4a20aba151b41a9af6a02217e,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 1,NA,JOUR,4,NA,NA,NA,DEC,1436-3798 and 1436-378X,WOS:001100929600003,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1330, 5106"

However, the management of coffee-pine agroforestry systems can significantly impact on soil water dynamics, affecting coffee bean yields. This study investigated the effects of different management systems on soil water dynamics and coffee bean yields in a coffee-pine agroforestry system in UB Forest, Malang East Java, Indonesia. Five different management systems were evaluated: (i) no management, (ii) pruned coffee with no fertilizer, (iii) pruned coffee with added organic fertilizer, (iv) pruned coffee with added organic-inorganic mix fertilizer, with a planting distance of pine trees of 3 x 2 m, and (v) pruned coffee with added organic-inorganic mix fertilizer under pine trees with a planting distance of 6 x 2 m. The soil water dynamics were measured at depths of 0-0.2 m with a soil moisture sensor and connected with a data logger measured within a year, started in April 2022. Coffee bean yield was measured with 100 coffee plants, then converted to production on ton ha-1. The results showed that the different management systems significantly impacted soil water dynamics and coffee bean yields. The combination of pruning and fertilization is a promising management strategy for increasing coffee bean yields in coffee-pine agroforestry systems. The consequent better growth of coffee plants impacts increasing soil water extraction. This study provides valuable insights for farmers and forest managers who are interested in improving the productivity of coffee-pine agroforestry systems and conserving soil water or sometimes needing water addition through irrigation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Agroforestry and coffee cultivation and coffee yields and forest management and water dynamics,10.1088/1755-1315/1299/1/012009,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188212428&doi=10.1088%2f1755-1315%2f1299%2f1%2f012009&partnerID=40&md5=225f2fad848e7b2be042ef5857a354c5,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,CONF,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1331

Habitat degradation and fragmentation can drive orangutans to move on to agroforestry plantations and into conflict with farmers. This research examines farmers’ awareness of the roles that Tapanuli orangutans play, their attitudes towards orangutans when they come on their land and the broader political-economic factors which influence interactions between smallholders and orangutans. Methods: We used a mixed methods approach of quantitative surveys with 275 farmers and qualitative in-depth interviews with 22 key informants from 11 villages on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia. Results: We found that while many farmers had negative encounters with orangutans eating their crops, their responses differed. Some tolerated the orangutans; others chased them away. The difference stemmed from cultural beliefs about orangutans and their relationship to humans. Some communities hold them as neighbours, others fear them, but in both cases would not harm them. Most farmers do not perceive them as significant threats but as hunger-driven neighbours. Rather than blaming the orang-utans per se, they argue that habitat loss caused by expanding extractive activities is the driving factor of this conflict. They want to see limits on the expansion of extractive industry, alternative income sources and compensation for their orangutan losses. Conclusion: The study concludes by highlighting five aspects that need consideration for reducing human-orangutan conflicts and with a broader discussion on the need to include the socio-cultural context of the human populations in conservation initiatives. Implications for Conservation: The study underscores the imperative of integrating local farmers’ perspectives in conserving critically endangered Tapanuli orangutans. It advocates coexistence through crop loss mitigation, deforestation prevention, and compensation strategies, emphasizing the need for holistic, sustainable conservation measures encompassing ecological, social, and economic facets within the region. © The Author(s) 2024.",ecosystem services and forest conservation and human-orangutan conflict and smallholder farmer and Tapanuli orangutans,10.1177/19400829241226932,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182644384&doi=10.1177%2f19400829241226932&partnerID=40&md5=892accb679a61feef16ec7b699938ed2,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 2,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,JAN,1940-0829,WOS:001144653800001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1333, 4907"

In this chapter, we analyse the current contribution of the protected area to conservation of grasslands, discuss the role - and implementation problems - of Legal Reserves and Areas of Permanent Protection, as well as the need for adequate grassland management. Only 5% of the total area of southern Brazil is currently in protected areas, with biases in terms of spatial distribution and type of ecosystem protected: grasslands are under-represented. The Legal Reserve could be an interesting instrument to complement the protected area networks, but implementation at the moment is insufficient and there have been attempts to undermine the instrument in favour of agricultural expansion. Besides implementation of Legal Reserve and expanding the network of protected areas, it is important that grassland areas are properly managed, as they are disturbance-dependent ecosystems. Grazing, fire and mowing can be used in active management, depending on the ecological and socioeconomic context of a specific site, and creation of spatial and temporal heterogeneity seems especially interesting from a conservation perspective. We conclude that the role of grassland conservation for safeguarding essential ecosystem services should be further explored in future studies to advance in conservation. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

Nevertheless, the extensive adverse effects from atmospheric pollution are mainly experienced by communities and people in lower- and middle-income countries, such as the medium- and large-sized cities in Latin America including the coastal city of Guaruja in Brazil. Urban forests, as integral parts of the city landscape, play a crucial role in mitigating air pollution and should therefore be considered in environmental policies. This study aimed to evaluate the spatiotemporal concentrations of air pollutants using the biological monitoring method with Tillandsia usneoides L. to highlight the capacity of urban forests to act as nature-based solutions (NbS) in improving air quality and providing other ecosystem services. Based on the quantification of chemical indicators of vehicle emissions, scientifically recognized as traffic-related elements (TREs) such as cadmium (Cd), Copper (Cu) and lead (Pb) in the biomonitoring samples, the results showed spatiotemporal variations in their concentrations. This finding demonstrates that urban fragments in the low-income settlement of the city exhibited higher values for TREs during the wet season. Cu values were the highest during the wet season in all study areas, underscoring the intensity of the light vehicle fleet. Forest fragments attenuated air pollution, highlighting their importance as features of environmental planning. The identification of atmospheric pollution hotspots in the territory guided the strategic implementation of NbS through tree planting, thus promoting a healthier environment with greater mitigation potential. This study is the first in Brazil to explore the spatiotemporal relationship between air pollution and urban forests in highly dense and low-income settlements providing quantitative indicators toward the benefits of NbS. © 2023 The Author(s)",Air quality and Biological monitoring and Environmental policies and Urban forestry and Urban green areas and Brazil and Guaruja and Latin America and Sao Paulo [Brazil] and Atmospheric chemistry and Ecosystems and Fleet operations and Indicators (chemical) and Public policy and Reforestation and Tropics and Atmospheric pollution and Biological monitoring and Environmental policy and Low incomes and Policy implications and Traffic-related elements and Urban forestry and Urban forests and Urban green area and Wet season and air quality and atmospheric pollution and biomonitoring and greenspace and urban forestry and Air quality,10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111386,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183680156&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolind.2023.111386&partnerID=40&md5=3640561a1382e8206148300ab34aebb2,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 12,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1339

Our goal was to evaluate the impact of no-till (NT) in association with ICLS on soil health and soybean yield in Inceptisol and Oxisol soils in Southern Brazil. The response of physical, chemical, and biological soil health indicators to soil and crop management systems was measured over the short- (<5 years) and long-term (>10 years) under ICLS with soybean in spring/summer and forage grazed by cattle in the autumn/winter. A soil management index was calculated for each soil based on ICLS management. Independent of soil type, ICLS in association with NT for 10+ years improved chemical and biological properties in the near soil surface (0–6 cm depth). The Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) scores for soil organic carbon (SOC), phosphorus (P), and bulk density were close to 1.0 in the Inceptisol, independent of management or soil depth, while the pH scores were lower in the ICLS topsoil. For the Oxisol, the SMAF scores for SOC and P were approximately 1.0 in the 0–6 cm depth under long-term ICLS. The SMAF overall soil quality index was high (approximately 0.9) for both soils and there were no significant differences between management practices. Overall, the adoption of ICLS in association with NT (i) improved or maintained soil health, (ii) promoted soil carbon sequestration, and (iii) increased soybean yield in the studied soils. This study confirmed the potential for conservation practices (ICLS combined with NT) to improve soil quality with environmental sustainability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Crop-livestock system and No-tillage and Soil health indicators and Brazil and Agronomy and Indicators (chemical) and Organic carbon and Soil conservation and Soils and Sustainable development and Tropics and Chemical and biologicals and Crop-livestock system and Inceptisols and Livestock systems and No tillage and No-till and Soil health and Soil health indicators and Soil management assessment frameworks and Soil organic carbon and agricultural land and agricultural practice and bulk density and crop plant and crop yield and mixed farming and soil carbon and soil quality and soil surface and subtropical region and zero tillage and Crops,10.1016/j.still.2023.105835,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85166480375&doi=10.1016%2fj.still.2023.105835&partnerID=40&md5=f273485c49c17fbd4d883455d1f8c177,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 9,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,OCT,0167-1987 and 1879-3444,WOS:001082174000001,AUG 2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1340, 5251"

Based on a literature review, we analyzed these two forms of security related to smallholder agroforestry practices. Findings indicate diverse agroforestry systems, with 88% focusing on non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and 12% on timber. While 42% prioritize direct food supply, 58% emphasize income generation through product sales. However, agroforestry that does not produce food for direct consumption by smallholders generates revenue for purchasing food necessities. Agroforestry supports both food needs (46–61%) and income (51–54%) for smallholders, surpassing traditional agriculture (13%). Semi-commercial agroforestry (57%) is a predominant livelihood prospect. The remaining 27% are purely subsistence, and 15% are purely commercial. However, the commercialization of agroforestry that focuses only on high-value commodities results in a negative impact on biodiversity. There is a concomitant decrease in environmental services for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Biodiversity remains crucial for climate resilience, health care, and food security in rural communities. Semi-commercial agroforestry is a midpoint for achieving multifunctional agriculture (biodiversity, soil and water conservation, food security, and income) in the climate change era.

One way to assess the recovery of these areas is using bioindicators. This research tested the use of the drosophilid community structure as an indicator to evaluate post-mining area restoration. We compared two regeneration techniques within the same chronological sequence and as reference used the forest remnants within the exploration area. The study was conducted in the municipality of Paragominas—Pará, in areas managed by Hydro mining company. Five sites of forest remnants were selected, five in natural regeneration and five in the nucleation technique, the latter two making up the PRADs. A total of 5,919 male drosophilids were collected belonging to 10 genera, and 32 species. Rarefaction showed the curves of the PRADs to be more asymptotic, than forested areas. Forest areas are potentially richer and, on average, have lower abundances and lower diversity. Beta diversity components in the forest present greater turnover and less nestedness processes when compared to PRADs areas. The PRADs showed no differences between them for any of the analyzed patterns. D. nasuta and D. sturtevanti behaved as generalists in relation to habitats, D. paulistorum and D. willistoni as forest specialists. D. malerkotliana, D. simulans, Scaptodrosophila latifasciaeformis, and Zaprionus indianus behaved as specialists in PRADs areas.

Theoretical framework: Histosols are soils that provide ecosystem services, especially carbon stocks. Among the environments in which these soils are formed, peatlands stand out. The conversion of these areas into agricultural systems requires soil drainage. This practice causes reductions in carbon content and changes in the structure of the SOM. Methodology: The study was conducted in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The soils were classified as Histosols. Three areas were selected: a) cassava (Manihot esculenta) cultivation for 80 years; b) forest fragment for 20 years; c) consortium of coconut palm (Cocos nucifera) and cassava for 20 years. Total organic carbon (TOC); particulate organic carbon (COP); organic carbon associated with minerals (COam); fulvic acid fraction carbon (CAF); humic acid fraction carbon (CAH) and; humin fraction carbon (CHUM) were determined. Solid-state spectroscopy (UV-vis, ATR-FTIR and 13C NMR CP/MAS) was carried out to characterize the structure of the SOM. Results and conclusion: The results showed that management and drainage have an impact on the TOC content, fractions and chemical structure of the SOM. The management adopted in the cassava area had an impact on the labile and humified fractions of the SOM. Spectroscopy showed that labile structures were lost in the humic acids (HA), while in the forest area only recalcitrant structures were preserved. Research implications: The conversion of Histosols to agricultural production using the drainage technique promotes quantitative and qualitative changes in SOM in the long term. In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is necessary to use techniques that promote carbon stocks in the soil. Originality/value: This study uses spectroscopic and chemometric techniques to highlight the effects of long-term soil management on the chemical structure of the SOM and to quantify the total carbon content and SOM fractions. © 2024 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

Analyses revealed a segregation of bird composition with a gradual increasing in forest dependent species from 7 years to mature forest. Detrended Correspondence Analysis ranged from those birds often present in semi-open habitats to forest birds, canopy frugivorous and understory insectivorous as the successional stages progressed from the most recent reforestation to the most mature. Although 7 and 10 years of reforestation had the largest composition range, the more generalist, granivorous and forest independent birds, three years were enough to have different bird diversity between them. Avifauna of 15 years patches resembled most closely that of mature forest but still lacked 18 species. In this way, we addressed: 1) planting of herbaceous/shrub and freshy-fruited species in reforestations and; 2) establish riparian forest corridors along the Paraná river to connect these reforestation patches with mature forest.

In this study, we focused on a tropical-subtropical river basin which covers urban, peri-urban and rural landscape types of a Brazilian municipality located in the ecotone between the Atlantic Forest and the Cerrado (Brazilian savannah). The research aimed to assess the current state of ES and bird richness (as a biodiversity indicator) and their relationships across an urban-rural-natural gradient. We assessed the cooling effect (as microclimate regulation indicator), air pollutant removal (PM10), nature-based recreation opportunities and bird richness and analysed the variations associated with a shift in the prevailing land-cover types along a gradient of urbaniszation. The results indicated a higher bird richness in periurban and rural landscapes, as well as greater pollutant removal and cooling effect provided by vegetation. However, recreation opportunities provided mainly by human infrastructure were higher inside the urban zone and in some peri-urban areas. The landscape type significantly influenced the availability and intensity of these four variables (p < 0.001). Bird richness, air pollutant removal, and cooling effect were positively correlated (r > 0.539; p ≤ 0.048);, however, a trade-off between them and recreation opportunities (r =-0.59, R2 = 0.348, p < 0.001) was found. We simulated possible scenarios of reforestation actions in urban areas to predict the ES values when vegetation cover area is increased. According to the results, the urban planning and efforts to improve nNature-based solutions in the studied river basin should consider the observed trade-off to promote sustainable nature-based recreation opportunities in places with higher values of ES (cooling effect, air pollutant removal, and bird richness) and/or to increase the ES values in urban landscape through environmental policies, such as reforestation. © Lessi B et al.",Air pollutant removal and cooling effect and nature-based solutions and recreation opportunities and trade-off and urban planning,10.3897/oneeco.9.e114955,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184424954&doi=10.3897%2foneeco.9.e114955&partnerID=40&md5=72ce2c88e4f830b2b9339ada7c928998,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 1,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,JAN 30,2367-8194,WOS:001223391100001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1356, 4975"

However, most studies including the international “4 per 1000″ Initiative focus on topsoil C only. Here, we studied the response of deep soil C to different land restoration approaches. Samples were taken from rural sites in the Atlantic Forest Biome (Brazil), using a paired site design with triplicates of different 16-to-19-year-old restoration approaches of former arable land: reforestation, natural regeneration, and agroforestry sites. Adjacent arable land and a > 25-year-old secondary forest served as references. We determined aboveground and belowground C pools, including deep soil until 3 m depth. We did not find statistical differences among the three restoration methods for the C sequestration in the whole ecosystem. However, the C stock in the aboveground living biomass in the reforestation site was 85 ± 15 Mg ha−1, significantly exceeding the respective aboveground C in natural regeneration (40 ± 13 Mg ha−1) and agroforestry system (25 ± 5 Mg ha−1), respectively. This order, however, was reversed in soil, where reforestation caused a loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) by 27 Mg ha−1 below 40 cm depth, whereas SOC stocks in the agroforestry system and natural regeneration site increased by 41 and 25 Mg C/ha, respectively, compared to arable land. We thus conclude that deep soil carbon losses can negate aboveground carbon accrual after land restoration, which emphasizes the importance of including this pool in C sequestration studies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Agroforestry and Carbon pools and Carbon sequestration and Deep soil carbon storage and Land restoration and Natural regeneration and Lakes and Land Use and Magnesium and Natural Reforestation and Restoration and Atlantic Forest and Brazil and Climate change and Lakes and Land use and Magnesium and Organic carbon and Reforestation and Soils and Agroforestry and Arable land and C sequestration and Carbon pool and Carbon sequestration and Deep soil carbon storage and Deep-soil carbon and Land restoration and Natural regeneration and Soil carbon storage and aboveground biomass and agroforestry and arable land and carbon storage and organic carbon and reforestation and secondary forest and soil carbon and Restoration,10.1016/j.foreco.2023.121403,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171779608&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2023.121403&partnerID=40&md5=d946f5a003dd0fd82d9059025eabfb42,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 5,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NOV 15,0378-1127 and 1872-7042,WOS:001083468100001,SEP 2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1365, 5136"

This ecosystem has traditionally been considered a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to its high rates of degradation and land use change for agriculture and plantation development. Estimates of the resulting emissions and their contribution to the global total, however, remain uncertain. Understanding the source and size of historical emissions from tropical peatlands is important for planning effective and efficient mitigation actions as well as assessing the potential impact of land management options on future emissions. Carbon accounting is the first prerequisite for measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) of mitigation and emission reduction actions. The availability of carbon accounting systems for tropical peatlands is important as part of efforts to reduce uncertainty in emission estimation by incorporating better data, improving methodologies, and thus increasing estimation accuracy, consistency, and data processing efficiency. The development of a carbon accounting system for reporting GHG emissions and removal in tropical peatlands requiresa combination ofdata(both remote sensing and ground-based observations) from various sources, and the use of anintegration framework wouldbeimportant for combining datatogenerateestimates for reporting GHG emissions/removal. The number of studies providing scientific information on emission factors and addressing a significant knowledge gap in the main parameters to improve the accuracy of emission estimation due to disturbance on tropical peatlands has increased. Efforts, from simple to complex approaches, have alsobeenimplemented todevelop carbonaccountingtools, combining emissions from peat forest/vegetation and emissions from peat soil.

This has led to extensive sand mining operations in the area, extending even to privately-owned agricultural lands. These mining activities have generated adverse environmental effects, such as the depletion of vegetation, and pose risks of soil erosion and biodiversity loss. This study aimed to assess the influence of implementing agroforestry as a resilience strategy by farmers on the sustainability of farming systems in response to land vulnerability on the slopes of Mount Semeru. A quantitative approach was employed, and the study site was purposively chosen in Bambang Village, Wajak Sub-District, Malang Regency. The research employed a survey methodology, incorporating observation and interviews with respondents to gather information on the implementation of agroforestry, resilience strategies, and sustainability indicators across ecological, economic, and socio-cultural aspects.

Bioenergy is foreseen as key option to meet future energy demands and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, however its sustainability depends on locations and regional characteristics. Simultaneously, agricultural production models that co-produce food, feed, and energy offer sustainability synergies and co-benefits, but site-specific sustainability assessments of their large-scale implementation are missing. This study presents a bottom-up approach to assess spatially explicit sustainability aspects of bioenergy-livestock integrated systems (BLI) in Brazil and shed light on their contribution to future energy demands, to climate change mitigation targets, and their impacts on selected ecosystem services, including bioenergy production, climate change mitigation, reduction of food competition, biodiversity conservation, and avoided deforestation. The proposed integration considers livestock intensification and use of biofuels by-products as animal feed supplement, taking advantage of synergies between these two value chains. The expansion of the BLI system in the Center-South region of Brazil produce up to 89 billion liters of ethanol, enough to meet future domestic ethanol demands from multiple shared socioeconomic pathways and generating surpluses for export. This production takes place on 16 million hectares of pastureland within the Sugarcane Agroecological Zoning, excluding the Amazon and Pantanal biomes, and biodiversity hotspots. BLI expansion mitigate up to 250 million tonnes of CO2eq and generate 15 billion dollars of profits. The best locations to maximize the selected ecosystem services are west of São Paulo, east of Mato Grosso do Sul, and the south-central region of the states of Goiás.

However, the conversion of these peatlands for agricultural purposes, such as oil palm plantations, leads to carbon loss and increased CO2 emissions. To effectively protect and manage vulnerable areas, accurate mapping of peatland thickness and carbon stocks is essential, aligning with Indonesia's National Determined Contribution to climate action. This research article aims to assess the status of peatland in Agam-West Pasaman, Western Sumatra, which was cleared between 1990 and 2000 for oil palm cultivation. Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) approaches were employed to map peat thickness, carbon stock and estimate carbon loss resulting from land use change. The study area, spanning 54,000 hectares, was covered by peat-swamp forest in 1989. A grid of 2 km was used for a soil survey, resulting in 134 observation points of peat thickness, water level and subsidence. Various spatial prediction methods, including geostatistics, machine learning (ML) and their combination, were tested to map peat thickness, carbon stocks, subsidence rate and carbon loss. The covariates considered in the analysis were elevation, nearest distance from rivers and Sentinel 1a radar images. The results obtained through 10-fold cross-validations revealed that ordinary kriging exhibited the best performance, with an R2 of 0.44 for peat thickness and 0.39 for carbon stocks. The superior performance of ordinary kriging can be attributed to the severe impact of human activities in the area, which disrupted the clear relationship between peat parameters and environmental covariates. The estimated carbon stock of the area was 107 Mt C (std. dev. 0.143 Mt), while the carbon loss since the establishment of oil palm plantations was estimated to be 19.50 Mt C (std. dev. 0.017 Mt C) based on subsidence data. These findings provide insights into the degradation of the peatland and the magnitude of carbon loss over the past three decades.

Findings from a livelihood assessment in Sumatra, Indonesia","Mires and Peat, MIRES AND PEAT",30,3,"In recent years, widespread peatland degradation has occurred in Indonesia as a result of both natural events and human activities. Although there is a strong push for restoration from national and international stakeholders, at the local level, farmers and communities are still widely managing peatlands with unsustainable practices including their conversion into agricultural land. To understand the causes of such a challenging situation, we carried out a survey to investigate the drivers of local livelihoods in the typical peatland village community of Kayu Labu in South Sumatra Province. Our findings showed that while the unsustainable practices adopted do not align with either the long-term interests of this community or the wider public interest, they do align with the best socioeconomic interests of the farmers. A preliminary examination of the livelihood options chosen illustrates the strong contrast between public and private interests. In particular, in local communities like Kayu Labu, the profit margins for oil palm and rubber are higher than those for sustainable alternatives. We conclude that, to address the problem of peatland degradation and to design successful and sustainable peatland restoration initiatives, decision-makers need to understand the local socioeconomic situation, people’s livelihoods, and their expectations. A key option is to increase the roles and responsibilities of local communities in determining the rules that relate to land management.

These animals have a wide range of feeding sources and contribute to several important soil functions and ecosystem services. Although many studies have assessed macroinvertebrate communities in Brazil, few of them have been published in journals and even fewer have made the data openly available for consultation and further use. As part of ongoing efforts to synthesise the global soil macrofauna communities and to increase the amount of openly-accessible data in GBIF and other repositories related to soil biodiversity, the present paper provides links to 29 soil macroinvertebrate datasets covering 42 soil fauna taxa, collected in various land-use systems in Brazil. A total of 83,085 georeferenced occurrences of these taxa are presented, based on quantitative estimates performed using a standardised sampling method commonly adopted worldwide to collect soil macrofauna populations, i.e. the TSBF (Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility Programme) protocol. This consists of digging soil monoliths of 25 x 25 cm area, with handsorting of the macroinvertebrates visible to the naked eye from the surface litter and from within the soil, typically in the upper 0–20 cm layer (but sometimes shallower, i.e. top 0–10 cm or deeper to 0–40 cm, depending on the site). The land-use systems included anthropogenic sites managed with agricultural systems (e.g. pastures, annual and perennial crops, agroforestry), as well as planted forests and native vegetation located mostly in the southern Brazilian State of Paraná (96 sites), with a few additional sites in the neighbouring states of São Paulo (21 sites) and Santa Catarina (five sites). Important metadata on soil properties, particularly soil chemical parameters (mainly pH, C, P, Ca, K, Mg, Al contents, exchangeable acidity, Cation Exchange Capacity, Base Saturation and, infrequently, total N), particle size distribution (mainly % sand, silt and clay) and, infrequently, soil moisture and bulk density, as well as on human management practices (land use and vegetation cover) are provided. These data will be particularly useful for those interested in estimating land-use change impacts on soil biodiversity and its implications for below-ground foodwebs, ecosystem functioning and ecosystem service delivery.

Soil chemical characterization was performed using solid-state 13 C CPMAS NMR. The conversion of pasture into cacao AFS did not impact the chemical composition of C. However, converting natural forest into cacao AFS provided differences in the composition of C compounds, mainly in macroaggregates. Notably, the young rubber tree was more prevalent in promoting changes in the chemical composition of C than cacao. The chemical composition of C in Cm density fractions did not vary across the land-use systems, and it was mostly represented by alkyl-C and O/N-alkyl-C forms.

South America, a region highly vulnerable to climate change, stands to benefit from implementing such strategies to reduce future risks and generate health co-benefits. This scoping review, aimed to assess the existing evidence on the health benefits of climate mitigation strategies in South American countries. PubMed, Web of Science, and LILACS databases were searched until June 15, 2023. Nine studies published between 2001 and 2021 were analyzed, focusing on Brazil, Chile, and Bolivia. All the studies identified in this review used scenario modeling. They evaluated various GHG emission mitigation strategies, including land management, reducing livestock production, biofuel production, increased active transportation, renewable energy, and waste reduction. Only one study looked at GHG capture and sequestration through afforestation. Given the limited information available, there is a pressing need for more research on the region's potential health, environmental, and economic co-benefits. This review serves as a starting point and suggests that climate mitigation can offer a range of positive co-benefits, such as improved air quality and increased resilience to climate impacts, thereby advancing public health initiatives.

However, agroforestry is an umbrella term for a large variety of systems and it is not clear how their degree of complexity influences their provision of soil-based ecosystem services, such as soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and nutrient cycling. Furthermore, a knowledge gap remains whether agroforestry systems perform equally well on all soil types. The objectives of this study were 1) to assess the links between agroforestry complexity, nutrient cycling and SOC fractions, and 2) to assess how soil texture influences these relationships in Brazilian agroforestry systems. We sampled 59 agroforestry plots across 30 sites in Sao Paulo state, Brazil, and 8 monocrop sites (6 pastures and 2 crop monocultures). The 38 sites represented a soil textural gradient, ranging from very sandy to very clayey (clay content range 25 – 620 g kg−1). An Agroforestry Complexity Index (ACI) was defined based on tree species richness, stem density and pruning management. Nutrient (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) and C contents were determined in litter and soil (0–30 cm depth) samples, and mineral-associated organic C (MAOC) and particulate organic C (POC) in soil samples were assessed as well. ACI was positively associated with C, N, P, Ca and Mg stocks in litter, and these litter nutrients were in turn positively associated with the corresponding soil nutrient stocks. Associations between soil nutrients and MAOC were stronger on sandy soils than on clayey soils, particularly for P, Ca and Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC). For POC, robust relationships with nutrients were only found on sandy soils. Structural Equation Models indicated causal relationships between agroforestry complexity, P and Ca cycling, and MAOC and POC stocks in topsoils. Our results indicate that nutrients effectively cycle from in situ mulch into plant-available soil pools and highlight the synergies between nutrient cycling and stable C stocks that can be achieved in complex agroforestry systems. These synergies seem to be particularly strong on sandy soils (<15 % clay). © 2023 The Authors",Agroforestry management and Diversity and Multistrata and Silvopastures and Soil fertility and Successional agroforestry and Brazil and Sao Paulo [Brazil] and Calcium and Climate change and Ecosystems and Magnesium and Organic carbon and Sand and Soils and Textures and Agroforestry and Agroforestry management and Agroforestry system and Diversity and Multistratum and Organics and Silvopasture and Soil fertility and Successional agroforestry and agroforestry and carbon storage and land degradation and nutrient cycling and organic carbon and soil carbon and soil fertility and soil nutrient and Nutrients,10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116726,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179703199&doi=10.1016%2fj.geoderma.2023.116726&partnerID=40&md5=305a30f6e30a13b5404a92a922cb5e17,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 11,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,DEC,0016-7061 and 1872-6259,WOS:001131478300001,NOV 2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1393, 3453"

Plant diversity on coffee agroforestry land in the buffer zone of Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park in East Java, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 25: 1030-1036. Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park (BTSNP) is facing threats to biodiversity due to land transfer functions and sand mining in rural areas. Land use conversion and sand mining in rural areas near BTSNP and Perhutani are threatening biodiversity through activities like land degradation, deforestation, forest depletion, and global climate change impacting local agriculture. Coffee farms in Poncokusumo and Wajak have been abandoned, leading to a decline in coffee farming and other agricultural commodities. Coffee-based agroforestry systems have been implemented to address this issue and improve soil fertility and vegetation diversity. This research aimed to identify and analyze plant diversity in coffee agroforestry land in BTNSP. The study was carried out in January-December 2022 in the village districts of Poncokusumo Sub-district (Sumberejo) and Wajak Sub-district of Malang District, which borders directly with BTSNP, collecting flora compositions and classifying them based on growth rate. The study identified 27 orders, 38 families, and 71 species of plants in the coffee fields. The presence of various plant species in the coffee fields contributes to the ecosystem's stability and the soil's quality.

However, a detailed analysis of such indicators in Brazilian soils is lacking. In this study, the activity of soil enzymes was evaluated using data from 73 publications covering 57 locations across all six biomes and eight soil orders out of the 13 that occur in Brazil. The results indicated a wide variation of enzymatic activity in soils, where the means in μg p-nitrophenol g−1 soil h−1 were 569, 116, 112, and 80 for acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, β-glucosidase, and arylsulfatase, respectively. Likewise, values of 148 μg reducing sugars g−1 soil day−1 for cellulase, 57 μg triphenyl tetrazolium formazan g−1 soil day−1 for dehydrogenase, and 38 μg N-NH4+ g−1 soil h−1 for urease were recorded. Soil organic matter and microbial biomass were the best attributes correlated with enzymatic activity, followed by clay content and pH. A more detailed analysis of the acid phosphatase, arylsulfatase, and β-glucosidase activities showed that land-use effects were more pronounced in the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado than in the Caatinga biome. Soils under non-tillage and integrated crop-livestock systems showed higher enzymatic activity than soils under conventional tillage. Soils housing higher biodiversity and delivering higher crop yields also presented higher enzymatic activity, especially in terms of arylsulfatase and β-glucosidase. Enzymatic activity has been shown to be a versatile indicator of soil quality, as it can elucidate how to achieve high-quality standards in tropical and subtropical soils. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Biological indicators and Integrated crop-livestock and Land use and Non-tillage system and Nutrient cycling and Soil quality,10.1016/j.apsoil.2023.105014,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162073091&doi=10.1016%2fj.apsoil.2023.105014&partnerID=40&md5=759003f7be651e2c7e51197f104efb2f,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 12,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,OCT,0929-1393 and 1873-0272,WOS:001026505400001,JUN 2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1395, 3553"

Within this context, forests emerge as crucial guardians of environmental equilibrium by actively absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide. This process serves as a strategic mitigation measure against the perils of global warming. This study aims to determine the inherent potential of biomass, carbon stock, and carbon sequestration within tree stands and poles existing within pine forests and agroforestry landscapes in Bategede Village, Jepara, Central Java, Indonesia. Additionally, the study undertakes a comparative assessment of the biomass, carbon stock, and carbon sequestration attributes between two distinct forest types: homogeneous pine forests and heterogeneous forests represented by agroforestry systems within Bategede Village. The study was conducted in March in Bategede Village, Nalumsari District. Data was collected through non-destructive methods, focusing on tree stands with a diameter (at breast height) exceeding 20 cm and poles with a diameter (at breast height) ranging from 10 to 20 cm. Robust biomass calculations were computed through predetermined allometric equations. The results of this study show that the biomass, carbon stock, and carbon sequestration were recorded at 407.83 tons/ha, 191.68 tons/ha, and 703.46 tons/ha, respectively, in pine forests. Meanwhile, the biomass, carbon stock, and carbon sequestration values recorded in agroforestry landscapes in Bategede Village were 120.64 tons/ha, 56.41 tons/ha, and 207.01 tons/ha, respectively. The comparative analysis revealed that homogeneous forests, particularly in the tree category, have carbon sequestration values that are sixfold greater than their heterogeneous counterparts. A parallel evaluation within the pole category demonstrated a twofold rise in carbon sequestration within heterogeneous forests compared to their homogeneous counterparts. This difference may be due to the interplay of factors, including variations in stem diameter, species composition, and number of individuals, all cumulatively influencing carbon sequestration within the homogeneous and heterogeneous forest ecosystems. © 2024, Smujo International.

We hypothesized that different land uses modify soil quality through changes that can be analyzed by determining the Soil Quality Index (SQI). Methods: Soil samples were collected from the 0-20 cm layer in five subsystems of peasant agroecosystems located in the municipalities of Solânea (A), Casserengue (B), and Serraria (C). SQI was calculated using non-linear scoring, while a principal component analysis was performed using all data (bulk and particle density, total porosity, particle size, pH, macronutrients, and soil organic carbon) to determine a Minimum Data Set (MDS). Results: The MDS composed of P available, Ca+2, Al+3, sand, silt, H+Al, base saturation (BS%), and the aluminum saturation (AS%) indicate that these parameters can serve as indicators for soil quality assessment in peasant agroecosystems. Sand and silt are related to pedogenic processes and parent material, while the remaining indicators reflect management practices. Land conversion from forest to cropland decreased nutrient availability and soil organic matter in agroecosystems A (Arenosol) and B (Luvisol) and increased the cation exchange capacity in agroecosystem C (Lixisol). Conclusions: All agroecosystems showed low SQI values, highlighting the need to expand conservation practices in the studied agricultural subsystems, especially regarding the increase of soil organic matter. Our results contribute to improving the use and management of soils and the vulnerability assessment in peasant farming, an essential requirement for the sustainability of agroecosystems. Implications for Conservation: Our results also demonstrated that agroforestry practices can significantly increase soil quality and soil carbon sequestration, a viable alternative for maintaining organic matter in areas susceptible to degradation. © The Author(s) 2024.",chemical indicators and minimum data set and multivariate techniques and soil quality index and sustainable agroecosystems,10.1177/19400829231215492,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181693212&doi=10.1177%2f19400829231215492&partnerID=40&md5=07d58167919c2f2a65b5a18dac4bffe5,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 3,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,JAN,1940-0829,WOS:001136860400001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1397, 5448"

The methodology involved purposive sampling to create observational sample plots (OSP) of varying sizes based on tree diameter. These plots were designed to measure the biomass, carbon potential, and environmental service potential of the trees in a given area. The collected data included the composition of tree species, the number of each type of tree, their diameters, and heights. The study applied specific formulas to determine the potential of biomass, carbon, and environmental services in the area. Key findings revealed a dominance of mahogany trees (83 trees per hectare) among ten identified plant species, indicating a specific but lower biodiversity in this zone. The significant results of the study include the quantification of biomass potential, which was found to be 787.84 tons/ha above-ground and 228.47 tons/ha below-ground, totaling 1016.31 tons/hectare. The study also evaluated the environmental service potential, including CO2 absorption and O2 production. The CO2 absorption capacity of the area was estimated at 1753.04 tons/ha, with a corresponding high O2 production of 1279.72 tons/ha. Additionally, the potential for carbon credits in the area was calculated at approximately 70.12 US$/ha.

Here we combined the geolocation of mine sites and carbon stock datasets to show that if all legal active mining sites in Brazil are exploited over the next decades, 2.55 Gt of CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) will be emitted due to the loss of vegetation (0.87 Gt CO2eq) and soil (1.68 Gt CO2eq). To offset these emissions, we propose constructing soils (Technosols) from mine and other wastes for mine reclamation. We show that this strategy could potentially offset up to 60% (1.00 Gt CO2eq) of soil-related CO2 emissions. When constructed with suitable parent materials, Technosols can also restore important soil-related ecosystem services while improving waste management. The construction of healthy Technosols stands out as a promising nature-based solution towards carbon-neutral mining and should, therefore, be considered in future environmental policies of major mining countries. © 2023, The Author(s).",Brazil and carbon dioxide and carbon emission and climate change and data set and environmental policy and future prospect and mining,10.1038/s43247-023-00862-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162189757&doi=10.1038%2fs43247-023-00862-x&partnerID=40&md5=8b62f89079d330ea8454385a02a6b635,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 14,NA,JOUR,1,NA,NA,NA,JUN 19,2662-4435,WOS:001010812200003,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1399, 4860"

A review of peatland research in Amazonia","Mires and Peat, MIRES AND PEAT",31,03,"Amazonia is believed to harbour the world’s most extensive tropical peatlands, storing significant amounts of carbon and having high value for biodiversity conservation, climate regulation and human welfare. However, a comprehensive assessment is hampered by fragmentary knowledge of the locations of peat-covered areas and this, in turn, prevents their protection and restoration in the face of ongoing anthropogenic destruction. The study reported here reviewed research activities on peatlands in Amazonia, which started with ecological studies in the 1950s. We found a broad and significant thematic increase since 2009, with growing focus first on carbon accumulation and greenhouse gas fluxes then, after 2017, on degradation and conservation, along with a spatial imbalance in favour of the Peruvian lowlands. Hitherto, very little scientific attention has been directed towards the peatlands of western Brazil, the Bolivian lowlands and the Guianas. Most research in Amazonia has been conducted by international institutions with, in recent times, increasing contributions from local institutes and research groups. Nevertheless, research on Amazonian peatlands is still in its early stages, and several scientific questions remain unanswered. Advancing the knowledge base with respect to various scientific disciplines (e.g., ecology, biology, geography, social sciences and economics) is, therefore, essential for understanding how and where peatlands developed, how they are used, which ecosystem services they provide, how climate change will affect them and, finally, what would be the most appropriate conservation, restoration and sustainable use strategies for safeguarding the wellbeing of both peatlands and people. © 2024, IMCG and IPS.

These PES initiatives have grown rapidly in Brazil over the last few decades, however, studies that address the panorama of these programs in the country are still scarce, regional, or outdated. Here, we investigate the PES overview in Brazil through interviews and an extensive literature review. We found in total 80 PES programs implemented in Brazil, of which 14 were closed. The programs are poorly distributed across the country, mostly concentrated in the Atlantic Forest (56.25%) and Savanna (36.25%) biomes, in Southeastern Brazil. The majority of programs primarily prioritize improving water quality and quantity. Therefore, reforestation, protection of native vegetation, and soil and water conservation are their main proposed practices. The positive impacts of Brazil's PES experiences are evident; while the lack of transparency and monitoring, and poor spatial and financial distribution are still major limitations. We conclude that if correctly implemented, PES schemes offer a path to reconcile environmental conservation with agricultural production in Brazil. © 2023 International Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation, China Water and Power Press, and China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research",Conservation funding and Ecological restoration and Environmental compliance and Public policy and Soil and water conservation,10.1016/j.iswcr.2023.01.001,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146443291&doi=10.1016%2fj.iswcr.2023.01.001&partnerID=40&md5=7768342a0e0091934ebd3147bde3e506,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 14,NA,JOUR,2,276,289,NA,JUN,2095-6339 and 2589-059X,WOS:000959325100001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1409, 4479"

Forty percent of these pastures are unproductive or degraded, with bare soil and native vegetation increasingly replacing exotic forage grasses. This study sought to investigate the regeneration of native vegetation in the pastures of the Cerrado and to evaluate the contribution of biophysical, land management, and landscape attributes to this process. Across the Cerrado, we analyzed pasture plant communities and the attributes of pasture management intensification, fire events, landscape native vegetation cover, and climate and soil types of 93 active pastures and 15 abandoned pastures. For the abandoned pastures, time since abandonment was an additional variable. On actively cultivated pastures, savanna regeneration varied from 0 to 70%, with a diversity of herbs and woody species. Pasture management was the main predictor of savanna regeneration on cultivated pastures. On abandoned pastures, time since abandonment was the main predictor. Exotic grass cover had a strong negative relationship with savanna regeneration and they were present even in pastures abandoned for 44 years. Our study reveals the potential of natural regeneration of the Cerrado and its particular predictors.

Although occupying only 1.3% of the world’s land area, Indonesia possesses the third-largest rainforest and the second-highest level of biodiversity, with very high species diversity and endemism. However, during the last two decades, Indonesia has been known as a country with a high level of deforestation, a producer of smoke from burning forests and land, and a producer of carbon emissions. The aim of this paper is to review the environmental history and the long process of Indonesian forest management towards achieving environmental sustainability and community welfare. To do this, we analyze the milestones of Indonesian forest management history, present and future challenges, and provide strategic recommendations toward a viable Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) system. Our review showed that the history of forestry management in Indonesia has evolved through a long process, especially related to contestation over the control of natural resources and supporting policies and regulations. During the process, many efforts have been applied to reduce the deforestation rate, such as a moratorium on permitting primary natural forest and peat land, land rehabilitation and soil conservation, environmental protection, and other significant regulations. Therefore, these efforts should be maintained and improved continuously in the future due to their significant positive impacts on a variety of forest areas toward the achievement of viable SFM. Finally, we conclude that the Indonesian government has struggled to formulate sustainable forest management policies that balance economic, ecological, and social needs, among others, through developing and implementing social forestry instruments, developing and implementing human resource capacity, increasing community literacy, strengthening forest governance by eliminating ambiguity and overlapping regulations, simplification of bureaucracy, revitalization of traditional wisdom, and fair law enforcement. © 2023 by the authors.",policy dynamics and shifting paradigm and sustainable forest management and Aceh and Indonesia and Merauke and Papua [(PRV) Indonesia] and deforestation and environmental history and forest management and forestry policy and natural resource and rainforest and sustainability,10.3390/land12061238,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163862279&doi=10.3390%2fland12061238&partnerID=40&md5=cb2b428f06ca8089e718264627320a98,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 16,NA,JOUR,6,NA,NA,NA,JUN,2073-445X,WOS:001017282400001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1414, 5210"

However, how socioculture structures Indigenous perspectives on forest management is unclear. Moreover, little is known about the influence of Indigenous landscape transformations on forest succession and floristic diversity. Here, we test hypotheses from biocultural and ecological theories suggesting that: (i) key social-ecological relationships with specific taxa structure Indigenous perspectives on forest management; (ii) such relationships guide sustainable management that generates resilient forest regrowth; and (iii) this management promotes floristic diversity by acting as an intermediate disturbance. We collected information about cosmology, occupation history and management among the Zoʻé, in Brazilian Amazonia. We also carried out floristic inventories in old-growth forests and in old Zoʻé swidden-fallow areas to analyze forest structure and alpha-and beta-diversity along a gradient of forest successional stages. We show that the Zoʻé perspective on forest management is structured by an ethical principle involving a social-ecological relationship with different beings, especially the spider monkey (Ateles sp.). This relationship generates mobility among the Zoʻé that allows forest regrowth in their fallow areas, so that in 28 years, forest basal area may equal that of old-growth forests. Also, Zoʻé forest management has increased alpha-and beta-diversity by increasing species richness and diversity in intermediate secondary forests and promoting floristic turnover at the landscape-level. These results show that some aspects of Zoʻé cosmology influence forest disturbance regimes that generate a sustainable social-ecological system, therefore being key for Zoʻé well-being and local biodiversity conservation. We believe that Indigenous perspectives about forest management should be included in forest conservation efforts aimed at protecting Amazonian biocultural diversity, thus valuing TEK and engendering sustainable social-ecological systems. © 2023 by the author(s).

Despite fire being a plant stimulation factor, such as breaking seed dormancy, when it covers large areas or occurs very frequently, it can cause irreparable damage to nature. Prevention is difficult and costly, and there are no corrective action options other than waiting for natural regeneration, which is usually slow and, not infrequently, with permanent damage. Due to its physicochemical qualities acting in biological regulation processes, water has been considered the primary vehicle for propagating signals from homeopathic ingredients, as suggested by previous studies carried out with solvatochromic dyes. Therefore, such inputs could, in theory, be inserted into watercourses to stimulate the regeneration of the biome destroyed by fire. This hypothesis motivated this case study. A slow dispersion device was developed aiming at promoting continuous environmental regeneration, containing hydrocolloid and calcium carbonate as a solid base soaked in a homeopathic complex specifically designed for this purpose, composed of Arnica montana 30 cH, Phosphorus 30 cH, Arsenicum album 30 cH, Staphysagria 30 cH, Ignatia amara 30 cH. The case occurred in Nascentes do Rio Taquari State Park (PENT), between Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul state, Brazil. It is a “cerrado” area, with multiple springs that feed the Paraguay River, occupying an area of 26,849 hectares over the Guarani and Bauru aquifers. After the fire in early September 2020, the devices were fixed at 9 strategic points in the park (P1 to P9) over 10 days, between September 29 and October 11, 2020, in water courses close to the main springs. The points varied from 400 to 800 m (altitude); all points were covered by native / recovered vegetation, but five were near agricultural fields. Two (P2 and P4) were located less than 400m from a highly vulnerable impact zone for burning. To assess the restoration signs of the post-fire environment, the IMASUL technicians responsible for monitoring the park registered the regrowth occurrence of new and known species of the flora in different locations close to four device-insertion points (P3, P5, P7, P8). Signs of recovery were observed 40 days after the fire was over. A rapid pioneer plant restructuring was noted, with a significant regrowth of grass, herbaceous and shrub species, such as Mutamba (Guazuma ulmifolia), Murici (Byrsonima spp.), Inga (Inga sp.), Brachiaria (Brachiaria sp.), Jaraguá grass (Hyparrhenia rufa), Colonião grass (Panicum maximum), Gabiroba (Campomanesia sp.), and Pixirica (Miconia sp.). Some species, such as Mimosa (Mimosa sp.), Colonião grass (Panicum maximum), and Jaraguá grass (Hyparrhenia rufa), were not detected in the area before the fire, probably by the seed bank stimulation caused by the heat. There was rapid forest regeneration (4 months after the fire) concerning the historical Brazilian forest natural post-fire recovery time [1], whose average for complete restoration is five to ten years, depending on the biome and the damage degree. The restoration of most of the burned trees was also noted, both for resisting the fire and for being free of invasive species highly aggressive to native plants, which were controlled by the action of fire. Concerning the fauna recovery, new bird visual observations were periodically observed, highlighting the appearance of “Tuiuiú” (Jabiru mycteria) and “Socó” (Tigrisoma lineatum) close to a water body with a waterfall area (P3). Both species belong to the “Pantanal” biome close to the park. Such species began to frequent the park's lakes, being observed until February 2023 (the last survey date). The park's inventory of lichens and fungi showed an unusual tolerance to fire in species that adhered to burned trees and remained active. In this way, although there is no clear cause-effect relation in this case report, it is suggested that installing slow dispersion devices in watercourses can contribute to the regeneration of other “cerrado” biome areas subjected to fire, protecting the local biodiversity. More studies of this nature are needed to know the real impact of this method on the recovery of different biomes. © International Journal of High Dilution Research.",biome regeneration and ecosystems and environmental homeopathy and forest fire,10.51910/IJHDR.V22I2.1351,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185262573&doi=10.51910%2fIJHDR.V22I2.1351&partnerID=40&md5=1bf7a5d04d6e5d53d3e4160faab381e0,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 2,NA,JOUR,2,44,45,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1421

In this sense, soil and ecosystem services related to nutrients cycling and water recharge can be improved. In this study, the spatial and temporal dynamics of soil water content (θ) were inferred using two-dimensional electrical resistivity (ER) surveys, that were applied to explore the soil profile treated by deep tillage under different citrus rootstocks (RS) implantation. A seasonal scale ER monitoring (Spring 2018, Summer 2019, and Winter 2019) was carried out at a selected study area, characterized by Ultisols and located in Southeastern Brazil. Three different citrus RS-types, represented by the varieties ‘Cravo Santa Cruz lemon’ (CSC), ‘Sunki Tropical Tangerine’ (ST), and ‘Citrandarin Indio’ (CI). Deep tillage was adopted before RS citrus-types planting by opening furrows and subsoiling up to 0.6 m depth. The interrows citrus plants were covered with Brachiaria decumbens (Syn. Urochloa) in all citrus RS-type plots. A native forest area (‘Forest’) was used as reference for all θ evaluations. The model for the ER-θ relationships was determined from measurements conducted on soil samples in the laboratory. Root water uptake (RWU), in terms of θ changes, was evaluated at the different treatments under study. The obtained results proved the suitability of ER method for identifying the ER-θ dynamics in the Ultisol profiles over time. Lower and more stable θ values were obtained in the ‘Forest’ and interrow areas. Among the evaluated citrus RS-types, CSC showed the highest water use efficiency due to the greatest root system development. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Conservative agriculture and Geophysical surveys and Natural dense layer and Tangerine crop and Tropical soil and Water storage and Brazil and Ecosystems and Electric conductivity and Forestry and Plants (botany) and Soil moisture and Soil surveys and Tropics and Citrus rootstocks and Conservative agricultures and Deep tillage and Dense layer and Geophysical surveys and Natural dense layer and Tangerine crop and Tropical soils and Ultisol and Water storage and alternative agriculture and electrical resistivity and geophysical survey and rootstock and spatiotemporal analysis and tillage and Ultisol and water storage and Dynamics,10.1016/j.still.2022.105629,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145783865&doi=10.1016%2fj.still.2022.105629&partnerID=40&md5=1f5ad85f73bfad0f8d4fe2273a95cf2f,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 3,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1424

An example of disinformation is the case of the “firefighter cattle”. Supporters of this idea believe that by consuming organic mass, cattle decrease the risk of fire in natural ecosystems. This statement was cited by a member of the Bolsonaro government in response to the unprecedented 2020 fires in the Pantanal, as well as in support of a new law that enables extensive livestock in protected areas of this biome. By suggesting that grazing benefits the ecosystem, the “firefighter cattle” argument supports the interests of agribusiness. However, it ignores the real costs of livestock production on biodiversity. We analysed the social repercussion of the “firefighter cattle” by analysing public reactions to YouTube, Facebook, and Google News posts. These videos and articles and the responses to them either agreed or disagreed with the “firefighter cattle”. Supportive posts were shared more on social media and triggered more interactions than critical posts. Even though many netizens disagreed with the idea of “firefighter cattle”, it has gone viral, and was used as a tool to strengthen anti-environmental policies.

We hypothesized that maintaining mosaic burning regimes, and thereby pyrodiversity, can diversify phenological patterns, ensuring year-round availability of flowers and fruits. Here we monitored open grassy tropical savanna phenology under different historical fire frequencies and fire seasons in a highly heterogeneous landscape in an Indigenous Territory in Brazil. We evaluated phenological patterns of tree and non-tree plants through monthly surveys over three years. These two life forms responded differently to climate and photoperiod variables and to fire. Different fire regimes led to a continuous availability of flowers and fruits, due to the complementarity between tree and non-tree phenologies. Late-season fires are supposed to be more devastating, but we did not detect a significant reduction in flower and fruit production, especially under moderate fire frequency. However, late burning in patches under high frequency resulted in a low availability of ripe fruits in trees. The fruiting of non-tree plants in patches under low fire frequency and early burning ensure ripe fruit, when there are practically no trees fruiting in the entire landscape. We conclude that maintaining a seasonal fire mosaic should be prioritized over historical fire regimes, which lead to homogenization.

Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the state of key-ecosystem services of provisioning and regulation in the southern coast of the state of Santa Catarina in the face of coastal stressors. For the development of the research, eight types of ecosystems were identified and mapped, according to a key ecosystem service offered by each of them, and the four largest in area were selected to apply the environmental valuation methodologies. The methodologies used were the Avoided Costs Method (ACM) and the Replacement Cost Method (RCM). The ACM calculates the economic value of the benefits that an ecosystem provides that would not be available if it did not exist. In turn, the RCM is based on the replacement cost of a damaged asset. Valuation results for Agriculture and Cattle farming; Continental waters and Marine environment; and Afforestation were respectively 1.74; 2.86; 2.89 million of dollars per year, while results for Dunes, Beaches and Restingas were in the range of USD 3,120-6,240 ha-1 yr-1. These values should be understood as approximations of the true economic dimension of the damages caused by the use of ecosystems, since they correspond to how much the environment is capable of monetarily returning to individuals.

We argue that the currently unfolding framing of Amazonian diverse economies in natural forests as part of a bioeconomy—on a par with, for example, soybean plantations—is a dangerous and misleading path. Recent reports framing the Amazon as a potential hotspot of bioeconomy are critically scrutinized. We find it important to disintegrate the all-embracing bio-concept that refers to anything “bio” and make visible and strengthen a radical and sustainable version of the bio-based economy against the extractive economy of the plantation. It is essential to analyze how land use practices impact diversity, both in the biological sphere and in social organization. We contrast and compare two types of land use based economies, the “plantation economy” and the “sociobiodiverse economy” offering a toolbox with which to analyze the nature of land use based economies when they expand over new territories and political economic systems. We explore how these two logics of land use compete for the same land and rule each other out, as rivals, using agroforestry and plantation studies as a basis. We find that the term bioeconomy has become so conflated that it cannot be rescued to serve the development of sociobiodiverse economies, such as agroecology or agroforestry. We conclude by making policy suggestions from a more global development perspective, situating the bioeconomy framing into the current moment of converging global crises. © 2023 The Authors",Agroforestry and Biodiversity and Bioeconomy and Brazil and Plantation politics and Sustainability and Biodiversity and Brazil and Contrast and Development and Economics and Forests and Impact and Land Use and Economics and Land use and Agroforestry and Bio-based and Brazil and Economic system and Hotspots and Natural forests and Plantation economy and Plantation politic and Social organizations and Unfoldings and Biodiversity,10.1016/j.forpol.2023.102932,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148543703&doi=10.1016%2fj.forpol.2023.102932&partnerID=40&md5=c3aa9b7c6dd2683ec5ebc1e8948b882a,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 19,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,APR,1389-9341 and 1872-7050,WOS:000946083700001,FEB 2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1434, 5510"

The understory herb-layer composition among different stand types, including Pinus (PN), Aleurites-Swietenia (AS), Swietenia-Acacia (SA), Melaleuca-Acacia (MA) and Tectona-Dalbergia (TD), was compared using some comparison analyses. The influence of tree vegetation characteristics and associated environmental factors on the understory herb-layer species was analyzed by employing canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Our result showed variation in understory herb-layer species composition despite equality in richness and diversity indices. Among all stand types, the MA stand showed fewer shade-tolerant species, and the TD stand exhibited the smallest number of shade-intolerant species. Seedling availability also varied between AS and MA, which contained fewer seedling species. One of the main species in the two stands did not even regenerate. Moreover, all indicator species in MA were shade-intolerant species with invasive characteristics, while those in TD were shade-tolerant and semi-shade-tolerant species. CCA showed that stand types held an important role in the herb-layer species composition, where the number of shade-tolerant and seedling species commonly native to forest were directly proportional to tree canopy coverage, silt proportion in soil texture and concentration of soil organic carbon yet inversely proportional to below-stand utilization. In contrast, the number of shade-intolerant species had positive correlation to below-stand utilization and inversely to other correlated factors. Our study also indicated the possibility of tree vegetation controlling several environmental factors, where the increase in canopy coverage was followed by an increasing proportion of silt in soil texture and concentration of soil organic carbon, as well as a decreasing percentage of below-stand utilization. Accordingly, we recommend tree species enrichment with dense-canopy trees and adaptive management of below-stand utilization for better forest development and tree regeneration.

Here, we evaluated the ecological role of the alien tree Bombax ceiba when interacting with nectar-feeding birds, including its potential for negative impacts as an invasive plant in an urban area in Brazil. At the community level, network analysis of 70 bird species interacting with flowers from 73 plant species showed B. ceiba to be one of the few ""hub"" plant species, indicating its importance as a nectar resource for urban birds. Specifically, B. ceiba flowers attracted 38 bird species with different habits (feeding guilds and habitat requirements), most of which fed on nectar, while some also consumed floral parts. On the other hand, the semiquantitative risk assessment for B. ceiba regarding potential negative impacts on native species and ecosystems indicated only a moderate risk, suggesting an overall benefit of keeping this tree species in the urban landscape.

To address this problem, we need to (1) identify groups of species with climatic similarity under climate scenarios and (2) identify areas with high conservation value under predicted climate change. To recognize species with similar climatic niche requirements that can be grouped for mixed cropping in Brazil, we employed ecological niche models (ENMs) and Spearman's ρ for overlap. We also used prioritization algorithms to map areas of high conservation value using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) to assess mid-term (2041–2060) and long-term (2061–2080) climate change impacts. We identified 15 species groups with finer climatic affinities at different times depicted on hierarchical clustering dendrograms, which can be combined into agroecological agroforestry systems. Furthermore, we highlight the climatically suitable areas for these groups of species, thus providing an outlook of where different species will need to be planted over time to be conserved. In addition, we observed that climate change is predicted to modify the spatial association of these groups under different future climate scenarios, causing a mean negative change in species climatic similarity of 9.5% to 13.7% under SSP2-4.5 scenario and 9.5% to 10.5% under SSP5-8.5, for 2041–2060 and 2061–2080, respectively. Synthesis and applications. Our findings provide a framework for agroforestry conservation. The groups of species with finer climatic affinities identified and the climatically suitable areas can be combined into agroecological productive systems, and provide an outlook of where different species may be planted over time. In addition, the conservation priority zones displaying high climate stability for each species individually and all at once can be incorporated into Brazil's conservation plans by policymakers to prioritize specific sites. Lastly, we urge policymakers, conservation organizations and donors to promote interventions involving farmers and local communities, since the species' evaluated have proven to maintain landscapes with productive forest fragments and can be conserved in different Brazilian ecosystems. © 2023 The Authors.

The existence of urban mangrove forests potentially contributes to mitigating the environmental problems. Preserving mangrove forests in coastal urban areas requires continuous support from all stakeholders, which can be strengthened by good understanding on the comprehensive benefits provided by these ecosystems. This study aims to quantify key ecosystem services from urban mangrove forest, with a case study in Angke Kapuk Jakarta. Four types of key ecosystem services were quantified, i.e., carbon storage, air pollutant absorption, microclimate regulation, and nature recreation. A vegetation survey was conducted in 30 sample plots to collect data for carbon storage, which covers above-ground carbon, below-ground carbon, and carbon on deadwood. The absorption of six pollutants (CO, NO2, O3, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5) was analysed using the i-Tree Eco model. Field measurements of air temperature and humidity, as well as interviews with 99 visitors, were performed to analyse microclimate regulation. This study found a high quantity of carbon storage within mangrove trees and deadwood in the study area (111.6 tonnes C/ha) as well as high amounts of air pollutants absorbed by mangrove trees (11.3 tonnes/year). Mangrove trees in the study area effectively regulated microclimate conditions, indicated by a significant difference in average daily air temperature and humidity between inside and outside the mangrove forest. Meanwhile, the number of visitors benefiting from its recreation services has fluctuated during the last five years, with an average of 138,550 people per year. We discuss the implications of the findings of this study for urban mangrove forest management, including how to integrate ecosystem services quantification into mangrove preservation and rehabilitation. © 2023 by the authors.",air pollution and carbon storage and climate regulation and mangrove restoration and urban forest and Air Pollution and Carbon and Conservation and Ecosystems and Forestry and Mangrove and Services and Temperature and Indonesia and Jakarta and Air pollution and Atmospheric temperature and Conservation and Digital storage and Ecosystems and Sea level and Carbon storage and Case-studies and Climate regulation and Coastal urban area and Ecosystem services and Jakarta and Mangrove forest and Mangrove restoration and Mangrove tree and Urban forests and air quality and atmospheric pollution and carbon sequestration and carbon storage and ecosystem service and mangrove and regulatory approach and Forestry,10.3390/f14091796,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85172726496&doi=10.3390%2ff14091796&partnerID=40&md5=d8b6cf79c30f51a6acccf5c1794d0ee8,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 12,NA,JOUR,9,NA,NA,NA,SEP,1999-4907,WOS:001072008100001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1448, 4203"

With more favourable climate conditions for their occurrence, like prolonged periods of drought, the frequency and intensity of these catastrophes continue to increase. Protected areas are important territories for conserving ecosystems and biodiversity around the world and serve as a key management tool in national environmental policies. Many studies have been developed around the world to assess the conditions, frequency, and intensity of fires, and, on the other hand, protected areas are intensively studied to understand whether conservation actions are effective in keeping the ecosystem balanced. However, there are few studies that contemplate these two themes together. Consequently, this study offers a bibliometric analysis of the wildfires and its occurrence in protected areas, aiming to understand the spatial and temporal relation between them, characteristics of the research studies, and trending issues to be worked on. We used the Bibliometrix package in R language, which provides the option of different methods for analysing bibliometric data to understand the temporal evolution of the published documents about wildfires and protected areas. In total, 1116 publications were analysed, ranging from 1970 to 2022. The findings show that the terms “fires” (185 occurrences), “fire” (117), “wildfire” (101), and “forest fire” (92) are more frequently used and associated with studies on topics including biodiversity (304), conservation (221), environmental protection (188), deforestation (148), ecosystems (138), forestry (133), and climate change (126) as well as protected areas (399). The highest growth of research has been registered since 2002. The majority of the publications were published by authors from universities in the USA (77), South Africa (72), the United Kingdom (22), and Brazil (19). The USA leads all other countries with 7 of the top 10 international collaborations, followed by Brazil, Australia, and South Africa. However, only the United Kingdom continues to maintain an increased number of external (inter-country) collaborations, whereas the other nine continue to maintain an increased number of internal (intra-country).

The study was conducted in two municipalities (Paragominas and Irituia) located in the Brazilian Amazon. The game was developed in 2018 using a co-construction process that mainly included farmers, students and researchers. Data was collected during two sessions of the game held in 2019, with participation by heterogeneous participants from different local institutions. Our results demonstrated that game sessions showed how the provision of ES, as well as other factors (e.g. values, availability of factors), is taken into account in planning the spatio-temporal configuration of the agroecosystem and associated agricultural practices. They also revealed some trade-offs involved in this decision-making process. We conclude that the RPG allowed stakeholders to synthesize and discuss different types of knowledge about this process. Bringing these elements to the discussion can contribute to an improved shared understanding of the challenges and possibilities of the ecological management of agroecosystems and can indicate solutions that are in line with local expectations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Agroecology and Cropping systems and Farming management and Knowledge sharing and Serious game and Amazon River and Brazil and Para [Brazil] and Paragominas and agricultural ecosystem and agricultural practice and agroecology and agroforestry and cropping practice and decision making and ecosystem management and farming system and knowledge,10.1007/s10457-021-00633-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105157079&doi=10.1007%2fs10457-021-00633-7&partnerID=40&md5=5d83315de294d2ce6dc7223403da0f2c,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 4,NA,JOUR,3,447,461,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1451

Efforts to conserve and sustainably manage seagrasses are increasing, particularly amidst the era of climate change, in which they play a critical role. However, these activities often received less attention or were slow in gaining momentum partly due to a lack of societal recognition of seagrasses and their importance. Thus, in this study, we collected community perceptions of seagrass ecosystem services and threats from 391 respondents in Karimunjawa National Park (KNP), a nationally declared protected area in Indonesia. We aim to provide insights on people's recognition of seagrasses from a local scale with strict protection measures. Overall, respondents showed varying perceptions of seagrass ecosystem services, with provisioning services more highly perceived than regulating services. The perceived level of threats was inconclusive, though, reclamation along shorelines received higher rates (leaning toward most damaging) than other threats such as natural disasters and illegal fishing activities. Sociodemographic attributes of respondents were found to influence their perceptions, with occupation as the most pronounced driving factor. The variations observed in seagrass perceptions suggest that there is a need to strengthen and/or enhance seagrass awareness and education campaigns, which is in line with the increasing demand that public perceptions matter for the conservation and sustainable management of seagrass ecosystems. We presented here the use and insights of community perceptions for seagrass blue carbon conservation in KNP, and consequently in Indonesia, where seagrass meadows are considered globally important carbon sinks. © 2023 The Authors.

Thus far AFS has been recognised and financed through the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM) program; however, analysis of the potential carbon credit payment and productivity trade-off has rarely been conducted. This study aims to analyse the potential of cocoa-based AFS in terms of the trade-off of carbon accumulation and productivity in West Sumatra, Indonesia. The trade-off is shown through 20 years of financial analysis between the two schemes: AFS without the VCM scheme (agroforestry Business as Usual-aBAU); and AFS with the VCM scheme. A comparison is made between four types of cocoa plantations in West Sumatra: (i) Cocoa-Rubber (CR), (ii) Cocoa Multi-strata (CM), (iii) Cocoa-Coconut (CC), and (iv) Monoculture practice (M). The results showed that under the aBAU scheme, CC showed the highest Net Present Value (NPV) and Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) of $6,647 USD and 5.8 respectively, while the lowest was CR, with an NPV and BCR of $2,423 USD and 2.73, respectively. Cocoa monoculture presented the group with the fastest payback period (PP) of two years. Utilising a VCM scheme under the Plan Vivo standard with Voluntary Emission Reduction (VER) as a selling unit, cocoa farmers stand to gain NPV by 15-25 % at VER prices of $8 USD Mg CO2e−1. It is thus concluded that cocoa-based AFS could be adopted under the VCM scheme with the dual purposes of enhancing carbon-storage through AFS and greater income for farmers. © Author(s) 2023.",carbon trade-off and Theobroma cacao,10.17170/kobra-202311028937,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186687809&doi=10.17170%2fkobra-202311028937&partnerID=40&md5=9cfa652278819e2f3701809e341254ea,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 1,NA,JOUR,2,101,114,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1460

The objective of this study was to evaluate the P adsorption in a reconstituted soil as a function of two forest recovery processes after bauxite mining. We evaluated three systems: native forest (FOR), planting of forest seedlings after bauxite mining (TPL), and natural regeneration of vegetation after bauxite mining (NRV). In each system, eight sampling plots were deployed. In each plot, we collected litter and soil samples. The soil samples were collected at depths of 0–5, 5–10, 10–20, and 20–40 cm, for soil chemical analysis and adjustment of P adsorption isotherms. We also performed an inventory of the tree vegetation to obtain basal area (G) and species diversity (H′). Forest was significantly superior with respect to most soil fertility, litter, and vegetation attributes, followed by natural regeneration and planting. In general, the adsorption curves and maximum phosphorus adsorption capacity (MPAC) in soil followed the order planting > natural regeneration > forest. We observed a negative relationship between phosphorus adsorption and soil organic matter, potential acidity, and available phosphorus. This result highlights the importance of biomass conservation and maintenance to ensure phosphorus availability in reclamation practices.

Straw is pointed out as a feedstock to attend high bioenergy production demand. However, either indiscriminate straw removal or high amount of straw kept on the field may impair several soil functions and thereafter decreases plant tillering and crop yield. Better nutrients cycling and soil physical protection due to Leguminosae species grown within the sugarcane renewal period may offset implications of straw managements across the crop cycles. Thus, does Crotalaria sp. grow within the sugarcane renewal period can offset the undesirable implications of unsustainable straw management on soil and crop yield? To address this research question, a two-year experiment was carried out in Quirinópolis, Chapadão do Céu, Iracemápolis and Quatá, first two sites are in Goiás state, while the other sites are in São Paulo state, Brazil. Soil and plant parameters under straw retention rates (i.e., 0%, 50% and 100% of straw retention) were assessed. This management was coupled with fallow (F) and Crotalaria sp. (CR) grown within the sugarcane renewal period. Soil parameters evaluated included, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks, while stalk yield was plant parameters assessed. The straw retention implications on soil and plant were site-specific. Carbon and N stocks in the upper 0.4 m soil layer were, respectively, 3.5 and 3.1 time higher at the fine-textured soil than the stocks of those elements at the coarse-textured soil. Regardless of Crotalaria sp. grown, stalk yield increased (ranged from 3 to 16 Mg ha−1) under total straw retention rate for most sites, while in the coolest site 50% and 100% straw retention reduced stalk yield in 13 and 14 Mg ha−1, respectively. In addition, Crotalaria sp. grown within the sugarcane renewal period does not seem able to avoid reduction on soil N availability due to straw retention along the ratoon cycles.

The Brazilian Cerrado, considered the savanna with the highest biodiversity, is characterized by climatic seasonality, vegetation mosaics and topographic variations that together with fire determine its different plant physiognomies. The Chapada das Mesas National Park (CMNP), located in the south of the state of Maranhão (Brazil), has different savanna plant physiognomies with high ecological potential and archaeological and water wealth. The aim of the present study was to reconstruct the fire history over 28 years for the park and its surroundings (20 km buffer area), endeavouring to understand the impact of the creation of this National Park on its fire regime. Landsat satellite images were used from the TM, ETM + and OLI sensors to map the fire scars, which were identified and vectorized manually. The database created was used to analyze the total annual burned area, burned area percentage, density ignition, mean burn scar area and fire frequency during the mapped period. In total, 86 % of the CMNP was burn at least once between 1990 and 2017, while 72 % of the buffer area was burn. The creation of the park had significant effects on the density ignition when the periods before (1990–2005) and after (2006–2017) its creation were compared, and showed no significant effects on total annual area burned and average burn scar area. Despite the amount of burned area over time did not change significantly between the years before and after, the main change was observed in the fire seasonality after the creation of the park. In the park, 38 % of the area had a frequency of burn areas higher than ten times in the 28-year interval while 13 % of the buffer area was burn more than 10 times. In contrast, 23 % and 15 % had a fire frequency of 2 to 4 times on the buffer and the park respectively. Although the park was created to mitigate the human impacts of fire, the geographic isolation, the current occupation of the park by local populations and the pressure from agricultural expansion in the surroundings are influencing these conservation measures. Understanding the spatial–temporal distribution of fire in protected areas of the Cerrado contributes to improving management, preservation and conservation actions, so that in future studies other factors can be included to better understand the dynamic of fire occurrence in the region of the CMNP and in other protected areas of the Cerrado. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH",Burned area and Fire frequency and Fire season and Land use change and Protected areas management and Brazil and Chapada das Mesas National Park and Maranhao and annual variation and biodiversity and cerrado and database and environmental protection and fire behavior and fire management and land use change and Landsat and protected area and satellite imagery and seasonality and spatial distribution and topographic effect,10.1016/j.jnc.2022.126318,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144418786&doi=10.1016%2fj.jnc.2022.126318&partnerID=40&md5=9ece6b76c96d9058c8c64c1b3c533792,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 7,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1465

Global recognition of the urgency of halting and reversing this trend have initiated numerous restoration activities. Restoration success is typically evaluated by estimating mangrove survival and area restored, while diversity and structure of vegetation, as proxies for functional forests, are rarely considered. Here we assess mangrove species richness along sea-landward transects and evaluate restoration outcomes by comparing number of mangrove species, relative species abundance, biomass, diameter, and canopy cover in “Monoculture Reforestation”, “Mixed Species Regeneration” and adjacent “Reference” forest stands, 14 (Tiwoho site) and 16 years (Likupang site) after restoration activities took place. In the “Monoculture Reforestation” plots, mangrove diversity and structure still closely reflected the original restoration actions, with only one and two “new” species having established among the originally densely planted “foundation” species. In contrast, the “Mixed Species Regeneration” plots were more similar to the “Reference” plots in terms of tree diameter and canopy coverage, but species number, abundance and biomass were still lower. The trajectory of the “Mixed Species Regeneration” plots suggests their similarity with the “Reference” stands will increase over time, whereas such “smooth” transition is unlikely to happen in the planted “Monoculture Reforestation” stands, in the foreseeable future. Implementing frequent small-scale disturbances in restored forest management would increase stand structure and diversity, accelerating the establishment of a more natural, and likely more functional and resilient forest. © 2023 The Authors.

Applied nucleation is considered a strategy that facilitates the development of vegetation, attracts dispersers, and, over time, tends to expand, coalescing into continuous forests. However, simply implementing restorative techniques is not enough, it is also necessary to monitor the process. Monitoring requires good ecological indicators, which is a challenge for ecological restoration. The present study aims to evaluate, through ecological indicators, the effectiveness of the applied nucleation for restoration of riparian forest. The study was carried out in the Serra do Sudeste, Pampa region, southern Brazil. Ecological indicators were analyzed in two areas of restoration: passive and active restoration. In the area under active restoration, paired plots were evaluated: intra-nuclei (inside the nuclei) and inter-nuclei (outside the nuclei). To assess natural regeneration, all regenerant shrubby and arboreal individuals taller than 30 cm were counted and taxonomically identified. The species were classified according to the dispersal syndrome. Shannon diversity indices and Pielou evenness were calculated. The canopy cover of nuclei and trees planted crown cover were evaluated. Ecological indicators were compared using Tukey's test (p < 0.05). The results showed a significant difference between passive, intra-nuclei, and inter-nuclei restorations for the evaluated indicators, with higher averages for intra-nuclei, followed by inter-nuclei and passive restorations. It is concluded that the intra-nuclei plots showed an increase in richness, abundance, biotic dispersal syndrome, canopy cover, and soil cover by plant litter and arboreal species.

Results showed that there was a striking increase in vegetation cover, yielding a total carbon sequestration of 3,853 tons, or equivalent to the reduction of 14,140 tons of CO2 emissions. On the other hand, co-benefits in term of floristic diversity at a landscape scale was low, and soil and micro-climate conditions were still marginal. This study provided empirical evidence that collaboration between communities and private entities in tree planting program can be effective in rehabilitation of degraded lands.

These peatlands globally provide vital environmental benefits, especially in case of their enormous carbon storage potential. Peat land also functions as a source of livelihood for the community, especially for agricultural activities, and this will lead to the potential loss of carbon stock in peatlands. This study examines plants' potential to create Carbon to offset carbon dioxide emissions and different land use types. The study focused on Central and West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Peat soil samples were collected from various types of land from 0-15, 15-45, and 45-100 cm depth and analyzed for physical and chemical parameters. The cylinder chamber method with infrared gas analysis model EGM-4 was used to measure CO2 emissions. Plant carbon sequestration was measured in a 6.25 m2 plot in the study sites of Central Kalimantan. The study showed that type of commodity and period of management affect the carbon content in peat with different land uses, and it is affected by soil bulk density, organic matter content, and CO2 emission. In the case of study crops, oil palm, rubber, corn, and mustard emit the highest CO2. Further, corn crop has the highest potential to fix carbon dioxide and produces more Carbon per hectare than the Carbon emitted from corn-planted under peatland conditions. The study indicated that the type of commodity and the time of its management affected the carbon content in peat with different land uses, and carbon content got the change with soil bulk density and soil organic matter content. © 2023, Editorial board of Journal of Experimental Biology and Agricultural Sciences.

Cultivated pastures under different degradation levels are dominant in the landscape and are being targeted for sustainable agricultural intensification and restoration of native vegetation. In this study, we classified the cultivated pastures of the Brazilian Cerrado according to their potential for natural regeneration, based on field surveys and environmental predictors. We surveyed the native vegetation cover in 186 plots distributed along 93 cultivated pastures. The environmental predictors considered in this study were the proportion of sand in the soil, cation exchange capacity, climate water deficit, pasture age, slope, and pasture vigor index. We then applied the Random Forest regression algorithm to predict and map the cultivated pastures according to their potential for natural regeneration in the 19 Cerrado ecoregions. The potential for natural regeneration was classified into low (< 30% of native plant cover), medium (30–50%), and high (> 50%). Our prediction explained 75% of the data variability. Most of the cultivated pastures presented medium potential for natural regeneration (57%), while 31% and 12% presented high and low potentials, respectively. Cultivated pastures in ecoregions with high mechanization, due to their high water availability and extensive flat terrains, presented low potential for natural regeneration. This first attempt to map the potential for natural regeneration in the cultivated pastures of the Brazilian Cerrado can be used as a proxy for planning low-cost and predictable restoration or environmentally sustainable intensification in this major type of land use found in this biome. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Pasturelands and Priority areas for natural regeneration and Random Forest and Tropical savanna and Agriculture and Biodiversity and Brazil and Conservation of Natural Resources and Ecosystem and Environmental Monitoring and Water and Brazil and Biodiversity and Conservation and Land use and Reforestation and Restoration and Sustainable development and Tropics and water and Biodiversity conservation and Brazilian cerrado and Classifieds and Ecoregions and Hotspots and Natural regeneration and Pastureland and Priority area for natural regeneration and Random forests and Tropical savanna and alternative agriculture and biodiversity and biome and cation exchange capacity and cerrado and cultivation and ecoregion and environmental restoration and intensive agriculture and native species and pasture and regeneration and savanna and vegetation cover and vegetation mapping and article and biogeographic region and biome and cation exchange and climate and field study and human cell and land use and pastureland and prediction and random forest and regeneration and sand and savanna and scrub and vegetation and water availability and water deficit and agriculture and biodiversity and Brazil and ecosystem and environmental monitoring and environmental protection and Vegetation,10.1007/s10661-023-11606-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167740485&doi=10.1007%2fs10661-023-11606-x&partnerID=40&md5=e80b2e044013438f64f3e68637ced309,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,JOUR,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1473

However, the current classification of these stages by experts does not consider the possible differences among such ecosystems. In order to test the hypothesis of significant differences, Atlantic Forest ecosystems in southern Brazil were compared at the same stage (initial, medium, and advanced stages of regeneration). An extensive database of the floristic forest inventory of Santa Catarina state, southern Brazil, with 460 sampling units, was used, addressing the seasonal deciduous forest (SDF), dense ombrophilous forest (DOF), and mixed ombrophilous forest (MOF). The regeneration stage of each sample unit was previously classified by experts using five key indicators (basal area per hectare—BA/ha; number of individuals per hectare—N/ha; number of species—S; Shannon biodiversity index—H’; and diameter at breast height—DBH). The Kruskal–Wallis method and pairwise multiple comparisons based on Dunn’s procedure were applied, considering two-way tests with 5% significance, and 95% power. The statistical tests confirmed the research hypothesis, namely, that the key indicators had significant differences in the later regeneration stages of Atlantic Forest ecosystems. For instance, S in DOF was statistically higher (p < 0.001) than in MOF and SDF (44 ± 9); N in SDF was significantly lower (394 ± 248 at mid-stage) compared to MOF (475 ± 233) and DOF (545 ± 173); and H’ showed increasing differences towards more advanced stages. Considering that the stage of forest regeneration is the main criterion for decision-making between suppression and conservation of forest ecosystems, the results achieved should support the review of current procedures applied to the classification of successional stages. Given the demonstrated differences, in the next steps of research, we will evaluate and propose specific standards for each Atlantic Forest ecosystem, i.e., intervals of discriminating values for the key indicators applicable to this biome. © 2023 by the authors.",key indicators and monitoring and assessment and regeneration stage and Atlantic Forest and Brazil and Santa Catarina and biodiversity and conservation status and deciduous forest and decision making and environmental assessment and environmental indicator and environmental monitoring and forest ecosystem and forest inventory,10.3390/su15086823,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85156143225&doi=10.3390%2fsu15086823&partnerID=40&md5=e7399d0684e7a4ed22a00fad4e5f6a80,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 1,NA,JOUR,8,NA,NA,NA,APR,2071-1050,WOS:000978189800001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1475, 5147"

We analysed the woody dynamics of the urban greening in Jataí, Goiás, Brazil, over 13-years (2007–2020), considering variations in tree composition, diversity, and structure. We also evaluate ecosystem services (pollination, dispersal and fruit supply) and planting management (native and non-native species, tree planted under electricity lines and sidewalk). Both species richness, diversity and equability increased in 2020. The density of anemophilous species increased in 2020, while the other pollination mechanisms remained constant. Zoochory prevailed with higher species richness and density in both years, while the fruit and non-fruit species richness and density increased. Although the richness of native species increased, the density pf non-native was higher than native species in 2020. The density of large species density has increased under electricity lines, suggesting inadequacy of tree planting over the years. Species density in the furniture and frontage zones increased in 2020, while there was no difference in the pedestrian zone between years.

Microclimate variables and pasture production and chemical composition were measured in pared paddocks under SPSnu and treeless pasture (TLP) in a commercial farm during four seasons in Southern Brazil. SPSnu measurements were subdivided into two areas: around the nuclei (AN) and area inter-nuclei (IN). In the TLP paddocks, we plotted fictitious nuclei with the same areas and distributions of SPSnu, however without trees. For the microclimate measurements, these areas were noted when shaded or unshaded by the nuclei trees. In each season, the microclimate variables air temperature (AT, °C), relative humidity (RH, %), illuminance (Ilu, lux), wind speed (WS, m/s), and soil surface temperature (SST, °C) were measured. In addition, botanical composition (%), pasture production (kg/DM/ ha), and pasture chemical composition were evaluated. The SPSnu provided the lowest values of microclimate variables in all seasons (p < 0.05), except for the relative humidity. Winter had the highest thermal amplitude in the systems. The highest difference between SPSnu and TLP for AT (4.3 °C) and SST (5.2 °C) was measured during the hot seasons (spring and summer). In contrast, during cold seasons (autumn and winter) it observed highest thermal amplitude between SPSnu and TLP. Overall, the highest annual pasture production was observed in the SPSnu (p < 0.05). During the summer, the SPSnu areas showed the highest values of crude protein and dry matter (p < 0.05). During the winter, the TLP showed the lowest values (p < 0.05) of pasture production and dry matter. It was observed that SPSnu improved the microclimate at the pasture level, influencing pasture production and pasture chemical composition. The enhanced microclimate can partially mitigate some of the effects of climate change on pastoral agroecosystems, creating conditions for ecological rehabilitation of ecosystem processes and services. These conditions could be amplified to a biome level through a payment for ecosystem services program. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Society of Biometeorology.",Agroforestry and Biometeorology and Pasture shading and Thermal amplitude and Thermal environment and Biodiversity and Cold Temperature and Ecosystem and Humidity and Microclimate and Seasons and Temperature and Trees and biodiversity and cold and ecosystem and humidity and microclimate and season and temperature and tree,10.1007/s00484-023-02488-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161292062&doi=10.1007%2fs00484-023-02488-2&partnerID=40&md5=efc9fd6dac8b8405fefd00360bb490bd,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 3,NA,JOUR,7,1199,1212,NA,JUL,0020-7128 and 1432-1254,WOS:001005062800002,JUN 2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1480, 5004"

However, LUC could negatively affect soil fauna along with the multiple functions and services associated with these organisms. Numerous groups of macroinvertebrates inhabiting the soil surface (i.e., epigeic) or the soil profile (i.e., edaphic) are fundamental for litter fragmentation, soil structuring and stabilization, water infiltration, biogeochemical cycling. In this study, both the edaphic and epigeic macrofauna communities were surveyed simultaneously to assess responses induced by the expansion of sugarcane cultivation over extensive pastures and to investigate whether the magnitude of such responses to LUC differs according to the community niche (i.e., soil profile versus surface). We hypothesized that LUC to a semi-perennial crop such as sugarcane would increase the density and diversity of the edaphic macrofauna, while the epigeic community would be negatively affected by LUC due to drastic changes in surface litter. The studied areas were two sites varying in soil texture (i.e., clay versus sandy soils) each including the following land uses: i) native vegetation, ii) extensive pasture, iii) newly planted sugarcane crop (sugarcane); and iv) established sugarcane (sugarcane ratoon). To evaluate edaphic macrofauna the TSBF methodology was adopted, while pitfall traps were installed at the same sampling points to collected epigeic macrofauna. The evaluated community attributes were density, Shannon diversity index, evenness index, richness of soil macrofauna taxa, as well as the chemical and physical attributes of the soil. Linear mixed effects analysis showed that LUC affected the relative abundance of edaphic (Land use p = 0.1191 r2 marginal = 0.28, r2 conditional = 0.33) and epigeic (Land use p = 0.0176; r2 marginal = 0.22, r2 conditional = 0.32) macroinvertebrates. Both groups showed the greatest density of organisms under native vegetation. Coleoptera and earthworms were associated with pasture areas, especially in clayey soil. Response ratios of LUC effects on macrofauna showed stronger responses of the epigeic compared to edaphic macrofauna, indicating a greater sensitivity of surface-dwelling organisms and their functions to disturbances such as those caused by LUC. In general, the density and diversity of macrofauna exhibited a positive correlation with soil organic matter, microbial carbon and nitrogen, macroporosity, and total porosity, and a negative correlation with soil density (p < 0.05). Also, the conversion of pasture to sugarcane cultivation (planting) causes significant macrofauna losses, particularly, in the clay soil. The cultivation of ratoon sugarcane led to a reduction of the density, taxonomic richness, diversity, and evenness of macrofauna. Given the importance of epigeic macroinvertebrates for litter fragmentation and decomposition, these results may indicate a rapid loss of key soil functions related to decomposition and carbon and nutrient cycling following LUC. © 2023",Biodiversity and Soil functions and Soil health and Soil management and Sugarcane and TSBF,10.1016/j.ejsobi.2023.103514,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163780887&doi=10.1016%2fj.ejsobi.2023.103514&partnerID=40&md5=83be223e1e8e08da251a1683fa589ce6,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 5,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,JUL-AUG,1164-5563 and 1778-3615,WOS:001024934600001,JUN 2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1481, 3611"

The process began by creating a theoretical NPF using a ‘systems thinking’ approach. Subsequently, a ‘system dynamic model’ was built based on an extensive review of the literature and on multiple quantitative datasets to simulate the impacts of the NPF, specifically focusing on the conversion of forests into open land for ranching and the implementation of soil management practices as a macro-level policy aimed at preserving soil quality and ranching yields. Various fallow scenarios were tested to simulate their effects on deforestation patterns. The results indicate that implementing fallow practices as a policy measure could reduce deforestation rates while simultaneously ensuring sustainable long-term agricultural productivity, thus diminishing the necessity to clear new forest land. Moreover, when combined with payments for avoided deforestation, such as REDD+ carbon offsets, the opportunity costs associated with ranching land can be utilized to compensate for the loss of gross income resulting from the policy. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the significance of different model variables, revealing that lower cattle prices require resources for REDD+ payments, and vice-versa. The findings indicate that, at the macro level, payments between USD 2.5 and USD 5.0 per MgC ha−1 have the potential to compensate the foregone cattle production from not converting forest into ranching land. This study demonstrates that employing an IAM with a systems approach facilitates the participation of various stakeholders, including farmers and landowners, in policy discussions. It also enables the establishment of effective land use and management policies that mitigate deforestation and soil degradation, making it a robust initiative to address environmental, climate change, and economic sustainability issues. © 2023 by the authors.",Amazon deforestation and REDD+ and soil conservation and systems modeling and systems thinking and Amazonia and Brazil and deforestation and fallow and sensitivity analysis and soil conservation and soil management and soil quality and sustainability,10.3390/su151512099,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167874771&doi=10.3390%2fsu151512099&partnerID=40&md5=a0a4176d9849cad32764daf243a586dd,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 1,NA,JOUR,15,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1488

These areas are of different ages, post-harvest of Pinus taeda L. stands, within the Araucaria Forest, which is part of an important global hotspot for biodiversity conservation. We evaluated the floristic composition of the seed rain and the measurement of the litter supply at five different ages of the restoration process, for one year. The efficiency of these indicators was defined by means of a classification based on aspects and descriptors. We hypothesized that these two indicators are suitable for assessing and monitoring the restoration trajectory and can describe the reestablishment of ecological processes in anthropized areas. These indicators are important because they determine the restoration of the functionality of altered ecosystems. The results showed that both are good indicators, mainly due to the sensitivity and scale criteria, since the indicators showed seasonal differences in the evaluated period.

To bridge this knowledge gap and address erosion-induced soil and water losses and considering intrinsic impacts of soil structure, a three-year-long study was conducted focused on three dominant soil types (Typic Hapludult, Typic Dystrudept, and Typic Usthortent) combined with different land uses (native forest, eucalyptus plantation, rotational grazing, and extensive grazing) in a critical water supply region for the São Paulo metropolitan area in Southeastern Brazil. Surface runoff, evaluated for erosion resistance, was measured using the Cornell infiltrometer, and soil electrical resistivity tomography estimated soil water content to a depth of 1.5 m for groundwater recharge analysis. Soil hydraulic properties were also measured. The results revealed that native forest soils had higher hydraulic conductivity, particularly in the surface layer, compared to eucalyptus and pastures. Native forests in Typic Hapludult showed a higher runoff rate (200 to 250 mm h−1) due to a naturally dense subsoil layer that negatively impacted water infiltration and recharge with a high erosion potential, therefore reducing the amount of water stored. Typic Usthortent maintained a higher soil water content in pastures than in other land uses and also showed a low rate of water infiltration, resulting in perched water in the surface layer. In Typic Dystrudept, the native forest presented higher hydraulic conductivity (0–5 cm: 115.9 cm h−1) than eucalyptus (0–5 cm: 36.4 cm h−1), rotational grazing (0–5 cm: 19.4 cm h−1), and extensive grazing (0–5 cm: 2.6 cm h−1), but there were no significant differences in soil water content among land uses. This work illustrates the crucial role of native forests in affecting deep water recharge, reducing the soil surface erosion, mainly in soils without naturally subsoil layer, maintaining recharge potential. For Ultisols, pastures preserved soil structure and are therefore less impacted by soil management. With these results, a contribution is made to soil and water conservation, providing support for sustainable management practices in erosion-prone areas. © 2023 by the authors.",ecosystem services and erosion resistance and groundwater recharge and land use and soil security and Brazil and climate change and deep water and ecosystem service and groundwater and hydraulic conductivity and infiltration and land use change and metropolitan area and recharge and runoff and soil structure and soil surface and soil water and subsoil,10.3390/su151813395,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173052617&doi=10.3390%2fsu151813395&partnerID=40&md5=6128f8208fe0266ae0fe6fd775c040cb,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 2,NA,JOUR,18,NA,NA,NA,SEP,2071-1050,WOS:001145339100001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1497, 4601"

The Iron Quadrangle region of southeastern Brazil is one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots; however, iron mining activities threaten many natural and seminatural ecosystem types in which many rare/protected species occur. The Iron Quadrangle has four main ecosystem types: Atlantic Forest (AF), ferruginous rupestrian grassland with dense vegetation (FRG-D); ferruginous rupestrian grassland with sparse vegetation (FRG-S); and quartzite rupestrian grassland (QRG). To support rehabilitation and monitoring plans, we evaluated reference areas and identified soil and vegetative attributes that best differentiated between these four ecosystems. We measured thirty-four physical, chemical, and biological soil properties and two vegetation parameters and, using a multivariate analysis, detected: 1) correlations between properties and 2) differences between areas. We identified twelve properties that best differentiated the areas (in order from most to least relevant): nickel content; exchangeable aluminum; clay content; above-ground vegetation volume; aluminum saturation; particle density; bulk density; arsenic content; zinc content; lead content, fine sand plus silt content; and fine sand content. Soil physicochemical properties proved to be more sensitive to differences in ecosystem type, and in particular, parameters related to fertility and the presence of metals and semi-metals differentiated the AF from the FRG-D and FRG-S. Soil physical properties, including fine sand and silt content, were most important for differentiating QRG from the other ecosystems, possibly resulting from the exposure of quartzite material to erosive processes.

However, sea-level rise can affect mangroves' protective role by increasing exposure to coastal hazards and economic costs. To better understand the role of mangroves as coastal protective barriers against hazards and their importance for conservation planning in the face of sea-level rise, we first analyzed temporal changes in the coastal landscape by measuring the erosion/accretion rates on the shoreline. We assessed coastal exposure to hazards with the presence and absence of mangroves. Finally, we estimated the economic losses and costs from the long-term retreat in the shoreline and mangrove loss. This study was carried out along the western coast of the South Atlantic, in the northeast Brazilian region. Coastal exposure indices were estimated using the Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) software, and the multitemporal analysis of shoreline was developed using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) software. Finally, the economic losses produced by those shoreline changes and social costs were estimated by predicting economic losses in terms of private property and by calculating societal costs in mangrove restoration and rockfill building. The results show that nearly a third of the shoreline is experiencing erosion and the coast could lose an additional 118 ha by 2030. In terms of the value of property loss, this translates to US$38,800 and would increase to US$72,000 under the maximum erosion rate scenario. Based on our coastal vulnerability assessment, almost 50 km of the coastline (20%) would transition to intermediate-high exposure levels if the current distribution of mangroves were to be lost. It is expected to cost about US$145 million in rockfill works and US$21 million in forest restoration to mitigate the impacts from human activities and sea-level rise on mangroves ecosystem services. At the national level, a total loss of mangroves in Brazil could mean mangrove forest restoration costs of nearly US$4000 million. More robust conservation policies are needed to conserve mangrove forests and safeguard the ecosystem-service co-benefits they provide. The latter is essential in low- and middle-income nations where the economic and welfare losses from coastal hazards are more challenging due to dependence on nature for livelihoods and well-being. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Climate change and Coastal exposure to Hazards and Ecosystem services and InVEST and Shoreline erosion and Atlantic Ocean and Brazil and Climate change and Conservation and Cost estimating and Ecosystems and Forestry and Hazards and Losses and Restoration and Sea level and Coastal exposure and Coastal exposure to hazard and Coastal hazards and Economic costs and Economic loss and Ecosystem services and Environmental services and Integrated valuation of environmental service and tradeoff and Sea level rise and Shoreline erosion and climate change and coastal protection and conservation planning and ecosystem service and mangrove and restoration ecology and risk assessment and shoreline change and vulnerability and Erosion,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106353,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138091375&doi=10.1016%2fj.ocecoaman.2022.106353&partnerID=40&md5=e634d161e65faddb86f96771964dd65b,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 13,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,OCT 1,0964-5691 and 1873-524X,WOS:000911793600002,SEP 2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1502, 4072"

Soil chemical properties, soil biota community composition, and litter traits of V. vinifera plantation were compared with an adjacent natural ecosystem (e.g., Mixed Ombrophilous Forest) from September 2019 to June 2021. Litter decay rate and priming effect was estimated by using native tree residues on litter bags in both studied environments. We also assessed the influence of soil biota on decay rate through a litterbag assay. Our results showed that both studied environments differed in soil chemical properties and soil biota community composition. However, in the V. vinifera plantation litter decay rate, and priming effect were higher, due to the presence and activities of soil organisms from Collembola - Paronellidae. Thermal amplitude, litter quality, and soil organisms’ activity were the main factors contributing to the data variance.

These crops are cultivated under the shade of the canopy of native trees, a system locally known as the “cabruca” agroforestry system. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship of Odonata assemblages (adults and larvae) in cocoa farming areas and to identify the relationships of these species with local and spatial environmental variables of the monitored sites. Altogether, adult and larvae were sampled at 22 sites. Physical and physicochemical water variables were recorded for each site. A total of 1336 dragonflies were collected, of which 20 were Zygoptera species and 30 were adult Anisoptera representatives. The different life stages were related to environmental variables such as conductivity, watercourse channel width, and dissolved oxygen. The space predictors were also associated with the assemblages, mainly for adults. The present study identified that cabruca areas maintain a great diversity of dragonflies, including species that are considered to be forest specialists and more sensitive to landscape changes. The characteristics of this cropping system are considered to be favorable for the conservation of the biodiversity of the Atlantic Forest. © 2022 by the authors.",Atlantic Forest and cabruca and dragonflies and land uses and Theobroma cacao and Atlantic Forest and Bahia and Brazil and agroforestry and breeding site and cocoa and conservation and dragonfly and environmental conditions and growth and land use and plant-insect interaction and spatial variation and species diversity and taxonomy,10.3390/d14110919,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141763743&doi=10.3390%2fd14110919&partnerID=40&md5=841cf88eb366764be886bde7d74395cc,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 6,NA,JOUR,11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1505

One still does not know the dimension of this hypothesis, but apparently, it is not despicable. This study evaluated the assemblage composition of fungi during litter decomposition in areas of Atlantic Forest invaded or not invaded by Tradescantia zebrina using Illumina MiSeq and metabarcoding analysis. Results: The invaded sample showed significantly higher richness and a difference in the species dominance than the invaded litter. Ascomycota was the first most abundant phylum in both areas. Even so, the dissimilarity between areas can be evidenced. The fungal from Basidiomycota were very representative in the non-invaded areas (ranged from an abundance of 43.29% in the non-invaded to 2.35% in the invaded sample). The genus Lepiota can indicate the primary functional group related to biomass degradation and showed the might difference about the invaded areas due to its essential reduction by the invader. In the invaded sample, there was a total absence of the endophyte-undefined saprotroph guild. Also, some genera not taxonomically characterized were eliminated in the invaded sample, revealing that the fungal biodiversity of areas has not yet been thoroughly characterized. Conclusions: Hence, makes impossible the real interpretation of the invasive plant impact, showing the importance of continuing research on fungal biodiversity.

Using quasi-experimental methods, we investigated the effects of one REDD+ project in the Brazilian Amazon on deforestation and people's well-being, including intra-community spillover effects (leakage). We then evaluated to what extent outcomes persisted after the project ended (permanence). This project combined Payments for Environmental Services (PES) with sustainable livelihood alternatives to reduce smallholder deforestation. Data came from face-to-face surveys with 113 households (treatment: 52; non-participant from treatment communities: 35; control: 46) in a three-datapoint panel design (2010, 2014 and 2019). Results indicate the REDD+ project conserved an average of 7.8% to 10.3% of forest cover per household and increased the probability of improving enrollees' well-being by 27–44%. We found no evidence for significant intra-community leakage. After the project ended, forest loss rebounded and perceived well-being declined – yet, importantly, past saved forest was not cleared. Therefore, our results confirm what the theory and stylized evidence envisioned for temporal payments on activity-reducing (‘set-aside’): forest loss was successfully delayed but not permanently eradicated. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Additionality and Climate change mitigation and Conservation incentives and Emission reductions and Impact assessment and Amazonia and Brazil and deforestation and forest cover and household survey and livelihood and probability and smallholder,10.1016/j.ecolecon.2022.107568,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135712097&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolecon.2022.107568&partnerID=40&md5=4949d7817c49a9c0c16b45b37fc29ea0,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 17,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NOV,0921-8009 and 1873-6106,WOS:000911284200014,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1510, 4461"

The study aimed to estimate the potential of carbon stocks in various types of agroforestry in the last 20 years in Senaru area, the sub district of Bayan, Northern Lombok. The study was conducted from June to August 2022. Different types of agroforestry managed on entisols include mahogany based agroforestry (Swietenia mahagoni), Cacao-based agroforestry (Theobroma cacao), Coffee-based agroforestry (Robusta Coffee), Sengon based- agroforestry (Albizia chinensis), and Porang-based agroforestry (Amorphophallus muelleri). Samples for measuring above ground biomass at each agroforestry were carried out on plot area of 20 m x 20 m. Samples for soil organic carbon (SOC) was carried out by collecting 4 composite soil samples at each type of agroforestry at soil depth of 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm. In addition to the soil organic-C, measurements were also made on soil bulk density, total porosity, and soil texture. The results of the study showed that the total carbon stocks varied under different types of agroforestry. Mahogany based agroforestry produced the highest total carbon stocks, 440.64 ton.ha-1, and subsequently, it was followed by sengon-based agroforestry, coffee, cocoa and porang with values of 371.54 ton ha-1, 305.33 ton ha-1, 166.15 ton ha-1 and 153.93 ton ha-1 respectively. Thus, to support sustainable agroforestry management in this area, it is important to consider the timber tree stands that potentially produce high biomass as well as the need to improve the diversity of high biomass vegetation in areas with low vegetation density. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",agroforestry and carbon sequestration and climate change and management and sustainable,10.1088/1755-1315/1160/1/012080,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160405800&doi=10.1088%2f1755-1315%2f1160%2f1%2f012080&partnerID=40&md5=2445c5f5de89378cc8e7435e4d62066c,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 3,NA,CONF,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1513

In Brazil, AFOLU-related NDC actions in its first version envisaged the elimination of, for instance: illegal deforestation in the Amazon region, the restoration and reforestation of 12 million hectares of severely degraded lands, and the substantial expansion of sustainably produced biofuels by 2030. While Brazilian Government commitment to these NDC targets soon vanished, a specific analytical question concerns as to how far sustainable land use scenarios can contribute to non-climate benefits (i.e., socioeconomic development) despite their internal challenges of harmonizing them with environmental protection and climate change mitigation. In this paper, we analyse the potential socioeconomic and environmental synergies and trade-offs in NDC implementation, given the possibility of the demand for land in Brazil increase due to agricultural and livestock expansion. We focus our analysis on GDP growth, income distribution, and food security. We do so by integrating land-use with computable general equilibrium (CGE) models and running policy scenarios, emulating different levels of NDC and development policy implementation. Our analysis helps us to understand how social and economic outcomes do change under varying levels of commitment by decision-makers. It shows that NDC implementation in Brazil is preferable to a business-as-usual development pathway, particularly when climate change is taken into consideration. While GDP and household income appear unaffected by NDC implementation, reducing the pressure over Amazon deforestation along with other social benefits appears under more stringent NDC implementation. Those results are particularly important given the significant upward trend in Amazon deforestation recorded in the last few years and the loss of purchasing power of low-income classes observed since 2015 in Brazil. In the AFOLU sector, NDC implementation, as in its first version, could thus act as entry points for alternative development pathways. For instance, such as the ones discussed under green economy or low carbon growth paradigms-although, possible trade-offs between agricultural and other sectors will still need to be closely monitored. © 2023, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

In Brazil, most of the invasion reports are related to terrestrial plants, being this forest the most affected. In this context is the Cantareira State Park (PEC), Sao Paulo. The PEC is home to a remnant that has a focus of invasion by several plant species, including Livistona chinensis (N.J. Jacquin) R. Brown ex Mart., known as Chinese Fan Palm. Given the potential for invasion of this species, a floristic-phytosociological study was conducted in order to analyse a possible inhibition effect in the natural regeneration process of the arboreous component caused by juveniles individuals of Livistona chinensis, with heights varying between 3 and 6 m. For each palm were installed 8 plots of 1 x 1 m, placed in quadrants, with the palm’s stipe in the center, in a way that half of the plots were placed under the canopy and half around the palm. In the analysis were considered arboreal and palms specimens ≥ 20 cm in height and with a Perimeter at Breast Height (PAP) ≤ 15 cm. The results pointed to a drastic reduced number of seedlings and saplings (28.95% and 29.85%) and of the species richness (16.13% and 8.33% of species) occurring under the canopies of these exotic palm trees in comparison with the surroundings (71.05% and 70.15% of the sampled individuals; and 61.29% and 58.33% of species, respectively). The study has shown the inhibiting effect of young individuals of this species on the forest regeneration in the PEC, by substantially reducing the richness of species and the abundance of arboreal individuals under the projection of their canopies, possibly because they serve as a shield and cause excessive shading of the place. © 2022, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

Our findings suggest that CAS has the potential to turn a profit in the future thanks to rising global and domestic market demand as well as environmental benefits like reducing carbon emissions and improving resource efficiency. However, several challenges should be addressed to improve coffee quality and sustain green economy activities, including product certification, collaboration with NGOs and business entities, and coordination of government policies at the site level. Overall, this study highlights the importance of CAS as a green economy approach in Indonesia and suggests policy recommendations to support its promotion and adoption.

The evaluations were carried out during the summer of 2020, which consisted of the collection of microclimate variables. The Mean Radiant Temperature (TMR, °C) was derived from the shaded and unshaded areas under the trees, and from that, the Radiant Heat Load (RHL, W m−2) was calculated as an index of thermal comfort. Solar radiation was estimated considering the sum of the direct, diffuse, and reflected components (W m−2), and carbon stock from trees biomass for CO2 sequestration was estimated from an allometric model applied to the native Cerrado tree species. The shade of the native trees reduced the meteorological variables such as dry bulb and black globe temperatures, to values considered adequate for the thermal comfort of animals, with an average reduction respectively equal to 1.3 °C and 6.4 °C. This represents a significant difference compared to the unshaded area as well as among tree species (P < 0.05), reflecting in lower values of TMR and RHL in the shaded area provided by each species. Carbon sequestration individually estimated by each native tree species was on average 8.85 Mg per tree.

Direct seeding is a low-cost restoration technique compared to nursery-raised seedling planting, but there is still a lack of information about restoration success in different savanna habitat types in Brazil. We tested direct seeding of six fruit tree species of the Brazilian Cerrado in a landscape compressed by five management regimes used by traditional farmers in a rural settlement in northern Minas Gerais State, Southeastern Brazil. We monitored germination, survival, growth and establishment for three years. Of the 9000 seeds planted, 18.7% germinated, 29.8% survived and 8.9% were established three years after sowing. Eugenia dysenterica (Mart.) DC. and Dypterix alata Vogel had higher germination, survival and establishment rates and are, thus, the most appropriate species. E. dysenterica showed high rates on native and managed Cerrado and D. alata in agroforestry system, hillside fields and lower field. The species studied are well adapted to conditions of water scarcity and low soil fertility. However, phosphorus concentration may be a limiting factor to species growth. Our results suggest that direct seeding of fruit tree species of the Cerrado is promising to some species, and to others, the sowing should be done with more seeds, or using nursery-raised seedling. The planting of fruit trees could be a practice that allow smallholders farmers to increase biodiversity at the same time that could contribute to their livelihoods. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Botanical Society of Sao Paulo.",Dypterix alata and Ecological restoration and Eugenia dysenterica and Savanna and Traditional farmers,10.1007/s40415-022-00831-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137918946&doi=10.1007%2fs40415-022-00831-2&partnerID=40&md5=d818a4e55c2040b12525c66523fb2e23,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,JOUR,3,1067,1080,NA,SEP,0100-8404 and 1806-9959,WOS:000852917100001,SEP 2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1522, 5104"

The present study proposes a Forest Fire Risk Indicator (FFRI) based on the Fire and Burn Risk Indicator (FBRI). The instrument was applied to the Sorocabuçu River Basin in São Paulo State, Brazil. The FBRI was initially obtained by using the factors that most contribute to the start or spread of fires according to the literature. These factors were later grouped into anthropogenic, topographic, land cover/land use, and climatic variables. The factors of each variable were classified into intervals to which a fire risk value was assigned ranging from 0 (null risk) to 1 (very high risk). By applying the Analytical Hierarchy Process, we obtained the final FBRI, after which the FFRI was created. The final FBRI showed predominantly high risks (64.78%) throughout the basin, as well as the FFRI (82.56%). The present study evidences that most forest fragments need measures for ecosystem protection.

Knowledge is still scarce about the growth and productivity of the tree component in ICLS, and there is a lack of long-term landscape-scale assessments about the provision of ecosystem services in ICLS. Our objective was to evaluate the monthly stem volume increment and productivity of Eucalyptus benthamii, at 7 years old, using metal dendrometer bands, for three different models of ICLS that integrate trees to the crop (crop–forestry—CF), livestock (livestock–forestry—LF), or both (crop–livestock–forestry—CLF) in southern Brazil. The form factor decreased while increasing age, with 0.516 at 4 years and 0.437 at 6 years after planting. In ICLS, we found the productivity of E. benthamii similar to the national averages for monoculture forestry in the United States and Brazil. At 6.5 years after planting, the average annual stem volume increment was 22.7 m3 ha−1 year−1 (LF), 24.6 m3 ha−1 year−1 (CLF) and 25.5 m3 ha−1 year−1 (CF), respectively. The CF production system provided trees with greater accumulated stem volume within 7 years of age. The LF system, on the other hand, provided trees with an equal increment in diameter, but less accumulated stem volume, and, therefore, smaller heights, suggesting that there is interference from cattle and pasture management on the growth and productivity of E. benthamii. ICLS are configured as an excellent possibility for vertical expansion of agricultural frontiers, promoting sustainable intensification, as well as can prevent horizontal expansion into new areas, reducing pressure on native forests, and contributing to combating deforestation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Agroforestry and Annual volumetric increment and Dendrometer band and Sustainable intensification and Vertical agricultural frontier and Brazil and United States and agroforestry and evergreen forest and forestry production and growth and mixed farming and monoculture and sustainability and volume,10.1007/s10457-022-00785-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140831696&doi=10.1007%2fs10457-022-00785-0&partnerID=40&md5=d3dc47e77918e9ff85e8de97bb895bda,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 4,NA,JOUR,1,45,57,NA,JAN,0167-4366 and 1572-9680,WOS:000874429800001,OCT 2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1526, 4839"

The study was carried out in native forest area (Subperennial Equatorial Forest) and cultivated area (annual species), in Porto Velho, Rondônia, Brazil. Samples were collected in two layers (0-10 and 10-20cm), on a Latossolo Vermelho-Amarelo, to evaluate microbial biomass by the fumigation-extraction (FE) method, as well as the chemical and physical soil attributes. It was possible to verify a significant increase in soil density and reduction of moisture and improvement of chemical attributes resulting from the use of the area. The organic matter content decreased sharply in the managed area (25%), compared to the forest, in the superficial layer (0-10cm). Microbial C-biomass under the native forest showed 54% higher mean value (883 μgC g-1) compared to the managed area (410 μgC g-1) in the superficial layer.

Agricultural intensification can lead to changes in land covers and livelihood opportunities and it remains unclear how such changes align or misalign with the desires of local communities. Using participatry mapping, we assessed ES uses and desires of Indigenous people and local communities provided by different land cover types along a gradient of agricultural intensification (forest subsistence, agroforestry mosaic, and monoculture and market-dependence) in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. We found that mapped ES use diversity was highest in the forest-dependent zone and lowest near monoculture agricultural systems. The expressed ES uses and desires varied greatly among land cover types amidst loss of old-growth forest and greater reliance on secondary forest and shrub land. The spatial analysis showed that high priority areas of ES use was related to access in the landscape, demonstrating the importance of attending to place-based social values in ES assessments. From this study, we call for a people-centric spatial modelling approach to address the divergence of social and cultural ES values associated with land covers under different intensification contexts.

We conduct a post-processing analysis using consolidated biodiversity indicators to emphasize how different IAM greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mitigation solutions present distinct positive and negative potential impacts on biodiversity in Brazil. However, our analysis does not consider the impacts associated with climate change, but only the risks imposed by mitigation policies. Our results indicate that biodiversity loss decreases in the scenarios from (1) to (3), implying that stronger climate change mitigation actions could result in smaller biodiversity losses.

Despite the recognized socio-ecological importance in providing essential ecosystem services (e.g., erosion prevention, protection against extreme weather events, provision of habitats for estuarine species, and blue carbon storage), mangroves have been converted from blue carbon sinks to sources. Here, we modelled and evaluated the spatial-temporal changes in blue carbon stocks and net sequestration potential in mangrove forests in Santos and São Vicente, Brazil, from 1988 to 2050. We used classified images obtained from MapBiomas and the InVEST Coastal Blue Carbon model, which quantifies the potential carbon sequestered in the study area based on changes in the land use and land cover over the determined study period. We found an increased trend in carbon stocks and net sequestration of mangroves in both municipalities. Over the analysis period, carbon stocks in the mangroves of the city of Santos increased 29% in total, while we found a smaller rise (14%) in São Vicente. We found that land use changed substantially during 1988 until 2018, with mangrove extent varying in the region from 3,375 ha in 1988 to 3,764 ha in 2018 within the entire study region.

To assess the taxonomic and functional composition we performed ordinations analysis with the vegetational data and using path analysis we assessed the causal relationships between variables of interest. Density of Butia odorata and woody plants were strongly positive related, suggesting a facilitation process in the establishment of arborescent plants on the grassland matrix. The abundance of less palatable plants and grazing pressure were inversely related, indicating a selection process induced by higher grazing intensity.

The importance of mangroves is particularly evident in Southeast (SE) Asia where the most extensive and diverse forests are found. To recover degraded mangroves, several SE Asian countries have implemented restoration programs. However, to date, there has been no systematic and quantitative synthesis on mangrove restoration studies in the region. Here, we provide a bibliometric-based analysis of mangrove restoration to provide understanding on trends and future directions needed to meet biodiversity and restoration targets in the region. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol, we analyzed 335 articles (249 articles with ecological attributes; 86 articles with social attributes) published until February 2022 from Scopus and Web of Science databases. Mangrove restoration studies with ecological and social attributes started around the early 1990s mostly from Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Majority of SE Asian countries have stronger collaboration to western countries rather than within the region. Reasons for restoration vary per country, but mostly were intended to rehabilitate damaged mangroves. Direct planting was the most common restoration method used while hydrological rehabilitation was less practiced. Research on ecological attributes were dominated by biodiversity-related studies focused on flora and fauna, and less on other ecosystem services (e.g., coastal protection, fisheries production, etc.). Studies with social attributes only accounted for <30% of the publications, mostly on topics related to ecological economics. Although mangrove restoration studies are apparent, some thematic restoration foci are needed. We propose priority research topics to help achieve the biodiversity and restoration targets by 2030.

Moreover, changes in seasons can influence the dynamic of SOM. Notably, the mechanisms involved in SOM stabilization and storage, particularly in agroforestry production areas, are still poorly explored. This study aimed to verify if the contents of soil organic carbon (SOC) and the physical fractions of the SOM are modified as a function of agroforestry systems implemented in the short term, and verify if seasonality can affect the compartmentalization of SOM in agrifood systems. Also, we tested if the carbon management index (CMI) is sensitive to detecting management practices quality across the unmanaged pasture, different agroforestry systems, and a reference area (forest). We measured soil physical properties, SOC content in bulk soil, particular organic carbon (POC), and mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) fractions at three different depths (0.00-0.05, 0.05-0.10, and 0.10-0.20 m) in response to the adoption of agroforestry systems. Our results show that after a short period of implementation of agroforestry systems, significant changes were observed in SOC contents and the physical fractions of SOM in the most superficial layers (0.00-0.05 and 0.05-0.10 m), with emphasis on the particulate fraction of SOM. We verified that the seasonality affected the SOC, POC, and MAOC contents. We also found that the CMI index was more sensitive and efficient in detecting changes arising from seasonality and the management practices involved.

In the Amazon soil, the communities of microorganisms are diverse and act in different biogeochemical activities relevant to their adaptation to the environment. The assessment of changes in soil microorganism communities is essential to consider the impact of agribusiness action in one of the wealthiest regions in diversity in the world. Thus, the soil microbial diversity of the Amazon forest, the north region of Brazil, was evaluated regarding the influence of soybean farming with regions with periods of two and 14 years of exploitation, with regions of pasture and forest area, through the metagenomics approach with new generation sequencing technology, in addition, it was considered chemical characteristics such as pH value, organic matter content, macronutrients, micronutrients, and cations. High microbial diversity was identified at all collection sites and, despite this, bacterial, archaeal, and virus communities were very diverse between sites, with higher identification of Enterobacter cloacae and species of Pseudomonas, Pseudoplusia includens, Methanosarcina barkeri in the farmed and pasture, whose microbial diversity is influenced by the presence of cations and the interaction of organic matter with clay. It was evident that there is a change in the communities of native microorganisms for others adapted in the areas that had their vegetal cover eliminated.

In the present study, we investigated how fish extinction driven by habitat loss may modify the functioning of freshwater Amazonian ecosystems. We sampled the fish and environmental conditions of 63 streams in the eastern Amazon and simulated extinction based on the vulnerability of the species to habitat loss, which is the principal threat to tropical biodiversity. The simulated extinction of vulnerable species led to a decrease in both the mean body size of the community and functional rarity and culminated in abrupt losses of ecosystem functions after 5% and 10% of extinction at local and regional scales. Our functional approach demonstrated the progressive loss of ecological functions in Amazon streams, which may collapse altogether following the extinction of functions related to protection against biological invasions, and associated alterations in nutrient cycling and water quality. We provide robust predictions on the modification of the ecosystem following the extinction of fish species, which is a major step toward the development of effective conservation measures that ensure the avoidance of the predicted processes, and help to prevent the loss of biodiversity and the potentially irreversible modifications to ecosystem functioning. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Deforestation and Effect traits and Land use and Mass extinction and Neotropics and Rarity and Animals and Biodiversity and Conservation of Natural Resources and Ecosystem and Extinction, Biological and Fishes and Rivers and Amazonia and Biodiversity and Conservation and Deforestation and Ecosystems and Fish and Water quality and Anthropocene and Conservation planning and Ecosystem functioning and Effect trait and Extinction risks and Habitat loss and Mass extinction and Mass extinction events and Neotropics and Rarity and Anthropocene and deforestation and fish and habitat loss and land use and mass extinction and Neotropical Region and paleoenvironment and rarity and stream and adult and aggression and Amazonas (Brazil) and Article and biodiversity and body size and burrowing species and climate and controlled study and dietary intake and electric fish and fish and freshwater environment and habitat loss and habitat structure and nonhuman and nutrient cycling and population abundance and sanguivore and seasonal variation and species extinction and stream (river) and water quality and animal and ecosystem and environmental protection and fish and river and species extinction and Land use",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156210,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130784196&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2022.156210&partnerID=40&md5=db4d57d6829082ecc191411080b918f0,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 5,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1547

Here, we assessed carbon-based incentives and incentives from full ecosystem services as a means of conserving peatlands in comparison with benefits from other existing types of land use. A benefit-cost analysis was conducted to determine the carbon price and assess the ecosystem services of peatlands with three land use options: conservation, clearing for oil palm plantations, and rubber plantations. Key informant interviews were conducted to analyze current land-use practices. Our results indicate that the peatland conservation option under the business-as-usual scenario would yield carbon pricing at US$0.03 tCO2−1. This is less than that obtained from the oil palm and rubber plantation options where pricing ranges from US$0.28–1.17 tCO2−1. Pricing for the peatland conservation option was US$24.8–26.8 tCO2−1 with the inclusion of full ecosystem services vis-à-vis US$47.6–148.96 tCO2−1 under plantation options. Nevertheless, internal rate of return for the conservation option was consistently higher than that for the plantation options. This suggests that the conservation option would be more attractive than plantation options when the discount factor is high.

Urban forests can alleviate air pollution by providing a surface for the dry deposition of particles and trace gases. To benefit from this environmental service and design future green structures, it is crucial to estimate the removal rate of air pollutants by trees. The removal rates of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) by urban trees were quantitatively assessed for the first time in Brazil. A big-leaf modeling approach was adopted, using the i-Tree Eco software. In situ dendrometric data, hourly PM2.5 concentrations, and meteorological variables were used as inputs to the model. PM2.5 removal fluxes ranged between 0.06 and 0.21 g/m2/year in three study areas with contrasting urban forestry conditions. The neighborhood with the greatest canopy cover and tree diversity had the highest removal rates. The evergreen character of the urban forest in the MASP possibly contributed to the relatively high PM2.5 removal fluxes, as compared to other cities around the world. Removal rates were higher in the austral summer, when high precipitation rates restricted the resuspension of deposited particles back to the atmosphere. When extrapolated to the whole metropolitan area, assuming homogeneous forestry conditions, the estimated PM2.5 removal rates were comparable to the magnitude of vehicular emissions, showing that air pollution removal by trees can be substantial in the MASP. The results demonstrate the contribution of urban trees to the improvement of air quality and can boost the development of public policies on urban afforestation in the MASP. © 2022, ABES - Associacao Brasileira de Engenharia Sanitaria e Ambiental.

Three different treatments were evaluated in which 29 native species with different area preparations were used, namely: Total manual mowing + residue burning + herbicide (T1); Total manual mowing + residue burning (T2); and Total manual mowing (T3). Each treatment had an area of 100m² (10x10m) and an interval between plots of 2 m. The survival of the individuals implanted in the direct seeding was evaluated, as well as the natural regeneration of the new individuals with Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) = 15 cm. As a result, after 16 years we can see the presence of 16 species and 106 individuals, as well as a Shannon’s diversity index of (H’) = 1.917 and Pielou’s index (P) = 0.691, demonstrating a low floristic diversity in the area. The species which stood out the most (most individuals) were: Joannesia princeps Vell. L.C.; Spondias venulosa (Engl.) Engl.; and Peltophorum dubium (Spreng.) Taub.

Short Communication: Diversity, biomass, and carbon stock of seagrass community in three coastal waters of Minahasa Peninsula, North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 24: 1793-1798. Seagrasses are well-known for their ecological and economic importance. However, just like any other ecosystem, seagrass meadows around the world are threatened by anthropogenic activities. This paper aimed to analyze the seagrass abundance (expressed as shoot density), richness, diversity, biomass, and carbon stocks in three locations in the Minahasa Peninsula of North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Transect survey techniques were conducted in Bajo, Bolsel and Bunaken. The study recorded 8 species across the three locations with Bolsel having the highest number of species (7), followed by Bajo (6) and Bunaken (4). Seagrass species differed significantly in terms of shoot density across the sampling locations in which denser shoots were observed for the eelgrass (Enhalus acoroides) at Bolsel while the other two species (Thalassia hemprichii and Cymodocea rotundata) were least abundant at the Bunaken site. Seagrass cover did not vary significantly between sites. With the exception of Bunaken, above-ground and below-ground biomasses, as well as carbon stock, did not differ among locations. The lower species diversity as well as above-ground biomass and carbon stocks in Bunaken were likely due to grazing by herbivores (e.g., fish and sea urchins) and tourism activities (e.g., boat traffic, diving, snorkeling). Grazing effects and human tourism activities should be included in future investigations to monitor the dynamics of seagrass biomass and carbon stocks in the area. This study provides baseline information that can be used to better manage the seagrass ecosystems, not only in the Minahasa Peninsula but in Indonesian waters and even beyond. © 2023, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

The readily releasable forms of nutrients present in this biowaste, such as phosphorus (P), along with their over application, can be detrimental to the environment, causing eutrophication. Pyrolysis, the thermal decomposition of organic materials at elevated temperature and low oxygen, seems to be a promising strategy to lower P release from biowastes such as biosolids. We pyrolyzed biosolids from various treatments and locations (Florida and Illinois; Galicia, Spain; and São Paulo, Brazil) to convert to biochar. Our objectives were (a) to use solid-state assessments, such as X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, and chemical assessments, such as water-soluble P (WSP), pH, Mehlich 3-extractable P (M3-P), total P (TP), and total Kjeldahl nitrogen, to evaluate changes caused by the conversion and (b) to compare P leaching potentials of biosolids and their corresponding biochars on two soils with varying P retention capacities. Pairwise comparisons indicated that biochar conversion significantly increased TP in the final material, but the absolute WSP decreased. However, M3-P remained the same after conversion to biochar. Cumulative P leached as a fraction of TP was greater for biosolids than their corresponding biochars. Two soils with contrasting P retention capacities predictably differed in P leaching behaviors as amended with biosolids and biochars. Differences suggest that future research could evaluate the efficacy of using mixtures of biosolids and biochar for a given soil to maintain soil fertility while reducing environmental P loss risk. © 2022 The Authors.

The Mount Hamiding Protection Forest is administratively located in North Halmahera District, North Maluku Province, Indonesia, and has a high biodiversity value with endemic flora and fauna. However, the management has not shown significant impacts in enhancing the welfare of the surrounding community, and there have been forest disturbances due to anthropogenic activities and vertical conflict. Hypothetically, the high level of social capital can support sustainable forest management and improve people's welfare, yet this has not been tested in the context of Mount Hamiding Protection Forest. Therefore, this research aimed to assess the social capital in community forest management in the Mount Hamiding Protection Forest. The quantitative survey was conducted in six villages in North Halmahera District, namely Wangongira, Efi-Efi, Mamuya, Togawa, Soakonora, and Roko. The elements of social capital assessed were trust, social norms, and social networks. The results showed that the level of community trust in the study area's six villages is in the medium category. However, the trust in the internal community is high, and trust in external stakeholders is medium. The communities in the six villages have overall high social norms. The social networks are high in Togawa, Soakonora, and Roko Villages, while the remaining villages have social networks in the medium category. Generally, the community around the Mount Hamiding Protection Forest area has a moderate social capital category due to a lack of participation and trust in written rules and government institutions. Therefore, the Forest Management Unit of North Halmahera District should strengthen the community's social capital to increase knowledge and understanding of written rules, trust in institutions, and network development through organization and participation. © 2023, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

However, some species can adapt to these changes. Wide-ranging species are expected to be less impacted by such changes, but they can occur in different domains with contrasting environmental conditions, resulting in different conservation statuses along their range. To understand whether a species will overall benefit or lose with global change, we evaluated the responses of a wide-ranging but a vulnerable bird (Crax fasciolata) to separate and combined effects of climate and land-use changes under different environmental policies in Brazil. Using ecological niche modeling and a land-use model within the Brazilian political context, we quantified climatic, habitat, and environmental suitability for Crax fasciolata under historical (2000) and future (2050) scenarios. Our findings showed that environmental suitability can increase for Crax fasciolata in Brazil in future, but these effects vary according to the domain and the specific future scenario considered. Climatically suitable areas will increase in all scenarios, and those environmental scenarios that include better habitat conditions will provide more environmentally suitable areas for Crax fasciolata. However, this increase comes from newly suitable areas in the Atlantic Forest and the Amazon, while the Pantanal, the Caatinga, and the Cerrado will lose environmental suitability due to native vegetation loss. Despite the availability of these new areas, reduced landscape permeability may hinder Crax fasciolata from reaching them. This reinforces the urgent call for public policies for native vegetation protection, reforestation, and effective deforestation control.

However, since this knowledge is dynamic, it is necessary to conduct studies that understand how cultural, sociodemographic and ecological factors can affect it. In this regard, the present study to assess the knowledge of farmers from different communities regarding plant species in forests of varying ages, as well as the sociodemographic and environmental perception factors that may influence them. Methods: The study was conducted in two rural communities in the municipality of José de Freitas, Piauí, Brazil. The research involved farmers who possess knowledge about forests of different ages, selected through the snowball sampling technique. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and guided tours for species collection. A total of 36 farmers participated in the study, including nine women and 27 men. Results:: Our study unveiled distinct plant species knowledge in rural communities for forests of varying ages, often tied to cultural contexts. Sociodemographic and environmental factors analysis revealed age and perceived forest regeneration time influenced early-stage plant knowledge. For late-stage plant knowledge, factors included fragment visits, perception of regeneration time, and their interaction. While communities had differing knowledge on early and late-stage plants, common explanatory factors emerged. Conclusions: The study suggests that in the studied communities, it's important to consider both age and current environmental experiences of farmers in LEK studies.

Modifications in the composition of biological communities are expected as a result of the loss and replacement of species due to global warming. Forest frugivorous birds already suffer from habitat loss and may disappear locally due to suitable area contraction or range shifts to novel areas, disrupting seed dispersal and consequently the functioning of natural ecosystems. Here, we investigate the impacts of different climate scenarios on alpha and beta diversities of forest frugivorous birds. Location: Central Corridor of the Atlantic Forest (CCAF), Brazil. Methods: We used ecological niche models to project species distribution of 68 frugivorous birds for the baseline and future (2050 and 2070) scenarios. We generated binary maps of suitable areas for each species by climate scenario to calculate alpha and beta diversities. Results: Most forest frugivorous birds were projected to lose suitable area, as a consequence of climate change, reducing alpha diversity in future scenarios and increasing temporal beta diversity, which is dominated by the nestedness component. In addition, species richness decreased from the east to the west portion of the CCAF, while differentiation of bird communities increased in the same direction, a pattern consistent across all climate scenarios evaluated. Main conclusions: Climate change may exert drastic alterations in the composition of frugivorous bird communities in the CCAF. As forest frugivorous birds are critical to seed dispersal of forest plant species, impoverishment of their communities can drastically affect forest regeneration, diversity, and structure in the decades to come. Therefore, a better comprehension of spatio-temporal changes in diversity patterns of frugivorous birds can help us to avoid the disruption of seed dispersal and its consequences, such as cascading effects that will trigger biodiversity loss in the CCAF. © 2022 The Authors.

The research was developed in the Environmental Protection Area-APA Tejupá, Corumbataí and Botucatu (SP, Brazil), where Mata Atlântica and Cerrado biomes occur. Based on the list of native species in the APA management plan, we identified those cited in the literature for their use as medicinal and food. To evaluate these species, those of interest for the public policies of the Brazilian government were selected, since they have already commercial potential. Finally, these species of interest were evaluated based on the parameters of sustainable use, to evaluate if their sustainable management is possible. Of the total of 735 species identified, 329 are edible plant and have medicinal uses. 219 of them are medicinal and 110 can be used as food. In addition, 68% of these species are trees, demonstrating the high diversity of species that could be used in forest restoration projects and agroforestry systems. However, of the total number of plant species detected, only 22 are included in public policies, and only 6 species have sufficient studies for sustainable exploitation in the studied region. Research and Public policies aimed at the management and use of native species should be reinforced, aiming to increase the set of species that can be used and provide benefits to the owners, in addition to ecological sustainability. © 2022, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

Recognition of the role of local communities and indigenous peoples is part of efforts to mitigate climate change and the current biodiversity crisis. The mapping of the contribution of local ecological knowledge in forest management approaches for biodiversity conservation is very important. This study aims to describes the contribution of local ecological knowledge (LEK) adaptation in conservation programs in Indonesia. This research method uses a qualitative approach with an ethnoecological strategy. The research locations were in three local communities in Indonesia, namely: the Nusa Lembongan community in Bali, the Tobelo community in Halmahera, Maluku, and the Urang Kanekes/Bedouin community in Lebak, West Java. Local ecological knowledge contributes to resilience in the face of climate change, and how indigenous peoples ensure harmony between social capital, the forest environment, and forest use can be of particular concern to face the challenge of achieving zero hunger. This is related to forest ecosystems managed by indigenous peoples showing better results in sustainability based on environmental and social sustainability principles. This study shows that forest management processes based on local ecological knowledge (LEK) can be an alternative approach to biodiversity conservation. Local ecological knowledge shows an emphasis on the ongoing process of experience-based knowledge in communities that utilize the environment. The contribution of studies on LEK adaptation as dynamic knowledge can be used as a more flexible conservation approach and evaluation of forest conservation programs in Indonesia in relating to ecosystem adaptation. The finding of this study was important to LEK integration into the conservation program so it will become more adaptive and flexible to the changes. Understanding the dynamic characterization of LEK has benefit to conservation program that is based on community and participatory. © 2023 Universitatea ""Alexandru Ioan Cuza"" din Iasi.

Data from the case studies were compiled by the authors. In Zanzibar, secondary data were obtained through a previous project, which included a stakeholder workshop in Zanzibar (in 2019) and one deliverable published by the IUCN on Zanzibar of their catalogue “Aquaculture and Marine Conservation”. In Indonesia, the original data were provided by the Blue Natural Capital Funding Facility (BNCFF) and the associated local teams. The analysis of the data, the information provided, and the scoring itself were done by the authors, in association with local teams in both areas. The results of the two assessments, discussed in the paper and presented in detail in the Supplementary materials, can be considered original research, never previously published in a scientific journal. The concept of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) was proposed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to protect, restore, and sustainably manage natural and modified ecosystems for achieving a variety of societal benefits. The IUCN released the IUCN Global Standard for NbS™ to help design, assess, strengthen, and upscale NbS interventions. In the current context of growing uncertainties for the future of coastlines and oceans, aquaculture has been recognized as a positive activity for achieving sustainable development in coastal communities; supporting food security, poverty alleviation, and economic resilience; and contributing to the conservation of marine ecosystems in some cases. However, the sustainability of aquaculture systems has often been criticized. Aquaculture initiatives in coastal areas can achieve both nature conservation and sustainable development objectives, but reflection on the conditions under which this would happen is needed. This article examines aquaculture systems through the lens of the NbS concept and the IUCN Global Standard for NbS™, along with other sustainability concepts and instruments currently used in the context of aquaculture. The application of the IUCN Global Standard for NbS™’s to two case studies is explored: seaweed farming in Zanzibar in marine conservation areas and shrimp farming coupled with mangrove restoration in Indonesia. The results show that the NbS concept underpinning the IUCN Global Standard for NbS™ could help in the overall assessment of aquaculture systems and improve their sustainability by highlighting both their positive outcomes and issues requiring further examination in relation to marine biodiversity benefits, socio-economic development, and/or governance. The IUCN Global Standard for NbS™ could provide an operational framework to implement existing concepts, such as the Ecosystem Approach to Aquaculture, contribute to clarifying critical issues in aquaculture development, and provide guidance for the development of a new type of aquaculture project, specifically designed as NbS. This finding advocates the context-dependent exploration and promotion of aquaculture projects as NbS.

With seventy-eight municipalities that fully or partially integrate the GBBR, the socioeconomic differences and the different contexts of urbanization and governance reflect on territorial management at the local level and impact the environmental and regional sustainable development agendas. Objective: Based on a survey of environmental policies and correlations between economic and socio-environmental indicators on a municipal scale for the entire study area, this article assesses the level of development of the main environmental public policies and identifies the relationship between these policies and socio-environmental indicators. Originality: Although the Green Belt Biosphere Reserve is an area recognized by the United Nations (UN), the management of its territory depends on municipal actions that comprise it. Little attention has been paid to environmental management, especially in terms of public environmental policies and a broad and ongoing understanding of the conservation of this area. Results: The analysis shows that the different municipalities in the GBBR have different levels of implementation regarding Environmental Agenda. When considering the Municipal Plans for Urban Afforestation, Adaptation to Climate Change, Atlantic Forest and Solid Waste, only Guarujá, Mogi das Cruzes, Santos and São Paulo have these four policies in preparation or completed, while for 33.3% (n=25) of the municipalities, none of these agendas was developed, and a positive correlation was identified between the HDI and the largest number of implemented policies. Contribution: Large and medium-sized cities in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, present studies addressing ecological patterns and processes, however, they do not address specific questions on the environmental sector itself, which this paper aimed at providing. Conclusion: As the Green Belt accounts for 72% of the volume of drinking water in all of São Paulo, the disparities between the municipal indicators analyzed reinforce the need to adopt the GBBR as a platform for adequate governance to integrate policies at different scales for sustainable regional development. Systemic efforts are needed, especially at the municipal scale, in order to carry out adequate environmental management of the GBBR territory. © 2023 Universidade Nove de Julho-UNINOVE.

In the last 20 years, drainage of Asian peat soil has increased to satisfy the demand of land for plantation agricultures. Industrial oil palm plantations occupy large areas of peatland in Indonesia and Malaysia, with associated GHG emissions and biodiversity loss, here referred to as nature occupation impact. This study performs a detailed Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of 1 kg of palm oil for two case studies: PT SMART's Hanau and Sungai Rungau facilities in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. The objective is to quantify the reduction in GHG emissions and nature occupation that has been achieved by implementing the following industry-driven measures: reducing the area of cultivated peat soil, reducing the peat drainage depth, and setting aside part of the land-bank for nature conservation. The results show that 1 kg of palm oil causes 2.72 and 2.25 kg CO2-eq./kg palm oil from Hanau and Sungai Rungau facilities respectively. These are 20%–34% lower than average RSPO certified palm oil and 49%–58% lower than average non-certified palm oil. Sungai Rungau achieves the reduction mainly due to a completely peat soil-free supply base. Hanau's peat emissions are instead 0.28 kg, compared to the 0.77 and 2.36 kg CO2-eq for RSPO certified and non-certified palm oil respectively, due to a very low drainage depth (18–25 cm compared to 57–73 cm in average of RSPO certified and non-certified respectively) and an overall lower share of oil palms on peat land. The impact on nature occupation is 24%–43% lower in Hanau and Sungai Rungau compared to non-certified oil and 4%–29% lower compared to RPSO certified respectively. About 8% of the total land bank of the Hanau supply-base has been set aside for nature conservation, reducing GHG emissions by 2% and nature occupation by 9%.

1576,Scopus,Book chapter,"Singh, S. and Kumari, T.",2023,Fire and Ecophysiological Responses of Tropical Plants,Ecophysiology of Tropical Plants: Recent Trends and Future Perspectives,NA,NA,"On a global scale, fire has a key ecological role in the establishment of several regions and ecosystems. It is a strong natural and evolutionary force that controls organism characteristics, population density, species interactions, community dynamics, nutrient cycles, and ecological functions. However, as a result of global climate and land-use changes, fire regimes have changed, increasing in intensity and extent, with an increased likelihood of such events occurring in the near future. Fires can affect the availability of water and nutrients in a forest ecosystem, promoting ecophysiological responses of plants in both the short and long terms. Assessing consequences of such events on forest ecophysiology presents a substantial challenge to the community due to their complex nature, which includes the fact that they are frequently unpredictable and may have effects that are drastically disproportionate to the duration of the stress. Globally, recent studies have made significant progress in our knowledge of the physiological mechanisms that occur in trees after fires and in understanding how fire injuries might affect these disturbances in different ecosystems. However, little emphasis has been placed on the physiological systems that drive plant responses to severe events in the tropical environment. Therefore, understanding how fires affect plants is essential for tropical ecosystems because: (1) such ecosystems have been impeded by anthropogenic fires for centuries; and (2) appropriate management of these ecosystems is necessary to save terrestrial biodiversity around the globe in order to cope up with the environmental changes. Thus, the aim of the chapter is to predict how plants will respond to fire damage by exploring fire-induced ecophysiological processes, the underlying mechanisms, and adaptation strategies. Understanding physiological plant responses is essential for more accurately assessing post-fire ecosystem dynamics and interactions with climatic perturbations, especially in light of anticipated increases in fire frequency and severity caused by climate change. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Sachchidanand Tripathi, Rahul Bhadouria, Pratap Srivastava, Rishikesh Singh, Rajkumari Sanayaima Devi; individual chapters, the contributors.",NA,10.1201/9781003335054-19,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173844364&doi=10.1201%2f9781003335054-19&partnerID=40&md5=379dc3e89c9132dbee5fb7698a68db56,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,CHAP,NA,161,174,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1576

Here we assess the induced Land-Use Change (LUC) implications of producing bio-SAFs in Brazil under different assumptions of forest conservation governance. We evaluate four bio-SAF routes via two main pathways: the Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) and the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) syntheses. We chose the most promising agriculture-based feedstocks to produce bio-SAFs in all five macro-regions of Brazil, including sugarcane and maize ethanol to jet and palm and macaw HEFA routes. To this end, we calculated future projections of air transport demand in Brazil and used the Brazilian Land Use and Energy Systems integrated assessment model to estimate LUC greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within five different levels of bio-SAF blends (10% to 50% of total aviation fuel demand) for each bio-SAFs evaluated. Estimated cumulated emissions vary widely, ranging from a carbon sequestration of −286.8 gCO2e.MJ−1 for a 10% blend of maize ATJ under a controlled deforestation scenario to a release of 15.0 gCO2e.MJ−1 for a 40% blend of high productivity macaw oil HEFA considering historical deforestation rates in the country. Results are highly sensitive to deforestation rate parameters, volume of bio-SAFs produced, the type of feedstock used, and methodological assumptions. Negative LUC GHG emissions were found under controlled deforestation assumptions and in low blends of bio-SAFs for maize and sugarcane ATJ routes. Under historical deforestation rates, the LUC GHG emissions are higher. Bio-SAF can be beneficial to reduce GHG emissions if effective land conservation policies are implemented. Therefore, large-scale bio-SAF production from sugar crops in Brazil may play an important role in the decarbonisation of the aviation sector if coupled with successful strategies to control deforestation. Additionally, when imposing bio-SAF demand, other biofuels demand reduces under the model optimal solution due to land restrictions. © 2023 The Author(s).

Our approach provides the first approximation of the economic, natural capital and ecosystem services impacts of a tipping point, and evidence to build the economic case for strategies to avert it. For the five Amazon focal countries, namely, Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia and Ecuador, we find that a tipping point would create economic losses of US$256.6 billion in cumulative gross domestic product by 2050. Policies that would contribute to averting a tipping point, including strongly reducing deforestation, investing in intensifying agriculture in cleared lands, climate-adapted agriculture and improving fire management, would generate approximately US$339.3 billion in additional wealth and a return on investment of US$29.5 billion.

This study is of paramount importance for long-term climate change mitigation efforts, as it aims to estimate carbon storage and assess land cover density in Selo Resort forest area of Mount Merbabu National Park (MMbNP), Central Java, Indonesia, utilizing remote sensing techniques. Sentinel 2A satellite imagery, acquired on May 28, 2023, serves as the foundational dataset for this research. Employing ArcGIS 10.5, the satellite imagery was processed to derive the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a critical parameter in this analysis. The NDVI values were subsequently employed to categorize land cover density, leading to the classification of land into five distinct classes: non-vegetation, shrubs, low density, medium density, and high density. This classification process enabled the determination of land cover density. The calculated values for each density class, namely low, medium, and high-density land cover, revealed substantial carbon storage potentials: 12,357.99 tons C, 92,871.04 tons C, and 73,542.06 tons C, respectively. Moreover, the computed areas for low, medium, and high-density cover were 202.59 ha, 364.93 ha, and 348.26 ha, respectively. This study underscores the need for ongoing monitoring to detect changes in land cover and to implement afforestation initiatives in areas with low-density vegetation. Such efforts are crucial for the preservation of land cover and the associated carbon storage benefits, thereby contributing to broader climate change mitigation strategies. © 2023, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

Our objectives were: 1) to assess land use effects on AMF spore density, diversity, and composition besides glomalin fractions (EEG, easily extracted GRSP; TG, total GRSP), and 2) to quantify the relationships between glomalin, AMF community metrics, soil organic carbon (SOC), and key soil quality parameters. Soils were collected in the dry and rainy seasons of 2018 under five land uses, including: three types of agroforestry systems (AS1, AS2 and AS3), an unmanaged pasture and a secondary forest in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Linear mixed-effects model and multivariate analyses showed that land uses had influenced the AMF community, meanly at the family level. On the other hand, seasonality has not proved to be an essential factor that modulates the changes of the AMF community and glomalin production. The management practices had influenced AMF sporulation and the number of total species in agroforestry systems. Glomalin is a potential contributor for SOC, mainly in agroforestry systems and pasture plots. Moreover, we found a correlation between the AMF community and key soil parameters. For example, most of the AMF families and spore density were positively correlated with the stability of soil aggregates and SOC. Our findings shed light on that land-use change can shift the AMF community, glomalin and their relationship to key soil quality parameters. Moreover, the adoption of agroforestry systems indicates maintenance of biodiversity and other soil quality parameters with future implications for their use to recover degraded areas. © 2022",Seasonality and Soil biological indicators and Soil quality and Rio de Janeiro and agroforestry and arbuscular mycorrhiza and bioindicator and community structure and ecosystem function and fungus and land use change and protein and seasonality and secondary forest and soil aggregate and soil ecosystem and soil organic matter and soil quality,10.1016/j.actao.2022.103815,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123777416&doi=10.1016%2fj.actao.2022.103815&partnerID=40&md5=155a990a15f4a27e00fd7d24c61dde99,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 13,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAY,1146-609X and 1873-6238,WOS:000820423700001,FEB 2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1603, 5171"

The study identified areas in the Rio de Janeiro State (RJS) with varying degrees of susceptibility to fire focis using remote sensing data derived from topographic, anthropogenic, meteorological, and hydrological factors based on seasonality and integrated into geographic information systems. The analytical hierarchy process was used as a method of integration and normalized hierarchy of variables, generating susceptibility maps in the annual, summer, and winter periods in the RJS’s hydrographic regions (HR), with the application of the associated chi-square test to records of fire focis from the AQUA satellite, period 2003 to 2017, without methodological variation for data acquisition, whose susceptibility was classified as very low to very high. The results show that the years with the most fire foci in the adopted time series are 2007 and 2014, with a peak in September and a fall from October onwards. According to the susceptibility map, 9% of the RJS is highly susceptible during the annual period, with HR-IX being especially vulnerable. In the summer, 0.2% of RJS is extremely vulnerable, while 32% is highly vulnerable in the winter, with 6402 km2 of HR-IX areas being extremely vulnerable. A statistical correlation was discovered between the chi-square test and susceptible areas.

If forests, the area with the most vegetation cover are decrease, the amount of carbon sequestered will decrease significantly. Currently, agroforestry systems or Talun (in West Java) in Sumedang was eleven times larger than secondary forest. Carbon stocks in this agricultural area need to be estimated so that their carbon sequestration capacity can be known in order to improve the quality of regulatory ecosystem services. NDVI value of the Landsat 8 OLI was obtained by conducting raster calculation in ArcMap. Field inventory was conducted by measuring stem DBH and height of all vegetation stands in 31 plots measuring 30 x 30 m, a similar plot size to the resolution of the Landsat imagery. Biomass of vegetation stands was calculated using allometric equations and then converted into the carbon content of the biomass. In order to analyze the correlation of NDVI and carbon inventory data, a Pearson product-moment correlation analysis in the form of simple linear regression, non-linear exponential, and polynomial order 2 and order 3 model were carried out. Standard error of estimate (SEE) was performed to identify the best equation to model the aboveground carbon stocks in the area. The results show that the four regression models give a positive correlation between NDVI and carbon stocks. The strongest category was the polynomial order 2 and order 3 regression model with 0.795 coefficient of determination. Yet, the linear simple regression model obtained the highest accuracy with estimated error 0.445 tons/pixel. The estimated carbon stock obtained by linear regression model was 16150.40 tons with an average of 104.95 tons/ha.

Although soils are directly or indirectly responsible for diverse ecosystem services in mangrove ecosystems, few studies have focused on the recovery of soil functions (e.g., carbon sequestration) after mangrove replanting. This study aimed to evaluate the recovery of soil processes associated with Fe, S, and C dynamics and its implications for the restoration of soil functions. Two mangrove sites under replanting initiatives were studied along the Brazilian coast (i.e., NE and SE). The study was conducted in 3-and 7-year-old replanted mangrove forests, and a comparison was made with degraded and mature mangroves. Particle size, soil C stocks, Fe forms, total Fe and S contents, degrees of pyritization of Fe, and mineralogical assemblages were assessed. Seven years after replanting, soil C stocks increased by 42% and 29% in mangrove soils from the NE and SE sites, respectively. In addition, significant increases were observed in fine particles, reactive Fe, and pyrite contents in replanted plots. These new conditions promoted organic matter accumulation, stabilization, and potential metal retention.

For so, we carried out a clipping experiment over a natural area of subtropical grassland in southern Brazil. The plots were submitted during three years to three different clipping frequencies (high, intermediate, and low) to simulate defoliation caused by grazing. We found the highest aboveground biomass accumulation and detritivore activity in the low defoliation frequency, which also promoted the dominance of tussocks. The synergies between higher vegetation height and biomass tend to provide microclimatic conditions that favors decomposition, which releases nutrients to plants, promoting their growth.

Merang-Kepahyang PHUs in South Sumatra cover a total area of approximately 1.094 km2, comprising three watersheds, namely Merang (360.3 km2), Buring (458.5 km2), and Kepahyang (275.3 km2). This area is globally known as a carbon (C)-rich ecosystem. However, there is still a lack of understanding of the C cycle in this area, primarily associated with land use and cover changes. This study spatially estimates belowground carbon stocks and relates them to land elevation, land use, and soil unit. To reduce inaccurate estimates, the volume of the peat is discretized by a 200 m × 200 m grid as a grid based analysis. This assessment aimed to obtain the baseline data with particular attention to provide information on the peat carbon and its spatial distribution in each watershed. We conducted field surveys and image analysis based on SPOT 6 (1.5 m/pixel with raster format 200 m/pixel) to produce interpolated data and maps of land use, soil unit, land elevation, peat thickness, and peat carbon. We found that the land elevation ranged from 1.5 to 13.0 m-MSL in Merang, from 1.1 to 13.5 m-MSL in Buring, and from 0.2 to 11.6 m-MSL in Kepahyang. Peat thickness in ranged from 1.3 m to 12.9 m in Merang, from 0.8 m to 13.2 m in Buring, and from 0.4 m to 11.4 m in Kepahyang. Peat carbon was 220 Mt in Merang, 225.8 Mt in Buring, and 116.8 Mt in Kepahyang. On average, peat carbon density was 6.11 kt ha−1 in Merang, 4.92 kt ha−1 in Buring, and 4.24 kt ha−1 in Kepahyang. The cumulative area covering the peat with a thickness greater than 3 m was 334.9 km2 (93%) in in Merang, 379.4 km2 (83%) in Buring, and 193.9 km2 (70%) in Kepahyang. There is a relationship between carbon content and elevation, where most of the high carbon content is in the higher elevation. Furthermore, the trees in the secondary forest are primarily found at higher elevations, while the shrubs are located at lower elevations. This is due to water table conditions below the land surface at higher elevations, and close to land surface at lower elevations. In conclusion, these watersheds are carbon-rich areas which are worthy of conservation while a small portion (<30%) may be used for cultivation. © 2022 by the authors.

In some indigenous lands in Brazil, fire brigades are composed of indigenous people, integrating their traditional knowledge in Brazilian fire management policies; however, the effectiveness of their management is largely undocumented. Nevertheless, we need to know the effectiveness of indigenous fire brigades and their influence on fire patterns. Here, we evaluate an 18-year historical series of fire patterns and burn scars, comparing periods with and without indigenous brigade activity, to describe the role of indigenous fire brigades in the Kadiwéu Indigenous Territory. In this Indigenous Territory, fire brigades composed of indigenous people have been instituted, trained and maintained by the National Center of Prevention and Combat of Wildfire (PREVFOGO/IBAMA) since 2009. These brigades are responsible for fire management throughout the Kadiwéu Indigenous Territory using controlled burning, prescribed burning and combating wildfires. We found that fire management by the indigenous brigades has reduced fire frequency by 80% in the areas with high fire frequency (over 70% of the analysed time). Management also reduced the size of the area burned by 53% and the influence of climate over the total area burned. According to our models, the area affected by fires is mainly influenced by annual rainfall in the absence of indigenous brigades; in contrast, climatic factors could not explain the variation in the burned area in the period without indigenous brigades. Synthesis and applications. The fire management realized by the indigenous brigades can modify the fire regime. These changes in the fire regime can include: changes in spatial patterns, the magnitude of fires and reduction in the influence of climate on fire regimes. Hence, the management carried out by the indigenous brigades can be considered an important tool for fire management.

Among PAs, Community Managed PAs have emerged from communities that are not exclusively indigenous and have developed social organizations to acquire land rights, participate in forest governance, and in some cases, engage in REDD+. However, regardless of the scale or counterfactual, there is no clear consensus about Community Managed PAs’ effectiveness in forest conservation and climate change mitigation. Furthermore, previous studies have been devoted to estimating PAs’ effects on deforestation before REDD+ projects began to operate. Based on Community Concessions in Petén (Guatemala) and Extractive Reserves in Acre (Brazil), we analyzed Community Managed PAs’ temporal and spatial effects on carbon stocks and avoided emissions relative to unprotected lands, other Sustainable Use PAs (IUCN V-VI), and Strict PAs (I-IV). We used carbon density maps, matching methods, geographic discontinuity designs, and sensitivity analysis between 2003 and 2015. After controlling for the influence of market access and agriculture suitability, our analysis shows that Community Managed PAs were more effective than Other Lands (i.e., unprotected) and Sustainable Use PAs, and at least as effective as Strict PAs, in preserving carbon stocks and avoiding emissions. For instance, relative to Other Lands between 2011 and 2015, Community Managed PAs resulted in net avoided emissions of 4.6 tCO2-eq/ha in Petén (Guatemala) and 2.15 tCO2-eq/ha in Acre (Brazil). While these net avoided emissions were lower than in previous years, they seem to be driven by a reduction in carbon emissions outside Community Managed PAs. Spatially, the boundaries of Community Managed PAs varied across jurisdictions. For example, the boundaries of Acre’s Community Managed PAs’ have become less effective in avoiding emissions, which translates into reduced effects on conserving carbon stocks. Our results highlight the need to assess temporal effects to exhibit jurisdiction-wide land-use dynamics and spatial effects to identify local land-use pressures emerging inside or around the boundaries of PAs. Our analysis also shows that decentralized governance in Community Managed PAs may contribute to climate change mitigation through REDD+ and forest conservation targets.

This is particularly necessary considering that chronic human disturbance is a threat to biodiversity worldwide. Depending on how species tolerate and adapt to such disturbance, ecological integrity and ecosystem services will be more or less affected. Bats are a species-rich and functionally diverse group, with important roles in ecosystems, and are therefore recognized as a good model group for assessing the impact of environmental change. Their populations have decreased in several regions, especially in the tropics, and are threatened by increasing human disturbance. Using passive acoustic monitoring, we assessed how the species-rich aerial insectivorous bats—essential for insect suppression services—respond to chronic human disturbance in the Caatinga dry forests of Brazil, an area potentially harboring ca. 100 bat species (nearly 50% are insectivorous), but with > 60% its area composed of anthropogenic ecosystems under chronic pressure. Acoustic data for bat activity was collected at research sites with varying amounts of chronic human disturbance (e.g., livestock grazing and firewood gathering). The intensity of the disturbance is indicated by the global multi-metric CAD index (GMDI). Using Animal Sound Identifier (ASI) software, we identified 18 different bat taxon units. Using Hierarchical Modeling of Species Communities (HMSC), we found trends in the association of the disturbance gradient with species richness and bat activity: species richness was higher at sites with higher human disturbance, whereas bat activity decreased with increasing human disturbance. Additionally, we observed taxon-specific responses to human disturbance. We conclude that the effects of chronic anthropogenic disturbance on the insectivorous bat fauna in the Caatinga are not homogeneous and a species-specific approach is necessary when assessing the responses of local bats to human disturbances in tropical dry forests, and in other biomes under human pressure.

This study aimed to investigate mangrove litter as the source of carbon in restored mangrove forests in Perancak Estuary, Bali, Indonesia, which previously experienced substantial mangrove loss due to shrimp aquaculture development. We assessed the production and decomposition of mangrove litter and associated macrozoobenthic biodiversity in restored forests with plantation age ≥14 years and intact mangrove forests as the reference. The monthly production of three groups of mangrove litter (leaf, reproductive, and wood) was assessed over 12 months. A leaf litter decomposition experiment was performed to inspect the interspecific and disturbance history variation in organic matter formation among four major mangrove species: Rhizophora apiculata, Bruguiera gymnorhiza, Avicennia marina, and Sonneratia alba. Our results showed that annual litterfall production from restored and intact mangroves in Perancak Estuary were 13.96 and 10.18 Mg ha−1 year−1, which is equivalent to approximately 6282 and 4581 kg C ha−1 year−1 of annual litterfall carbon sink, respectively.

Studies on Community Forestry’s impact in many countries indicate that community involvement in forest governance can generate positive outcomes in terms of reducing deforestation and increasing biodiversity protection. This chapter will analyze the impacts of Community Forestry on forest conservation thus for climate change adaptation. A Community Forest in Lombok Indonesia is considered as a case study, through a mix quantitative and qualitative research approach. This study concludes that Community Forestry rules allow forest farmers to plant crops and Multipurpose Tree Species (MPTS) together with conservation trees. Similar to the endemic forest trees, MPTS can provide ecological benefits such as water protection, carbon sequestration and flood control, yet MPTS lack the benefits of biodiversity protection. MPTS are beneficial for the livelihood of the forest farmers since they can produce fruits – as a nontimber forest product – that can be a source of income for the forest farmer. Thus, planting MPTS on community forest land generates dual benefits for the economy and watershed conservation, which can be an incentive for the forest farmers to maintain the forest cover for climate change adaptation. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

In forest ecosystems, these events induce drastic changes in population dynamics, which could dramatically impact species diversity. Here, we studied the effect on diversity of recent short-interval, severe wildfires (SISF), which occurred in rapid succession in the summers of 2002 and 2015 in Chilean Northern Patagonian Araucaria–Nothofagus forests. We analyzed the diversity of deadwood-dependent (i.e., saproxylic) and fire-sensitive beetles as biological indicators across four conditions: 2002-burned areas, 2015-burned areas, SISF areas (i.e., burned in 2002 and again in 2015), and unburned areas. Saproxylic beetles were collected using window traps in 2017 to 2019 summer seasons. To investigate the mechanisms underpinning the fire-related disturbance of the assemblage, we evaluated the effects of post-fire habitat quality (e.g., dead wood decomposition) and quantity (e.g., burned dead wood volume and tree density) on the abundances and species richness of the entire assemblage and also multiple trophic groups. Compared with the unburned condition, SISF drastically reduced species richness, evenness, and Shannon’s diversity and altered the composition of the saproxylic beetle assemblages. The between-condition variation in composition was accounted for by a species replacement (turnover) between SISF and 2015-burned areas, but both species replacement and extinction (nestedness) between SISF and unburned areas. Dead wood decomposition and tree density were the variables with the strongest effects on the abundance and species richness of the entire saproxylic beetle assemblage and most trophic groups. These results suggest that SISF, through degraded habitat quality (dead wood decomposition) and quantity (arboreal density), have detrimental impacts on diversity and population dynamics of saproxylic beetle assemblages. Therefore, habitat loss is a central mechanism underpinning fire-related biodiversity loss in these forest ecosystems. © 2022 by the authors.

The conservation of old-growth and other forests with important environmental values is central to many international initiatives aimed at protecting biodiversity, mitigating climate change impacts, and supporting sustainable livelihoods. Current remote-sensing products largely focus on deforestation rather than forest degradation and are dependent on machine learning, calibrated with extensive field measurements. To help address this, we developed a novel approach for mapping forest ecosystem stability, defined in terms of constancy, which is a key characteristic of long-undisturbed (including primary) forests. Our approach categorizes forests into stability classes based on satellite-data time series related to plant water–carbon relationships. Specifically, we used long-term dynamics of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the canopy (fPAR) and shortwave infrared water stress index (SIWSI) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for the period 2003–2018. We calculated a set of variables from annual time series of fPAR and SIWSI for representative forest regions at opposite ends of Earth’s climatic and latitudinal gradients: boreal forests of Siberia (southern taiga, Russia) and tropical rainforests of the Amazon basin (Kayapó territory, Brazil). Independent validation drew upon high-resolution Landsat imagery and forest cover change data. The results indicate that the proposed approach is accurate and applicable across forest biomes and, thereby, provides a timely and transferrable method to aid in the identification and conservation of stable forests. Information on the location of less stable forests is equally relevant for ecological restoration, reforestation, and proforestation activities. © 2022 by the authors.",deforestation and ecological stability and forest degradation and MODIS and primary forests and time-series analysis and Biodiversity and Climate change and Conservation and Ecosystems and Land use and Mapping and Reforestation and Remote sensing and Stability and Time series analysis and Ecological stability and Forest degradation and Forest stability and Human land use and Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer time series and Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometers and Primary forest and Short wave infrared and Time-series analysis and Water stress indices and Deforestation,10.3390/rs14153813,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137089947&doi=10.3390%2frs14153813&partnerID=40&md5=d1d84272a7d08227386281fdac305bf9,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 8,NA,JOUR,15,NA,NA,NA,AUG,2072-4292,WOS:000839851500001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1635, 5128"

Brazilian northern cities are expanding fast, without considering the regional biodiversity, and urban plantings of almost exclusively exotic species are taking place. It is paramount that the correct identity of such trees is ascertained before procurement of the seeds and young plants, as the use of popular names may lead to importation of plant material from elsewhere, with potential introduction of invasive species. The abundant local diversity also leads to the need to score the most suitable species within a given region. Following the preparation of authoritatively named floristic lists in Southeastern Pará state, we proceeded to score and rank the most suitable trees for urban planning using different characteristics such as size, ornamental value, ecologic role, resilience and known methods of propagation. From an initial 375 species list, 263 species were ranked according to their suitability for street and urban area plantings and visualized using a Venn diagram. A final list with the 49 of the highest-ranking species was further analysed regarding their pollination and phenology period and two types of dissimilarity analyses were provided to aid practitioners in matching and choosing groups of species.

Rehabilitation efforts have been mainly conducted through community-based mangrove management (CBMM) programs, aimed at restoring important services such as food provisioning and coastal protection, and for biodiversity conservation. Our study assessed the effectiveness of CBMM strategies to conserve biodiversity in four adjacent Indonesian coastal villages (Sriwulan, Bedono, Timbulsloko, Surodadi) in Central Java. For this, we used complementary methodologies combining participatory resource mapping, semi-structured interviews, questionnaire-based interviews, field assessments and literature review. This yielded detailed information on mangrove rehabilitation activities, management approaches and the impacts of mangrove rehabilitation on biodiversity in the four villages. Our analysis focussed on mangrove forest structure and diversity and macro invertebrate diversity. The overall comparison of management performance shows a higher achievement of CBMM applied in Bedono in terms of a larger mangrove diversity and net reforestation coverage, also supporting a higher macrobenthic faunal diversity compared to the other villages. The main contributing factors were a) the longer-term funding and maintenance, b) the greater acceptance for protective legislation, c) the higher levels of public support, d) the fact that more species of mangroves were used, e) the much larger spatial scale of mangrove restoration, and f) the presence of additional measures to reduce wave action in highly eroded areas. The results revealed key determinants of success when restoring mangroves for the purpose of biodiversity conservation and the influence of different CBMM approaches. © 2022 The Authors",Community governance and Demak and Macrobenthos and Mangrove structure and Rehabilitation and Central Java and Denmark and Indonesia and biodiversity and forest management and local participation and macrobenthos and mangrove and restoration ecology,10.1016/j.tfp.2022.100202,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123943882&doi=10.1016%2fj.tfp.2022.100202&partnerID=40&md5=2e80e129ff48e75e68b23b1f6bf8714c,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 45,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAR,2666-7193,WOS:000762164100005,FEB 2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1638, 4932"

We performed two analyses using primary and secondary data, namely propensity score matching to estimate the effects of the enactment of HN Simancuang in 2012 on forest cover loss and ordinal logistic regression (OLR) to predict the determinants of conservation awareness. The results of the forest cover analysis showed that forest cover loss in HN Simancuang between 2012 and 2019 was 0.038 percentage point lower than the adjacent protection forest. The relatively small impact was meaningful because although HN Simancuang is located much closer to settlements which increases the pressure on the forest, it could still maintain lower tree cover losses than the adjacent protection forest. This result indicated a certain degree of conservation awareness among HN Simancuang members, which prompted us to conduct a survey to 111 individuals from different households. To do this, we used the Ecosystem Services framework to conceptualise conservation awareness in HN Simancuang. Our OLR results showed that regulating and provisioning services of forests are the strong determinants of conservation awareness among the individuals in our sample.

Coffee (Coffea spp.) is one of the most important commodity crops in the world that can easily be cultivated in complex agroforestry systems. Coffee agroforestry systems usually sustain higher biodiversity levels than sun-exposed fields while keeping similar levels of productivity considering the several benefits of growing coffee under a complex system. We aim to explore the richness and abundance of invertebrates in coffee home gardens in West Java, Indonesia by comparing 14 sun-exposed and 14 shade-grown gardens. We collected data in March/April 2019 via pitfall traps, pan traps, and beating tray in each field. We ran generalised linear models to assess whether the number of species and the number of individuals of insects differed between sun-exposed vs. shade-grown coffee gardens, and tested associations between main taxa. Overall, there was no difference in the richness (sun-exposed: 19.86 ± SE1.19; shade-grown: 19.71 ± SE1.19; Z-value = 0.12, p value = 0.904) and abundance (sun-exposed: 141.93 ± SE 3.18; shade-grown: 139.93 ± SE3.16; Z-value = 0.35, p value = 0.706) of invertebrates in coffee gardens, although taxa specific differences were present. Sun-exposed fields had a higher abundance of invertebrates considered as pests (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae, Ectobiidae; Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae, Lycidae and Tenebrionidae; Diptera: Anisolabididae, Drosophilidae and Sarcophagidae). Camponotus spp. were the most dominant ants in shade-grown gardens while Dolichoderus spp. and Myrmicaria spp. were more abundant in sun-exposed gardens. Despite the fact that sun-exposed coffee fields registered higher abundance of invertebrate pests than shade-grown coffee fields, the richness of invertebrates did not substantially vary between sun-exposed and shade-grown coffee, suggesting that the matrix of gardens offers advanced ecosystem services.

In this context, we developed, to the best of our knowledge, the first Machine Learning (ML) algorithm based on the GOES-16 ABI sensor able to detect and monitor Active Fires (AF) in NRT in MATOPIBA. To do so, we analyzed the best combination of three ML algorithms and how long it takes to consider a historical time series able to support accurate AF predictions. We used the most accurate combination for the final model (FM) development. The results show that the FM ensures an overall accuracy rate of approximately 80%. The FM potential is remarkable not only for single detections but also for a consecutive sequence of positive predictions.

To date, the assessment of mangrove restoration outcomes is generally poor, and the limited studies that do exist are focused largely on forest area. Thus, more holistic ways of assessing the outcomes of mangrove restoration projects on biodiversity and associated ecological processes are urgently needed. Ecological networks are a useful tool for simultaneously examining both. Here, we assessed the utility of using species-interaction networks for evaluating mangrove restoration outcomes for the first time. We compared the structure and complexity of mangrove ecological networks in replicated “monoculture reforestation,” “mixed species regeneration” and “reference forest” plots in two study areas in Sulawesi, Indonesia, an estuarine, and a coastal fringe mangrove system. We also combined and evaluated sampling methods, utilizing traditional plant–animal sampling while also integrating video recording data in a novel way. We found significant differences in the structure and complexity of mangrove networks between restored and natural plots, with contrasting effects between the two sites. Our results show differences in the complex ways in which taxa interact in mangrove restoration projects, which would be overlooked if common biodiversity metrics, such as species richness, were used alone, with consequences for the restoration of ecosystem functioning. We also highlight the utility of video recording data collection for constructing species-interaction networks, overcoming the detrimental impacts of observer presence for some key species. © 2021 The Authors.

Despite adverse impacts on biodiversity, extensive areas are being afforested with non-native pine (Pinus spp.), triggering forest succession on areas that were previously native grasslands. The long-term effects of afforestation with these non-native trees for biodiversity conservation are still unknown. Here, we assess this issue by comparing the fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages in young (20 year) and old (70 year) pine plots with nearby native Araucaria Forest. Abundance and richness of butterflies were positively correlated with temperature and mean humidity only in the native forest. Abiotic conditions differed between vegetation types: there was more sunlight, and was warmer and drier in the pine afforestation plots than in the Araucaria Forest. Butterfly species composition was similar between young and old pine plots, but distinct from the native Araucaria Forest. Butterfly species abundances in native forests were more evenly distributed than in afforestation sites. In these pine sites, assemblages were dominated by small, grass-feeding satyrines, whereas old pine sites had more liana-feeding biblidines, and the Araucaria Forest had more large-sized bamboo-feeding species.

Understanding how plant communities are influenced by these variables is fundamental to devise adequate management strategies for biodiversity conservation and management. Here, we evaluated the plant species composition and environmental drivers of different open environments of Lagoa do Peixe National Park in subtropical southern Brazil. We used cluster analysis (UPGMA) to classify the sites into major vegetation types and verified the relationship of these groups with environmental variables through redundancy analysis (RDA). We conducted indicator species analysis for each group of sites. We found seven groups of sites with distinct species composition: marsh, shrub grassland, wet lowland, grazed grassland, dune vegetation, dune grassland and degraded wet lowland. Variables related to moisture, vegetation height and soil cover, as well as indicators of cattle management and the presence of invasive pine, were the main drivers of changes in species composition among the different groups. At the study site, grazing management contributes to biodiversity conservation, maintaining open habitat with typical species. Understanding open landscapes as compatible with and dependent on management is essential for the conservation of the typical species of these environments. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Institute of Botany, Czech Academy of Sciences.",cluster analysis and dunes and environmental characterization and environmental variables and grasslands and wetlands and Brazil and Lagoa do Peixe National Park and Rio Grande do Sul and biodiversity and cluster analysis and community composition and dune and environmental effect and grassland and habitat mosaic and plant community and wetland,10.1007/s12224-022-09407-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129338177&doi=10.1007%2fs12224-022-09407-0&partnerID=40&md5=d1084b2a499f139ec732b5d646ec6099,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 11,NA,JOUR,1,1,20,NA,MAR,1211-9520 and 1874-9348,WOS:000789765000001,APR 2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1648, 5442"

In a biome with high human presence, understanding the potential for restoration approaches, such as agroforestry, to provide benefits to smallholder farmers and biodiversity is essential in developing equitable restoration strategies. Smallholder or family farmers are essential to national food security, producing most fruit and vegetables consumed in Brazil. Their farms can also provide ecological stepping stones for biodiversity. To better understand their role in Atlantic Forest restoration, this study explores the use of agroforestry by smallholder farmers from the Movimento Sem Terra (MST), the Rural Landless Workers' Movement, in Pontal do Paranapanema. We use quantitative and qualitative data to assess farmer perceptions of the measures which support agroforestry farming, barriers to implementation and its impact on indicators of wellbeing. We find agroforestry farmers report significant benefits in 8 of 18 tested indicators. Attitudes to agroforestry are varied, but common themes emerge including the high value of tree cover for shade and cooling effects, and the difficulties in selling agroforestry products. Our results show lack of policy support and initial investment needs are the biggest constraints to agroforestry, but opportunity cost is not considered a large barrier. Tailored policies and financial measures are needed to integrate thousands of smallholder farmers into the Atlantic Forest restoration agenda, helping to reach biome restoration targets while supporting rural livelihoods and national food security.

Among the diverse ecosystems on land, forests, agroforestry, and agricultural ecosystems provide many services to people’s welfare. However, rapid changes in land use and the occurrence of disasters are among the major threats to those ecosystems. One of the disasters is landslide and it may create a critical bare land. This chapter presents a review of previous studies in Indonesia, including projections of future management and studies with a focus on good practices for biocultural landscape conservation and utilization of ecosystem services for human well-being. Moreover, it is divided into three parts such as covering the role of landscape agroforestry, the use of local biological resources, and conservation of critical lands. The chapter concluded that besides the potential and lots of services provided by forests and agroforestry systems, these ecosystems are prone to land-use change and natural hazards, which could negatively impact their performance. Therefore, efforts to overcome these negative impacts could be carried out with potential solutions, such as ecosystem reclamation, land revegetation, forest and agroforestry protection, and empowerment of community forests. This requires a more integrated approach in the interdisciplinary field of study, including the development of hydro-seeding methods for revegetation, evaluation of government policy implementation, and community participation. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.",Agroforestry and Ecosystem service and Hydro-seeding and Local wisdom and Medicinal plant and Natural hazard and Revegetation,10.1007/978-981-16-7243-9_14,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160114802&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-16-7243-9_14&partnerID=40&md5=dcec8b9d02f23d706925ba0865207742,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 1,NA,CHAP,NA,207,221,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1651

Deforestation in Brazil’s Atlantic Forest, for which agriculture has been a primary driver, already threatens the biome’s impressive biodiversity and the ecosystem services it helps sustain. Many small family farmers in Santa Catarina—located in the South of Brazil—have adopted the Voisin Rational Grazing System (VRG) as an alternative to conventional and environmentally detrimental dairy activities. This article presents the results of a research project designed to analyze the economic, social, and ecological VRG impacts based on farmers’ perceptions and economic accounts. We compare farmer profitability and critical social and environmental aspects of both systems using detailed interviews and monthly accounting of revenues and expenditures on VRG and conventional farms. We found that VRG is more profitable than the conventional dairy system in Santa Rosa de Lima. However, most farmers combine VRG with some conventional practices, affecting profitability and potential ecological benefits. The adoption of VRG in Santa Rosa de Lima nonetheless correlates with reduced use of environmentally harmful inputs, compatible with a gradual transition to a more ecologically-friendly and sustainable system. © 2022 by the authors.

Due to their efficiency in wood decomposition process, many species have great ecological importance, especially in nutrient cycling, as well as for their biotechnological properties. Nevertheless, knowledge about these fungi is scarce in many phytogeographic regions of Brazil, as is the case of the Cerrado, since mycodiversity studies in this biome are mainly focused on areas of the São Paulo state. Here we present the taxonomic inventory of corticioid and poroid fungi from the Reserva Ecológica da Universidade Estadual de Goiás (REC-UEG), a Cerrado remnant in Anápolis, Goiás, Brazil. The area is covered by three typical Cerrado landscapes (cerrado stricto sensu, mesophilic forest, and gallery forest), widely explored for scientific and educational purposes by the academic and regional community which seeks to learn about and preserve its biodiversity. Exsiccates deposited in the fungarium of the Universidade Estadual de Goiás (HUEG-Fungi) were analyzed. They are the result of collections made over 20 years, in approximately 103 ha of the reserve. Samples were characterized macro and microscopically and identified based on specialized literature. 51 species were recognized, which are distributed in 33 genera, 15 families, and five orders. Species were most frequent in forested areas and among them, six are new occurrence records for the Cerrado, nine for the Midwest region, and nine for the Goiás state. These results contribute to increase the knowledge of these fungi in the Cerrado, as well as geographic distribution, and show the relevance of preserving the reserve for the regional Funga representativity. © 2022, Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP.

This research aimed to (1) understand the regulations concerning protected area management and the restoration strategies adopted based on the history of forest degradation in the area, (2) investigate the factors driving local people to adopt agroforestry systems in the area, and (3) investigate the characteristics of the agroforestry system developed and its impacts based on farmers’ perceptions. This research was performed in Wan Abdul Rachman Grand Forest Park, Lampung Province, Indonesia, and involved interviewing 59 respondents who managed 63 agroforestry plots in the area. Several schemes had been implemented to restore the degraded forest without involving the community, and the results were unsatisfactory. Changing the regulations concerning managing conservation forests to involve the community and providing legal permits and support from the management improved forest function due to community willingness to implement the agroforestry system. About 81% of observed plots consisted of 5–12 plant species, and 16% of plots consisted of 13–16 species per plot. Theobroma cacao was the most common species in the agroforestry plots, followed by Durio zibethinus, Parkia speciosa, and Aleurites moluccana. The size of the agroforestry plot affected the number of species in the plot. The community perception demonstrated that agroforestry has positive impacts on livelihood, the environment, and biodiversity at the landscape level. © 2022 by the authors.

Two allometric references: (a) stem diameter (D30) and (b) combined quadratic stem diameter and tree height (D302H) were used to estimate aboveground and belowground vegetation carbon stocks. The soil samples were collected from different depth and analysed in laboratory for soil carbon. The objective of this study was to estimate ecosystem carbon stocks of restored mangroves and its sequestration. The growth of restored mangroves induced an increase of tree biomass and a corresponding increase in vegetation carbon stocks from 3.7 MgC ha-1 at 2-year to 136.8 MgC ha-1 at 30-years. However, soil carbon stocks among restored mangrove plots spread randomly and didn't follow the sequence of mangrove tree ages. Average (2-30 years) mangrove ecosystem carbon in Northern Sumatra estimated by D302H allometry (362.0 MgC ha-1) was higher than that estimated by D30 allometry (344.1 MgC ha-1). This higher trend was also followed by its carbon sequestration with values of 41.1 MgCO2e ha-1 yr-1 estimated by D302H allometry and 31.5 MgCO2e ha-1 yr-1 estimated by D30 allometry. It is concluded that the values of ecosystem carbon stock of restored mangroves and its sequestration estimated by combined quadratic stem diameter and tree height (D302H) are higher than if it is estimated by stem diameter (D30). The D302H value is higher because this allometry calculates the volume of the tree stem, while D30 allometry only calculates the surface of the stem. The range values of average ecosystem carbon sequestration of this study may be better used as a reference for Afforestation, Reforestation and Re-vegetation (ARR) verification than what has been used as default/conservative values.

Yet, despite the known importance of tropical peatlands for biodiversity conservation and serious threat that anthropogenically induced fires pose to this ecosystem, the influence of protected area designation on fire occurrence in tropical peatland has been poorly assessed thus far. Our study addresses this knowledge gap through providing a novel assessment of fire patterns from a tropical peatland protected area and surrounding landscape. We investigated the importance of both climatic factors (top-down mechanism) and human interventions (bottom-up mechanism) on fire occurrence through analyzing 20-years (2001–2020) of LANDSAT and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) images of the Padang Sugihan Wildlife Reserve and a 10-km buffer area surrounding this in Sumatra, Indonesia. Fire density was assessed in relation to road and canal construction. Monthly and annual precipitation was compared between wet and dry years. The reserve was effective in limiting fire compared to surrounding landscapes only in wet years. We revealed that peat fire occurrence in the protected area and buffer zone was not due to climatic factors alone, with distance from canals and roads also contributing toward fire occurrence. Our results suggest that it is essential to address tropical peatland fire processes at a landscape level, particularly at the surroundings of protected areas, in order to increase the effectiveness of fire protection, improve fire risk classification maps, and conserve threatened tropical peatland wildlife such as the Sumatran elephant.

Despite their importance for biodiversity conservation, this system is being progressively replaced with high-yield agricultural crops, resulting in forest loss. However, such a loss of native vegetation could be avoided by developing appropriate technologies to optimize production and conservation, thus making caívas more attractive to farmers. This research tested two alternatives to traditional caíva (TC) management to identify strategies to increase pasture yield while also maintaining forest regeneration potential. The two alternative strategies are: (1) winter overseeding of cultivated pasture on natural pasture (WOC); (2) replacing natural pasture with giant missionary perennial pasture (GMC). The experiment was conducted in eight caívas, from October 2014 to February 2017. Pasture yield was evaluated monthly, and soils were analyzed at the beginning and end of the experiment. Richness and density of forest regeneration were also assessed through surveys carried out every six months in all plots. Results show that both alternative strategies were effective in increasing pasture yield, pH, and base saturation in soil. Further, these alternatives showed no impact on the total organic carbon content in the soil or on forest seedling diversity and richness, but with TCs showing a higher rate of forest regeneration. These results indicate how research that develops strategies to optimize use can help to improve traditional productive systems, preserving their social, economic, and environmental importance for communities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Agroforestry and Axonopus catharinensis and Ilex paraguariensis and Mixed Ombrophilous forest and Araucaria and Brazil and Parana [Brazil] and agroforestry and biodiversity and cattle and forest ecosystem and pasture and strategic approach and total organic carbon,10.1007/s10457-022-00738-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126350512&doi=10.1007%2fs10457-022-00738-7&partnerID=40&md5=d67f75f9e7fae24d815fbb4a99ed78f7,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 7,NA,JOUR,4,759,771,NA,APR,0167-4366 and 1572-9680,WOS:000770177400001,MAR 2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1665, 4640"

The case of soy in the Brazilian Cerrado,World Development,152,105814,"Over the past decade public and private actors have been developing a variety of new policy approaches for addressing agriculturally-driven deforestation linked to international supply chains. While payments for environmental services (PES) have been advocated in many contexts as an efficient and pro-poor environmental policy to incentivize conservation, they have been the subject of intense scrutiny and criticism for leading to mixed and sometimes adverse environmental and social outcomes. It remains unclear whether such an approach is an improvement over existing approaches to govern sustainability in supply chains and especially as a mechanism for reducing ecosystem conversion. Here we conduct an ex-ante analysis to examine the potential outcomes of using a standalone PES scheme versus existing standalone market exclusion mechanisms (MEM) to govern commodity supply chains. The analysis develops a theoretical framework to examine the potential effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, equity, and legitimacy of the two approaches and then applies this framework using qualitative analysis of secondary and interview data. Using this theory-driven evaluation approach we examine the case of the Brazilian Cerrado, where a PES mechanism is currently being proposed to achieve zero-deforestation targets in soy supply chains. We find that both standalone approaches suffer from different strengths and challenges and would be better used in combination. We conclude that a mixture of strict market exclusion with positive incentives and enabling programs that are targeted at the poorest farmers would be more effective, cost-effective, equitable, and legitimate.

The main factors shaping broadscale patterns of phytoplankton species richness (PhyRich) are temperature, system area, productivity, and less assessed light, flushing, and grazing. Our understanding of how the environment affects PhyRich is limited on broad spatial scales because of the lack of data using the same sampling and analysis methods. We selected three essential factors and hypothesized that PhyRich increases with water temperature, light availability (as turbidity), and intermediate productivity (as total phosphorus) levels. We assessed PhyRich from samples taken by a specially equipped hydroplane at 1045 sites across subcontinental (entire dataset) and regional (hydrographic regions) scales in Brazil (4°N–33°S and 34°–73°W) by quantifying the species number per site (settling technique). We selected models using the Akaike Information Criterion to understand which combination of variables better described PhyRich patterns. On our subcontinental scale, PhyRich was positively related to water temperature and negatively to light availability and productivity, although PhyRich was similar in oligo- and mesotrophic conditions, approaching the expected unimodal relationship. The trend for a slight reduction at the end of all gradients (univariate models) may have implications for the ecological functioning of freshwater systems. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.",Light and Productivity and Regional and subcontinental scales and Water temperature,10.1007/978-3-031-07453-0_4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161614646&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-07453-0_4&partnerID=40&md5=0bfd0e4bdabd720ee0d6d1d255b66c3e,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,CHAP,NA,97,118,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1668

An Example in the Atlantic Rainforest in Paraná State, Southern Brazil","Neotropical Entomology, NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY",51,NA,"Biodiversity conservation is a challenge for today. Studies regarding different ecosystems have become extremely important for understanding communities and promoting strategies for conservation, especially those involving forest restoration as strategy to reverse biodiversity loss. We compared bee diversity indices between three remnants of Atlantic rainforest in southern Brazil and four adjacent areas that were reforested after shale mining, and which are now under different restoration levels. Seven sites were monitored for over 5 years (2011–2016), by sampling bees directly on flowers or in flight using an entomological net, with 400 collected individuals/site/year. Bee species composition differed between post-mining ages and between sites. In all, we sampled 14.185 specimens and 236 bee species. The introduced Africanized Apis mellifera Linnaeus was the most frequent and abundant species, followed by Trigona spinipes and Psaenythia bergii Holmberg. Among habitats, the reforested area in initial phase showed lower richness and diversity in relation all others sample sites. Conversely, all indices were higher in forest remnants, middle phase II, and advanced phase reforested areas, reinforcing the importance of reforestation for conservation, notably endangered species, such as Oxytrigona sp., Schwarziana quadripunctata (Lepeletier), and the solitary species of the genus Hylaeus, all found in the restored areas. These results represent an important contribution for understanding the recovery of the bee fauna in restored mining habitats. The dataset reveals an interesting response in areas that were mined for shale extraction and are now undergoing different levels of restoration, suggesting that older reforested habitats have a higher probability of having a fully recovered bee community. © 2022, Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.",Anthophila and Biodiversity and Environmental regeneration and Richness and Shale mined area restoration and Animals and Bees and Biodiversity and Brazil and Ecosystem and Forests and Rainforest and animal and bee and biodiversity and Brazil and ecosystem and forest and rain forest,10.1007/s13744-022-00949-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124713050&doi=10.1007%2fs13744-022-00949-8&partnerID=40&md5=a1aad48125619f83efa00869e043b10d,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 2,NA,JOUR,2,230,242,NA,APR,1519-566X and 1678-8052,WOS:000754937400001,FEB 2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1670, 5159"

In Latin America, both jaguar and puma are known to prey on livestock, yet studies in Mesoamerica have been scattered and few have been carried out in Honduras. We interviewed ranchers in a biosphere reserve where jaguars and pumas are present. Local indigenous communities reported livestock predation (average annual loss of 7% from 2010– 2019), with preventive and retaliatory killing as their main actions against predation by the jaguar and puma. Other sources of cattle loss included diseases and theft. The extensive management system (free grazing) lets cattle access forests where predators are more common. We found that livestock predation is not random, but rather, related to landscape variables and human influence. Sites farther from human influence and closer to forest cover were more susceptible to predation. Jaguar and puma persistence in the biosphere reserve will require measures that facilitate human–carnivore coexistence and comply with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2 and 15 (zero hunger and biodiversity conservation). We propose management practices to mitigate livestock predation in the presence of large carnivores based on examples of proven human–carnivore coexistence in Venezuela, Brazil, Paraguay, and Nicaragua, such as improving the spatial arrangement of livestock (maintaining a distance from forest areas) and the incorporation of confinement pens for young calves (at least the first three months of life) and their mothers. If the pens are built close to the property’s house and have constant surveillance and/or dogs, the results are likely to be more effective. Deploying these proven tools may help change the current negative perception of ranchers towards large carnivores that is essential to conservation under the aims of SDG 15. We recommend government policies and support aimed to strengthen livestock health to increase productivity and to reduce their vulnerability to predation. Finally, this study represents a baseline to understand the magnitude of the human–carnivore conflict over cattle in one of the largest biosphere reserves in Mesoamerica. © 2022 by the authors.

However, most developed restoration protocols in Brazil are specifically intended for monitoring active restoration. Only a few studies are addressing ecological indicators for passive restoration. In this context, we tested indicators defined by a monitoring protocol (SMA Resolution 32/2014) formulated for active restoration, along with other indicators of richness, diversity, and functional aspects of natural regeneration. The evaluations took place in sites under passive restoration in different age classes (between three and twelve years old) and in a secondary riparian forest (reference ecosystem) inside the Mixed Ombrophilous Forest (Araucaria Forest) in South Brazil. Those sites had previously been covered and degraded by Pinus taeda L. plantations. We compared the evaluated sites with the intermediate and final reference values proposed by the protocol to define the suitability of the tested indicators and the forest restoration process. Results showed that the canopy cover, density, and richness of regenerants are suitable to evaluate areas under passive restoration with a history of degradation by forestry. However, it is necessary to adapt the protocol's reference values. We further suggest the inclusion of other indicators related to the ecosystem's structure and functionality as the herbaceous cover, dispersion syndrome, life form, and the ecological group of species, as well the definition of indicator species for the different restoration levels. Despite the low similarity in composition, structure, and functional aspects with the reference ecosystem, the passive restoration showed potential to perpetuate the successional course in the studied areas. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Araucaria forest and Floristic composition and Functional aspects and Natural regeneration and Passive restoration and Reference ecosystem and Araucaria and Atlantic Forest and Atlantic Ocean and Brazil and Brazil and Parana [Brazil] and Conservation and Ecosystems and Reforestation and Active restoration and Araucaria forests and Ecological indicators and Floristic compositions and Functional aspects and Natural regeneration and Passive restorations and Pinus taeda L and Reference ecosystem and Reference values and environmental indicator and plantation and restoration ecology and riparian forest and Restoration,10.1016/j.ecoleng.2022.106604,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126061040&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoleng.2022.106604&partnerID=40&md5=2327511193800cf5ba1b4a05a8664969,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 6,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1672

These problems are majorly driven by overexploitation and the conversion of mangroves into brackish water aquaculture areas. One of the most common aquaculture systems traditionally developed in the coastal areas is the mangrove-fish pond system that combines fish production with existing trees. This study aims to analyze the environmental and economic aspects of mangrove-fish pond aquaculture in different levels of mangrove cover in the coastal area of Subang District, West Java, Indonesia. The spatial analysis method was used to analyze mangrove distribution and identify the current coverage in the aquaculture area. The economic aspect was analyzed, based on the costs and revenue from fish production, while the environmental aspect was represented by carbon storage, which is among the crucial mangrove ecosystem services. This study estimated carbon storage in the four-carbon pools: above- and below-ground biomass, deadwood, and litterfall. Based on the combination of visual interpretation of Sentinel 2A satellite images and field observations, approximately 667 ha of mangrove-fish pond was identified. This study found that there were no significant differences in fish production and net income from mangrove-fish pond aquaculture at various levels of mangrove cover. Meanwhile, the ponds with high mangrove cover stored higher carbon than those with medium and low mangrove covers. This indicates that maintaining carbon storage does not reduce fish production from mangrove-fish pond aquaculture. © 2022 by the authors.",coastal ecosystem and ecosystem services and mangrove degradation and mangrove restoration and silvofishery and Carbon and Deforestation and Economic Analysis and Ecosystems and Indonesia and Lakes and Mangrove and Production and Indonesia and West Java and Coastal zones and Deforestation and Economic analysis and Ecosystems and Fish and Fisheries and Carbon storage and Coastal area and Coastal ecosystems and Ecosystem services and Fish production and Indonesia and Mangrove degradation and Mangrove restoration and Pond systems and Silvofishery and carbon sequestration and carbon storage and ecosystem service and environmental degradation and mangrove and restoration ecology and satellite data and satellite imagery and Sentinel and Lakes,10.3390/f13081308,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137560822&doi=10.3390%2ff13081308&partnerID=40&md5=e6afed52e922448c8411796a89db8f62,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 5,NA,JOUR,8,NA,NA,NA,AUG,1999-4907,WOS:000846105300001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1674, 4307"

Some known mechanisms such as niche complementarity and selection effects have been tested to explain the biodiversity-ecosystem function (BEF) relationships in several ecosystems, but less work has been done in high-altitude forests with environmental stresses. Therefore, we measured key diversity attributes including species richness (SR), functional trait diversity (Rao's quadratic entropy, RaoQ), and mean pairwise distance (MPD) in functional trait space and compare them to an important functional attribute (aboveground biomass, AGB, as a proxy for productivity) and resource stress (soil phosphorus). The results showed that both SR and RaoQ showed positive relationships with AGB, while MPD exhibited a negative relationship with AGB, suggesting that increases in plant species ameliorated by neighboring plants with similar functional and evolutionary roles in a stressful environment will help enhance ecosystem productivity. Together with plant diversity, the proportion of variance in AGB increased from 23.90 to 65.80% when soil phosphorus was added into analyses, suggesting that SR, RaoQ, and MPD all exhibit potentiality in the variation of AGB and that soil nutrients play important roles in the BEF relationships. The BEF relationships in tropical cloud forests are mediated by facilitative interactions due to low soil phosphorus. Our findings suggested that conservation of neighboring plant species with functional similarity and close relatedness be important in these forest managements. Additionally, our results showed a comprehensive consideration of environmental factors in BEF relationship analysis. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.",Biodiversity and ecosystem function and Environment stress and Facilitation and Functional diversity and Phylogenetic diversity and Species diversity and Tropical forest,10.1007/978-981-19-3655-5_11,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161825987&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-19-3655-5_11&partnerID=40&md5=25090106a5628bb46fd32f0bc6df894b,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,CHAP,NA,139,150,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1686

We conducted long-term action research in the Virola-Jatobá Sustainable Development Project (PDS), where peasant farmers who were the early settlers of the area, and more recent occupants allied to illegal loggers, land grabbers and speculators adopt antagonistic positions and challenge respective entitlements towards land and forest. In this research we highlight issues of power asymmetry and social injustice when assessing how social relations and environmental conditions in the study area are affected by land use and forest conservation policies since year 2000, when the scheme was established. The PDS situation approached a collapse in late 2017 when the integrity of its forests and the beliefs and practices of vulnerable local residents were damaged. This case study empirically demonstrates that Amazon forest frontier systems have a limited capacity to endure extreme perturbations in the social and ecological interconnected domains. We argue that when a threshold is reached in systems featuring heavily institutionalized social asymmetries that constrain the action of vulnerable resource users, few conditions remain to reorganize the constituent setup through adaptive changes in the same regime or state. Reaching this stage will likely result in drastic changes that will lock the system into a pathway that compromises human wellbeing and the provision of ecosystem services. The fundamental nature of a tenurial scheme that combines social justice and environmental conservation tends thus to be lost for good, to enter a new regime with fewer options and novelties in social-ecological advances, reflecting the overall setbacks currently experienced in Brazilian policy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Brazilian Amazon and Forest management and Land reform and Social-ecological systems and Amazonia and Brazil and Para [Brazil] and environmental policy and forest management and land reform and policy analysis and social policy and sustainable development,10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105935,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121370439&doi=10.1016%2fj.landusepol.2021.105935&partnerID=40&md5=c45515bde30ef82bf60489aec8501ed7,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 6,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1687

Knowing the balance between positive and negative effects of livestock (presence or exclusion) on different ecosystems is, therefore, crucial to support management decisions. We conducted an experiment in a secondary savanna with exotic grasses, used as pasture, to assess the effect of cattle presence in low density and cattle exclusion (in paired plots) on the trajectory of these ecosystems. Richness, composition and structure of the woody community, and exotic grass cover and biomass were compared between treatments in the beginning of the experiment and after 7 years. At the end of the experiment, we also compared composition, richness, and density of the native ground layer. We verified that (a) cattle exclusion accelerates the undesirable woody encroachment, changes the species composition and leads to huge grass fuel accumulation, while (b) cattle grazing/browsing hinders changes in savanna structure and composition and reduces the exotic grass cover and biomass, thus favoring native herbaceous plants. By decreasing the grass biomass, cattle grazing also reduces the system flammability and, therefore, the risk and intensity of wildfires. Together, the positive effects of cattle presence and the negative effects of cattle exclusion lead to the conclusion that cattle should be maintained in these systems. Low-intensity cattle grazing limits woody and exotic grass invasion, improves native forb biodiversity, and help to maintain composition and structural features of secondary savannas of the Cerrado.

Whilst 75% of economically important crops depend on insect pollinators for cultivation, 40% of insect pollinator species are threatened with extinction. Pollination services must be preserved if there is to be enough food for a global population whose demand is expected to double, if not triple, by 2050. Pollinator diversity and pollinator efficiency have been found to increase as a result of wildlife-friendly farming practices (i.e., natural chemicals and fertilizers and agroforestry). We evaluated the presence of insect pollinators in 42 coffee home gardens in West Java, Indonesia. Via generalized linear mixed models, we found that number of visitor species (β = 0.418 ± SE 0.194, p = 0.031) and visitation time (β = 0.845 ± SE 0.308, p = 0.006) decreased as farms were more intensely managed, (i.e., used chemical pesticides), compared to fields using organic practices. As knowledge of pollination services is widespread amongst smallholder farmers in Indonesia and beyond due to the long-held tradition of beekeeping, these results will add to their existing knowledge and empower farmers to enhance resources for pollinator species through agroforestry and natural pest management. Although we found significant differences in pollination services provided in intensely managed and wildlife-friendly farms, chemical use can affect farms far beyond a particular area of production. Therefore, pollinator conservation must be applied at a landscape level and involve all stakeholders, including farmers, when making effective policies. © 2022 by the authors.

However, FAO reports indicate that approximately one-third of the planet’s arable lands show levels of degradation from processes including soil erosion, low levels of nutrients, acidification, salinization, compaction, sealing, and contamination. These conditions are also found in Brazil where soil degradation is largely caused by inadequate land management. Worldwide, strategic policies have been presented to mitigate this problem, with emphasis on sustainable agriculture. Among them, agroforestry has been identified as a viable system for mitigating and recovering degraded areas. Agroforestry techniques have been developed and tested but are still not understood by farmers, due to their complexity. This study aimed to analyze experiences and studies with agroforestry reported from Australia, some countries in Africa, and Brazil to search for similarities in these complex systems and identify possible correlations to support the hypothesis that land recovery can be enhanced through soil management using agroforestry. A Sankey diagram was developed to illustrate relationships among problems, the adoption of agroforestry and improvements, and the most important contributions. Data analysis shows that the main problems related to soil degradation are soil erosion and decreased soil fertility, while the adoption of agroforestry systems proved to improve different aspects of soil quality and to be a safe path to sustainable agricultural production. To obtain more information on the adoption of these systems in different locations, soils, and climates, it is important to implement policies for reducing land degradation. Furthermore, the assessment of the economic, environmental and social benefits of improving soil fertility and decreasing erosion in agroforestry systems is necessary to validate the use of agroforestry as a sustainable agricultural practice.

This study evaluated aboveground and soil (0–20 cm) carbon stocks of AFS, secondary forests (SF), conserved and logged mature forests, on 88 sites in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. Tree carbon stock was higher in young (< 10 years) and advanced (> 30 years) AFS (10.2 ± 2.0 and 47.2 ± 8.1 Mg ha−1, respectively) when compared to the same age SF (5.8 ± 2.5 and 26.5 ± 19.5 Mg ha−1). However, aboveground and total carbon stocks were statistically similar within the same age categories of AFS and SF, because shrub pool were higher in SF. Conserved mature forests had the highest carbon stocks (190.2 ± 11.0 Mg ha−1), and carbon stocks in logged mature forests (119.4 ± 5.1 Mg ha−1) were similar to the advanced stages of AFS (108.6 ± 7.5 Mg ha−1). Litter and soil organic carbon (SOC) did not differ significantly between land-use systems nor along succession. At 30 years, aboveground carbon recovery was 46% (± 16) in AFS and 35% (± 21) in SF. Vegetation structural diversity (measured by DBH and height variation) was a good predictor of aboveground carbon stocks. Our results show the potential of AFS for carbon recovery, especially in the tree pool at late stages of development. Structurally more complex AFS provide an alternative to recover degraded lands and to develop synergies between climate change mitigation, adaptation, and goods production in Amazon. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Amazon and Biomass and Forest succession and Secondary forest and Stand structure and Amazon River and agroforestry and biomass and carbon sequestration and climate change and secondary forest and succession,10.1007/s10457-022-00754-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133358557&doi=10.1007%2fs10457-022-00754-7&partnerID=40&md5=8ae67794a70b2ab935f3fe94fb819f24,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 13,NA,JOUR,5-6,941,956,NA,AUG,0167-4366 and 1572-9680,WOS:000820093600001,JUL 2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1699, 5408"

The resulting map was a subsample of all tree cover gain but we coupled it with an extensive random accuracy assessment (n = 4,269 points) to provide unbiased estimates of expansion. Most predicted gain patches (69.2%) consisted of small patches of natural regrowth (31.6 ± 11.9 Mha). However, expansion of tree plantations also dominated increases in tree cover across the tropics (32.2 ± 9.4 Mha) with 92% of predicted plantation expansion occurring in biodiversity hotspots and 14% in arid biomes. We estimate that tree plantations expanded into 9.2% of accessible protected areas across the humid tropics, most frequently in southeast Asia, west Africa and Brazil. Given international tree planting commitments, it is critical to understand how future tree plantation expansion will affect remaining natural ecosystems. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",Biodiversity and Conservation and Deforestation and Reforestation and Satellite imagery and Tropics and Accuracy assessment and Forest and grassland and Natural regrowth and Optical and radar satellite imagery and Rapid expansion and Small patches and Tree cover and Tree plantations and Tropical tree and Unbiased estimates and Expansion,10.1038/s41893-022-00904-w,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131573628&doi=10.1038%2fs41893-022-00904-w&partnerID=40&md5=a3cc0493cbbc8485f5649024a3e0cac7,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 53,NA,JOUR,8,681,688,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1700

The intensification of crop management to increase yields is usually associated with a reduction of shade trees and heavy use of chemicals, typically correlated with a decrease in biodiversity. The relationship between intensity of crop management and biodiversity, however, is not clear-cut and is dependent on environmental and geographical differences. We assessed the influence of different shade cover, shade tree richness, richness of other crops, distance from the forest, and use of chemicals on the diversity, richness and abundance of butterflies, a bioindicator in coffee home gardens. We collected data in 42 coffee home gardens in West Java, Indonesia, via Pollard transects, totalling 15.1 km (July-August 2019 and July-August 2020). We found 54 species of butterflies in the gardens. Via Generalised Additive Mixed Models, we found that the use of chemicals negatively influenced the abundance (p = 0.001) and richness (p = 0.039) of butterflies, while shade tree richness positively influenced the abundance (p < 0.001), diversity (p = 0.046) and richness (p < 0.001) of butterflies. The other predictors did not have a significant effect. The high diversity of butterflies in the study area suggests that the agroforestry environment is now resilient, but the relationship between butterfly abundance, diversity, and richness with shade tree richness indicates an urgency to maintain and improve current ecosystem complexity. The negative relationship between butterfly abundance and richness and the use of chemicals further indicates that organic farming should be promoted to preserve ecosystem services provided by pollinators. Coffee production in Indonesia has dramatically increased in the last 10 years and producers are keener to use more intensive farming techniques with a consequent reduction of ecosystem complexity. This process can break the resilience of agroforestry habitats if actions are not taken immediately. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Agroforest and Biodiversity and Indonesia and Lepidoptera and Organic and Pollination and Indonesia and West Java and Lepidoptera and Papilionoidea and agrochemical and agroforestry and biodiversity and bioindicator and butterfly and coffee and complexity and crop production and home garden and numerical model,10.1016/j.agee.2021.107547,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108102230&doi=10.1016%2fj.agee.2021.107547&partnerID=40&md5=6bdbd596344f8bd667a781443ad6d638,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 16,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,OCT 1,0167-8809 and 1873-2305,WOS:000685518100005,JUN 2021,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1703, 4693"

Data from abiotic variables integrated in a geographic information system were used to identify the areas that most need restauration using production systems such as agroforestry as part of a forest restoration process, necessary to land degradation in the sub-basin and its surroundings. It was found that the sub-basin of the Curuá-Una River has a more elongated shape, confirmed by the circularity index, compactness coefficient, and shape factor. It is a fifth order sub-basin with a densely branched drainage network with a low probability of flooding due to the predominance of undulating relief. The morphometric characteristics present conditions that can be used in anthropic areas integrated into production systems such as agroforestry.

The pattern of tree planting in urban areas is related to age, ethnicity, education, and household income. Unfortunately, this issue has not been evaluated, nor has it received significant subsidized governmental actions, funding, study, or public policies in large tropical cities in developing countries. Thus, we aimed to investigate if there was a pattern of urban afforestation related by socio-territorial inequalities, in the city of São Paulo, or if there was a relationship between the number of seedlings planted over the past 4 years and zoning, socioeconomic, health, and environment variables in the neighborhoods of São Paulo, as well as to evaluate the ecosystem services provided by the planted species. Our results showed that tree planting was not oriented to increase cover of less-vegetated areas of the city and where more respiratory diseases have been registered. In fact, the number of seedlings planted over the past 4 years was very influenced by socioeconomic status of inhabitants. In this sense, wealth and education proved to be a better predictor than zoning, health, and environmental variables for the tree planting.

Soil samples were collected from three villages Kuala Pembuang, Muara Dua, and Telaga Pulang within the Rimba Raya Biodiversity Reserve located in Seruyan District, Central Kalimantan Province, Indonesia, in June 2017. Soils from 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm were analyzed for cellulase, PMEase, urease, C, and N. The results showed that enzyme activities and percentages of C and N were significantly different (>Emphasis Type=""Italic""<a>/Emphasis< 0.05) among management practices within the soil depths. The highest enzyme activities were found in NF, AHG, and TA treatments. The lowest C level was found at 0-15 cm soil depth (1.32%) of POP. The highest nitrogen level was found at NF (1.23%) for 15-30 cm soil depth followed by TA site at 0-15 cm (1.15%). The lowest soil N level was found at POP among treatments and depths (0.43% and 0.21%). The outcomes of this study will help formulate land management recommendations for landowners, palm oil management, government agencies, and communities around the study areas to maintain soil quality for long-term sustainability of the peat forest ecosystems.

Although benefits of restoration are often expected to substantially exceed the costs, most restoration projects are being carried out without clear cost analyses. This study provides empirical assessments of challenges and costs of the four peatland restoration projects managed by different proponents in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia based on key informant interviews, a follow-up survey and document analyses. We also reviewed existing policy contexts that can address some of the challenges to propose a governance alternative to sustain peatland restoration efforts. We found that many ecological challenges of peatland restoration projects were created by drainage canals leaving the peat to be dry and fire prone. Peatland degradation has been exacerbated by human activities and human-caused fires, and restoration efforts have faced many challenges due to lack of secure funding and complexity of governing the project implementation. The key informants we interviewed easily recognized direct costs for implementing restoration activities, but often left out indirect costs of addressing social challenges, such as expenses to engage local communities, in their assessments of the costs. Although our accounting is far from exhaustive, we found that indirect costs can add up to half of the total cost of peatland restoration projects. Current funding mechanisms for these projects mostly rely on international donors and private sectors, which make the long-term sustainability of the projects questionable. We argue that hybrid governance for a green business model, such as restoration and ecosystem services enterprises, with active participation from the public sector should be mainstreamed. The accounting framework developed in this study can be applied in other projects and should be further revised to systematically assess cost-effectiveness of restoration interventions. © 2021",Challenges and Cost accounting framework and Financing and Hybrid governance and Peatland restoration and Central Kalimantan and Indonesia and cost analysis and empirical analysis and environmental restoration and finance and governance approach and human activity and international aid and peatland and private sector,10.1016/j.tfp.2021.100131,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118900150&doi=10.1016%2fj.tfp.2021.100131&partnerID=40&md5=3545a9e7693c75e1a14fdd7e4d4c915a,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 23,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,DEC,2666-7193,WOS:000728582600004,AUG 2021,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1708, 4905"

Yet as ecosystem services (ES) focus on nature’s positive contributions to people, some have argued that ‘ecosystem disservices’ (EDS), or nature’s negative contributions, should also be taken into account to better orient sustainability policies. However, joint ES and EDS assessments remain rare in sustainability research, partly because of the persisting conceptual ambiguity around the EDS concept. This study aimed to develop these joint assessments and test their relevance in addressing sustainability issues. To this end, we devised a novel cascade model that helps to define ES and EDS in a multi-level context that considers both as coproduced by ecosystems and people. In order to explore the potential and limitations of this model, we then applied it in a Brazilian landscape where reconciling agriculture and forest conservation is a critical sustainability challenge. Using the model in comprehensive interviews with farmers about their perceptions and management practices of forests, we found that they had an overall positive valuation of forests, but identified both positive and negative interactions between forests and farms at different organizational levels. The model also revealed a vicious circle between crop expansion, a resulting decrease in certain ES and an increase in certain EDS, which might exacerbate tensions between agriculture and forest conservation in the future. Additionally, the model allowed a window on the diverse preventive and regulating practices that the interviewed farmers have adopted to cope with increasing EDS without necessarily harming biodiversity. Based on this case study, this novel cascade model seems a promising conceptual tool to uncover the interactions between ES and EDS, opening new research and policy avenues to support sustainability. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.",Cerrado and Conceptual framework and Coproduction of ecosystem services and Forest conservation and Nature’s contributions to people and Socio-cultural valuation,10.1007/s11625-021-01049-z,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116855747&doi=10.1007%2fs11625-021-01049-z&partnerID=40&md5=48e286ca351e0ee6273fab193ad4aafd,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 16,NA,JOUR,1,105,119,NA,JAN,1862-4065 and 1862-4057,WOS:000706070800007,OCT 2021,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1712, 4251"

We assessed spatial and temporal microclimate and LST variability in a biodiversity enrichment experiment, in which tree islands have been planted in an oil palm plantation in Sumatra (Indonesia). Four years after establishment of the experiment, we measured microclimate and LST using mini microclimate sensors and drone-recorded thermal images. We examined experimental effects of tree species richness (0, 1, 2, 3 or 6), plot size (25 m2, 100 m2, 400 m2, 1600 m2) and stand structural complexity on microclimate and LST. Diurnal patterns showed ambient air temperature peaks and relative humidity (RH) minima at 3 pm, whereas diurnal soil temperatures peaked around 6 pm. The lowest LST were observed from oil palm canopy leaves and the highest from bare soils and understorey vegetation (including trees). Spatial and temporal ranges of ambient air temperature were smaller than LST ranges, and average ambient air temperature and LST were positively correlated. Tree species diversity had no overall significant effect neither on microclimate nor LST, but humidity was higher in planted tree islands compared to natural regeneration only. Smaller plots were characterized by higher mean air, soil and LST, compared to larger plots. Structurally complex plots were associated with low mean and maximum values of ambient air temperature, soil temperature and LST and high mean and minimum RH. Still, conditions were hotter and drier in several experimental plots compared to conventional oil palm plantations, considering a higher transpiration in the latest. We conclude that stand structural complexity and tree island size control microclimate and LST in the experimental oil palm agroforests, but alleviating the harsh microclimate conditions in oil palm plantations might take longer to occur. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Biodiversity enrichment agroforestry experiment and Drone-based thermography and iButton and Land surface temperature and Microclimate and Oil palm and Air and Biodiversity and Natural Reforestation and Soil and Surface Properties and Temperature and Trees and Greater Sunda Islands and Indonesia and Sumatra and Sunda Isles and Elaeis and Biodiversity and Drones and Land surface temperature and Landforms and Palm oil and Reforestation and Soils and Surface measurement and Surface properties and Agroforestry and Ambient air temperature and Biodiversity enrichment agroforestry experiment and Drone-based thermography and Ibutton and Land surface temperature and Microclimate and Natural regeneration and Oil palm and Oil palm plantations and agroforestry and ambient air and biodiversity and ecosystem function and evergreen tree and land surface and microclimate and plantation and regeneration and surface temperature and Atmospheric temperature,10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119480,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110082805&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2021.119480&partnerID=40&md5=83b7820576485939229d2aeb3fe171e4,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 23,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,OCT 1,0378-1127 and 1872-7042,WOS:000685082000005,JUL 2021,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1713, 5559"

When payments cease, the behaviors they motivate can change. Previous research on conservation-based payments recognizes the impermanence of conservation success, but it does not consider the legacy of payments that failed to effect change. This research assesses impermanence and failure by investigating the legacy of village-level conservation payments made through one of the largest Integrated Conservation and Development Projects in Indonesia. The Kerinci-Seblat Integrated Conservation and Development Project aimed to conserve forest area and promote local development through voluntary conservation agreements (VCAs) that provided payments for pro-conservation pledges and activities from 2000 through 2003. Project documentation and previous research find that payments failed to incentivize additional forest conservation, producing nonsignificant differences in forest-cover change during the project period. To examine the legacy of these payments in the post-project period, this research uses matched difference-in-differences and triple differences models to analyze forest cover change in villages (n = 263) from 2000 through 2016 as well as matched binary logistic regression models to assess enduring differences in household (n = 1303) livelihood strategies within VCA villages in 2016. The analysis finds that VCA villages contained significantly more forest loss than the most similar non-VCA villages outside the national park, and greater payments predict increased forest loss in the post-project period. In addition, farming high-value tree crops and cultivating private land were the most important attributes for modeling VCA affiliation among randomly selected households. These results demonstrate that, after payments ceased, project failures increased in severity over time.Those who design and implement conservation-based payments bear great responsibility to ensure their projects are informed by local voice, align with community preferences, and provide sufficient benefits, lest they result in a conservation legacy of increased failure. © 2022 The Author(s).

A review","Agronomy for Sustainable Development, AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT",41,75,"Acrocomia spp., a genus of wild-growing palms in the neotropics, is rapidly gaining interest as a promising multipurpose crop. Diverse products can be derived from various components of the palm, the oils being of highest interest. Acrocomia shows similar oil yield and fatty acid composition to the African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). It is, however, able to cope with a wider range of environmental conditions, including temporary water scarcity and lower temperatures, thus potentially a more sustainable alternative to its tropical counterpart. Acrocomia’s research history is recent compared to other traditional crops and thus knowledge gaps, uncertainty, and challenges need to be addressed. This review attempts to assess the acrocomia’s preparedness for cultivation by highlighting the state-of-the-art in research and identifying research gaps. Based on a systematic literature search following a value web approach, it (a) provides a comprehensive overview of research topics, (b) shows the development of publication activities over time and the drivers of this development, and (c) compiles main findings to assess the acrocomia’s preparedness for commercial cultivation. Our results confirm its multipurpose characteristic as a potential feedstock for manifold sectors. Research has continued to increase over the last decade, especially on A. aculeata and is driven by the interest in bioenergy. Increasing knowledge on botany has contributed to understanding the genetic diversity and genus-specific biology. This has enabled applied research on seed germination and propagation toward domestication and initial plantation activities, mostly in Brazil. Main research gaps are associated with genotype–environment interaction, planting material, crop management, and sustainable cropping systems. Overall, we conclude that acrocomia is at an early phase of development as an alternative and multipurpose crop and its up-scaling requires the integration of sustainability strategies tailored to location-based social-ecological conditions. © 2021, The Author(s).",Acrocomia aculeata and Agroforestry and Bio-based value chain and Bio-based value web and Biodiversity and Bioeconomy and Biorefinery and Coyol and Macaw palm and Macaúba and Mbokajá and Minor crop and Oil crop and Vegetable oil and Brazil and Acrocomia and Acrocomia aculeata and Aculeata and Elaeis guineensis and bioenergy and crop production and cropping practice and cultivation and fatty acid and genotype-environment interaction and germination and plantation and sustainability,10.1007/s13593-021-00729-5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118927599&doi=10.1007%2fs13593-021-00729-5&partnerID=40&md5=af3a547603a22b1524f5d82b64732329,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 13,NA,JOUR,6,NA,NA,NA,DEC,1774-0746 and 1773-0155,WOS:000717504500002,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1720, 5605"

They store carbon in their biomass, support biodiversity, and provide ecosystem services such as protection of watersheds or reduction of soil erosion. Forests act as sources for timber and non-timber forest products and are the habitat of forest communities' inhabitants. Despite the importance of tropical forests, they continue to be devastated, causing 17% of global carbon emissions, loss of biodiversity, and climate change. Decades of efforts by governmental, non-governmental, and international organizations to reduce illegal deforestation worldwide have had limited success. In this paper, we analyze the opportunities to develop administrative methods for forest conservation based on the blockchain technology in combination with the economic activities of forest communities. The aim is to reduce the sale of illegally logged timber, to contribute to the reduction of illegal logging, and thereby to the mitigation of climate change. Based on this analysis, we propose a concept for tropical forest preservation through a blockchain-based contract management platform.

It is estimated that around 15% of carbon is stored in peatlands worldwide. Indonesia contains approximately 50% of the world’s tropical peatlands with frequently cited estimates of about 21 Mha. Pelalawan district area (Riau Province) is dominated by peat soils. The land in Pelalawan is mainly covered by industrial plantations of acacia forests and oil palms. The area is very susceptible to the loss of carbon stocks in peat soils due to the opening of drainage channels. This study aims to calculate the carbon stocks of subsurface peatlands in Pelalawan, especially in the research location. The method used is a grid survey, the distance between the particular points is 500 m, which covers the total area of the research site, i.e. 2,500 ha. The number of observation points is 121, which includes measuring the thickness of the peat layer, calculating bulk density, and C organic content. The paper analysed the distribution of carbon stocks in the peat bottom based on the thickness class. The results showed that carbon stocks in the peat bottom in Pela-lawan were 218,753.95 tons/ha consisting of 143,138.40 tons/ha in the peat thickness of >300 cm (very deep peatland), 44,999.10 tons/ha in the peat thickness of 200–300 cm (deep peatland), 21,577.67 tons/ha in the peat thickness of 100–200 cm (medium peatland), 4,780.78 tons/ha in the peat thickness of 50–100 (shallow peatland), and 4,258 tons/ha in the peat thickness of 0–50 (very shallow peatland).

The financial feasibility of oil palm agroforestry is compared to oil palm monoculture, employing a discounted cash flow approach using three indicators: net present value (NPV), benefit-cost ratio (BCR), and internal rate of return (IRR). Two ecological indicators— biodiversity and land cover—are evaluated in an experimental plot of oil palm agroforestry in Jambi.

Gold mining activities in Indonesia, in many areas, have a negative impact on the environment. Activities that can improve the quality of post-mining land include revegetation activities, which are included in post-mining land reclamation activities. The purpose of this study was to analyze the development of vegetation in post-gold mining revegetation areas. Vegetation data were collected using the plotted line method (natural forest) and the Systematic Sampling method with Random Start (revegetation area). The analysis found that the vegetation structure in the post-gold mining revegetation area aged 3 to 10 years has complete vegetation levels (saplings, saplings, poles, and trees). Compared to natural forest, which only includes 30 tree species and 7 herbaceous, this revegetation region has a greater diversity of species, with 66 tree species and 16 herbaceous. The longer the age of revegetation is not followed by an increase in species and an increase in the value of the species diversity index. However, it is still better than the revegetation at a young age and is closer to the condition of a natural forest. The revegetation area aged 8 and 7 years has a higher number of species than natural forests and other revegetation areas. © 2022, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

Therefore, it is important to understand the influence of soil properties, especially physical and chemical, on plant growth in coal mine recl amation areas. This study aimed to evaluate the growth and diversity of plants at various ages of reclamation and analyze the factors that most influence their growth and diversity. The study analyzed four soil physical properties and eight soil chemical properties. The research was conducted in mine reclamation areas with different ages: 1, 4, 6, 9, and 11-year-old-plantations for vegetation analysis and soil collection. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) analysis was performed using PAST 4.0 statistics program to analyze the data. The results showed that the 9-year-old plantation had the highest mean Shannon Wiener Index (H’= 1.52), mean basal area (35.04 m2/ha), and mean density (469 trees/ha), while the 4-year-old plantation had the highest mean diameter (28.42 cm). The 1-year-old plantation had the highest clay content of 56.28% and the lowest pH of 3.27. The physical properties of the soil affected the growth rat e and diversity of the reclamation area more than the chemical properties of the soil. This can be seen from the cumulative proportion of the two PCA values that described the original condition of 71.20% for soil physical properties and 63.10% for soil chemical properties.

Very little research has been published on the Cerrado savanna, Pampa grasslands and Pantanal wetlands. Regulating services were much more frequently studied (85%) than provisioning (13%), while cultural services represent a major gap. A consistent positive effect of agroforestry was demonstrated for soil quality, habitat and food provisioning. Trade-offs were demonstrated for soils and habitats. (4) Our analysis identifies high-priority gaps given their critical importance for human well-being which should be filled: agroforestry effects on water provision and regulation. Moreover, they should assess other ES such as erosion control, flood protection and pest control to enable a more reliable inference about trade-offs. © 2022 by the authors.

This case study aimed to evaluate the growth and yield of paricá at different soil management practices, including consortium with an agricultural production, in the Brazilian Amazon. Paricá was implanted, consorted with soybean in the first year, and maize in the second, in a 5 × 2 m spacing. The treatments T1 = subsoiling, basal dressing, top-dressing, inoculation of microorganisms and consortium with soybean/maize were applied. In T2, T3, T4, and T5, we applied the same practices of T1, except subsoiling (T2), basal dressing (T3), top-dressing (T4) and inoculation of microorganisms (T5). T6 was the control, which used none of these practices, including the consortium with soybean/maize. The results indicate that the highest rate of plant survival occurred in T2, while T3 and T4 promoted greater intraspecific competition, compromising the growth in dbh and the yield (m3 ha−1 ) of plants in future ages. Growth in dbh and th and the yield of plants in the soybean/maize consortium period was higher in T2 and T6. In future ages, the dbh and yield of plants demonstrated higher growth trends in T6, T1, and T5. Agroforestry practices of soil management influence the growth and yield of paricá plants. However, there is a tendency for greater growth and yield for paricá plants cultivated in the absence of agroforestry practices for soil management proposed in this case study.

Herein, we explored how the diversity patterns of anurans respond to the scenario of extensive replacement of grasslands with agriculture in southernmost Brazil. We determined possible changes in the species richness, taxonomic composition, and structure of pond-breeding anuran communities in the grassland ecosystems of the South Brazilian Grasslands (SBG). Using the survey at breeding sites method, we sampled a total of 238 ponds, 153 from extensive livestock grazing on grasslands and 85 from agricultural areas. The higher species richness was found in the livestock areas on grasslands. There was a significant nestedness pattern associated with agricultural areas, indicating a non-random process of community simplification by species loss. Seven anuran species were considered land use indicators, of which five were considered indicators of grasslands with livestock, and two as indicators of agricultural areas. Generalist species were persistent and dominant in agricultural areas, while habitat specialists disappeared from these areas. Land use was a significant factor explaining the community structure segregation between land uses regardless of the natural variation reported at the local and regional levels. We highlight the importance of grasslands for the conservation of pond-breeding anurans in non-forest landscapes of the subtropical region, and we discuss the view that extensive livestock production needs strategic incentives to help the conservation of SBG biodiversity, such as multi-institutional measures. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Agriculture and Anuran communities and Biodiversity loss and Grassland remnants and Livestock and Brazil and breeding and community structure and grassland and livestock farming and species richness,10.1007/s10531-021-02317-1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118610105&doi=10.1007%2fs10531-021-02317-1&partnerID=40&md5=503da39cd52308ec21384bb048941efa,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 8,NA,JOUR,1,21,37,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1737

The state of São Paulo represents only 3% of the Brazilian territory but holds 33% of its mammalian diversity. Most of its territory is dominated by agriculture, pastures, and urban areas which directly affect the diversity and persistence of mammals in the landscape. In addition, São Paulo has the largest port in Latin America and the largest offshore oil reservoir in Brazil, with a 600 km stretch of coastline with several marine mammal species. These human-made infrastructures affect the diversity, distribution, ecology, and the future of mammals in the state. Here, we answer five main questions: 1) What is the diversity of wild mammals in São Paulo state? 2) Where are they? 3) What is their positive and negative impact on human well-being? 4) How do mammals thrive in human-modified landscapes? 5) What is the future of mammals in the state? The state of São Paulo holds 255 species of native mammals, with four endemic species, two of them globally endangered. At least six species (two marsupials, Giant otter, Pampas deer, Brazilian dwarf brocket deer, and Giant armadillo) were extirpated from the state due to hunting and habitat loss. The intense human land use in the state forced many mammalian species to change their diet to cope with the intense fragmentation and agriculture. Large-scale monoculture has facilitated the invasion of exotic species such as wild boars (javali) and the European hare. Several “savanna-dwelling” species are expanding their ranges (Maned wolf, Brocket deer) over deforested areas and probably reflect changes towards a drier climate. Because the state has the largest road system, about 40,000 mammals from 33 species are killed per year in collisions causing an economic loss of 12 million dollars/year. The diversity of mammals is concentrated in the largest forest remnants of Serra do Mar and in the interior of the State, mainly in the regions of Ribeirão Preto and Jundiaí. Sampling gaps are concentrated throughout the interior of the state, particularly in the northwest region. Wild mammals play a fundamental role in many ecosystem services, but they can also be a concern in bringing new emergent diseases to humans. Although the taxonomy of mammals seems to be well known, we show that new species are continuously being discovered in the state. Therefore, continuous surveys using traditional and new technologies (eDNA, iDNA, drones), long-term population monitoring, investigation of the interface of human-wildlife conflict, and understanding of the unique ecosystem role played by mammals are future avenues for promoting sustainable green landscapes allied to human well-being in the state. The planting of forest or savanna corridors, particularly along with major river systems, in the plateau, controlling illegal hunting in the coastal areas, managing fire regimes in the Cerrado, and mitigating roadkill must be prioritized to protect this outstanding mammal diversity. © 2022, Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP.

Thus, the protection and restoration of tropical peatlands has recently turned into an important strategy to mitigate global climate change. Little research exists that has investigated the impacts and dynamics that such climate mitigation efforts evoke in local communities living in and around peatlands. We present insights on this from Sumatra, Indonesia and use a climate justice lens to evaluate local outcomes. We show how an increasingly transnational network of state and non-state actors has become involved in developing new laws, policy programs and land-use agreements on Sumatra's coastal peatlands, aiming at supposedly win–win low-carbon development pathways. We argue that such efforts are open to much of the same criticism that has been raised regarding previous policies and projects aimed at reducing GHGE from deforestation and forest degradation. These projects disregard local perspectives on development, fail to deliver the promised benefits and, through a reconfiguration of local land-use rights, reduce the capabilities of smallholder farmers to benefit from their land. In sum, our analysis suggests that recent policies and projects aimed at mitigating GHGE from tropical peatlands contribute to a redistribution of the global climate mitigation burden onto smallholder farmers in Indonesia. This occurs through their threefold assignment to protect forests, prevent fires and help restore degraded peatlands. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Climate change mitigation and Climate justice and Indonesia and Peat fires and Peatland restoration and REDD+ and Greater Sunda Islands and Sumatra and Sunda Isles and Trixis and agricultural land and climate change and deforestation and global climate and greenhouse gas and land use change and peatland and smallholder,10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2021.102388,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118720231&doi=10.1016%2fj.gloenvcha.2021.102388&partnerID=40&md5=5c0002d19446957975a2126ac9ada836,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 17,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NOV,0959-3780 and 1872-9495,WOS:000711154700004,OCT 2021,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1741, 5141"

While its forest law enforcement strategy was partially successful in combating illegal deforestation, the effectiveness of positive incentive measures in agriculture has been less clear. The reason is that emissions reduction from market-based incentives such as the Brazilian Low-Carbon Agriculture Plan cannot be easily verified with current remote sensing monitoring approaches. Farmers have adopted a large variety of integrated land-use systems of crop, livestock and forestry with highly diverse per-hectare carbon balances. Their responses to policy incentives were largely driven by cost and benefit considerations at the farm level and not necessarily aligned with federal environmental objectives. This article analyzes climate-related land-use policies in the state of Mato Grosso, where highly mechanized soybean–cotton and soybean–maize cropping systems prevail. We employ agent-based bioeconomic simulation together with life-cycle assessment to explicitly capture the heterogeneity of farm-level costs, benefits of adoption, and greenhouse gas emissions. Our analysis confirms previous assessments but suggests a smaller farmer policy response when measured as increase in area of integrated systems. In terms of net carbon balances, our simulation results indicate that mitigation effects at the farm level depended heavily on the exact type of livestock and grazing system. The available data were insufficient to rule out even adverse effects. The Brazilian experience thus offers lessons for other land-rich countries that build their climate mitigation policies on economic incentives in agriculture. © 2021 The Authors",Agricultural land use and Diffusion of climate-friendly technologies and Green financing and High-performance computing and Model uncertainty analysis and Brazil and Mato Grosso and Gossypium hirsutum and agricultural land and environmental economics and environmental policy and incentive and land use change and land use planning and modeling and uncertainty analysis,10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105618,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108411864&doi=10.1016%2fj.landusepol.2021.105618&partnerID=40&md5=60b3dffa8da0a320acfe216a54d86608,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 27,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,OCT,0264-8377 and 1873-5754,WOS:000702765200007,JUN 2021,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1742, 5317"

Agricultural management practices are crucial to offset the anthropogenic C emission; hence, Carbon sequestration (CS) in agriculture is a viable option for reversing this cycle, but it is based on hypotheses that must be questioned in order to contribute to the development of new agricultural techniques. This review summarizes a global perspective focusing on 5 developing countries (DC) (Bangladesh, Brazil, Argentina, Nigeria and Mexico) because of their importance on global C budget and on the agricultural sector as well as the impact produced by several global practices such as tillage, agroforestry systems, silvopasture, 4p1000 on CO2 sequestration. We also discussed about global policies regarding CS and tools available to measure CS. We found that among all practices agroforestry deemed to be the most promising approach and conversion from pasture to agroforestry will be favorable to both farmers and in changing climate, (e.g., agroforestry systems can generate 725 Euroeq C credit in EU) while some strategies (e.g. no-tillage) supposed to be less promising and over-hyped. In terms of conservative tillage (no-, reduced-, and minimal tillage systems), global and DC's land use increased. However, the impact of no-tillage is ambiguous since the beneficial impact is only limited to top soil (0–10 cm) as opposed to conventional mechanisms. Grasses, cereals and cover crops have higher potential of CS in their soils. While the 4p1000 initiative appears to be successful in certain areas, further research is needed to validate this possible mode of CS. Furthermore, for effective policy design and implementation to obtain more SOC stock, we strongly emphasize to include farmers globally as they are the one and only sustainable driver, hence, government and associated authorities should take initiatives (e.g., stimulus incentives, C credits) to form C market and promote C plantings. Otherwise, policy failure may occur. Moreover, to determine the true effect of these activities or regulations on CS, we must concurrently analyze SOC stock adjustments using models or direct measurements. Above all, SOC is the founding block of sustainable agriculture and inextricably linked with food security. Climate-smart managing of agriculture is very crucial for a massive SOC stock globally especially in DC's. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Agricultural practice and CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration and Environmental impact and Global warming and Greenhouse gases and Soil Carbon Sequestration and Agriculture and Carbon and Carbon Dioxide and Carbon Sequestration and Developing Countries and Global Warming and Soil and Poaceae and Budget control and Carbon and Developing countries and Environmental impact and Forestry and Global warming and Greenhouse gases and Land use and Soils and Sustainable development and organic carbon and carbon and carbon dioxide and Agricultural practices and Agroforestry and Agroforestry system and Carbon sequestration and CO2 sequestration and Greenhouses gas and Landuse change and No tillage and Paradigm shifts and Soil carbon sequestration and agricultural practice and agroforestry and carbon sequestration and developing world and environmental impact and global warming and greenhouse gas and zero tillage and agriculture and agroforestry and Argentina and Bangladesh and biomass and Brazil and carbon sequestration and clinical practice and conservation tillage and developing country and environmental management and environmental policy and greenhouse effect and land use and Mexico and Nigeria and Review and soil analysis and soil property and total organic carbon and carbon sequestration and developing country and soil and Carbon dioxide,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148169,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111021991&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2021.148169&partnerID=40&md5=8789b8884b800bb52942a27430fd94c9,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 52,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,OCT 10,0048-9697 and 1879-1026,WOS:000685281100011,JUN 2021,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1744, 5275"

The total plots were 75 plots (a plot size of 50x50 m), and carbon stock estimation was focused on pole and tree levels. The average carbon stock in the traditional zone of MHSNP, Kampung Birang, and Kampung Merabu respectively was 51.02 Mg C/ha, 96.25 Mg C/ha, and 82.17 Mg C/ha. The carbon stock in traditional agroforestry of all study sites was very significantly affected by the basal area (m2/ha) (p-val<0.05) with a strong correlation (r = 80% and 97%). The carbon stock was affected by stand density (p-val<0.1) with a very low correlation (r = 27.3%). The carbon stock was very significantly affected by total species (p-val<0.05). However, it had a weak correlation (r = 28.0%). In agroforestry systems, how to manage the agroforestry, socio-economic aspects, ecological site, and market are the main factor in species selection and species maintenance by landowners that indirectly influence biodiversity conservation effort and carbon stock value.

Halting and reversing deforestation requires multiple, complementary interventions by state and non-state actors at different scales. We argue that the order in which these instruments and actors are introduced into the policy mix matters. Sequences of interventions from case studies in Latin America show that government commitment is a critical first step, implemented through command-and-control measures and then incentives. Combined with REDD+, they create an enabling environment for supply chain initiatives. A more coordinated and deliberate polycentric governance is needed to achieve zero-deforestation. Technical summary Avoided deforestation provides a natural climate solution for reducing emissions while generating co-benefits for people and nature. However, unleashing this potential requires improved governance. Diverse coalitions of actors are designing interventions to protect forests, each with different motivations and specialization of strategies. We introduce a policy sequencing framework to advance our understanding of how to improve polycentric zero-deforestation governance. Focusing on commodity production in Costa Rica, Brazil, and Colombia, we reconstructed the policy mix of zero-deforestation interventions across three domains - domestic public policies, REDD+, and supply chain initiatives. We classified interventions according to their instrument mechanism - disincentives, incentives, enabling measures - and when they were introduced into the policy mix. We found a sequence of interventions that reflects stages of forest cover dynamics, but also depends on local political will and institutional capacity. Government command-and-control measures are needed early in the policy sequence to slow deforestation, with incentives added to increase legal compliance. REDD+ helps governments build an enabling environment that supports supply chain initiatives seeking to increase forest cover at later stages of the sequence. Policy sequencing and policyscape concepts advance the design of more deliberate polycentric forest governance that enhances actor coordination and instrument synergies in the policy mix.

Also, these disturbances affect plant community biodiversity and cover, which are also known to affect multiple ecosystem properties. However, the strength of the relative effects of the disturbance itself and of the effect that is mediated by changes in the plant community is still unclear. Questions: We evaluated the relative direct and indirect effects (mediated by changes in the plant community) of the anthropogenic disturbances on ecosystem multifunctionality. Location: Dry forests within the Sustainable Development Reserve Ponta do Tubarão, northeastern Brazil. Methods: We measured standing biomass, litter mass, soil fertility and soil water content in 52 vegetation plots along a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance. Also, we measured woody plant cover and species’ functional traits to characterize the plant community functional structure. We measured livestock grazing, selective logging and past clear-cuts as proxies of anthropogenic disturbance to create an index that characterizes the additive effect of these human activities. By building a theoretical model using the structural equation modelling approach, we investigated how the plant community changes in cover and biodiversity due to anthropogenic disturbances mediate changes in ecosystem properties. Results: Our results show that anthropogenic disturbances had negative effects on ecosystem properties. Plant cover loss caused by anthropogenic disturbances was the major determinant of the negative effect of disturbances.

Conclusions: By assessing the effect of human activities on multifunctionality, we found a stronger negative effect of anthropogenic disturbances when compared to its effect on single ecosystem properties.

The objectives were to analyze: (1) farmers’ knowledge of the role of bats in ecosystem services, (2) the perception of bats, (3) awareness of bat population loss and its impact on durian production, and (4) farmers' actions against bats on their land. The results showed that 1 out of 7 farmers exhibited negative actions toward bats in their agroforest lands. They also had significantly low knowledge about bat services in agroforestry. Most farmers regarded bats as meat for food and medicine rather than as pollinators of durian fruits.

To date, however, studies have emphasized field-and system-scale outcomes of shade tree integration, and potential impacts on the rhizosphere of adjacent cacao trees have not been fully characterized. Interactions at the root–soil interface are closely linked to plant health and productivity, making it important to understand how diverse shade tree species may affect soil fertility and microbial communities in the cacao rhizosphere. We assessed the impacts of neighboring shade tree presence and identity on cacao yields and physical, chemical, and biological components of the cacao rhizosphere in a recently established diversified agroforestry system in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Stepwise regression revealed surprising and strong impacts of microbial diversity and community composition on cacao yields and pod infection rates. The presence of neighboring shade trees increased nitrogen, phosphorus, and pH in the rhizosphere of nearby cacao trees without yield losses. Over a longer time horizon, these increases in rhizosphere soil fertility will likely increase cacao productivity and shape microbial communities, as regression models showed nitrogen and phosphorus in particular to be important predictors of cacao yields and microbiome diversity and composition. However, neither presence nor identity of shade trees directly affected microbial diversity, community composition, or field-scale distance-decay relationships at this early stage of establishment. These results highlight locally specific benefits of shade trees in this agroecological context and emphasize the rhizosphere as a key link in indirect impacts of shade trees on cacao health and productivity in diversified systems. © 2022 by the authors.

To face the challenge of applying science in environmental policy establishment, we developed a scientific project funded by the São Paulo State Research Foundation (FAPESP) to support the implementation of the New Forest Act in São Paulo State, as part of the Biota/FAPESP Program. The project was conducted differently from a regular research project: the broad objective was to provide scientific support to the State’s implementation of the New Forest Act, based on a participatory interaction among stakeholders to build specific objectives, methods, and discussion of results, within an interdisciplinary and intersectoral research team. Here, we present the lessons learned during and after the four years of the research project development to evaluate how scientific knowledge can be produced and adopted in the implementation of a specific environmental policy. We present the main outcomes and the challenges faced in trying to include scientific data in the decision-making process. We also present current and future challenges in the New Forest Act implementation that could be solved with scientific evidence. The lessons learned showed that even designing the project in order to meet the needs to support the implementation of the environmental policy, avoiding difficulties normally pointed out by similar projects, there was a great difficulty for scientific contributions to be adopted in the decision-making process.

Nearly 33% of our respondents showed negative action against Tapanuli Orangutan. Farmer's claimed that they drive the Orangutan out of their agroforests using tools such as air rifles, sharp tools, as well as stones and sticks. Farmer's knowledge of Tapanuli Orangutan as a forest engineer is very low. Seventy three per cent of the respondent did not know any ecosystem services provided by Orangutans. We found out that cultural services of orangutans are the most understandable services by local farmers (14%), followed by regulation services (10%) and provisioning services as they consume the bushmeat of Orangutan (3%). Simultaneously, we found that knowledge, perceptions and attitude affect farmer actions by 62.2%. Understanding the farmer's action against the Tapanuli Orangutan will provide vital information for the stakeholders. We suggested further research to determine farmers' willingness to accept compensation for their crop-raiding by an Orangutan and the resolution conflict scheme of humanorangutan conflict.

Understanding where sediments are produced and where they are delivered enables managers to design more effective strategies for improving water quality. A management strategy is targeted restoration of degraded terrestrial areas, as it provides opportunities to reduce land-based runoff from coastal areas and consequently foster coral reef conservation. To do this strategically, a systematic approach is needed to identify watersheds where restoration actions will provide the highest conservation benefits for coral reefs. Here, we develop a systematic approach for identifying global forest restoration opportunities that would also result in large decreases in the flux of sediments to coral reefs. We estimate how land-use change affects sediment runoff globally using high-resolution spatial data and determine the subsequent risk of sediment exposure on coral reefs using a diffusion-based ocean transport model. Our results reveal that sediment export is a major issue affecting 41% of coral reefs globally. The main coastal watersheds with the highest sediment export are predominantly located in Southeast Asian countries, with Indonesia and the Philippines accounting for 52% of the sediment export in coastal areas near coral reefs. We show how restoring forest across multiple watersheds could help to reduce sediment export to 63,000 km2 of coral reefs. Although reforestation opportunities in areas that discharge onto coral reefs are relatively small across watersheds, it is possible to achieve large sediment reduction benefits by strategically targeting watersheds located in regions with a high density of corals near to the coast. Thus, reforestation benefits on coral reefs do not necessarily come from the watersheds that produce the highest sediment export. These analyses are key for generating informed action to support both international conservation policy and national restoration activities. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",biodiversity conservation and cross-realm planning and restoration and ridge to reef and spatial planning and water quality and Animals and Anthozoa and Conservation of Natural Resources and Coral Reefs and Ecosystem and Forests and Indonesia and Philippines and Anthozoa and biodiversity and coral reef and forest management and marine ecosystem and nature conservation and reforestation and restoration ecology and runoff and sediment transport and spatial data and spatial planning and water quality and animal and Anthozoa and coral reef and ecosystem and environmental protection and forest,10.1111/gcb.15811,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111759850&doi=10.1111%2fgcb.15811&partnerID=40&md5=a03b9c5b40c88014030654dc1217164b,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 21,NA,JOUR,20,5238,5252,NA,OCT,1354-1013 and 1365-2486,WOS:000681279000001,AUG 2021,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1768, 5117"

Attempts to quantify the value of carbon capture in native species restoration efforts in the tropics are limited. This case study analyzed the rates of biomass (C) accumulation in restored plots in Monteverde, Costa Rica. Annual biomass (C) accumulation averaged 5.34kg per tree over the first 17years after seedling planting. This converts to an average capture of 19.57kg of CO2 tree−1 year−1. Carbon sequestration rates in the first decade of growth are low at 1.95kgCyear−1 and carbon offset programs should account for this by requiring a minimum 15-year commitment for emission mitigation. Using an average tree planting and survival estimate per hectare, based on our 20-year restoration program, reforestation in this region can capture up to 12.72Mg (with just planted trees), or 15.7CO2 Mgha−1 year−1 when natural tree recruitment in restored plots is included. Great variation exists among tree planting sites, as well as within sites, and captured amounts differ with tree species capabilities. Given the challenges of accurate, broad-range model development for calculation of tropical forest biomass accumulation, this study utilizes the average of six published allometric equations and discusses their application to this study. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we used ant communities to evaluate the effects of historical land uses (former agriculture or tree plantation) and current management (grazing, burning, mowing, and fertilizing) in subtropical grasslands. We also examined how ant species richness and composition are affected through changes in resource diversity and habitat structure. We classified 80 study sites in southern Brazil into two groups: permanent and secondary grasslands. Permanent grasslands presented high, medium or low management intensities that had never been under other land use. Secondary grasslands are former grasslands that were used for agriculture or pine plantations in the past, followed by passive restoration. We sampled ant communities with D-Vac suction in three multiplots per site in 2013–2015. We found that secondary grasslands had lower ant species diversity and different community composition than permanent grasslands. Ant diversity did not differ among permanent grasslands, but composition was markedly different, especially when comparing medium and high management intensities with low. Additionally, ant richness in secondary grasslands was mainly mediated by a decreased resource diversity (i.e., plant species richness) and grass cover, while burning and mowing management increased ant richness by increasing resource diversity. Our results indicate that passive recovery of grasslands in early successional stages after other land uses leads to incomplete recovery of ant communities, as important resource and structure-related drivers of ant species remain altered. In contrast, traditional management practices promote ant diversity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Abandoned pine plantations and Biodiversity conservation and Burning and Ex-arable fields and Grassland management and Mowing and Brazil and ant and biodiversity and community composition and detection method and grassland and land use planning and restoration ecology and species diversity and species richness and subtropical region and succession,10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109387,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119054507&doi=10.1016%2fj.biocon.2021.109387&partnerID=40&md5=e2e6e0a06456441821112ae8b38483e1,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 5,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,DEC,0006-3207 and 1873-2917,WOS:000722192800009,NOV 2021,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1772, 5506"

Three land-use systems (LUS) were investigated: agricultural management (30 years), regeneration under controlled grazing (25 years) after 5 years arable management, and native dry forest. Soil contents of P, total C, total N, and N fractions were used to calculate stocks and their stoichiometric ratios for layers 0–5, 5–10, 10–20, and 20–40 cm. Data from these LUS were compared using Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric tests. Changes to soil microbial biomass reflected the substantially reduced SOC concentration and stock in managed soils compared with that of the natural dry forest area. Total N stock was not affected by LUC, although increases in nitrate and ammonium offset a significantly reduced organic N fraction in the agricultural area. The largest P stock was found in agricultural land, followed by the grazed fallow regeneration site. LUC significantly influenced the stoichiometric ratio of C, N, and P, with the change from Caatinga to agriculture affecting the equilibrium between organic residues’ input and mineralization.

The forage crops produced from the reclaimed land can be integrated with developing cattle farm agritourism to obtain a win-win solution of environmental recovery by enhancing the socio-economic livelihood of local communities. Hence, this study aims to analyze the economic feasibility of developing cattle beef agritourism at ex-coal mine lands in South Sumatra, Indonesia, and assess its potential in increasing the effectiveness of partnership program funding. The analysis of feasibility criteria revealed a Net Present Value (NPV) of 129,152,169,746 IDR, meaning that the project is feasible to be implemented since the NPV is greater than 1. The Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) was 1.22, which is more than 1, implying that it is feasible to be run. The Payback Period (PP) was 3.5 years which is far shorter than the estimated investment period of 15 years. The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) was 35.6% which is much greater than the assumed annual interest rate of 8%. The farmers’ plasma system analysis showed that the cattle farm agritourism could increase the amount of fund distribution, collectibility rate, and also farmer’s income. © 2022, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

Here, we assess the impact of landscape structure and matrix contrast on carrion removal by scavenger insects, an often overlooked ecosystem service but of paramount importance for nutrient cycling and disease control. We first hypothesize that more forested landscapes and less contrasting matrices harbour richer communities of scavenger insects, mainly composed of forest species. We then posit that these richer communities of scavenger insects promote a higher provision of the carrion removal service. The scavenger insect community and carrion removal service was surveyed using 18 independent paired sampling sites (forest-agricultural matrix, composed either by coffee plantations or cattle pastures) in the Atlantic Brazilian Forest domain. We measured insect species richness, community composition and carrion removal amount using meat baits inside exclusion cages monitored along 6 days across a forest cover gradient (8%–89%) and distance gradient from forest edge (0–100 m to the interior of forest patches and adjacent matrix). Species richness of scavenger insects was higher in more fragmented landscapes, with more forested areas presenting communities composed of mainly forest-associated species. Carrion in coffee plantations attracted richer communities than in cattle pastures or forests. Coffee plantations also presented communities with more forest-associated species than cattle pastures. Carrion removal was higher in both forest and coffee plantations compared to cattle pastures. Even though forest communities had lower species richness, key forest-associated groups were the bulk of a higher service provision. Synthesis and applications. Forested landscapes with less contrasting matrices maintain a higher provision of carrion removal service by sustaining communities composed of scavenger insects with higher carrion removal capacity—mostly forest-associated species. Landscape management focusing on the conservation and reforestation of native forest patches, as well as reducing matrix contrast, could facilitate species spillover and thereby ensure the provision of carrion removal service. © 2021 British Ecological Society",Atlantic Forest and cattle pastures and coffee plantations and community composition and ecosystem services and fragmentation and landscape structure and matrix type and Atlantic Forest and Brazil and Hexapoda and community composition and ecosystem service and forest cover and forest edge and gall insect and insect and landscape ecology and landscape structure and nutrient cycling and reforestation and tropical environment,10.1111/1365-2664.13991,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113490406&doi=10.1111%2f1365-2664.13991&partnerID=40&md5=d3b90e01bf2411d553dd8801552b8bbb,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,JOUR,11,2637,2649,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1777

Among plantation systems, rubber agroforestry (jungle rubber) is preferable since it resembles natural forests, which still maintain high biodiversity. While previous studies have been focused on the floristic diversity, composition and structure of jungle rubber, limited research has investigated indicator species and tree regeneration in jungle rubber. This research aimed to compare herb layer composition including species diversity, indicator species and tree regeneration potential between jungle rubber (JF) and the existing natural growing forests, including undisturbed post-logging forest (UF), mixed regrowth forest (MF) and newly regrowth forest (NF), in Sungai Manau Forest, Jambi, Indonesia. We conducted a vegetation survey and subsequently analyzed the data using some comparative analyses, indicator species analysis and regeneration status analysis. Our results showed significant differences in herb layer communities among all land cover types (T=-18.91, p=0.000). Although JF and all-natural growing forests showed equal indices of diversity, each land cover type showed its own indicator species, reflecting their environmental conditions. However, indicator species for JF were mostly similar in character to that in MF with non-native semi-shade-tolerant species. Meanwhile, all indicator species for UF were native shade-tolerant species and the indicator species for NF were fully non-native shade-intolerant species. JF is also equal to MF in seedlings availability and tree regeneration potential by showing an equal number of seedling species and the number of individuals where most of the seedlings in both land cover types were pioneer species with “good regeneration ”status”. Our finding suggested that JF had a similar potential to MF in the succession process. Therefore, jungle rubber can be a good alternative when a plantation system is inevitable in a post-logging forest. © 2022, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

Besides reducing deforestation and forest degradation, plantation development also plays an important role in climate change mitigation, particularly for carbon stock enhancement. This study aims to estimate the carbon sequestration potential of rubber plantations in East Kalimantan. Rubber plantation carbon stock was measured by establishing 24 sample plots with the size of 20x20 m in two locations, Kutai Timur and Penajam Paser Utara regencies. Above-ground biomass of rubber was estimated using the allometric equation AGB = 0.144 x D2.40. While the carbon stock was further calculated using the lifetime average approach. The result shows that the carbon stock of rubber plantations in East Kalimantan is 75.71 tons C ha-1. With a total plantation area of 123,460 ha, the potential carbon sequestration of rubber plantations in East Kalimantan is about 9.05 Mt, equivalent to 33.19 Mt CO2e. Given the high carbon sequestration potential, rubber plantation development needs to be considered as an important strategy to achieve FOLU net sink by 2030. This is part of the enhancement of carbon stock through land rehabilitation, which is prioritized to be implemented in degraded lands to avoid deforestation and forest degradation in forested areas. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",NA,10.1088/1755-1315/1109/1/012102,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144042250&doi=10.1088%2f1755-1315%2f1109%2f1%2f012102&partnerID=40&md5=91d537331a9074feb54bb4c3e42022e2,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 1,NA,CONF,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1784

We conducted a systematic review to assess if sufficient ecological knowledge has been accumulated to aid restoration practices for the Cerrado, a Brazilian biome dominated by savanna ecosystems and threatened by anthropogenic disturbances. Most Cerrado restoration studies were performed by few research groups and focused primarily on two vegetation types: Cerrado sensu stricto (typical savanna) and riparian forest. We also found that defining reference ecosystems and selecting plant species for restoration programs is neglected, mostly disregarding their original occurrence and proportion of plant growth forms. Furthermore, studies lacked standardized and systematic evaluation of restoration outcomes. Hence, we argue that current ecological knowledge is insufficient to guarantee the success of large-scale ecological restoration of the Cerrado. We strengthen the need to explicitly define the reference ecosystem for each Cerrado ecosystem and use its structure and composition as guidance for ecological restoration research, which should be based on a scientific approach. We encourage investigations into ecological dynamics and natural regeneration of the different vegetation types of the Cerrado and highlight the importance of integrating such knowledge with environmental laws, societal engagement and cost-effective techniques to advance Cerrado ecological restoration. © 2022, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

Therefore, Brazil is looking for measures, such as integrated crop–livestock–forestry (ICLF), to increase productivity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in this sector. The forest component within this system plays a positive role in the context of climate change, soil conservation, carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration, and biodiversity protection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of management and rainfall on N2O emissions in eucalypt monoculture soils and eucalypt soils in ICLF systems. Manual static chambers were used to collect gas samples, from November 2013 to October 2014, in four treatments, i.e., one eucalypt monoculture (F) and three modalities of ICLF (livestock–forest [LF], livestock–crop–forest [LCF], and integrated crop–livestock–forest [ICLF]). A gas chromatograph with an electron capture detector was used to measure the N2O concentrations. The results showed that rainfall considerably affected N2O fluxes across all the treatments, indicating that rainfall is the main factor in increasing emissions. During the wet season, the N2O levels ranged from 0.158 to 0.482 kg N-N2O ha-1 across all treatments. During the dry season, all treatments behaved like sinks of N2O. Moreover, N2O flux did not differ between the soils in the eucalypt monoculture and ICLF systems. This indicates that the forestry component in the ICLF systems did not affect N2O soil fluxes. © 2022, Australian Journal of Crop Science.

The environmental recovery obligations defined in the legislation serve as a good guidance, but sand mining companies are not always able to finalize their activity entirely and to comply with the laws. To take this into account, the present study was developed with an objective of analyzing the changes observed in the ES after 70 years of sand exploitation in the Paraíba do Sul River Valley, Brazil. The services of the floodplain soil formation and associated components, such as the quality and quantity of water and refuges provided by the riparian forest, are highlighted in this study. To evaluate the different ESs modified by mining, socio-environmental variables were studied, and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was applied to assign significance to each variable in the phase of closing activities, thus creating a compound index for ES evaluation at mine closure. The closure conditions were analyzed against the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6, 8, 9, and 11. The results showed that the companies are small, that they met the legislation in equal criteria of environmental rehabilitation, and that they were induced to a closure standard, reflecting the reforestation with native forest variable, related to the ES of provisioning of habitat to wild fauna. However, the mine facilities variable, associated with the cultural ES of recreation, predominated, because the buildings and access roads were preserved, even though the movable assets were demobilized quickly. It was concluded from the analysis that the scenario of the ES at mine closure is generally linked to geodiversity, company size, and compliance with legal duties. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Anthropocenic environments post-mining and Geodiversity and Socio-environmental indicators and Sustainable development goals and Brazil and Paraiba do Sul Basin and Analytic hierarchy process and Ecosystems and Environmental regulations and Planning and Plant shutdowns and Reforestation and Restoration and Anthropocene and Anthropocenic environment post-mining and Ecosystem services and Environmental indicators and Geodiversity and Mine closures and River basins and Sand mining and Socio-environmental indicator and Sustainable development goal and analytical hierarchy process and ecosystem service and environmental policy and floodplain and geodiversity and legislation and mining and reforestation and sand and Sustainable Development Goal and Sustainable development,10.1016/j.resourpol.2021.102405,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118722191&doi=10.1016%2fj.resourpol.2021.102405&partnerID=40&md5=e8da18152505c3baf2079f4a20c5f2dc,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 13,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,DEC,0301-4207 and 1873-7641,WOS:000714118900001,OCT 2021,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1789, 4694"

However, current metrics of functional restoration (other than seedling survival rates and plant community composition) are often not readily available for local community managers, highlighting an urgency to identify easy-to-measure indicators to assess the functionality of restored mangroves. The macrozoobenthic community could be such practical indicator, as macrozoobenthic communities are sensitive to changes in their environment, and can be easily surveyed within local managing programs. Focusing on three main mangrove management conditions (natural, planted, and naturally regenerated) in North Sumatra and the province of Aceh, Indonesia, we compared vegetation and macrozoobenthic community diversity indices and identified environmental variables that best describe the forest management conditions and their associated macrozoobenthic community assemblage. Results showed that community assemblage, rather than macrozoobenthic diversity index, was associated with management conditions. The highest dissimilarity in macrozoobenthic community assemblages occurred between planted versus natural mangroves, with nonsignificant dissimilarity between natural and naturally regenerated mangroves. The Lined Nerite gastropod (Nerita balteata) was identified as an indicator of natural mangroves, and the invasive Giant African snail (Achatina fulica) was abundant in mangrove plantations, but also in natural mangroves bordering harbors, oil palm plantations, and aquaculture ponds, suggesting associated anthropogenic pressures. This study showed that the macrozoobenthic community can be used as restoration indicator and could serve as a baseline to empower monitoring activities and community-based adaptive management practices to improve the outcomes of restoration efforts. © 2022 The Authors.

The research was carried out in the concession area of a coal mining company in Berau, East Kalimantan, which was divided into three sites: Sambarata Mining Operation (SMO) Site, Binungan Mining Operation (BMO) Site, and Lati Mining Operation (LMO) Site. At each site, eight research measurement plots (RMP) were established representing land with varying vegetational conditions, namely original land and post-mined lands with varying revegetation stages from open land to 12-year-old vegetation. The percentage of C content was calculated from 288 disturbed soil samples, while bulk density was analyzed from 144 whole soil samples using the Walkey & Black and gravimetric methods. We found that the C stock at the initial state after the mining operation was very low. Coal mining activities caused a loss of C in soil with an average value of 21.29%, or equal to 5.65 tons/ha. The biggest loss occurred at the SMO site (44.97%, or 13.04 tons/ha), while the smallest loss was found at the LMO site (2.24%, or 0.40 tons/ha). The carbon stock improved after revegetation, particularly in the SMO and LMO sites, and the rate of carbon stock enhancement in the soil differed across sites. The results also showed that soil carbon in the post-mining area of 10-30 cm was greater than that of the 0-10 cm layer. Along with the increasing age of plants, the vertical distribution of C stock shifted from the lower layer to the upper layer. © 2022, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

One of the mechanisms that contributes to conservation is the Permanent Preservation Areas (PPA); however, studies related to the vegetation of these areas are scarce, especially regarding the herbaceous stratum, creating a gap in the evaluation of the conservation of the Pampa biome's grassland formations. The objective of this study was to characterize the structure of fragments of grasslands in PPA, with and without cattle grazing, inserted in a plantation of Eucalyptus saligna Sm. in the Pampa biome. The survey was conducted on 40 systematically distributed sample units in six grassland areas, three of which were occasionally exposed to grazing and three fenced off with no grazing. Cover and frequency values ​​(absolute and relative) and importance value index (IVI) were estimated for species, exposed soil and dry plant material. The difference between the areas was evaluated by the Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) and ANOSIM, complemented by SIMPER. Richness, dry plant material and exposed soil were evaluated using the Kruskall-Wallis test. A total of 210 species were registered, with the Poaceae family being the most numerous, followed by Asteraceae (41), Cyperaceae (19), Fabaceae (12) and Rubiaceae (9). The areas differed in relation to richness, with grazing showing more diversity. Enclosure Area 3 did not differ from open areas 2 and 3, possibly due to the greater proximity and low cattle interference. The exposed soil did not vary according to the enclosure; however, the dry plant material was higher in the enclosed areas.

One such vegetation is grasslands which have the potential for carbon storage and to reduce CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. At present, many enterprises have designed grasslands for many purposes. Grasslands at Cikalong Wetan and Little Farmers, West Bandung Regency were established under different pattern of plantation stands. The purpose of this research was to study the potential of carbon stock in grassland vegetation at these locations. Based on RaCSA method, the tree biomass was determined by nondestructive collection of density and basal area of trees, then calculated by an allometric equation. The ground cover biomass was determined by destructive collection of grass and roots. Total measured biomass was multiplied by 46% to obtain carbon storage. Based on the results, the potential of carbon stock in Little Farmers grassland (159,540 ton ha-1) is higher than in Cikalong Wetan (14,482 ton ha-1). Carbon stored in tree biomass gives the highest contribution to overall carbon stock potential in Little Farmers (94.84%) while carbon stored in below-ground understorey biomass gives the highest contribution in Cikalong Wetan (52.13 %). Different management of grasslands and pattern of plantation stands resulting a different contribution of carbon stock in every carbon pool. In order to maintain the carbon sequestration potentials of these locations, an agroforestry management such as agri-silviculture need to be encouraged. This study gives a comparison of the carbon sequestration potentials between two man-made grassland ecosystems.

Aiming to better understand the effects of fire on biodiversity, we addressed the following questions: does fire benefit all alpha and beta components of taxonomic and functional diversity in grasslands; which functional groups are affected; does diversity foster recovery of above-ground biomass after fire?. Location: Campos grassland, southern Brazil. Methods: The effects of fire were investigated using a before/after control/impact experimental design. A randomized block design with seven replicates was set up, where a fire experiment was established after three years of both grazing and fire exclusion. Each block contained two paired 10 m × 10 m plots. We assessed plant species composition, plant functional trait composition, plant functional groups, and above-ground biomass before and after fire in both burnt and control plots. Results: Both taxonomic and functional alpha diversity increased in burnt plots and decreased in unburnt plots across time. Taxonomic species richness considering total species increased more than considering common species only. Functional beta diversity increased in burnt plots while taxonomic beta diversity stayed similar between treatments. Forb total cover increased after fire while graminoids and shrubs remained unchanged. Burnt plots with high initial functional richness presented greater biomass recovery, whereas species richness presented no relation with above-ground biomass. Conclusions: Fire increases species and functional richness in plots of subtropical Campos grasslands (alpha diversity component), and while it increases functional beta diversity, taxonomic beta diversity remained unchanged.

The level of carbon reduction resulting from peat restoration is uncertain, owing in part to diverse methodologies and land covers. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted to assess the impact of rewetting on reduction of total CO2 in soil and heterotrophic emissions at the country level. The tier 2 emission factor associated with the land cover category in Indonesia was also calculated. The analysis included a total of 32 studies with 112 observations (data points) for total CO2 emissions and 31 observations for heterotrophic emissions in Indonesia. The results show that the land cover category is not a significant predictor of heterotrophic and total soil emissions, but the highest observed soil emissions were found in the plantation forest. Using the random-effects model, our results suggest that an increase in the water table depth of 10 cm would result in an increase in total CO2 emissions of 2.7 Mg CO2 ha−1 year−1 and an increase in heterotrophic emissions of 2.3 Mg CO2 ha−1 year−1 .

Plant species can be negatively affected as a result of landscape conversion; thus, it is essential to detect the potential effects of environmental stress on plant performance using reliable bioindicators of quick, cheap diagnosis. Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) describes the degree of the random differences in shape and size among two sides of a bilateral trait of the organisms and reflects the developmental instability of an organism, so we can use it to predict the effects on plant fitness. We evaluated the land-use change stress on seed FA levels, seed germination, and the subsequent seedling development of seed produced by trees that occur in an anthropized and a preserved area of seasonally tropical dry forests (STDF) in Brazil. We sampled 10 ten reproductive trees of Enterolobium contortisiliquum of each landscape condition, and then, 100 seeds per each tree were collected. Additionally, 50 seeds were randomly selected for each tree to determine plant fitness. Despite, we found no true FA in the community, the anthropized area had a lower seed nutritional quality and percentage of germination, and higher germination time of seeds produced than in preserved areas. The dry weight of the aerial part of seedlings did not differ between areas. However, root dry weight and total dry weight were higher in seedlings developed from seeds of anthropized than in preserved areas. Our findings show that seeds of E. contortisiliquum are not a sensitive biomarker to detect full stress conditions of habitat disturbance. However, we demonstrate that habitat disturbance negatively affects plant fitness, decreasing germination percentage, and nutritional quality, and increasing germination time. This fact has potential consequences on recruitment, establishment and survival of E. contortisiliquum in regenerating areas of STDF's in Brazil. © 2021 The Author(s)",Land-use change and Seed fluctuating asymmetry and Seed germination and Tropical dry forest and Brazil and Enterolobium contortisiliquum and Fabaceae and Antennas and Biodiversity and Biomarkers and Conservation and Cultivation and Ecosystems and Health and Land use and Plants (botany) and Reforestation and Tropics and Biodiversity conservation and Developmental instability and Environmental stress and Fluctuating asymmetry and Germination percentages and Landscape disturbance and Nutritional qualities and Seedling development and conservation status and disturbance and dry forest and environmental stress and germination and landscape and legume and seed set and survival and tree and Seed,10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107451,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100607896&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolind.2021.107451&partnerID=40&md5=c3e5e889ff7c99dd6e01ff7ffbf1a95d,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 1,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1813

While this could include many different types of interventions to reduce deforestation and degradation, a consensus has emerged that they should safeguard and “do no harm” to the forest-based livelihoods of local people. Many REDD+ projects have been designed to incentivize forest conservation and support local livelihoods by promoting sustainable use of the forest, hence increasing the revenues earned by local households from forest products. We examine two such projects in the Peruvian Amazon, using panel survey data from over 400 households gathered in 2011 and 2014. In the 3 years between surveys, we observed a severe decline in forest revenue.

Thus, restoring mangroves is a strategic pathway for mitigating global climate change. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the organic matter dynamics in mangrove soils during restoration processes. Four mangrove soils under different developmental stages along the northeastern Brazilian coast were studied, including a degraded mangrove (DM); recovering mangroves after 3 years (3Y) and 7 years (7Y) of planting; and a mature mangrove (MM). The soil total organic carbon (CT) and soil carbon stocks (SCSs) were determined for each area. Additionally, a demineralization procedure was conducted to assess the most complex humidified and recalcitrant fractions of soil organic matter and the fraction participating in organomineral interactions. The particle size distribution was also analyzed. Our results revealed significant differences in the SCS and CT values between the DM, 3Y and 7Y, and the MM, for which there was a tendency to increase in carbon content with increasing vegetative development. However, based on the metrics used to evaluate organic matter interactions with inorganic fractions, such as low rates of carbon enrichment, C recovery, and low C content after hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment being similar for the DM and the 3Y and 7Y—this indicated that high carbon losses were coinciding with mineral dissolution. These results indicate that the organic carbon dynamics in degraded and newly planted sites depend more on organomineral interactions, both to maintain their previous SCS and increase it, than mature mangroves. Conversely, the MM appeared to have most of the soil organic carbon, as the stabilized organic matter had a complex structure with a high molecular weight and contributed less in the organomineral interactions to the SCS. These results demonstrate the role of initial mangrove vegetation development in trapping fine mineral particles and favoring organomineral interactions. These findings will help elucidate organic accumulation in different replanted mangrove restoration scenarios. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the cocoa pollinator identity is largely unknown and there are important knowledge gaps regarding landscape and farm-level management driving pollinators. Here we analyzed flower visitation with two approaches to quantify how landscape and farm-level factors affect potential pollinators (flower visitors) of cocoa in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. In the first approach (landscape and farm-level) we selected 18 farms and focused on the relative importance of distance to forest (m), potential-pollinator habitats surrounding the farm (i.e. secondary forests and cocoa agroforests [%]), canopy cover (%), leaf-litter amount (kg/m2), and cocoa flower abundance for flower visitors. In the second approach (experimental farm management) we manipulated leaf-litter in 24 farms, because high leaf-litter is suggested to enhance flower visitors. We found that ants and Diptera were the most common flower visitors, and although previous studies suggest ceratopogonids as main cocoa pollinators, none were captured in this study. In the landscape and farm-level approach, potential-pollinator habitats surrounding the farm, and increased canopy cover enhanced ant and Diptera abundance, whereas distance to forest had no effect. In the experimental farm management approach, potential-pollinator habitats surrounding the farm rather than leaf-litter manipulation increased Diptera and ant abundance. In summary conservation of forests and agroforests surrounding the farm, maintaining canopy cover and minimum leaf-litter enhance cocoa flower visitors. Thus, farms with shade trees embedded in a biodiversity-friendly landscape are important for conservation of potential pollinators and pollination services and, thereby, promotion of sustainable cocoa. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Agroforestry systems and Farm management and Flower visitor and Forest conservation and Indonesia and Pollinator habitats and Greater Sunda Islands and Sulawesi and Sunda Isles and Diptera and Hexapoda and Theobroma cacao and biodiversity and cocoa and conservation status and insect and landscape ecology and leaf litter and pollination and pollinator,10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109106,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103780679&doi=10.1016%2fj.biocon.2021.109106&partnerID=40&md5=903e3c2dd7b79939d0fcc3ade4c11e39,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 27,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAY,0006-3207 and 1873-2917,WOS:000663301900014,APR 2021,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1822, 5373"

Field campaigns across West Kalimantan sites were conducted during both rainy and dry seasons, using mist nets and 10-min point count recordings along transects. We used four diversity indices, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and the Indicator Value index (IndVal) for our analysis. Our results endorsed the general trend found across the tropics of a significant reduction in bird species richness, from the complex natural and old secondary forest structures to the simplified monoculture habitats. We recorded 10,519 individuals across 214 bird species, representing almost 90% of Borneo's lowland forest species. NMDS differentiated intact forest from forest fragments and land under different agriculture uses. Eighty percent of the bird species preferred an intact forest environment. Industrial oil palm sites were the most ‘avoided’ vegetation type. Using IndVal, we found six indicator species significantly associated with forest, three indicator species for depleted forest, one for mixed garden, and none for oil palm plantation. Farm-dependent species richness was strikingly low, and species had little conservation value as per IUCN standards; industrial oil palm plantations were poorest in bird species. Notable exceptions were traditional mixed gardens and old fallows associated with swidden agriculture, when in proximity to forest. These traditional agroforestry systems have higher conservation value than industrial and smallholder monoculture plantations, however, their long-term preservation is uncertain, and monitoring programs are lacking that can contribute to long-term biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service maintenance. More data are needed to determine the viable population sizes for the bird indicator species identified in our study. Such knowledge on population trends can be used to monitor habitat quality and health of forest agriculture landscape mosaics and improve the effectiveness of management, conservation and monitoring in future. © 2021 The Authors",Bird and Indicator species and Indicator value and Indonesia and Kalimantan and Landscape mosaic,10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e01610,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105298520&doi=10.1016%2fj.gecco.2021.e01610&partnerID=40&md5=6be02224ac5b069dba289595f8fb3aa8,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 13,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,JUN,2351-9894,WOS:000663457500009,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1824, 4985"

In this context, Schizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum Huber × Ducke (paricá) has shown good silvicultural performance in AFSs. Nevertheless, the properties of its wood when grown in AFSs are not widely reported in the literature. The present study aimed to characterize paricá wood regarding its technological characteristics and industrial applications. Wood was obtained from a multi-stratified AFS in midwestern Rondônia state, northern Brazil. The AFS is composed of perennial crops and forest species cultivated in double rows with spacing of 5.0 m × 2.5 m. Experimental results showed paricá wood had low extractives content and density along with good dimensional stability. However, the wood’s mechanical performance was similar to that observed in material from pure plantations and pristine forests. Specific strength was similar to wood species with higher basic densities. Paricá wood reached the minimum requirements for structural uses and had suitable characteristics to be employed to produce engineered wood panels. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.",Agroforestry system and Chemical composition and Mechanical properties and Paricá wood and Physical properties and Wood quality assessment and Amazonas [Brazil] and Brazil and Schizolobium amazonicum and agricultural production and agroforestry and ecosystem service and hybrid and literature review and perennial plant and performance assessment and rainforest and silviculture and sustainable development,10.1007/s10457-020-00576-5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101223155&doi=10.1007%2fs10457-020-00576-5&partnerID=40&md5=a17a02b4cca818826ee81fd46ccbdc39,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 8,NA,JOUR,3,475,486,NA,MAR,0167-4366 and 1572-9680,WOS:000620119700001,FEB 2021,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1826, 4795"

Nocturnal bees are still poorly studied due to bias towards studying diurnal insects. However, knowledge concerning their biology and role as crop pollinators has increased. We review the literature on nocturnal bees’ traits and their host plants, and assess the crop pollination effectiveness of this neglected group. Nocturnal bees have visual adaptations to cope with low light intensities, and floral scents are a key sensory cue used to find their host flowers. Nocturnal bees generally show high flower constancy, the ability to vibrate flowers, and high transfer rates of pollen grains to stigmas. The flowers visited by nocturnal bees range from small radial and zygomorphic flowers to large brush blossoms; moreover, they visit plants with different flowering strategies. Nocturnal bees are effective pollinators of regional fruit crops in Brazil, such as cambuci (Campomanesia phaea), guaraná (Paullinia cupana), cajá (Spondias mombin), and in North America of cultivated pumpkins (Cucurbita species). However, they most likely are pollinators of several other crops. Strategies to host high numbers of nocturnal bees around cropping areas should be taken, such as preserving adjacent native forests, restricting soil management, providing food resources beyond crop flowers, and avoiding light pollution. © 2021 by the authors.

In an effort to achieve high economic growth, land productivity is spurred in such a way as to result in the increased exploitation of natural resources which has an impact on the destruction of forests, land, water, air, and biodiversity. The concept of sustainable use of natural resources will face various challenges because, on the one hand, increased economic resilience must be encouraged, while on the other hand, ecological aspects and physical preservation of the landscape must be maintained. The study was aimed at finding out the historical basis of forest land-use change and recommendations for sustainable land use models based on the economic and ecological adaptation of farmers around the buffer zone of Lore Lindu National Park (TNLL), Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. This type of research is qualitative research to describe the history of land-use change and ecological adaptation. Meanwhile, economic risk analysis is used to explain the economic adaptation of farmers.

This paper contributes to our understanding of mangrove microbiomes distributed along three biogeographical provinces and ecoregions, covering the exuberant mangroves of Amazonia ecoregion (North Brazil Shelf) as well as mangroves located in the southern limit of distribution (Southeastern ecoregion, Warm Temperate Southwestern Atlantic) and mangroves localized on the drier semi-arid coast (Northeastern ecoregion, Tropical Southwestern Atlantic), two important ecotones where poleward and landward shifts, respectively, are expected to occur related to climate change. This study compared the microbiomes associated with the conspicuous red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) root soils encompassing soil properties, latitudinal factors, and amplicon sequence variants of 105 samples. We demonstrated that, although the northern and southern sites are over 4,000 km apart, and despite R. mangle genetic divergences between north and south populations, their microbiomes resemble each other more than the northern and northeastern neighbors. In addition, the northeastern semi-arid microbiomes were more diverse and displayed a higher level of complexity than the northern and southern ones. This finding may reflect the endurance of the northeast microbial communities tailored to deal with the stressful conditions of semi-aridity and may play a role in the resistance and growing landward expansion observed in such mangroves. Minimum temperature, precipitation, organic carbon, and potential evapotranspiration were the main microbiota variation drivers and should be considered in mangrove conservation and recovery strategies in the Anthropocene. In the face of changes in climate, land cover, biodiversity, and chemical composition, the richness and complexity harbored by semi-arid mangrove microbiomes may hold the key to mangrove adaptability in our changing planet. © Copyright © 2021 Tavares, Bezerra, Normando, Rosado and Melo.",amplicon sequence variants and blue carbon and network co-occurrence analysis and red mangrove and Rhizophora mangle and soil microbial community and DNA 16S and genomic DNA and iron and nitrogen and nucleotide and organic carbon and organic matter and RNA 16S and sulfur and Acidobacteria and allotype and Amazonas (Brazil) and amplicon and anaerobic ammonium oxidation and archaeon and Article and bacterium and Bacteroidetes and biodiversity and biogeographic region and biosphere and Campylobacterales and chemical composition and Chloroflexi and climate change and conservation biology and controlled study and Deltaproteobacteria and Desulfobacterales and DNA barcoding and DNA extraction and DNA sequencing and ebb tide and ecosystem monitoring and ecotone and environmental monitoring and environmental sustainability and Euryarchaeota and evapotranspiration and Gammaproteobacteria and genetic variability and genotype and greenhouse effect and Halomonas and halophilic archaeon and halophilic bacterium and heterozygosity and humidity and in situ hybridization and land use and mangrove and metagenomics and microbial activity and microbiome and microflora and monitoring and network analysis and nitrification and nonhuman and particle size and Planctomycetes and precipitation and prokaryotic evolution and Proteobacteria and Rhizophora mangle and salinity and semiarid climate and soil and soil acidity and species richness and Spirochaeta and temperature and Thermoplasmata and tropical rain forest and vegan and Verrucomicrobia,10.3389/fmicb.2021.715991,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114651874&doi=10.3389%2ffmicb.2021.715991&partnerID=40&md5=4b8c624d5ff60e6457ac6280b04d09e4,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 17,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1836

As a fire-prone ecosystem, natural fire in the Cerrado shapes plant communities and drives evolutionary processes. Human activities and landscape management can alter natural fire regimes and reshape Cerrado dynamics, making biodiversity conservation a challenge, particularly in densely populated areas. We reconstructed the historical fire regime of three protected areas (PA) and their buffer zones in São Paulo state to understand how current fire exclusion policies are affecting fire regimes and to measure how human-climate-fire relationships can change in areas under different land management. We used Landsat satellite imagery, from 1984 to 2017, with 30 m of spatial resolution and 16 days of temporal resolution. In total, we mapped 49,471 ha of burned area, and we detected variations in fire frequency and fire size among sites. PA dominated by open savanna in Itirapina concentrated 93 % of all observed fires, while PA dominated by forest-like formations in Assis represented only 2% of the fires. Annual rainfall showed a very weak relationship (R2 = 0.04) with annual total burned area, while the rainfall split between dry and wet seasons showed a tendency to have a fuel moisture effect which determined the vegetation available to burn in the dry season (R² = 0.09). Fire regimes in PA were similar to those observed in buffer zones suggesting that fire-exclusion policies do not effectively prevent fires in PA that are surrounded by an anthropic matrix where fire is often used. When we included human factors in addition to rainfall, our models explained 44 % of variation of burned areas. We conclude that fire regimes in São Paulo Cerrado have been modified by humans and that fire exclusion is not a suitable policy for protected areas in this fire-prone ecosystem. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH",Anthropic landscapes and Fire management and Forestry and Landsat and Protected areas and Savannas and Brazil and Sao Paulo [Brazil] and buffer zone and environmental policy and fire management and forest fire and Landsat and protected area and satellite data and satellite imagery and spatial resolution,10.1016/j.jnc.2021.126006,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107148341&doi=10.1016%2fj.jnc.2021.126006&partnerID=40&md5=66e9c896dd36bac8b30d9e33e75fa0c0,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 23,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,JUN,1617-1381 and 1618-1093,WOS:000649653800008,APR 2021,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1844, 5485"

The model favors application to headwater catchments where clean water production is expected. However, the frequent invasion of these areas with intensive agriculture and livestock production systems affects water quality threatening the use of this resource, namely as drinking water. The proposed Agriculture for Clean Water Yield (ACWY) model reconciles agriculture with clean water production through the incentive approach, giving the farmers a financial compensation if they are willing to replace intensive by sustainable agriculture and livestock production systems, namely agro-forestry systems. The reconciliation through the incentive approach is justified because clean water and food are both vital goods for human survival. The compensation rises as function of increasing catchment water yield capacity and conversion costs. For example, landowners receive more if land conversion occurs in slopping than undulated landscapes. The model applied to Fazenda Glória watershed, composed of 19 headwater catchments (96.7 ha on average), proposed financial incentives in the range 218.73–576.5 US$/ha/year depending on the catchment's water yield capacity, which rise to 284.35–749.45 US$/ha/year if conversions occur in extreme vulnerable areas. The watershed, located in São Paulo state, Brazil, covers 18.4 km2 and is the source of drinking water to 70,000 people living in Jaboticabal city. Monitoring is essential to assess the performance of ACWY and adjust the compensation dynamically. For instance, noteworthy improvements in water yields and water quality or land conversions performed in short periods can expect the most generous compensation. Two concerns about implementing the model in Fazenda Glória rely on the lack of political will in spite of existing federal and state legal support, as well as on the financial sources to make the model a real project. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Agro-forestry sustainable production and Best management practices and Headwater catchments and Land conversion and Payment for ecosystem services and Water provision services and Catchments and Ecosystems and Finance and Forestry and Potable water and Sustainable development and Timber and Water quality and Watersheds and drinking water and water and Agriculture productions and Agro-forestry sustainable production and Best Management Practise and Clean waters and Headwater catchment and Land conversion and Payments for ecosystem services and Water production and Water provision service and Water yield and agroforestry and catchment and drinking water and ecosystem service and headwater and resource management and sustainable development and water resource and agricultural worker and agriculture and agroforestry and Article and available water capacity and Brazil and catchment area (hydrology) and cropland and economic incentive and harvest and human and livestock and priority journal and water monitoring and water quality and water supply and watershed and workman compensation and Runoff,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147331,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105691414&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2021.147331&partnerID=40&md5=848c5966056a3d8b84b1492fbb80590b,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 22,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1845

However, it is unclear how grazing exclusion reduces the negative effects of overgrazing on the microbial community in the Caatinga biome. In our study, we assessed the bacterial community under three different soil managements in a semiarid region of the Brazilian Caatinga biome, as follows: (a) Native Caatinga vegetation (natural); (b) grazing exclusion (exclusion); and (c) overgrazing (grazed). The bacterial community was assessed through the sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene and analyzed soil chemical and physical properties were correlated with the bacterial community structure. Our results demonstrate that exclusion increases the content of soil carbon and nitrogen, and bacterial diversity, while grazed showed a reduction of ~31 and ~43% in organic C, compared to exclusion and natural, respectively. However, the changes in bacterial diversity were more expressive in a specific site (No. 1), suggesting that exclusion strategy could be a context-dependent and complex approach to protecting or improving Caatinga soils. Moreover, grazed areas might restrain the potential of bacterial diversity to sustain ecosystem functions since nonbeneficial elements increased in grazed treatments, which presented a negative correlation with the bacterial community. Our study provides novel evidence that high-intensity disturbance by overgrazing could not only reduce soil fertility but it may also restrain bacterial composition, with implications on ecosystem functioning.

However, afforestation and fire suppression have caused significant ecological changes and biodiversity loss in the Cerrado region. Restoring these modified systems to their pre-plantation states remains a considerable challenge. In this study, we compared the recovery of savanna vegetation after afforestation in areas managed with three restoration strategies: (i) old pine plantation stands that are not managed anymore (control), (ii) passive restoration (natural regeneration after pine clearcutting), and (iii) native tree planting (native tree seedlings planted at high density after pine clearcutting). To compare the outcome of each strategy to native ecosystems that were never plantations, we sampled a cerrado sensu stricto (the desired restoration target), and a cerradão (the local alternative state when savannas are fire-suppressed). Fifteen years after applying the restoration approaches, we assessed the structure, richness, and composition of the plant communities. For the analyses, we separated the upper layer (woody native species, diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 5 cm) and ground layer (woody species with height ≥ 50 cm and DBH < 5 cm, and subshrubs and herbs), and distinguished savanna species from forest and generalist species. The results showed that both passive restoration and native tree planting restored the structure, richness, and composition of the upper layer, reaching the values of the cerrado sensu stricto. In contrast, in all treatments, the ground layer lacked the subshrubs and herbs typical of undisturbed savannas, with communities appearing similar to cerradão. Generalist species dominated all layers, and tree canopy cover in the treatments (mean values from 64.7% to 83.0%) ranged from 2.4 to 3 times the cover value recorded in the cerrado sensu stricto (mean of 28%). Pine clearcutting, independent of whether it was followed by native tree planting, improved the recovery of savanna woody vegetation. Therefore, we suggest that pine clearcutting, but not tree planting, is necessary to restore the woody community. Despite these apparently positive restoration outcomes for the woody plant community, it is important to note that after 15 years of passive restoration, communities are turning into low-diversity forests composed of generalist species and lacking savanna species in the ground-layer community. We therefore suggest that restoration of cerrado sensu stricto after pine clearcutting will require controlling woody encroachment, via prescribed fire or mechanical tree thinning, and planting of savanna subshrubs and herbs, rather than trees. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Afforestation and Ecological restoration and Natural regeneration and Old-growth savanna and Savanna encroachment and Biodiversity and Conservation and Ecosystems and Plants and Reforestation and Brazil and Biodiversity and Conservation and Ecosystems and Reforestation and Seed and Structure (composition) and Vegetation and Cerrado and Ecological restoration and Ground layer and Native trees and Natural regeneration and Old-growth savanna and Passive restorations and Plantings and Savanna encroachment and Tree plantings and anthropogenic effect and biodiversity and cerrado and clearcutting and coniferous forest and forestry production and native species and pine and restoration ecology and savanna and silviculture and Restoration,10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119158,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103639052&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2021.119158&partnerID=40&md5=8b94a17cea058bd8739b2cc3d8f7a685,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 13,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1848

The degradation of natural areas in order to turn them into croplands has been causing severe effects to the soil quality, including the maintenance of their biodiversity. Soil physical disruption reduce the soil biodiversity and, consequently, may cause negative effects to the supporting services, i.e., organic matter degradation and nutrient cycling, which will directly or indirectly impact agroecosystems. In this study, the influence of three different types of land uses (native forest (NF), conventional agriculture (CA), and organic agriculture (OA)) to the soil mesofauna (emphasizing collembolan and mites) were assessed under real scenarios in the southeast part of Brazil. Both conventional and organic fields were of strawberries, and the greatest difference in their processes was the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, performed at CA. Soil fauna organisms were collected and identified to main groups, except the collembolan species which were further separated into four main groups/family. Results showed that not only the physical changes due to soil tillage caused negative effects to soil fauna. In the field where the use of agricultural products was allowed, organisms were much more severely affected. Hence, the conversion of natural forested areas to agricultural lands may harm soil fauna communities through biodiversity loss.

Diversity, biomass, covers, and NDVI of restored mangrove forests in Karawang and Subang Coasts, West Java, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 22: 4115-4122. Indonesia has been recognized as the country with greatest diversity of mangrove species with significant amount of carbon sink and biomass. In few recent decades, mangrove forests have been deforested significantly. One of the solutions to deal with mangrove deforestation is through restoration. West Java north coasts are one of the areas that have experienced deforestation, however and mangrove restorations have been conducted mainly in Karawang and Subang coasts. Correspondingly this research aims to assess the mangrove diversity using index and biomass resulted from restoration program in those coasts. To assess the mangrove diversity in each coast on June 2021, 6 sampling stations containing 3 replicated sample plots of size 10 m × 10 m were located. In total 8 species with 1549 trees were been sampled. In Subang the order of mangrove species from common to less-common species were Avicennia marina > Rhizophora mucronata > Sonneratia caseolaris > Acanthus ilicifolius > Bruguiera gymnorhiza. While the order in Karawang was Avicennia marina > Rhizophora mucronata > Rhizophora apiculata > Sonneratia caseolaris >Bruguiera gymnorhiza. The mangrove diversity (H)’ was significantly different (p = 0.000, F = 2.216) with diversity in Subang Coast (average H' = 1.326, 95% CI: 1.15-1.5) was higher than in Karawang (average H’ = 1.063, 95%CI: 0.934-1.2). Estimated restored mangrove covers in Subang were 3.612 km2 and 0.46 km2 in Karawang. R. mucronata was mangrove species that has the highest biomass with the value of 1337.91 mg ha-1 and the lowest was A. marina with value of 14.3 mg ha-1. The results suggest that restoration areas in Subang and Karawang have significant contributions to maintain mangrove diversity, biomass, and covers. © 2021, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

Flora and fauna have been continuously monitored for a period of 10 years (2009–2018), to assess the effectiveness of environmental management programs on the biological aspect. Mangrove flora and fauna recorded in the area comprise 28 true mangrove species representing 11 families along with 103 birds (40 families), 9 reptiles (6 families) and 7 mammals (5 families). Results confirm previous studies that secondary mangrove forest shows significant growth and recovery, with 5 true mangrove species consistently becoming dominant species in primary and secondary mangrove forest. Logging on mangroves significantly impacted the biodiversity of flora as Rhizopora apiculata become more dominant in secondary forest covering 69% of total species composition. Abundance and diversity of fauna in secondary forest was higher in younger forests as compared to older stands. About 18% of total fauna individual was categorized as keystone species. Fauna composition was not significantly impacted by logging most likely due to the abundance of habitat (untouched forest) remaining in the surrounding harvest area.

Cattle grazing removal over a short-term is widely used in introduced Brazilian pastures. However, the impact of this management on dung beetles is still unknown.

We sampled dung beetles, with pitfall traps baited with cattle dung and carrion, simultaneously in pastures with constant cattle grazing (control), and one, three, and five months after cattle grazing removal in Aquidauana, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Taxonomic metrics and FRic, FDis, and FEve did not differ among control and pasture treatments. We found that pastures with one month of cattle removal maintain the same CWM coprophagous diet from the control, and higher CWM biomass in relation to control. Although cattle grazing removal, at least over the short-term, does not cause a negative impact on dung beetle taxonomic metrics and functional diversity indexes, two important traits associated to dung removal are negatively affected after three months of cattle removal. Thus, we suggest that one month of cattle removal to grazing rotational management in introduced Brazilian pastures can be a useful strategy to, besides conserving the grass, also conserving dung beetle diversity, and consequently the ecological functions performed by them. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS",Agro-pastoral landscape and Cattle grazing management and Functional diversity and Functional groups and Scarabaeinae and Urochloa spp. and Brazil and Mato Grosso do Sul and Coleoptera and Hexapoda and Scarabaeinae and Urochloa and beetle and biodiversity and cattle and conservation planning and functional role and grazing management and pasture and pitfall trap and species diversity and taxonomy,10.1016/j.actao.2020.103681,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097430889&doi=10.1016%2fj.actao.2020.103681&partnerID=40&md5=f3cd06abffd096bc8743ecbb813de001,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 14,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAY,1146-609X and 1873-6238,WOS:000641035900010,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1860, 5357"

Grassy ecosystems characterize extensive areas in all biomes in Brazil, offering great contribution to biological diversity and providing ecosystem services on which society depends. Palaeoecological evidence indicates these ecosystems evolved under the influence of grazing and fire, and these disturbances have been essential for controlling the dominance of woody vegetation. While the need for fire to maintain grassy biomes has been recently discussed, grazing as a management tool for conservation is still little accepted by the local scientific community and by decision-makers. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of the current literature on grazing management and its effects on grassy ecosystems in Brazil. Based on a review of the role of grazers prior and after European colonization, and a synthesis on grazing effects across different systems, we call for the evaluation of grazing as a management tool for biodiversity conservation in Brazil's grassy systems. Grazing should be an interesting management strategy especially in Legal Reserves with grassy vegetation types, as it can ally conservation with livestock production. To achieve these potentially complementary objectives, a research agenda needs to be developed to devise adaptive management strategies for Legal Reserves. In this, relevant stakeholders should be included and both the ecological conditions of the ecosystem in question and the socioeconomic determinants considered. © 2021 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação",Adaptive management and Grassland and Grazing and Legal Reserve and Savanna,10.1016/j.pecon.2021.06.002,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108940536&doi=10.1016%2fj.pecon.2021.06.002&partnerID=40&md5=f66ad99748de73a1694e780578e4c3b8,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 32,NA,JOUR,3,256,266,NA,JUL-SEP,2530-0644,WOS:000684303700002,AUG 2021,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1862, 4930"

To sustainably manage the mangroves that remain, an ecosystem approach to management is essential. Two different management regimes – conservation and restoration – were assessed, looking at their respective effects on forest structure and carbon cycling capacity, when compared with degraded mangrove. We found that mangrove restoration enhanced tree density, while mangrove conservation was able to maintain species diversity. In terms of carbon budgets, aboveground carbon was lower in restored mangrove (79.40 ± 37.41 Mg C ha−1) when compared with conserved mangrove (92.26 ± 22.65 Mg C ha−1), but was almost double that found in degraded mangrove (39.89 ± 27.49 Mg C ha−1). Although conserved mangrove had higher aboveground carbon, lower amounts of soil carbon were found in conserved mangrove (127.49 ± 33.21 Mg C ha−1) than in restored and degraded mangrove (236.26 ± 20.33 Mg C ha−1 and 139.17 ± 25.44 Mg C ha−1, respectively). The elevation change was highest in degraded mangrove (41.7 ± 24.0 mm yr−1), followed by restored (20.7 ± 14.6 mm yr−1) and conserved mangrove (12.2 ± 3.9 mm yr−1). Carbon burial in conserved mangrove (1.20 ± 1.90 Mg C ha−2 yr−1) was double that of degraded mangrove (0.63 ± 0.60 Mg C ha−2 yr−1). Ultimately, we conclude that although a conserved mangrove is not always the end result of mangrove restoration and sustainable management, finding balance between structural development and ecosystem function is essential to serve different objectives, including biodiversity maintenance. © 2021 The Authors",Biodiversity and Blue carbon and Carbon stocks and Environmental isotope <sup>210</sup>Pb and rSET-MH and Matthiola and Rhizophoraceae,10.1016/j.ecss.2021.107467,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108015604&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecss.2021.107467&partnerID=40&md5=b6ef175bcc69b0a9397aba4635174908,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 35,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,SEP 30,0272-7714 and 1096-0015,WOS:000685355700002,JUN 2021,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1863, 4594"

However, the structural stability of the soil against the external stresses can be enhanced through the addition of organic substances. The study aimed to investigate the efficacy of biochar addition on the microstructural stability of a Gleyic Luvic Planosol under yearly conventional tillage of rice-fallow-rice lowland ecosystem in southern Brazil. Organic amendment consisted of four levels of rice husk biochar rates namely 0 % (Bio0), 2 % (Bio2), 5 % (Bio5) and 10 % (Bio10) by dry mass, corresponding to 0, 20, 50, and 100 g biochar/kg soil. As organic matter is known to closely interact with density, we decided further to investigate the impact of varying density, namely 1.15, 1.33, 1.45, 1.60, and 1.75 g/cm3. Biochar-incubated soil samples were subjected to four levels of matric potentials (0, -3, -6, and -10 kPa). The microstructural stability parameters of strain (γ), shear resistance (τ), storage and loss moduli (G’, G’’), and coefficient of structural rigidity (Iz) of the amended soil samples were evaluated using the amplitude sweep test in a rheometer. Increasing biochar rate significantly (p < 0.05) increased the soil organic matter and, consequently, the water retention capacity of the biochar-amended Planosol. The stabilizing effect of biochar addition was reflected in higher microstructural stability of the amended soil compared to the control (no biochar). Increasing density in the biochar-amended Planosol increased the shear resistance, reduced the strain at linear viscoelasticity and yield point, and decreased the stiffness degradation.

1870,Scopus,Review,"Procópio, L. and Barreto, C.",2021,The soil microbiomes of the Brazilian Cerrado,Journal of Soils and Sediments,21,NA,"Purpose: The slightly exuberant appearance suggests a misleading idea of an insignificant diversity of microorganisms in Cerrado soils. Thus, a review is necessary, gathering essential information on the microbiology of the Cerrado soil, and its biogeochemical processes, as well as the effects of anthropogenic impacts on this important biome. Materials and methods: We reviewed studies of microbiota, bacteria, archaea, and fungi, from the Cerrado soil, which were carried out by metagenomic methods, or amplicons sequencing. Also, we evaluated the descriptions of the Cerrado’s characteristics, and describe the implications of the expansion of agricultural areas, anthropic impacts, and wildfires on the soil microbiota. Results and discussion: The acidic soil, subject to variations in nutrient cycling depending on the climatic season, reflects on the structures of the communities of the main bacterial groups of Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Members of the Archaea are also abundant in the Cerrado soil, with an emphasis on representatives of the groups Euryarchaeota, Crenarchaeota, and Thaumarchaeota. The fungi found in Cerrado soils are normally dominated by Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, which exert influence of the impact of land use, such as grazing and agriculture. Despite its immense microbial biodiversity, the Cerrado constantly suffers the impacts of the “new agricultural frontier,” which has been devastating the biome through the cultivation of sugarcane, maize, cotton, and soybean monocultures, in particular. Conclusions: These activities, with consequent loss of native areas of the Cerrado, modify the microbiome present in the soil, changing the flow of nutrients and interfering in biogeochemical processes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Biogeochemical cycles and Cerrado and Land use and Microbiome and Soil and Brazil and Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria and Archaea and Ascomycota and Bacteria (microorganisms) and Basidiomycota and Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota and Glycine max and Gossypium hirsutum and Microbiota and Proteobacteria and cerrado and cultivation and growing season and microbiology and nutrient cycling and soil ecosystem and soil microorganism and soybean,10.1007/s11368-021-02936-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103189362&doi=10.1007%2fs11368-021-02936-9&partnerID=40&md5=c5bc9cbb31782fce3ff113f731e168e4,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 23,NA,JOUR,6,2327,2342,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1870

With the objective of evaluating soil structuring, this study determined the physical attributes and organic carbon contents of a clayey Oxisol in an area of 10 years under four different land uses: i.e., afforestation (AF), no-tillage system with grass-grass succession (corn/corn), no-tillage systems with grass-legume succession (corn/Crotalaria juncea L.) and conventional soil tillage system (corn/fallow). The evaluated areas are located in the Cerrado biome of southeastern Brazil. Each area was sampled at 20 points and undisturbed and disturbed samples were collected in the layers of 0.00−0.10 m, 0.10−0.20 m and 0.20−0.30 m. The attributes evaluated were related to soil aggregation and porosity and, due to the structure of dependence of the variables, the data were subjected to multivariate factor analysis. We observed that, after a long period, the no-tillage system promoted soil aggregation and porosity similar to those of the planted forest and superior to those of the conventional tillage system. The type of crop succession in the no-tillage system caused differences in soil structure, and grass-grass succession (corn/corn) promoted better soil structure compared to grass-legume succession (corn/Crotalaria juncea L.). The greater soil porosity generated by the conventional tillage system was limited to the most superficial layer (0.00−0.10 m) and this effect can be considered ephemeral, due to the presence of a large amount of smaller aggregates that, after the operation, can occupy the generated pores. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Grass and Legume and Soil aggregation and Soil management and Soil porosity and Brazil and Fabaceae and Crops and Cultivation and Land use and Multivariant analysis and Organic carbon and Porosity and Reforestation and Carbon sequestration and Conventional tillage and Multivariate factor analysis and No-tillage systems and Organic carbon contents and Soil tillage system and Southeastern Brazil and Superficial layers and afforestation and biome and carbon sequestration and cultivation and organic carbon and Oxisol and porosity and soil-structure interaction and succession and tillage and Soils,10.1016/j.still.2020.104924,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099822429&doi=10.1016%2fj.still.2020.104924&partnerID=40&md5=d2e1cfc2eb8360030d181e84f4376258,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 12,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAY,0167-1987 and 1879-3444,WOS:000632560800006,JAN 2021,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1871, 5273"

This study aims to analyze the gender perspectives on agroforestry (AF) practices in the Mt. Merapi prone area. 128 men and 86 women were randomly selected from four different areas. Descriptive analysis, independent t-test, and logistic multinomial regression were used to analyze the data. Gender issue in AF practices is found in some parts of the practices. For example, women are more predominant in marketing the products rather than men, whilst the men are predominant in activities that need more strength such as planting. An external factor that is significant is the different impacts of farmers support groups on men and women. Meanwhile, factors such as capital access and AF easiness do not show significant differences between men and women. In other words, these two variables are felt the same among men and women when practicing AF. As for the contribution of AF, social aspect is found to show significant differences, whilst economic and ecology do not show significant differences to both the men and women. Additionally, factors that affect the perspectives on AF contribution vary among the respondents across both groups of men and women. This study suggests that the different perspectives and factors that are affecting AF farmers can be used to develop future AF promotion programs. © 2021, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

This is especially true for the herbaceous strata at the community level, in which reproductive efforts are deeply affected by fire. The objectives of this study were the following: evaluate if fire qualitatively and/or quantitatively affects the production of sexual reproductive structures in an open cerrado community; describe fire-stimulated or fire-inhibited flowering and fruiting species; and evaluate the influence of water availability on flowering and fruiting. The number of species with flowers and fruits/m2 and the number of reproductive units/m2 were sampled in eight 20×20 m2 plots in Chapada Diamantina, Brazil. After the first sampling in the beginning of the rainy season (November 2009), the vegetation in four plots was burned and then the eight plots were resampled over five months. Indexes of fire-stimulated and fire-inhibited flowering and fruiting species were calculated. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and cross-correlation analyses were calculated and differences between the burnt and unburnt plots were compared with an analysis of variance. Sexual reproduction was deeply affected by fire, which changed the composition of reproducing species. Profuse reproduction of graminoids (Poaceae) and geophytic herbs classified as fire-stimulated flowering and/or fire-stimulated fruiting species concomitantly occurred with a high increase of water in the burnt soil compared to the unburnt soil in the first two months after the fires. The sexual reproduction of shrubby species was inhibited by fire. In an objective way, 21 species stimulated or inhibited by fire were recorded. Fire also changed the influence of rainfall on reproductive efforts.

Smoke from wildfires worsened the situation of isolated, as well as urban communities, already under an increasing toll of COVID-19. Here we review the impacts and the possible causes of the 2020 mega-fires and recommend improvements for public policies and fire management in this wetland. We calculated the amount of area burnt annually since 2003 and describe patterns in precipitation and water level measurements of the Paraguay River. Our analyses revealed that the 2020 wildfires were historically unprecedented, as 43% of the area (over 17,200 km2) had not been burnt previously in the last two decades. The extent of area affected in 2020 represents a 376% increase compared to the annual average of the area burnt annually in the last two decades, double than the value in 2019. Potential factors responsible for this increase are (i) severe drought decreased water levels, (ii) the fire corridor was located in the Paraguay River flood zone, (iii) constraints on firefighters, (iv) insufficient fire prevention strategy and agency budget reductions, and (v) recent landscape changes. Climate and land use change will further increase the frequency of these extreme events. To make fire management more efficient and cost-effective, we recommend the implementation of an Integrated Fire Management program in the Pantanal. Stakeholders should use existing traditional, local ecological, and scientific knowledge to form a collective strategy with clear, achievable, measurable goals, considering the socio-ecological context. Permanent fire brigades, including indigenous members, should conduct year-round fire management. Communities should cooperate to create a collaborative network for wildfire prevention, the location and characteristics (including flammability) of infrastructures should be (re)planned in fire-prone environments considering and managing fire-catalysed transitions, and depending on the severity of wildfires.

Here I briefly examine trade-offs and synergies between the productivity of graze-based livestock systems and the environment, and share a few generic guidelines to design pathways for the ecological intensification of livestock systems following agroecological principles. I draw from experience on livestock farming in the Rio de la Plata Grassland Biome of South America (Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil). Livestock systems based on native grasslands in this region may have greater carbon footprints (13–29 kg CO2 eq. kg LW−1) than intensive grass-feedlot systems in the region (9–14 kg CO2 eq. kg LW−1) or the average range reported for OECD countries (c. 10–20 kg CO2 eq. kg LW−1) when calculated per unit product, but only 20% greater when expressed on an area basis. Yet they use less external energy (10x) or nitrogen inputs (5x) per kg live weight (LW) produced, provide ecosystem services of local and global importance, such as carbon storage, habitat protection for biodiversity, watershed regulation, clean water, food and textiles, livelihoods and local cultures, and provide better living conditions for grazing animals. Traditional graze-based systems are less economically attractive than intensive livestock or grain production and they are being replaced by such activities, with negative social and environmental consequences. An ecological intensification (EI) of graze-based livestock systems is urgently needed to ensure economic profits while minimising social-ecological trade-offs on multifunctional landscapes. Examples of such EI systems exist in the region that exhibit synergies between economic and environmental goals, but a broad and lasting transition towards sustainable multifunctional landscapes based on agroecological principles requires (co-)innovation at both technical and institutional levels. © Copyright © 2021 Tittonell.",agroecology and carbon footprint and environment and livestock and sustainability and trade-offs,10.3389/fsufs.2021.664103,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109134773&doi=10.3389%2ffsufs.2021.664103&partnerID=40&md5=247b1be695e4ded82433f088dbfef47e,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 18,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,JUN 22,2571-581X,WOS:000669846800001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1881, 4684"

However, the mechanisms that support these benefits have not been examined in detail. On-farm experiments were conducted in Indonesia during five rice cropping cycles. We compared three monoculture rice systems receiving chemical or organic inputs, and four organic polyculture rice systems that varied in level of complexity. To investigate the agro-ecological mechanisms of weed and pest suppression and nutrient cycling that determine rice productivity and stability, the dynamics of weeds, pests, nutrients and rice yields were monitored and related to rice system complexity. The observations revealed that increasing the level of complexity resulted in lower levels of weed and pest infestation. Analysis of duck behaviour and their gizzard composition showed that ducks foraged intensively on weeds, insects, and snails. Furthermore, nutrient cycling was accelerated by ducks via feeding and excretion as well as by their movement in the field. This could explain why rice yields increased along the gradient of complexity, and overall were higher and less variable in the most complex systems in comparison to the rice monocultures. In complex rice systems, increasing the number of species that are compatible to the rice ecosystems and could play a role in generating ecosystem services of weed and pest suppression as well as nutrient recycling, can lead to higher and less variable rice yields. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Analyses of ecological interactions and Duck behaviour and Ecosystem functions and Functional agrobiodiversity and Functional redundancy and Multispecies interactions and Rice yield and stability and Indonesia and Azolla and Gastropoda and Hexapoda and agroecology and complexity and crop yield and ecosystem service and excretion and monoculture and polyculture and recycling and rice and weed,10.1016/j.agee.2021.107385,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102070297&doi=10.1016%2fj.agee.2021.107385&partnerID=40&md5=4ac8bd8bdbf72dcbd87d718ccbd502e3,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 14,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,JUN 15,0167-8809 and 1873-2305,WOS:000636219500010,MAR 2021,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1883, 3469"

The weighted similarity coefficient was the dissimilarity matrix that best represented the genetic diversity of the clones used, allowing the separation of the genotypes into 18 groups through Tocher grouping, demonstrating the genetic diversity present in the evaluated material. The morphoagronomic characterization of the accessions detected polymorphisms for all the evaluated traits, showing that the genotypes exhibited genetic variability for the 33 evaluated descriptors. The results obtained by the Shannon-Weaver and fingerprint analyses indicate that the use of the descriptors leaf cluster, leaf length, intensity of green color of leaf, leaf undulation of margin, and trunk diameter is sufficient to characterize the variability in the data analyzed. The comparison between the similarity indices used showed that the weighted similarity coefficient is at least similar to the similarity coefficient and seems to better represent genetic diversity.

Species inhabiting adjacent forests, as well as species that prefer agroforestry systems, can benefit from this habitat matrix. It is necessary, however, to understand the species-specific adaptability to such a complex matrix. Indonesia is a biodiversity hotspot and hosts many endemic species that are threatened with extinction. Its human population relies heavily on agriculture, meaning that finding a balance between crop productivity and biodiversity is key for the long-term sustainability of local communities and wildlife. We aim to determine the influence of the presence of shade trees and distance to the forest on the detection rates of wildlife in coffee home gardens. In West Java, Indonesia, we monitored 23 gardens between April 2018 and March 2021 via camera traps, totalling 3856 days of monitoring in shade-grown and 3338 days in sun-exposed gardens. We also collected data in the nearby montane rainforest, totalling 1183 days of monitoring. We used Generalized Additive Models to estimate the influence of shade cover and distance to the forest on the detection rates of wildlife. The Sunda leopard cat Prionailurus javanensis was found more frequently in shade-grown gardens and used both the forest and agroforest matrix. Wild boars Sus scrofa mostly occurred in gardens adjacent to the forest, while barred buttonquails Turnix suscitator were associated with gardens far (>1 km) from the forest. Several species (civets Viverricula indica and Paradoxus musangus javanicus, Horsfield’s treeshrew Tupaia javanica, Javan ferret badger Melogale orientalis, Javan mongoose Herpestes javanicus) were not influenced by shade cover and distance to the forest, suggesting they are well adapted to the agroforestry system. Still, species of high conservation importance, such as Javan leopard Panthera pardus melas, Sunda porcupine Hystrix javanica, and grizzled langur Presbytis comata, were present in the forest but not in the agroforest, suggesting that the replacement of the forest by the agroforestry matrix is still detrimental.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of land-use types (native vegetation (NV) vs. no-till system (NT)) on OC stocks and on the chemical composition of organic matter (OM), and sought to understand the mechanisms that govern OC protection in the studied highly weathered soils. To achieve these objectives, we used an OC fractionation scheme in a combination of solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic analyses in soils from six farms in southern Brazil. Our results showed smaller OC stocks (whole soil) under NT than under NV in four of the six sites. In addition, the OC stock differences between land-use types were larger in coarser textured soils and in those where conventional tillage was used before the adoption of NT. Among fractions, particulate organic carbon (POC) represented only 8% of the whole OC stock but was the fraction most affected by land-use type. In contrast, the humus organic carbon (HOC) fraction contributed 78% of the whole OC stock and was little altered by land-use type. Resistant organic carbon (ROC) represented 14% of the whole OC stock and it was altered by land-use type, demonstrating that this fraction is not as inert as previously thought. Overall, OM chemical composition was quite similar between land uses, with O-alkyl-C being the predominant C type. This labile component was further highly correlated with OC stock and silt + clay contents, indicating that the accumulation of OC in these highly weathered soils is mainly a response to the association between labile C compounds and minerals. Highlights: The OC build-up in no-till areas and the mechanisms of OC protection in soils are still uncertain. OC stocks under no-till are still smaller than under native vegetation. Soils under no-till showed untapped potential for OC sequestration. The association of labile compounds with soil minerals is the driving factor for OC protection. © 2020 British Society of Soil Science",carbon fractions and carbon stabilization mechanisms and native vegetation and no-tillage and solid-state <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy and weathered soil and Brazil and Matthiola and carbon sequestration and chemical composition and land use change and particulate organic carbon and soil nutrient and soil organic matter,10.1111/ejss.12972,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085125499&doi=10.1111%2fejss.12972&partnerID=40&md5=9b7328e214e26a495824582a3abc7915,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 23,NA,JOUR,3,1083,1100,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1887

However, long-term dynamics are not fully understood yet, especially woody plant encroachment (WPE). The objective of this study was to examine changes in vegetation structure in a preserved area in Tri ngulo Mineiro region, within the southern Brazilian Cerrado domain, over 32 years (1987, 2005, and 2019). We based the study on field and literature surveys, as well as satellite imagery, and hypothesized that, due to the absence of periodic fires or grazing, Cerrado open formations (i.e., grassland or savanna) tend to become denser due to WPE. Shrubby grassland cover assessed in 1987 disappeared in the following periods (from 30.0% to 0.0% in 2019) while forest formations increased (from 7.0% in 1987 to 11.0% in 2019). Changes between 2005 and 2019 occurred within the stricto sensu cerrado subdivisions, with reduction of sparse cerrado (from 34.2% to 7.7 %) and an increase in dense cerrado (from 6.9% to 39.8 %). Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) applied for similar periods indicates a progressive increase of values over time (from 1986 (0:61-0:10) to 2004 (0:65-0:06) and 2018 (0:78-0:05)) and corroborates the WPE process. These patterns imply the loss of biodiversity in open plant formation. Another major consequence was the reduction of wetlands and possible impact on water supply.

The majority of coal mines are operated through an open-pit system which has a significant impact on the environment. Therefore, reclamation and revegetation activities are required to recover ecological sustainability. This study aimed to analyze the diversity, structure, and composition of vegetation resulting from the postmining revegetation process in a mining concession in Sumatra, Indonesia at various intervals of post-reclamation periods, namely 11 years, 10 years, 8 years, and 5 years. Data collection was conducted by sampling with a 2.5 percent intensity. The study discovered 23 species of naturally grow understory plants and 25 species of woody plants. The stand structure at the eleventh, tenth, and eighth years of revegetation resembled an inverted J curve. The Species Richness Index (R) was determined to be low, the Shannon diversity index (H’) was is low to moderate, whereas the evenness index was moderate to high. We concluded that the structure of vegetation in the post-mining reclamation region resembled that of a natural forest ecosystem, yet the biodiversity indicators remain low and below those of natural forest.

The results of this case study indicate that reclamation work is not an emission-free process, but that the benefits delivered from this work are considerable. It was found that the emissions involved at the coal mined reclamation in Indonesia were 25.4–26.6 t-CO2/ha, with topsoil management and land preparation contributing over 98% of the total emissions (9.5 t-CO2/ha and 16 t-CO2/ha, respectively). The ability of the trees on the reclaimed land to absorb CO2 emissions was calculated to be 26.4 t-CO2/ha, with the amount of oxygen produced calculated to be as much as 143 t-O2/ha of oxygen. The economic value of the ecosystem services delivered by reclamation was over USD 27,750/ha. This is higher than the USD 8642–9417/ha cost of establishing the reclamation work.

Beef and dairy contribute over 70% of livestock greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), which collectively contribute ~6.3 Gt CO2-eq/year (Gerber et al., 2013; Herrero et al., 2016) and account for 14%–18% of human GHG emissions (Friedlingstein et al., 2019; Gerber et al., 2013). The utility of beef GHG mitigation strategies, such as land-based carbon (C) sequestration and increased production efficiency, are actively debated (Garnett et al., 2017). We compiled 292 local comparisons of “improved” versus “conventional” beef production systems across global regions, assessing net GHG emission data from Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies. Our results indicate that net beef GHG emissions could be reduced substantially via changes in management. Overall, a 46 % reduction in net GHG emissions per unit of beef was achieved at sites using carbon (C) sequestration management strategies on grazed lands, and an 8% reduction in net GHGs was achieved at sites using growth efficiency strategies. However, net-zero emissions were only achieved in 2% of studies. Among regions, studies from Brazil had the greatest improvement, with management strategies for C sequestration and efficiency reducing beef GHG emissions by 57%. In the United States, C sequestration strategies reduced beef GHG emissions by over 100% (net-zero emissions) in a few grazing systems, whereas efficiency strategies were not successful at reducing GHGs, possibly because of high baseline efficiency in the region. This meta-analysis offers insight into pathways to substantially reduce beef production's global GHG emissions. Nonetheless, even if these improved land-based and efficiency management strategies could be fully applied globally, the trajectory of growth in beef demand will likely more than offset GHG emissions reductions and lead to further warming unless there is also reduced beef consumption. © 2021 The Authors.

Mangrove restoration projects typically have multiple objectives, including carbon storage, coastal resilience, and fisheries recovery. How planting seedlings, the most common form of active restoration, can promote recovery of mangrove ecosystem functions remains an urgent research need. We quantified multiple ecosystem outcomes of Guyana's national mangrove restoration program, approximately a decade after seedling planting, and compared restoration outcomes with conditions in intact and degraded mangrove forests. Multivariate analyses indicate that intact and restored sites' environmental conditions were similar to each other but different from degraded sites. Aboveground biomass in restored sites (103 Mg ha−1) was 13 and 99% greater than intact (89.4 Mg ha−1) and degraded (0.12 Mg ha−1) sites, respectively. Active restoration successfully increased seedling abundance of both planted and unplanted species, with similar abundance between intact and restored sites. In contrast, fish communities in restored sites remained similar to degraded sites. Restored sites were dominated by a single algivorous fish species, with lower species diversity and commercially valuable fisheries than intact sites. Our results demonstrate that active restoration is a viable option to restore mangrove forest tree biomass and tree species composition in this region. However, even under a best-case scenario for mangrove forest restoration, fisheries did not recover during our study's timespan.

The city’s climate is basically characterized by high air temperature and relative humidity. However, climatic data of 1995-2015 shows that its temperature has actually increased. The issue worsens the thermal comfort, lead to more energy used for cooling, and can even induce heat-stress-related health problems. Urban heat island effect is one potential cause, triggered by significant progress of infrastructure development, increased number of vehicles, and land-use changes. It argues that sustainable urban landscaping is a prerequisite to environmental sustainability, especially in coastal city that prone of disasters. This study composes and analyzes the potential of vegetative measures for mitigating the issue. To provide reflective solutions, both substantial vegetative cooling mechanisms are studied. Hence, the paper asserted that unsustainable use of urban landscape structures leads to environmental problems, such as biodiversity loss, climate change, and soil erosion. The outputs become the foundation for the strategic framework of the proposed vegetative measures, i.e. tree planting, development of greenspaces with optimum size, cover composition and distribution, and green façade application to support sustainable landscapes. The impact of each vegetative intervention is investigated through microclimate simulations run using ENVI-met. Air temperature and other climatic factors related to outdoor thermal comfort and urban heat island are used as the indicators. The results reveal that landscaping such: tree planting with proper distance, adjusted based on tree canopy’s width to optimize shading, improves outdoor thermal comfort considerably, while the impact on urban heat island is rather small. On the other hand, green facade application only impacts insignificantly on both aspects. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Gunung Leuser National Park forest in the Bukit Lawang section is the habitat of Sumatran Orangutan (Pongo abelii). There have been reports of the orangutans visiting the village. As some tree species are required for their sustenance to provide nests and food, there is a need to study species diversity availability in their habitat. Thus, the aim of the research was to analyze the composition and structure of the area's vegetation-this was done for the forestand mixed plantation. The sampling for the measurement of tree parameters was conducted using the line strip method. The strips (width 50 m, length 250 m) were constituted by a sub-plot measuring for seedling, pole, sapling, and trees. Within the sampling area, 181 species were found. Species within Dipterocarpaceae showed higher important value index (IVI) compared to other species in all layers. Shorea parviflora and Shorea ovalis were among the species with higher IVI in all the layers. The presence of species of Dipterocarpaceae and other species preferred by orangutans will support their quality of life. Therefore, orangutans prefer staying in the forest to entering the garden. Thus, it is concluded that their entry into the mixed gardens is related to the garden's proximity to the forest.

Herein, we investigated whether the time after restoration determines the similarity between restoration forests and reference ecosystems, and whether the age and width of the forest as well as the surrounding forest cover have an influence on forest restoration. The tree stratum, seed rain, and regenerating stratum were monitored in a reference ecosystem and four 10-year and 20-year-old restoration forests of different widths in southeastern Brazil. We verified that both 10- and 20-year-old restoration forests were like the reference ecosystem in the species richness, diversity, number of individuals, and functional groups of the tree stratum and seed rain. However, the floristic composition of the three strata evaluated plus the number of regenerating plants were lower in the restoration forests than in the reference ecosystem, which may be due to the agricultural matrix where the restoration forests were inserted. We also found that most of the ecological indicators were associated with increasing forest width meaning that wider strips can recover more vegetation attributes. The study indicates that various indicators can be recovered within a decade of active restoration (seedling planting) in the tropics. The regenerating stratum however may require more than two decades to recover. As the restoration was associated with increasing forest width, restoration practitioners should restore wider areas so that more biological groups can be recovered. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Ecological indicators and Ecological restoration and Monitoring and assessment and Reference ecosystems and Ecosystems and Plants and Rain and Recovery and Reforestation and Restoration and Brazil and Agricultural robots and Ecosystems and Rain and Recovery and Reforestation and Restoration and Vegetation and Ecological indicators and Ecological restoration and Floristic compositions and Monitoring and assessment and Regenerating plants and Southeastern Brazil and Species-area relationship and Vegetation restoration and ecosystem management and forest cover and forest management and functional role and restoration ecology and seeding and species-area relationship and succession and vegetation structure and Conservation,10.1007/s11056-020-09786-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082875010&doi=10.1007%2fs11056-020-09786-2&partnerID=40&md5=4590b9e26c22c2b9b6ed8e6c9b256133,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 5,NA,JOUR,1,129,144,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1903

Action research plots comprise strategies of peatland restoration (rewetting, revegetation, and revitalization, and the integration of the three measures). From the 112 action research projects, we selected and observed potential plots as well as local practices (the approaches that had existed before BRG RI intervened). It is elicited for peatland restoration to encourage economic development without sacrificing the priceless peat ecosystem and its services for human being and well-being, and this requires upscaling the economic benefits from the peatland restoration. To achieve that, peatland restoration requires stakeholders’ participation in the entire peatland hydrological unit without which a landscape approach toward peat hydrological unit would be hard to implement. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.",Lesson learned and Payment for ecosystem services (PES) and Peatland restoration and Revegetation and Stakeholder involvement,10.1007/978-981-33-4654-3_28,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126276760&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-33-4654-3_28&partnerID=40&md5=3f4114e4e87c19728fcb5c209584eccf,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 6,NA,CHAP,NA,751,774,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1905

First, we quantified the effectiveness of CBET in forest conservation by analyzing forest cover change with published maps created from satellite images. Second, we evaluated the contribution of CBET to household income and livelihood changes through a household survey using a questionnaire. Analysis of the forest cover change maps revealed that deforestation had significantly decreased inside the CBET area as compared to outside it, although the reduction was not enough to stop net deforestation. The survey revealed that the total monthly income of CBET member households and non-CBET households was not significantly different. It also showed that the community members felt the livelihood change after the implementation of CBET. However, this change may have been caused by general socioeconomic changes in Cambodia.

One of the active methods most widely used for ecological restoration in environments where soil has been lost or severely degraded is topsoil transposition due to the physical, chemical, and microbiological improvement of the substrate, in addition to the seed bank. Thus, plant succession was monitored for 40 months after topsoil transposition in a canga area degraded by aluminum mining, without any other type of management. A completely randomized design with 70 permanent plots (1 × 1 m) was used. Annual phytosociological surveys were carried out and floristic and vegetational spectra were constructed with the life-forms proposed by Raunkiaer. Floristic composition was compared with a reference site. Overall, 105 species were identified. Both flora and vegetation changed over time, increasing resemblance to the reference areas. The floristic and vegetational spectra after 4 years of topsoil deposition are similar to pristine ones. The vegetation spectrum showed an increase in the dominance of phanerophytes and hemicryptophytes, while therophytes reduced their proportion. The early successional stage is dominated by weeds, like in other canga restoration studies, but did not impede the native species regeneration. Cangas's species recruited well from transposed topsoil. Unlike other studies with fertilized topsoil, our findings show the efficiency of topsoil transposition to provide initial conditions for the ecological restoration of this ecosystem. © 2020 Society for Ecological Restoration",campos rupestres and canga and ecological restoration and ironstone outcrops and land reclamation and Brazil and bauxite and environmental degradation and ironstone and land reclamation and mining and restoration ecology and succession and topsoil,10.1111/rec.13303,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096951266&doi=10.1111%2frec.13303&partnerID=40&md5=5010bf8fbf2eb0771a91ef693ece0dd6,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 29,NA,JOUR,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1907

The objective of this study was to evaluate the initial growth of five native tree species of the Atlantic Forest, with a view to their use in forest restoration projects. The following species were produced in the nursery, planted in the field, and evaluated for performance: Araucaria angustifolia, Mimosa scabrella, Trichilia claussenii, Schizolobium parahyba, and Cordia trichotoma. These species were distributed in two different areas, based on the randomized block experimental design. In experiment 1, the species A. angustifolia, M. scabrella, and C. trichotoma were distributed in three randomized blocks, each composed of 11 plants of each species. In experiment 2, the species A. angustifolia, M. scabrella, T. claussenii, and S. parahyba were distributed in three randomized blocks, each one composed of five plants of each species. In general, S. parahyba and M. scabrella showed faster development than the other species and, in this regard, are promising candidates for forest areas constitution or reconstitution in which there is interest in obtaining economic returns in less time. Araucaria angustifolia and T. claussenii showed relatively low development, whereas C. trichotoma showed intermediate development in relation to the other species studied. Despite their differences in performance, all species proved to be suitable for use in reforestation, mainly in the region where the study was developed. © 2021",espécies florestais and forest planting and forest species and Legal Reserve and plantio florestal and Reserva Legal and silvicultura sustentável and sustainable silviculture,10.5380/rf.v51i1.67317,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119917361&doi=10.5380%2frf.v51i1.67317&partnerID=40&md5=bd4f34de9a09e7e65ad935827bdb38ca,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 1,NA,JOUR,1,70,79,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1908

Within forests, managing for ecosystem services such as clean water and air, food, fiber, or bioenergy requires knowledge of soil chemical, physical, and biological properties to assess a site’s capacity to sustainably produce those services and numerous other valuable forest products. These same soil properties are also used to quantify changes in soil functions such as filtering, buffering or nutrient cycling, but in complex forest ecosystems such assessment can be very difficult because of the multiple uses they must provide. The type of forest ecosystem (temperate or tropical) further complicates soil health assessment because different factors control both production and decomposition of biological material within these two distinct biomes. This chapter provides examples of how forest soil health is currently being assessed within temperate, tropical, and agroforestry ecosystems.

In these systems, the herbaceous stratum of the forest is composed of natural pasture on which animals graze. In order to better understand the impact of caívas on the conservation of the Araucaria Forest, the effects of different intensities of pasture management, mowing practices, and cattle grazing on natural regeneration were assessed. The experiment was carried out in eight caívas from 2015 to 2016, during which the forest regeneration was monitored every six months. Throughout the study period, 48 tree species that are characteristic of the Araucaria Forest were identified. In all evaluated scenarios, the regeneration of tree species was present, dynamic, and continuous in the caívas. The intensity of pasture use did not affect the indicators of diversity, species richness, and regeneration density. However, there was limited similarity among caívas with the same type of pasture management. Mowing had the greatest impact on regeneration, with a marked reduction in the density of regenerants, although it did not affect species richness. Given the abundance of species in the regeneration, including many species typical of advanced forest succession, it is possible to confirm that these systems present high levels of resilience with respect to the conservation of biodiversity, despite the occurrence of livestock grazing for generations. The results also indicate that it is possible to successfully implement strategies for pasture intensification in caívas. However, this practice must be associated with preservation strategies in forest areas that are more fragile and diverse, in order to ensure the system is sustainable across all dimensions. © 2021, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

Amidst the burgeoning industry, huge ecological costs have been accrued within just three decades due to the rapid oil palm expansion in many parts of the world. Many oil palm plantations are linked to deforestation, biodiversity losses, land use change emissions, among other ecological problems. Total replacement of palm oil could result in even greater adverse environmental consequences as alternative crops will require more land. To satisfy the growing demands in a sustainable manner, any new plantations must be located in environmentally-benign lands. This study identifies and quantifies the potentially available lands in Malaysia and Indonesia through a novel fuzzy GIS-based land suitability analysis. Three maps were generated: biophysically suitable land, based on optimal conditions for oil palm cultivation, excluding peatlands and existing protected areas; environmentally suitable land, further excluding forest cover; and potentially available land, further excluding existing plantations and other land uses. About 4.5 million hectares of available land for new plantations have been identified that could provide 1.3 million tonnes per year of sustainable palm oil. However, most of these areas are fragmented and scattered throughout the entire archipelago, which could pose economic and socio-political hurdles to developers of sustainable palm oil. With affordable and fairer certification schemes, sustainable oil palm plantations can be achieved by smallholders on these potentially available lands.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to enhance the growth of tropical endangered species Pterocarpus indicus and Pericopsis mooniana in post gold mine field in Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 22: 3844-3853. Gold mining activities contribute to the national economy, but have a serious impact on forest and environmental degradation and pose a threat to tree species in the tropics. Reforestation of post-gold mining with tropical legume tree species is threatened with extinction. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are effective in conservation of endangered plants and restoration of degraded land. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of native AM Fungi inoculation on the growth of Pterocarpus indicus and Pericopsis mooniana in nurseries and post-gold mining fields. P. indicus and P. mooniana seedlings were inoculated with Glomus claroideum Schenk & Smith, Glomus coronatum Giovann., and mixed AMF (G. claroideum, G. coronatum). Uninoculated seedlings were used as control treatment, and they were maintained for 4 months under greenhouse conditions. After 4 months in greenhouse, seedlings were transferred to post-gold mine and planted for 4 months. The percentage of AMF colonization, plant growth, nutrient content and uptake of N, P, K, Fe, Mn were measured after 4 months both in the greenhouse and the field. The percentage of AMF colonization under greenhouse conditions in P. indicus and P. mooniana ranged 5.67-75.3% and 2.2-41.2%. All AMF colonization tended to have higher shoot height, leaf numbers and nodules, plant dry weight and N, P, K content under greenhouse conditions. Shoot height, stem diameter, leaf dry weight, N, P, K, Mn and Fe under field conditions had higher inoculated seedlings than control four months after planting. AMF could be used to conserve endangered tree species in post-gold mining reforestation in the tropics. © 2021, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

To cope with increasingly widespread fires, we need accurate estimates of the chances of fire occurrence across heterogeneous landscapes. Estimates of risk of fire are fundamental to prevent and fight wildfires. To this end, we developed a monthly fire spread probability model for the Brazilian Cerrado biome based on the historical relation between fuel loads and burned areas. To so, we firstly stratified the biome into 16 climatic regions, given the climate influence on fuel loads. We used historical burned areas and fuel loads from remote sensed data between 2015 and 2018 to build a non-stationary model that estimates fuel loads dynamics across the biome. Climate seasonality is the main factor driving fuel loads dynamics. The correlation between fuel loads and the best predictor (monthly mean precipitation) ranges from 0.27 to 0.88 (mean r = 0.61 and deviation of 0.18) across the Cerrado. The average amplitude of fuel loads is 32% between dry and rainy seasons. Our Bayesian fire risk model uses the burned area as a prior probability and fuel loads to estimate the posterior probability of fire spread. Our results show that the probability of fire spread highly correlates with historical burning events (r = 0.87). The recovery of fuel loads post-fire takes, on average, 2.43 years; however, our results point to a downward pathway of the biome's vegetation biomass due to frequent recurrent fires. The models we developed provide a useful tool for improving the representation of spatial patterns and seasonality of fires in order to support management practices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Bayesian model and Burned area and Climate and Fire management and Precipitation and Savannas and Biodiversity and Dynamics and Fires and Fuels and Remote Sensing and Risk Assessment and Brazil and Biodiversity and Dynamics and Fuels and Remote sensing and Risk assessment and Risk perception and Climate seasonality and Heterogeneous landscapes and Management practices and Mean precipitation and Non-stationary model and Posterior probability and Probability modeling and Remote sensed data and biome and cerrado and fire and fuel and management practice and probability and remote sensing and risk assessment and satellite data and seasonality and wildfire and Fires,10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118889,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098479761&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2020.118889&partnerID=40&md5=16a416f351569b290eb70bc4a201dad2,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 45,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1929

Their populations have declined up to 75% of their original size and are now distributed only in parts of the tropical rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. Pongo pygmaeus, Pongo tapanuliensis and Pongo abelii are the three most representative species, in this study, here we discussed the latter. Sumatran forests are generally suffering from deforestation with rates ranging from 3.74% to 49.85% between 2000 and 2012. Thus, human wildlife conflict intensity has escalated and gained more traction. Orangutans are known as arboreal great apes and need to build nests for resting. We applied the transect line method (three transects; each 1,000 m long) at different elevations in Soraya Research Station, Gelombang Village, Sultan Daulat sub-district, Subulussalam district, and assessed the nest characteristics. The characteristics are: (1) nesting position referring to the position of nest on a tree; (2) nest successional stages defining the age and leaf decay used in constructing a nest indicated with I (new) until V (almost gone); and (3) nest density to predict the density of nest per square km. Afterwards, the identified nesting trees along the transect were further identified based on their species, and assessed based on three characteristics (the tree height, diameter and the height of a nest measured from the soil). A total of 27 nests were found, and 44% were located in transect III or at the riparian. Out of 27, four orangutans’ nests were found on Moraceae (Streblus elongatus) and Myrtaceae (Syzigium spp.), while three nests were found on Dipterocarpus sp. The tree height, tree diameter and nest height were 10 m–25 m (mean = 17.5 m; SD = ± 0.25), 10 cm–30 cm (mean = 20 cm; SD = ± 0.4) and 16 m–20 m (mean = 18 m; SD = ± 0.35), respectively. Meanwhile, nest density calculated based on the form: d = [N/ (L* 2w)], and the values obtained were 8.4, 13.45, 26.9 nests/km2 located on transect I, II and III or at the riparian. The most commonly found nest successional stages and position were stage III and position 3, respectively.

However, the environmental sustainability of small-scale anaerobic digestion is undermined where lack of capacity to utilize the biogas fuel results in biomethane venting to the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. Policy support for improved manure management in Bali, Indonesia, has resulted in the installation of small (6 m3) anaerobic digesters across 752 Bali cattle breeding units. These 752 remote rural digesters annually vent approximately 75 482 ± 37 741 m3 of biomethane into the atmosphere as a waste, owing to lack of practical means to convert this potential fuel into useful energy. Meanwhile, most of these cattle farms lack access to electricity. This paper describes the performance of a novel, compact and versatile “BioMiniGen” system that provides convenient electricity generation from small-scale biogas production. This innovative system comprises: (i) a simple biogas desulfurizing system; (ii) a two-stroke, single cylinder (63 cc) air-cooled engine; (iii) an electric generator; (iv) an optional CO2 removal unit. Lifecycle assessment indicated that bioelectricity generated by the BioMiniGen would have a smaller environmental footprint than Indonesian grid electricity across 11 impact categories, including a negative global warming burden owing to avoidance of biogas venting. Trade-offs included a larger abiotic depletion burden associated with manufacture of the generators. Over a five-year lifetime, each unit, costing US$500, could generate up to 5971 kWh of electricity and mitigate up to 65.1 Mg CO2 eq., with a greenhouse gas abatement value up to US$13023. Across Bali, up to 898 ± 449 MWh yr−1 bioelectricity could be generated, and 1.92 ± 0.96 Gg CO2 eq. saved. Further pilot trials are needed to ascertain realistic biogas yields from cleaned digesters managed for bioenergy generation alongside manure management.

Tropical peatland conservation represents a case in point: local community livelihoods have only recently come into focus, particularly within academic literature. Instead, many previous studies emphasise the need to conserve intact peat swamp forests for their carbon storage, as a habitat for flagship species such as the orangutan, and to provide fire-free landscapes. Here, we explore the socio-environmental issues being faced in the peatland landscapes of Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. This includes the loss of peat-swamp forest, decreases in peatland fish populations and related socio-cultural challenges such as potential loss of fishing livelihoods along with historic and continued experiences of marginalisation of indigenous communities. To find solutions to these complex and interrelated problems, an interdisciplinary approach which focuses on interdependencies and includes multiple worldviews is required. We propose an approach which deploys both Ethan Miller's use of livelihoods (incl. Miller, 2019) and biocultural approaches to conservation to analyse human-nonhuman relationships, with a focus on fish and fishing livelihoods. We draw on data from in-depth social and ecological research in two village communities in Central Kalimantan, and in so doing illustrate how fish conservation has the potential to support important biocultural and livelihood relationships between human and nonhuman communities in peatland areas. Our findings lend support to previous calls for biocultural approaches to conservation in other socio-ecological contexts, and lead us to conclude that tropical peatland conservation initiatives that integrate such approaches will result in improved outcomes for peatlands, forests, biodiversity and people. These findings will be relevant to other tropical peatland areas with high dependence on fishing as a source of livelihood, such as the peatlands of the Amazon and Congo basins. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Central Kalimantan and Fishing and Orangutan and Tropical peat and article and biodiversity and Congo and ecology and fishing and forest and human and human experiment and Indonesia and nonhuman and orangutan and peatland and swamp,10.1016/j.envsci.2020.08.018,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090733739&doi=10.1016%2fj.envsci.2020.08.018&partnerID=40&md5=1e89f6194d0e3ffee17781249738c084,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 25,NA,JOUR,NA,341,351,NA,DEC,1462-9011 and 1873-6416,WOS:000591436800017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1934, 3703"

Integrating ecological, social and policy aspects to develop peatland restoration strategies in Orang Kayo Hitam Forest Park, Jambi, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 22: 4158-4168. Peatlands play an essential role in delivering various ecosystem services, yet in many areas in Indonesia, peat forests have been deforested, degraded, and threatened by repeated fires. As such, restoration efforts need to be done. But these require various considerations, including ecological aspects such as type degradation conditions, water table, species selected for planting, and climates, socio-economic aspects like community's involvement, and policy aspects such as regulations and institutions at national and local levels. This study aimed to analyze peatland restoration strategies in Orang Kayo Hitam (OKH) Forest Park, Jambi using the Strengths, Weaknesses, Threats, and Opportunities (SWOT) framework. The analysis was done by integrating multiple aspects such as policy, biodiversity conservation, and surrounding community participation. Data were collected using virtual ethnographic techniques due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Key informants (i.e., OKH Forest Park Unit area managers, NGOs, staff of national government, and university academics) and selected respondents were interviewed to identify and determine factors considered as internal (i.e., Strengths and Weaknesses) and external (i.e., Threats and Opportunities). This qualitative data was then analyzed using a SWOT approach through the IFE (Internal Factor Evaluation) and EFE (External Factor Evaluation) Matrix. The research findings showed that from 12 internal factors and 11 external factors, efforts to restore peatland ecosystems in Orang Kayo Hitam (OKH) Forest Park had obtained very strong values in the biodiversity aspect. The SWOT matrix analysis showed values of S-W = 0.43 and O-T = 0.16 positioned in quadrant I. This result suggests that the most powerful strategies can be developed aggressively from the factors of strengths and opportunities. © 2021, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

However, their success depends on their ability to sustain soil functions. To assess the efficiency of a limestone mine reclamation, we measured the soil quality (SQ) of a three- (SC3) and seven-year-old (SC7) Technosol under sugarcane, and one 20-year-old (P20) Technosol under pasture, constructed with limestone spoil in southeastern Brazil. Soil chemical, physical, and biological attributes were evaluated and compared with those of an adjacent natural soil (NS; Rhodic Lixisol). We also tested the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) for assessing the SQ of the studied soils. SMAF was suitable to detect SQ changes over the years of reclamation. After three and seven years under sugarcane cultivation, the Technosols showed similar SQ indexes (= 0.70 and 0.67) to that of the native soil (SQ = 0.69), whereas after 20 years under pasture the SQ (= 0.88) of P20 was superior to that of NS. Overall, the Technosols recovered most of the ecosystem services expected for healthy soils, especially in P20, where carbon stocks were 2.7 times higher than in NS (82.1 vs 30.35 Mg C ha−1).

Our results indicate that forests with yerba mate plantations not only maintains the bird species richness, but also its species composition differs significantly from edge and croplands, which might be an indicator of the contribution of shade-grown yerba mate plantations to conservation. The results of the research would help to value the impact of sustainable agroforestry activities for the conservation of Atlantic Forest biodiversity.

Short Communication: A comparison of stand structure, species diversity and aboveground biomass between natural and planted mangroves in Sikka, East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 22: 1098-1103. The effectiveness of mangroves reforestation can be evaluated by comparing the stand dynamics of planted mangroves with natural mangroves in similar site conditions. This study investigated stand structure, species diversity and aboveground biomass between natural and planted mangroves in Sikka, East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. A field survey was conducted using quadrat transect method for vegetation measurement, especially related to species composition and its size distribution. Several parameters were recorded in field observation, including number of species, diameter, height, volume, and aboveground biomass. The stand structure of both mangroves was demonstrated by the distribution of diameter class while the species diversity was described using three parameters, i.e., richness, heterogeneity, and evenness. Moreover, the IVI of each species recorded was also calculated to understand the contribution of species in the mangrove ecosystems. The comparison of stand characteristics between natural and planted mangroves was examined by Mann-Whitney test and Spearman Correlation was also applied to understand the relationship between IVI and aboveground biomass. The results showed that the diameter and height between the natural and planted mangroves significantly differed (P<0.05). In contrast, there was no significant difference in tree density, volume, and aboveground biomass (P<0.05). The stand structure of both mangrove stands followed the pattern of J-inverse in which the frequency of trees decreased with the increase in diameter class. Species diversity in both stands was statistically equal in richness, heterogeneity, and evenness (P>0.05) even though there were some specific species which only observed in the natural or planted mangroves. The most superior species in the planted mangroves was Rhizophora mucronata (IVI = 96.99) while the most important plant in the natural mangroves was Sonneratia alba (IVI = 82.49). Our study found there was a significant correlation between IVI and aboveground biomass in which species with higher IVI indicated greater aboveground biomass. Based on these findings, restoration efforts of degraded mangroves in Sikka have been effective. The restoration, which has been conducted for almost three decades, has not only brought back its vegetation cover but also the functional traits of the mangrove stand to mimic with natural mangroves in the area. © 2021, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

This study focuses on enterprises that might offer a promising opportunity as a user-side financing system for payments for ecosystem services (PES) to balance forest conservation priorities with local communities’ livelihood needs. Two possible sustainable user financing systems for PES were designed. The first entailed a modification of an existing tax structure in limiting usage of its revenue (an earmarked tax). The second entailed a community-level business structure based on customary village practices. Receptiveness to the first system was assessed using questionnaire and interview-based surveys carried out on 50 respondents. The second system was assessed using questionnaire and interview-based surveys with five representatives in each of nine villages in the region. Findings revealed a reasonably high potential for developing each of the two options. Enterprise owners and workers demonstrated a high level of awareness of the model’s conservation and societal benefits and were incentivized to pay the same level of tax redirected to conservation and fire prevention activities. However, few were willing to pay a higher tax level. The overall reception of the cooperative business model was positive, but start-up financial concerns and negative community dynamics such as low trust among community members were the main constraining factors.

The unique quality of this forest typology is under constant threat of change owing to the behavior of climate variables and different anthropic activities that occur in the biome itself. Therefore, it is essential to conduct studies that clarify the factors that affect the formation of forests in this ecosystem and to validate the use of forest resources by society through appropriate forest management practices. Thus, this study aimed to answer how the structure, composition and floristic diversity of the forest are influenced by forest logging in different phases of development of a local Amazonian forest, and whether there is a relationship between these attributes and regional and global climate factors. This study assessed the dynamics of natural regeneration of 36 permanent plots over 33 years after logging in the Tapajós National Forest in Belterra, State of Pará, Brazil. The plots studied were measured in 1981, 1983, 1985, 1987, 1992, 1997, 2007, and 2012. All individuals with height greater than 30 cm and diameter at breast height <10 cm were monitored in three regeneration strata (seedlings, saplings, and small trees) and three forest classes (gap-phase forest, growing forest, and old-growth forest). Density, floristic similarity according to the Sørensen Index, and floristic diversity according to the Hill series were analyzed. Climate variables such as mean annual compensated temperature; total annual precipitation, and Oceanic Niño Index were correlated with the mortality, recruitment, and density of growing trees. An ANOVA for count data verified that the density of individuals differed over time since logging among the regeneration strata and forest classes analyzed. Likewise, the diversity profiles generated from the Hill series were significantly different from each other, and the floristic similarity varied between regeneration strata over time. For the forest classes, the similarity values ranged between 50% and 96%. The gap-phase forest areas had the lowest similarity values, with some 100% dissimilar surveys. However, there was an exponential reduction in similarity over time in the different forest classes. The results indicate that logging promotes significant changes in floristic structure and diversity in different strata of natural regeneration and forest classes over time. Additionally, no correlation was found between climate variables and the natural regeneration dynamics in the Tapajós National Forest. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Forest Composition and Forest Management and Hill Series and Rainforest and Biodiversity and DBH and Density and Dynamics and Logging and Natural Reforestation and Variables and Amazonas [Brazil] and Belterra and Brazil and Para [Brazil] and Biodiversity and Climate change and Dynamics and Annual precipitation and Compensated temperature and Diameter-at-breast heights and Exponential reduction and Floristic diversity and Floristic similarities and Forest management practices and Natural regeneration and biodiversity and biome and climate variation and forest dynamics and forest management and forestry practice and global climate and logging (timber) and regeneration and species diversity and typology and Reforestation,10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118862,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098453957&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2020.118862&partnerID=40&md5=396a31f78d3602acd04663914f1e84b4,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 14,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1948

We aimed to determine whether the changes caused by the conversion affected the abundance, richness and diversity of the insect orders found in the two systems. Total abundance, richness and diversity did not differ between the two systems, but we detected a significant difference in community composition. Several insect orders showed differences in either abundance, richness or diversity between the two systems, and several families of Hymenoptera, which contains pollinators and natural enemies, showed important increases in the silvopasture.

Here, peat drained for agricultural expansion increases the risk of large-scale uncontrolled fires. Several solutions to this complex environmental, humanitarian and economic crisis have been proposed, such as forest protection measures and agricultural support. However, numerous programmes have largely failed. Bundles of interventions are proposed as promising strategies in integrated approaches, but what policy interventions to combine and how to align such bundles to local conditions remains unclear. We evaluate the impact of two types of interventions and of their combinations, in reducing fire occurrence through driving behavioural change: incentives (i.e. rewards that are conditional on environmental performance), and deterrents (e.g. sanction, soliciting concerns for health). We look at the impact of these interventions in 10 villages with varying landscape and fire-risk contexts in Sumatra, Indonesia. A private-led implementation of a standardised programme allows us to study outcome variability through a natural experiment design. We conduct a systematic cross-case comparison to identify the most effective combinations of interventions, using two-step qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) and geospatial and socio-economic survey data (n = 303). We analysed the combined influence of proximate conditions (interventions, e.g. fear of sanction) and remote ones (context; e.g. extent of peat soil) on fire outcomes. We show how, depending on the level of risk in the pre-existing context, certain bundles of interventions are needed to succeed. We found that, despite the programme being framed as rewards-based, people were not responding to the reward alone. Rather sanctions and soliciting concern appeared central to fire prevention, raising important equity implications. Our results contribute to the emerging global interest in peat fire mitigation, and the rapidly developing literature on PES performance. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Carbon and Governance and Oil palm and Payments for ecosystem services and Public-private and QCA and Greater Sunda Islands and Sumatra and Sunda Isles and Elaeis and fire management and land use change and peatland and socioeconomic conditions,10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2020.102154,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092667213&doi=10.1016%2fj.gloenvcha.2020.102154&partnerID=40&md5=0a127ca1564962094c3810470463a19b,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 24,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAR,0959-3780 and 1872-9495,WOS:000634865600003,MAR 2021,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1950, 4946"
1952,Scopus,Book chapter,"Le, Q.P. and Xuan Le, T.",2021,Management of Peatland in the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam,Tropical Peatland Eco-management,NA,NA,"Peatland area in Vietnam is very small compared to that in other countries in Southeast Asia such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. After years of exploitation, most of the peatland areas in Vietnam became negligible except in a few locations in the Mekong River Delta (MRD). Peatlands in the MRD were formed mainly after the middle Holocene transgression period until hundred years ago. The typical types included: ancient coastal marsh peat mixed swampy peat and modern coastal swamp peat. Most of the peatlands are found in ancient swamps and ancient abandoned channel courses scattered across the delta. Many peatland areas in the MRD have been lost, others severely degraded due to inappropriate management practices for decades. They include (1) uncoordinated sectoral approach leading to overlapping management, (2) limited capacity for peatland management, (3) lack of systematic researches on peatlands, and (4) demand for land for food production of poor people living in and around peatland areas. Inappropriate management and lack of knowledge about peatland resources have led to activities that caused loss of peatland resources, including conversion to agricultural land, drainage, mining for organic fertilizer production, fuel, among others. Previously, the area of peatland was estimated to be tens of thousands of hectares. Its area has decreased to about 13,000 ha. The largest area of peatland is mainly in the U Minh region, and few small areas scatter in the Long Xuyen Quadrangle, in the MRD. U Minh peat-swamp is considered a very large peatland located in U Minh Thuong (Kien Giang Province) and U Minh Ha (Ca Mau Provinces), currently, the total remaining peat area is only about 12,667 ha, in which U Minh Thuong and U Minh Ha account for 3231 ha and 9436 ha, respectively. Although only a small area, the U Minh peatland stores a significant amount of carbon. It also has a large area of Melaleuca forest, which is capable of absorbing a significant amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. A large area in U Minh peat-swamp, including U Minh Thuong and U Minh Ha, is now established as national parks for preserving peatland resources, including ecosystems and biodiversity. Both the U Minh Thuong and U Minh Ha peatlands are assessed to have a diversity of wetland ecosystems and high biodiversity of plant and animal species that need to be preserved in Vietnam. Few small peatland areas scattering in the Long Xuyen Quadrangle are being exploited for fertilizer production, although the provincial government has decided to stop exploitation in new areas. Inappropriate hydrological management in U Minh peatlands has resulted in quite serious forest fires and peat fires in previous years, especially forest fires in 2002. Forest fires in peatlands seriously damage not only peat-swamp forest ecosystems but also habitats and animals in both national parks. Integrated water and fire management applied effectively have ceased forest fires in U Minh Thuong National Park since 2009. Meanwhile, U Minh Ha National Park still faces the risks of forest fires and peatland oxidation due to adequate method of water retention in the dry season. Nature conservation in the U Minh peat-swamp has faced a conflict of interest with local communities who have lived in the peatland area for a long time. The demand for agricultural production land and peatland resources as important sources of their livelihoods has been affected after nature reserves establishment. The application of integrated fire and water management, local community-based natural resource management, and afforestation resulted in positive effects on the rehabilitation of U Minh peatland ecosystems and on the socio-economic development for the local community in recent years. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.",Mekong river delta and Melaleuca and Peatlands ecosystems and U Minh Ha and U Minh Thuong,10.1007/978-981-33-4654-3_29,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85153823441&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-33-4654-3_29&partnerID=40&md5=07311d2fb498b014406f77ab10e2c5a3,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 1,NA,CHAP,NA,775,817,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1952

A new and largely unreported setback is a proposal in the National Congress for a road cutting the Iguaçu National Park in two. Here, we identify environmental threats from the proposed road and pressures on the park from the surrounding human population. The proposed laws violate Brazil’s constitution and would cause immeasurable damage to the park’s biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. The road would reduce the cost of transport between two municipalities (counties), but not the cost of transporting soybeans, their main agricultural product. However, the local population would be better served by strengthening its ties to the park and promoting economic alternatives such as tourism, agroforestry, and organic agriculture.

However, the conversion of natural habitats followed by agricultural intensification may adversely affect edaphic mites. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of different management systems on edaphic mite abundance, richness, and diversity in tropical rain forests in Indonesia. There were five forest management systems, which were as follows: secondary forest, production forest (pine monoculture), and three agroforestry systems (pine + coffee, mahogany + coffee, and mahogany + new cocoyam). We established a transect containing five research plots for each forest management system. Litter and soil from each plot were collected from December to March 2021. Temperature, relative humidity, and pH of litter and soil, as well as litter thickness, were measured. We found that edaphic mite abundance, richness, and diversity in the secondary forest were similar to managed forests. However, the aforementioned variables were significantly higher in “pine” systems than in “mahogany” systems. Our analysis evidenced positive correlations between litter thickness and edaphic mite abundance, richness, and diversity.

However, these political changes may not be an effective to prevent mangrove deforestation in the country. This study aimed to analyze mangrove deforestation over twenty years in Santos and São Vicente estuarine region located at the Baixada Santista region (southeastern of Brazil), a highly vulnerable region subject to intense land use pressure by urban occupation and activities of the largest port of Latin America. Using remote sensing spatial analysis techniques, we analyzed if changes in Brazilian legislation has been reflected in degradation of mangrove forests over a period of twenty years due to the presence of vulnerable mangroves and accelerate land use pressure by urban occupation and activities of the largest port of Latin America.

We adopted an adaptive management approach that included developing common objectives through a process of stakeholder consultation and co-learning. We firstly investigated via interviews the expectations and the issues encountered by 25 farmers who converted to organic production in 2016. Their main expectations were an increase in income and an increase in coffee quality, while they had issues mainly in finding high quality fertilizers, reducing pests, and increasing productivity. We used this information to establish a problem-solving plan for the transition to community-wide wildlife-friendly practices.

Mounting evidence indicates that the climatic impacts of forest loss can also vary considerably, depending on specific features of the affected areas. The size of the deforested patches, for instance, was shown to modulate the characteristics of local climatic impacts. Nonetheless, the influence of different types of land use and management strategies on the magnitude of local climatic changes remains uncertain. Here, we evaluated the impacts of large-scale commodity farming and rural settlements on surface temperature, rainfall patterns, and energy fluxes. Our results reveal that changes in land–atmosphere coupling are induced not only by deforestation size but also, by land use type and management patterns inside the deforested areas. We provide evidence that, in comparison with rural settlements, deforestation caused by large-scale commodity agriculture is more likely to reduce convective rainfall and increase land surface temperature. We demonstrate that these differences are mainly caused by a more intensive management of the land, resulting in significantly lower vegetation cover throughout the year, which reduces latent heat flux. Our findings indicate an urgent need for alternative agricultural practices, as well as forest restoration, for maintaining ecosystem processes and mitigating change in the local climates across the Amazon basin. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

The present study is considered to evaluate and monitoring of LULC change along with the ecosystem services of a tropical forest region in Jhargram block West Bengal in India during 1972–2019. LANDSAT satellite imageries (1972, 1987, 1992, 2002, 2012, and 2019) have been analyzed to identify the LULC change and to determine the ecosystem service values using the value transfer method. Based on the Maximum likelihood algorithm image classification techniques using Arc-GIS software v.10.3, the study area is divided into eight land use land cover (LULC) categories like forest, cultivated land, grassland, water bodies, settlement/built-up land, barren land, and sand. We found that forest land continuously decreased by 42.3% between 1972 and 2019 and cultivated land is also decreased by 31.6% from 1972 to 2019. Settlement and Barren land are increased progressively 1209.6%, 394.3% respectively between 1972 and 2019 respectively. The total ecosystem services in Jhargram block have been calculated as $30.52, $29.69, $27.03, $34.1, $29.2, and $21 million in the year of 1972, 1987, 1992, 2002, 2012 and 2019 respectively. The total ecosystem services have reduced by 31.2% due to deforestation. Variations can also be seen in the value of individual ecosystem service functions viz. food production, raw material, erosion control, nutrient cycling, recreation, and climate regulation, which are important contributions in total ecosystem services. The sensitivity analysis indicates that our estimated ecosystem service value for our present study is reasonable and robustness concerning the value coefficient.

Biochar is known to enhance soil quality but can also have undesired effects such as altering the bioavailability and behavior of herbicides. Microbial communities can degrade herbicides such as sulfometuron-methyl in soils; however, they are known to be affected by BC. Therefore, it is important to understand the tripartite interaction between these factors. This research aimed to evaluate the sorption-desorption and biodegradation of sulfometuron-methyl in Amazonian soils amended with BC, and to assess the effects of the interactions between BC and sulfometuron-methyl on soil bacterial communities. Soil samples were collected from field plots amended with BC at three doses (0, 40 and 80 t ha−1) applied ten years ago. The herbicide sorption and desorption were evaluated using a batch equilibrium method. Mineralization and biodegradation studies were conducted in microcosms incubated with 14C-sulfometuron-methyl for 80 days. Systematic soil sampling, followed by DNA extraction, quantification (qPCR) and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing were performed. The presence of BC increased the sorption of the herbicide to the soil by 11% (BC40) and 16% (BC80) compared to unamended soil. The presence of BC also affected the degradation of 14C-sulfometuron-methyl, reducing the mineralization rate and increasing the degradation half-life times (DT50) from 36.67 days in unamended soil to 52.11 and 55.45 days in BC40 and BC80 soils, respectively. The herbicide application altered the bacterial communities, affecting abundance and richness, and changing the taxonomic diversity (i.e., some taxa were promoted and other inhibited).

On one part, continuous biogeochemical cycling of carbonaceous C (organic C) and C dioxide-C (CO2-C) are all vital and essential for life on the planet earth. There can be no life without C, in addition to hydrogen, oxygen and other elements known to science. The problem lies with excess CO2-C which remains in relative gaseous phase in the environment of soil, water and air. The global limit of CO2-C continues to rise in the era of agricultural, industrial and human civilisations that depend primarily on burning of fossil fuel, coupled with other anthropogenic activities like bush burning, deforestation, logging, gas flaring in crude oil exploration and wastes disposal. These have come with consequent environmental consequences, namely, global warming, climate change, melting of arctic ice, rise in sea level, flooding, tsunami, acidification, acid rain, desertification, pollution and habitat degradation/losses. To mitigate C excesses in the environment, scientists and researchers have tried several schemes/approaches in C sink, popularly referred to as “sequestration”. The rate of sequestration in atmosphere, lithosphere and hydrosphere depends on the available methods and resources. In atmosphere, C-sequestrations have involved reforestation or afforestation to securely capture CO2-C and store as nutrients in plant parts in the form of cellulose, hemicelluloses, starch, carbohydrate and glucose. In lithosphere, C-sequestrations have involved organic matter amendments/deposition, alley farming, silviculture and agroforestry. In hydrosphere, C-sequestrations have involved ocean fertigation with iron (Fe++) fillings required by phytoplankton as nutrients. The limitation for atmospheric sink lies on global deforestation/logging for agriculture and timber, while that of lithospheric sequestration lies on high-input agriculture that makes use of inorganic fertilisers, agrochemicals and agricultural mechanisation/processing/storage that depends on burning of fossil fuel, bush burning and bush clearing for land preparation/agricultural activities. The limitation of hydrospheric sequestration lies on cost, availability and affordability of Fe++ fillings. Whichever method of C sink, successes and failures come with global welcome as scientists, agriculturists and researchers strive to test, develop and adapt all local, regional, national and international options, including integrated approaches/methods/formulas. The chapter “Carbon stabilisation in tropical ecosystem” is geared towards highlighting the importance of carbon sink in our ecosystem. The methods and systems of C sink or storage vary from one location to another. But the idea remains that excess gaseous carbon dioxide-C in the environment is very inimical to environmental health, and all options required for their sink and stabilisation in the environment should be accelerated all over the world to avoid what this chapter likens to “carbon holocaust”. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.",Agricultural activities and Anthropogenic activities and Between nature and nurture and Burning of fossil fuel and Carbon cycling and Carbon dioxidecarbon and Carbon sequestration and Carbon stabilisation and Environmental consequences and Human civilisations and Industrial activities and Mitigation measures,10.1007/978-981-33-6765-4_7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160132697&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-33-6765-4_7&partnerID=40&md5=1a23a68d603ae5e223b24d33e24e24d5,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,CHAP,NA,243,275,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,1980

Thus, this work aims to analyze the impact caused by the succession process in soil of different pasture areas, with an emphasis on their physical quality and physical-hydric characteristics, relating them to the role played by naturally observed ecosystem services. For this, 4 grazing areas were selected, in Red Ultisol, under different levels of natural succession: grazing in good visual conditions (PB); pasture under low scrub (CB); pasture under high scrub (CA); pasture under “capoeirão” (CAO), in the Ribeirão José Pereira microbasin (Itajubá-MG). The physical attributes were determined: soil density, porosity, size and stability of aggregates, as well as their classification as to the formation path. The infiltration analysis was carried out with the aid of a Guelph permea meter and the resistance to mechanical penetration of the soil with an impact penetrometer. For analysis of the results, analysis of variance and Tukey test at 5%, Pearson's correlation and multivariate statistics of main components were used. The natural succession in abandoned pastures improves the physical quality of the soil, with the production of larger, more stable aggregates and of biogenic formation over time. The areas could be classified according to their quality, in the following increasing order: PB < CB < CA < CAO, which respected the action of natural succession and, therefore, of ecosystem services. © 2021, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco.

However, most studies in human-dominated landscapes have used taxonomic diversity in their analysis, ignoring evolutionary relationships. Consequently, the relationship between landscape structure and phylogenetic diversity is not well understood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that landscape heterogeneity is positively related to bird phylogenetic indexes of diversity and structure, leading to over-dispersed phylogenies in very heterogeneous landscapes. We analyzed phylogenetic responses in interfaces between forest edges and anthropogenic matrices (forest–pasture and forest–eucalyptus) using generalized linear mixed models. We also compared these indexes between land covers to assess which one best preserves the phylogenetic history of communities. We used both traditional phylogenetic indexes and those corrected for species richness. Our results showed that phylogenetic diversity varied significantly between land cover types, but this did not occur when we removed effects associated with species richness, suggesting that all land covers preserve similar levels of evolutionary history. Additionally, our best models showed a positive relationship between landscape heterogeneity and bird phylogenetic indexes of diversity and structure, but the strength of these relationships may be land cover dependent. In summary, our work highlights the influence of landscape heterogeneity on the phylogenetic diversity and structure of bird communities, reinforcing the need for its incorporation into conservation-based studies.

Although coffee cultivation exists in the State of Amazonas, there is no information regarding the behavior of this species population in this region of Brazil. Since the Amazon region is a favorable environment for H. hampei, the present study aimed to investigate this insect population in the following cultivation systems implanted in the municipality of Humaitá, Southern Amazonas: i) coffee in native forest (CNF), ii) coffee intercropped with cupuaçu and açaí (native Brazilian fruits) (CCA) and iii) coffee in monoculture (MC). Also, the climatic and phenological parameters of the plant were used in relation with the population dynamics of the insect. For that, ten baited traps were installed in each field for the monthly sampling of the H. hampei population from July/2018 to June/2019. The highest population abundance of the insect was observed during the coffee flowering season, mainly in monoculture crops, when compared to the other intercropped fields. The total mean value of the insect population observed in the three environments evaluated was highest in August/2018, with a recorded value of 1749. The increase in rainfall indexes occurred simultaneously with a decrease in the insect population; this coincides with the end of the flowering season (October/2018, 161.8 mm) and the beginning of grain formation (November/2018, 234.8 mm). The lowest abundance of the insect observed in the coffee fields in native forest, with an abundance of 83 (CNF), indicates that the local biodiversity disfavors the population size of the pest in the environment. These results suggest that phenological phases of conilon coffee and the influence of climatic conditions can result in changes in the population dynamics of the H. hampei. Coffee agroforestry systems are more promising to maintain this population at low levels. © 2021, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

This metropolitan area is one of the largest urban conglomerates in the world with more than 22 million people.

First, a diagnostic of the current conditions was elaborated using available layers of geospatial data from the MASP. Then the future tree cover was discussed according to three scenarios: i) the non-adopters that represent the business as usual; ii) the late-adopters that develop innovative actions from 2035; and iii) early-adopters that undertake innovative interventions of urban greening from 2020. The vegetation cover was estimated to be reduced by 4% considering the current non-adopter scenario by 2050. On the other hand, vegetation cover has the potential to increase 30% in 2050, once there is an early adoption of innovative interventions, promoting various ecosystem services and co-benefits that support the quality of life and the biodiversity in the MASP, while fostering the carbon credit in the city through vegetation carbon sink.

This area has consistently implemented ecotourism principles. Previously, it was assumed to be vulnerable from the damage due to differences in environmental awareness of ecotourists and local communities. This study aims to (i) describe the strategy of coastal biodiversity conservation to enhance environmental awareness and its sustainability; (ii) analyze the role of conservation on sustainability and environmental awareness, with sustainability as a mediating variable between conservation and environmental awareness. Data analysis was conducted with descriptive and Warp Partial Least Square (WarpPLS). The results indicate that empirical facts of conservation, sustainability, and environmental awareness in CMC Tiga Warna are relevant to the result of statistical analysis. Conservation is believed to form the environmental awareness of ecotourists and local communities and to maintain the sustainability of ecotourism destinations. In addition, the sustainability of ecotourism destinations serves as an effective mediator between conservation and environmental awareness, along with the modeling of environmental awareness enhancement in conservation-based coastal ecotourism. The proposed model explains that sustainability and environmental awareness variances are 23% and 25%, respectively.

Specifically, we focus on media coverage of the 2016 International Peat Congress, where scientifically misleading claims that it is sustainable to develop oil palm plantations on tropical peatlands were made. We found that media reporting of the denialist narrative is more prevalent than that of the peer-reviewed science consensus-view that plantations on tropical peat could cause excessive greenhouse gas emissions and enhance the risk of fires. Four mutually complementary narratives were used by Indonesian and Malaysian media to construe denialism, which closely resemble the four climate denialist narratives identified by Elsasser and Dunlap (2013). These denialist narratives draw heavily upon information advocated by divergent knowledge communities (Goldstein 2016) and appeal to a nationalist sentiment of ‘us’ - palm oil-producing developing countries - and ‘them’ - western developed countries producing research critical of the industry. The Malaysian press has most extensively deployed this nationalistic sentiment, whereas the Singaporean media has not actively endorsed or rejected any of the denialist narratives. Our findings suggests that media representation of the issue is a reflection of an amalgamation of economic, diplomatic and nationalistic concerns, determined by political, socio-cultural nuances specific to each country. Importantly, our article alerts to the continuation of unsustainable practices as justified by the media to the public, and that the prevalence of these denialist narratives constitute a significant obstacle in resolving pressing issues such as transboundary haze, biodiversity loss, and land-use change related greenhouse gas emissions in Southeast Asia. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Divergent knowledge and Palm oil and Science communications and Southeast Asia and Sustainable agriculture and Tropical peatlands and palm oil and peat and Article and biodiversity and carbon footprint and environmental impact and haze and Indonesia and land use and Malaysia and mass medium and narrative and peatland and plantation and politics and priority journal and publication and science and Singapore and sustainable agriculture,10.1016/j.envsci.2020.07.004,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089541846&doi=10.1016%2fj.envsci.2020.07.004&partnerID=40&md5=884430b22f38e87d8f25fa060aa9ffcc,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 22,NA,JOUR,NA,162,169,NA,DEC,1462-9011 and 1873-6416,WOS:000591437000017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","1995, 5192"

In this regard, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of converting areas cultivated with sugarcane to eucalypt plantations (Eucalyptus spp.) on soil quality and carbon sequestration in a Latossolo (Ferralsol) in the Atlantic Forest region of the Alagoas state, Brazil, through multivariate analysis. The systems under evaluation consisted of four areas: one area cultivated with sugarcane for approximately 20 years, taken as the reference area of this study, and the other three adjacent areas cultivated with eucalypt at 1 (E1), 3 (E3) and 6 (E6) years of age, previously cultivated with sugarcane. Physical (bulk density-BD, Mean weight-diameter-MWD, geometric mean diameter-GMD and aggregate stability index-ASI), chemical (soil organic carbon-SOC, total nitrogen-TN, labile carbon-LC and recalcitrant carbon-RC) and biological (Microbial biomass carbon-MBC, soil carbon respiration-C-CO2 and metabolic quotient-qCO2 ) properties of soil were evaluated. Data were collected, standardized and submitted to exploratory analysis with principal components. The results show that SOC, LC, TN, GMD, MWD and ASI increased, while BD showed a reduction in E3 and E6 systems.

We used field measurements of rainfall, streamflow, and throughfall and estimated canopy interception and evapotranspiration by water balance. Water flows in the monitored watersheds with eucalyptus plantations were influenced by forest developmental stage. Annual canopy interception and transpiration were always higher in the watersheds with eucalyptus than in the one with grassland, except for the transpiration in the first year after plantation in the watershed with young eucalyptus. An increase in evapotranspiration (green water flow) and the consequent decrease in streamflow (blue water flow) should be considered in local water resource management.

To reverse this situation, a range of restoration programs for deforested and degraded areas have been created and implemented. The aim of this study was to analyze the tree composition, successional stage, dispersal and pollination syndromes, conservation status of tree species, and proximity to seed sources under different forest restoration techniques (seedling planting, natural regeneration, and assisted natural regeneration or nucleation) implemented in post-mining sites in the Paragominas municipality (Para, Brazil). Sixty permanent plots with a restoration age of three years were selected for tree sampling. A total of 119 species, 83 genera and 27 botanical families were identified. Sites restored with different techniques significantly differed in tree composition. Seedling planting sites exhibited the highest abundance, species richness, and diversity values. These were dominated less by pioneer species when compared to the natural regeneration and nucleation sites. Entomophilic pollination and zoochory dispersal were highly represented in the three types of restored sites. Abundance and species richness were negatively correlated with distance from plots to seed sources, and they sharply declined in natural regeneration and nucleation plots at > 250 m from seed sources. Four threatened species were identified in the restored sites.

Diversity and distribution of mollusks at three zones of mangrove in Pejarakan, Bali, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 21: 4636-4643. The diversity of mangrove species in mangrove zonations on the coast of Pejarakan plays an important role in the existence of faunal diversity, including those from mollusks. Mollusks are the dominant phylum associated with mangrove habitats, in addition to the species of the Crustacean subphylum. This research aimed to determine the diversity of mollusks and their distribution patterns in three mangrove zones in Pejarakan, Buleleng District, Bali Province, Indonesia. Data collection was conducted by establishing sampling plots across three mangrove zones, i.e. seaward zone, middle zone, and landward zone. There were 23 sampling plots in total with size of each plot was 1x1m. The species and number of individuals of each species of mollusks were recorded in each quadrat plot. The diversity of mollusks was calculated using the Shannon-Wiener index, evenness index, and dominance index, while the pattern of distribution of mollusks was measured using the Morisita index. The results of the study found 27 species of mollusks, consisting of 19 species from Gastropods group, 7 species from Bivalvia group and 1 species from Polyplacophora (chiton). The seaward zone showed the highest species diversity, while the landward zone had the lowest. Terebralia palustris had the highest abundance with 217 individuals/m2 and was distributed in the three mangrove zones. Planaxis sulcatus showed the highest abundance (87 ind./m2) in the seaward zone, and Telescopium telescopium showed a fairly high abundance and were distributed in the mid zone and the landward zone. In general, mollusks in the mangrove area of Pejarakan was distributed in a group/clustered pattern.

No-tillage systems can promote earthworm populations, which can improve soil physical and chemical properties, thus enhancing the benefits of NT for soil conservation and ecosystem services. Furthermore, earthworms can be used as indicators of the quality of NT systems. Here, we summarize the studies that evaluated earthworm populations in NT systems between 1986 and 2016 in Brazil, highlighting important gaps in knowledge. The studies were highly skewed geographically, with most data from southern and south-eastern Brazil, and had very little information from the two states with the greatest NT area (Mato Grosso and Rio Grande do Sul) which together represent 43% of Brazilʼs NT area. Abundance values ranged from 0 to 660 ind. m−2, with a mean of 91 ± 129 ind. m−2 (±SD), and at least 33 species were identified in NT systems. However, 73% of sites were considered to have poor and moderate soil quality based on their earthworm populations, raising concern regarding soil quality levels in Brazilian NT systems. Climate, soil and management conditions are important drivers of earthworm populations in Brazilian NT systems and future earthworm surveys in NT systems should provide ample data on these attributes, as well as on earthworm species, in order to improve their use as soil quality bioindicators. Highlights: Mean earthworm abundance in Brazilian NT is 91 ± 129 ind. m−2 (range 0–660 ind. m−2) 33 species were identified in NT, most endogeic and epi-endogeic (0 anecics, 1 epigeic) Around 75% of NT sites sampled in Brazil had moderate to poor earthworm populations Soil management practices need improvement in many NT systems to increase earthworm populations. © 2019 British Society of Soil Science",bioindicators and conservation agriculture and earthworms and ecosystem services and soil macrofauna and soil quality and Brazil and Mato Grosso and Rio Grande do Sul and abundance and bioindicator and earthworm and future prospect and physicochemical property and soil conservation and soil quality and spatiotemporal analysis and zero tillage,10.1111/ejss.12918,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076784608&doi=10.1111%2fejss.12918&partnerID=40&md5=fda345e904d823dd8eb76bbf7ea92deb,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 18,NA,JOUR,6,988,1005,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2004

The lowlands of Sumatra, for example, are dominated by increasingly extensive areas of oil palm and rubber monoculture plantations, while rainforests are continuously vanishing. The status of many rainforest animal populations, including iconic insect groups such as butterflies, is largely unclear. With a rapid assessment approach, we studied butterflies along land-use gradients from lowland rainforest, via jungle rubber plantations (rubber agroforest system), to monocultures of rubber and oil palm in Jambi Province, Sumatra. Butterflies were caught in a nested replication design at eight research plots at each of the forest, jungle rubber, and rubber and oil palm locations. Butterfly abundance was the highest in the rainforest (204.3±82.1), slightly lower in the jungle rubber and oil palm areas (164.9±61 and 169.3±94.9, respectively), and the lowest in the rubber plantation (108.8±38.5). Similarly, butterfly species richness was the highest in the forest and jungle rubber areas (47.1±7.7 and 38.8±7.6, respectively), followed by the oil palm area (33.3±9.8), and the lowest in the rubber plantation (26.1±9.1). Likewise, ShannonWiener diversity was the highest in the rainforest, at an intermediate level in the jungle rubber, and lowest in the oil palm and rubber plantations. Butterfly community composition in the rainforest was very different from that in the other three land-use systems, in which it was similar. Overall, the study demonstrates that rainforest butterfly communities cannot be sustained in agricultural systems, highlighting the importance of rainforests for conserving the diversity of arthropods. © 2020, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

The mapping results depict a worrying scenario of over-fragmentation and reduction of forest cover. The limited information provided, however, may underestimate deforestation in this Brazilian biome. We analysed the use of new high-resolution global deforestation datasets to quantify 10 years of deforestation in a heterogeneous landscape, where forest fragments are immersed in an agricultural and urban matrix. We set up a framework based on high-resolution satellite images available on Google Earth to visually inspect whether the areas of Global Forest Change (GFC) and SOSMA considered to be forest loss corresponded to actual deforestation. Results showed that no more than 21% of the forest loss area of the GFC were considered deforestation of Atlantic Forest remnants. More than 55% of the mapped patches (counts) were considered misclassifications. Misclassifications varied throughout the years, revealing the absence of a clear pattern, and they were considered dependent on the year. Forest plantation, forest regeneration, and grassland were the main sources of misclassifications. Despite errors, GFC accounted for significantly more deforestation than the official Brazilian mapping of the Atlantic Forest (SOSMA), showing that many small forest fragments that are important for maintaining biodiversity are being lost with little or no concern about it. We suggest that instead of sustaining an entire national programme that relies on acquiring and processing imagery, it would be better to work alongside a global programme such as the GFC by providing visual inspection, cross-validation, local knowledge, and further improvements. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Atlantic Forest and Brazil and Biodiversity and Deforestation and Image enhancement and Mapping and Space research and Brazilian Atlantic forests and Forest plantation and Forest regeneration and Heterogeneous landscapes and High resolution satellite images and Limited information and Misclassifications and National programme and deforestation and forest management and fragmentation and GIS and image resolution and satellite imagery and twenty first century and vegetation mapping and Reforestation,10.1080/01431161.2020.1718236,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079348440&doi=10.1080%2f01431161.2020.1718236&partnerID=40&md5=4dd86996161495218fde2b6867aa8280,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 9,NA,JOUR,11,4408,4420,NA,JUN 2,0143-1161 and 1366-5901,WOS:000512637800001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2006, 5101"

Soil organisms such as Collembola are good indicators because they respond to a variety of environmental and ecological factors and their community structure indicates a change in land management. In this study, we propose to assess the relationships between springtail biodiversity in management systems with a history of NT and CLI. For both management systems, nine points were sampled, distributed in a 30 × 30 m sampling grid, in three municipalities on the Southern Santa Catarina Plateau, Brazil. Springtails were collected using a metal cylinder (5 cm diameter × 5 cm deep) and identified at the species level. At the same point, samples were collected to evaluate soil properties (chemical, physical and microbiological). In total, 538 individuals were collected, distributed in 24 species, 293 individuals (18 species) in NT and 245 individuals (17 species) in the CLI system. Soil management systems studied did not affect the total number of individuals and richness. The NT system had a greater association with epigeic species, while the CLI system was more associated with hemiedaphic and edaphic species, which is related to the site-specific differences in soil conditions. In both soil management systems, the species were influenced by a range of soil properties.

Paludiculture involves wet cultivation practices in peatland and can maintain peat bodies and sustaining ecosystem services. However, information about paludiculture effects on tropical peatlands is limited in the literature. Therefore, this study aimed to analyse the effectiveness and progress of paludiculture projects in supporting peatland ecosystem restoration in Indonesia that uses approaches of soil rewetting, revegetation of peat soil/forest, and the revitalisation of rural livelihoods around peatlands. We obtained qualitative and quantitative data from field measurements, observations, document reviews, spatial data from open-source web applications, and interviews with key stakeholders in two projects (agri-silviculture and agro-sylvofishery) that adapt paludiculture principles to Indonesia's South Sumatra Province. We found that the limited use of paludiculture principles in both projects has a different contribution to peatland restoration. The agri-silviculture project has been utilising jelutung (Dyera polyphylla), ramin (Gonystylus bancanus), and balangeran (Shorea balangeran) for (forest) revegetation. These species are 3 of the 534 paludiculture species that are adaptive to peat soils and tolerant to acidic conditions and inundation. The revegetation resulted in effective results that supported peatland restoration despite the delayed application of rewetting activities in the initial phase of the project. Additionally, in the agro-sylvofishery project, trade-offs between soil rewetting to maintain high peat water tables and the need to provide short-term economic benefits for local communities through horticulture and fishery practices were noted.

We used a combination of the forest canopy density model, carbon conversion and socio-economic related data to analyze land cover classes in the periods of 1999–2003, 2003–2009, and 2009–2018, representing the phases of several years before community forestry permit, initial phase of community forestry establishment and several years after community forestry permit, respectively. Results showed that at baseline (1999), where illegal logging was started on the ground, the condition of the 40ha investigated area was dominated by non-forest in the form of open land by 54% with an amounted carbon storage of 1352.62ton. In the phase of before community forestry permit (1999–2003), when there was continuous illegal logging, the open land rise quickly achieved to 83%, with only 312.09 ton of carbon storage remaining. In the initial phase of community forestry establishment (2003–2009), when the government issued a legalization of community forest, the mixed dryland agriculture shifted to dominate the area by 55%, with the carbon storage being increased to 1840.94 ton. The last phase, several years after community forestry permit (2009–2018), which characterized by active engagement of the community in forest rehabilitation, the area was altered to fully stocked teak plantation forest by 82%, with a carbon storage enhancement of 3379.16 ton or two times higher than that at baseline. Such results are important for the forest community authority and related stakeholder for designing appropriate forest-related policies and supporting REDD + implementation. © 2020 The Author(s).

The Cerrado, one of the main biodiversity conservation hotspots in the world, loses natural habitat at a very high rate and suffers from disturbances generated by land use and advancement of the agricultural frontier. Given the need to generate knowledge about land use in Cerrado biome, this study aimed to evaluate if the anthropogenic disturbance alters biodiversity indexes and the capacity to store biomass of these savanna. We installed a permanent plot (20 m × 50 m) inside each study fragment and assessed the intensity of local disturbances such as cattle grazing, earthworm extraction, Caryocar fruit harvesting, and fire. To measure habitat loss and fragmentation, we used configuration and composition metrics in local and landscapes scales. Cattle grazing caused a loss of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity, while fragment size and Cerrado cover in landscape increased phylogenetic diversity. The patch density, shape complexity and edge density in the landscapes also had a negative influence on phylogenetic diversity. Landscapes with more Eucalyptus sp. plantation area had lower phylogenetic diversity. In addition, the percentage of Cerrado in the landscape had a negative influence on biomass while the number of patches had a positive influence. Thus, we conclude that anthropogenic disturbances in the Cerrado generates loss of taxonomic, phylogenetic diversity and alters biomass stock patterns. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Biodiversity loss and Cerrado fragmentation and Ecosystem functioning and Ecosystem services and Land use and Brazil and Bos and Caryocar and Eucalyptus and anthropogenic effect and biodiversity and biomass and cerrado and ecosystem service and habitat fragmentation and habitat loss and human activity and land use change and phylogenetics and savanna and taxonomy,10.1007/s10531-020-02013-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087730344&doi=10.1007%2fs10531-020-02013-6&partnerID=40&md5=6389e26cd36593791f5ab6a99610d3fe,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 43,NA,JOUR,11-12,3151,3168,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2016

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are produced at various stages of the process (including for instance, from fuel used in dredging equipment). One substantial and site-dependent source of GHG emissions is associated with carbon stock losses resulting from the disturbance and extraction of fill from vegetated marine ecosystems. In this article we focus on these sources of GHG emissions and assess, for the first time, the potential carbon loss from mangrove ecosystems caused by land reclamation activities. To this end, we take a case study of a regionally significant, large-scale reclamation project in Jakarta Bay, Indonesia. The extent of mangroves likely to be impacted by the project was estimated by analysing land satellite (LANDSAT) imagery in the period before and after the start of reclamation activities. The carbon stored in the affected areas was then estimated using field measurements to determine total stocks (biomass and soil organic carbon). Mangroves in the study area at Serang (where sand mining is designated) and Angke (adjacent to deposition site) were estimated to store on average 203.64 Mg C ha−1, and 531.53 Mg C ha−1 respectively. The lower carbon stocks at Serang are a consequence of sand mining that occurred there in 2003. The regrown mangroves at Serang are smaller than that at Angke. The near-surface soil organic carbon (SOC) content at Serang was less than at Angke, 17% and 43% of the total respectively. Results also reveal that around 75% of total carbon stocks in both sites are in the form of SOC. We suggest that collating this sort of information about carbon stocks in sites impacted by land reclamation activities can help development planners identify opportunities to reduce GHG emissions. To illustrate, long-term carbon losses due to land reclamation in the case study area could be reduced if dredging is limited to 1 m depth and mangrove areas are actively rehabilitated. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Carbon stock and Land reclamation and Mangroves and Satellite mapping and Greater Sunda Islands and Jakarta and Jakarta Bay and Java and Sunda Isles and Rhizophoraceae and Ecosystems and Gas emissions and Greenhouse gases and Land use and Organic carbon and Reclamation and Satellite imagery and Affected area and Biomass and soils and Dependent sources and Dredging equipment and Field measurement and Industrial development and Mangrove ecosystems and Reclamation project and carbon emission and carbon sequestration and dredging and extraction method and greenhouse gas and industrial development and land reclamation and mangrove and marine environment and satellite imagery and vulnerability and Land reclamation,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105283,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087381800&doi=10.1016%2fj.ocecoaman.2020.105283&partnerID=40&md5=940cdc527118d279502c7e3025851856,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 36,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2019

The experiment was initiated in September 2015 with a randomized block design arranged in a 3 × 2 factorial scheme (three silvicultural practices and two planting models). We evaluated the performance of nine native species by the analysis of morphological (i.e., survival, height, and stem diameter) and physiological attributes (i.e., photosynthetic pigments and chlorophyll a fluorescence). The use of intensive silvicultural practices in restoration plantations maximized tree survival rates, height, and stem growth, and provided better values for the physiological attributes. The two planting models tested in this study (i.e., “framework species” and diversity) can be used in future restoration projects in subtropical regions associated with intensive silvicultural practices.

Consequently, it may contribute to the disturbance of the sustainability of its forest biodiversity and increasing number of local poverty surrounding the forest area. Agroforestry system is known as one of the strategies to mitigate the forest conflict. The system helps the farmers to increase agricultural production, social life, and ecological stability. Local community in Kemuning forest had been implementing coffee-based agroforestry system for a long time, as part of their main income. This system allowed farmers to acces the forest through an intensive interaction between locals and its forest environment. This study aimed to understand the forest conflict mitigation through agroforestry practices in Kemuning forest better, which allegedly become a key factor for the sustainability of the presence of Javan slow lorise. This study builds on the assumption that people frame conflicts on Kemuning forest according to their experiences, expectations, objectives and interests at a specific moment. The basis for our analytical framework is found in theories on framing. In doing so, the study uses the framing analysis theory to identify framing of the conflict by different involved stakeholders. Data were collected in 2018 - 2019 through several techniques such as in depth interview, field observation, and study literatures. Collected data were analyzed descriptively by discussing each finding with framing analysis theory. Findings revealed that conflict in Kemuning forest were triggered by three main issue/problem frames identified as the root causes of the conflicts which are forest security, unfollow the signed contract, and an unequal benefit sharing from the coffee-based agroforestry sector. Other frames: identity, characterization, and conflict management frames were constructed in such a way to reinforce the issue/problem frames. This study also found that related to Javan slow lorise habitat, this coffee-based agroforestry system is the appropriate land use management that provide secure habitat for the sustainability of the presence of the animal within Kemuning forest. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.",cofee-based agroforestry and conflict and Frame theory and Kemuning forest and secure habitat and Agricultural robots and Biodiversity and Ecosystems and Land use and Sustainable development and Timber and Agricultural productions and Agroforestry system and Conflict management and Ecological stability and Forest biodiversity and Forest environments and In-depth interviews and Land-use management and Forestry,10.1088/1755-1315/449/1/012050,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083423432&doi=10.1088%2f1755-1315%2f449%2f1%2f012050&partnerID=40&md5=d5c9af1b2b79a14547b9385cd31466ec,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 3,NA,CONF,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,1755-1307,WOS:000654637000050,NA,NA,3rd International Conference in Agroforestry (ICAF SEANAFE) - Adopting Modern Agroforestry Toward Smart Social Forestry Program,IOP,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2024, 5588"

Using integrated crop–livestock systems (ICLs) under no-till agriculture can increase soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation, thereby helping mitigate such emissions. The aim of this study was to assess the net global warming potential (net GWP) of no-till ICLs at variable grazing intensities of winter black oat pasture in a subtropical ecosystem. A 3.5-year field experiment involving three different grazing intensities (i.e., intensive, moderate and light as defined by a pasture height of 10, 20 and 30 cm, respectively) and grazing exclusion in winter and no-till soybean cropping in summer was conducted on a Ferralsol in southern Brazil. Net GWP, in Mg CO2eq ha−1 year−1, was assessed in terms of SOC sequestration relative to intensive grazing as a reference, including methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and energy costs of farming operations and inputs. Moderate grazing reduced net GWP relative to intensive grazing (from 0.09 to 4.92 Mg CO2eq ha−1 year−1), the latter leading to the highest GWP levels. The decrease in net GWP was mainly the result of SOC accumulation, which offset 34–98% of all GHG emissions. Light grazing and grazing exclusion proved to be less efficient than moderate grazing in decreasing net GWP (1.84 Mg CO2eq ha−1 year−1 on average), mainly as a result of decreased SOC accumulation. Based on our findings, moderate grazing (20 cm high pasture) of winter black oat pasture is an effective strategy to reduce the C-footprint of ICLs in subtropical no-till agriculture.

Experiences in Indonesia,"Forests, FORESTS",11,503,"The Forest Stewardship Council initiated a Forest Certification for Ecosystem Services (ForCES) project from 2011 to 2017 to improve and promote sustainable forest management addressing a range of ecosystem services. Three sites in Indonesia were included in the pilot. Whilst the development of the certification standard was largely the result of a partnership between the certification standard organization, civil society and research organizations, implementation and monitoring of the impact of this sustainability standard will entail interactions with state regulations. This study examined how voluntary certification, other market-based approaches and state regulations concerning ecosystem services in Indonesia interplay, particularly in the agenda setting and negotiation stage. Using the conceptual lenses of transition theory and state and non-state market-based governance, interrelationships between ecosystem services certification and regulations were found to be complementary and antagonistic. The majority of interrelations were complementary and supporting. However, antagonism exists where regulations do not address multiple land uses and when there are contradictions in how state regulations define ecosystem services. There was limited state involvement in developing the ecosystem services certification standard, with no substitution between the voluntary standard and regulations occurring. To scale and transition this innovatory standard from a niche to a sociotechnical regime level, it is recommended that market-driven governance arrangements at farm, forest concession and landscape level are developed in collaboration with national and local governments. Collaboration can create synergies to incentivize the acceptance, adoption and effectiveness of non-state market driven instruments to positively enhance the conservation of ecosystem services. © 2020 by the authors.",Ecosystem services and Indonesia and Plural governance arrangements and State regulation and Voluntary sustainability certification and Commerce and Ecosystems and Forestry and Indonesia and Land Use and Sustainable Forest Management and Indonesia and Commerce and Forestry and Land use and Laws and legislation and Sustainable development and Certification standards and Forest Certification and Forest stewardship councils and Market-based approach and Research organization and Socio-technical regimes and Sustainable forest management and Voluntary certification and certification and ecosystem service and forest management and negotiation process and regulatory approach and sustainability and voluntary approach and Ecosystems,10.3390/F11050503,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085489688&doi=10.3390%2fF11050503&partnerID=40&md5=0e22757a1e1027a1b14aa83d499966ae,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 11,NA,JOUR,5,NA,NA,NA,MAY,1999-4907,WOS:000542736000044,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2027, 3933"

We evaluated physiological and growth responses of Cytharexyllum myrianthum seedlings to flooding in three different soil types representative of the Almada River Watershed (ARW), southern Bahia, Brazil. The soils selected, based on the relative abundance and importance in the ARW, were: Luvisol, Argisol, and Spodosol. After 35 days of flooding, the Argisol had the lowest and the Spodosol had the highest reduction–oxidation (redox) potential (Eh). After 35 days of flooding, the Luvisol had higher pH and electrical conductivity (Ec) than the other soils. Stomatal conductance (gs) and net photosynthesis (A) significantly declined in all soil types after 7 days of flooding. After that period, morphological changes characteristic of flood-tolerant plants, such as lenticel hypertrophy and adventitious root formation, were observed in all flooded plants. Following the morphological changes, gs and A in flooded plants increased to values close to those of the non-flooded plants. The highest relative growth rates based on mass (RGRm) and net assimilation rates (NAR) for the non-flooded plants were observed in the Argisol. After 35 days of flooding, no significant differences in RGRm or NAR were observed between non-flooded and flooded plants in the Luvisol, but large significant decreases in RGRm and NAR were observed for the flooded plants in the Spodosol. Our results demonstrated that the ability of seedlings of the same species to acclimate to flooded soil conditions differs among soil types.

The evaluated areas varied in relation to the post-mining condition, natural revegetation (NR), an area with gully erosion (GA) and area under eucalyptus revegetation (ER) and native vegetation cover, rupestrian field (RF), and seasonal semi-deciduous forest (NF). The main soil physical attributes evaluated were: soil organic matter (SOM), geometric mean diameter (GMD), weighted mean diameter (WMD), bulk density (Bd), air capacity (ACb), plant-available water capacity (AWC), relative field capacity (RFC), and visual soil quality assessment. In addition to the impacts on the landscape, with removal of vegetation and soil cover, iron ore mining process impacts soil physical quality measured through porosity and aggregation properties and therefore could impact ecosystems services. Areas of iron post-mining that are not restored can develop gully erosion.

The efficient treatment of aquaculture wastewater is vital in reaching a sustainable and ecological way of fish farming. Bioremediation in the form of the Green Liver System employing macrophytes was considered as wastewater treatment for a tilapia farm, COOPVALE, in Itacuruba, Brazil, based on previously demonstrated success. A large-scale system was constructed, and the macrophytes Azolla caroliniana, Egeria densa, Myriophyllum aquaticum, and Eichhornia crassipes were selected for phytoremediation. As cyanobacterial blooms persisted in the eutrophic wastewater, two microcystin congeners (MC-LR and-RR) were used as indicator contaminants for system efficiency and monitored by liquid-chromatography–tandem-mass-spectrometry. Two trial studies were conducted to decide on the final macrophyte selection and layout of the Green Liver System. In the first trial, 58% MC-LR and 66% MC-RR were removed and up to 32% MC-LR and 100% MC-RR were removed in the second trial. Additional risks that were overcome included animals grazing on the macrophytes and tilapia were spilling over from the hatchery. The implementation of the Green Liver System significantly contributed to the bioremediation of contaminants from the fish farm. © 2020 by the authors.

The study was carried out to quantify the litter productivity and macronutrient (N, P and K) deposition through leaf litter to forest floor under 2-3 years old three native tree species of tropical peatland forest. Those three species are mahang (Macaranga pruinosa), geronggang (Cratoxylum arborescens) and skubung (Macaranga gigantea). These three native species coincide with one exotic species krassikarpa (Acacia crassicarpa) were planted on the drained tropical peatland in Riau using a randomized completely block design. Litter trap was set up on this experimental plot for litter productivity measurement. Nutrient content of leaf litter was analyzed to quantify the nutrient return. Results showed that the maximum litter productivity and leaf litter nutrient return was found in geronggang. Litter productivity, N return, P return, and K return of this native tree species were 7.04 ton ha-1yr-1, 60.69 kg ha-1yr-1, 10.82 kg ha-1yr-1 and 57.68 kg ha-1yr-1, respectively. These results suggested that forest and land productivity could be better maintained by Cratoxylum arborescens plantation than other native tree species. In terms of litter productivity and leaf litter nutrient return, this species is, therefore, more recommended than Macaranga pruinosa and M. gigantea. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Biodiversity and Conservation and Environmental protection and Nutrients and Planning and Productivity and Sustainable development and Tropics and Wetlands and Exotic species and Experimental plots and Forest floors and Land productivities and Native species and Native tree species and Nutrient contents and Productivity measurements and Forestry,10.1088/1755-1315/533/1/012007,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090781337&doi=10.1088%2f1755-1315%2f533%2f1%2f012007&partnerID=40&md5=3554026ec3532c8d73fbba6194760b22,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 5,NA,CONF,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2035

Passive restoration uses the natural regeneration potential while applied nucleation recreates microhabitats, which facilitates ecological succession. In this study, we assessed floristic composition, structure and functional groups as ecological indicators to compare passive restoration (fenced site 12 year ago), applied nucleation (7 years of dense seedling planting) and riparian forest. The study was carried out in a Seasonal Semi-deciduous Forest region in the Pampa biome, in the South of Brazil. We measured and identified all shrub and tree individuals greater than 30 cm in height. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey test (p <.05) was performed to compare composition (richness, abundance, diversity and evenness), structure (average height, maximum height, canopy cover, soil cover, leaf litter depth) and functional group variables (dispersion syndrome and shade tolerance). Riparian forest showed greater richness and diversity. Passive restoration and applied nucleation did not differ statistically in richness, abundance, maximum or average height, or for zoochoric species and zoochoric individual indicators. The leaf litter depth was statistically higher in the riparian forest. The applied nucleation presented a canopy cover similar to riparian forest, demonstrating ability to form habitats which are favorable to ecological succession. We can conclude that passive and applied nucleation restorations have been occurring in a slow process. This is the natural condition of the ecological succession in the Pampa biome, which is probably due to the subtropical climate. Although we could not verify the facilitation effect by functional groups in applied nucleation and expansion of the nuclei size, the floristic composition, diversity, canopy cover and leaf litter depth indicators suggest an acceleration in the ecological succession process.

The region chosen for this study is an area of high biodiversity and has within its geographical limit the second largest city in the Southeast region of Brazil. The objective of this work was to parameterize a model of LULC, which comprises the State of Rio de Janeiro inserted in the Atlantic Forest Biome. For that, it was necessary to calibrate and validate the simulations, in the period between 2010 and 2016, respectively. The LuccME (Land Use and Cover Change Modeling Environmental) model was adopted, which identified the process of LULC changes, and made it possible to project future scenarios for 2020 and 2030, being optimistic and pessimistic. The study indicated the trend in pessimistic growth scenarios in areas that previously had forest in pastures and urban growth, with a low rate of native vegetation area. This is a warning for public and private sector management about territorial planning, for that in the future the population will suffer from the scarcity of natural resources. In the optimistic scenarios, the changes in vegetation are shows more intensely, since in the areas that were undergoing the process of restoration and reforestation, they recover to the point of changing from pasture to forest. In both scenarios, agriculture remained in the most productive and productive areas, with no significant increases or loss of area.

Added to the Amazon, the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) faces changes in fire regimes. Climatic changes and the recent weakening of environmental law enforcement are factors, but historic and large-scale trends and drivers of fire regimes must be analyzed. We discuss ecological and policy drivers of recent changes in fire regimes in the Cerrado, in order to highlight management strategies. The Cerrado has evolved with natural fires and anthropogenic fires are also common for millennia. In the past 50 years, wildfires tend to be concentrated in the late dry season and to occur every two / three years, causing serious damage in fire-sensitive vegetation. Apart from climatic variations, the drivers of wildfires are deforestation and fire suppression policies. Nearly half of the original vegetation of the Cerrado biome has disappeared largely due to agribusiness expansion. Fire is associated with deforestation in two ways: vegetation conversion to monocultures, and lack of fire management in the remaining native vegetation. Indeed, the attempts to exclude fires from this fire-prone ecosystem disrupted traditional fire management. Fire suppression policies lead to increased wildfire risks due to fuel load and the multiplication of sources of ignition (conflicts, roads). The recent advances in Integrated Fire Management in protected areas in the Cerrado are evident. However, the recent budget cuts by the Brazilian government in environmental management and research undermine the chances of decreasing occurrences of wildfires in this biodiversity hotspot. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH",Cerrado and Deforestation and Fire suppression and Integrated fire management and Wildfires and Zero-fire policy and Amazon River and Brazil and agroindustry and anthropogenic effect and biodiversity and deforestation and dry season and environmental legislation and environmental management and law enforcement and policy making and savanna,10.1016/j.flora.2020.151613,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085033486&doi=10.1016%2fj.flora.2020.151613&partnerID=40&md5=d239a2ef0da104549892981b63f47227,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 107,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,JUL,0367-2530 and 1618-0585,WOS:000539998200003,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2040, 5322"

Impacts of changes from natural forest to a range of intermediate tree-based land uses (‘agroforestry’) and non-tree agriculture remain contested. Standard C-stock accounting for a fixed sampling depth depends on changes in both Corg concentrations and bulk density, often with opposite effects. Confounding factors that, beyond current vegetation, influence Corg (soil texture, minerology, drainage, elevation and soil pH) may also influence bulk density. Because land use may not be random with respect to inherent soil properties, differences in soil C-stock between land uses can have multiple causes. We compiled and analysed data from six landscapes in Indonesia (volcanic and other mineral soils; Sumatra, Kalimantan; Java, Sulawesi) where chronosequences of forest, various agroforestry systems and open-field agriculture had been sampled. Our data analysis (617 samples within 0−30 cm depth; 8 land use types) showed that a pedotransfer function for effects on Corg of texture, elevation and soil pH reduced the relative standard error of means per land use type, reduced the range (Max–Min)/Avg and led to a more consistent pattern in apparent land use effects. Relative to natural forest reductions in Corg concentration in the 0−30 cm layer (corrected for confounding factors) averaged 8–20 % in degraded forest, complex agroforest, oil palm plantations and older forest plantation plots, and 25–30 % in simple agroforestry, monoculture tree crops and woodlots, or over 40 % in non-tree (mostly cropped) plots. However, calculated C-stock change was small due to an observed increase (up to 30 %) of bulk density relative to that of natural forest. This implies that up to 23 % additional Corg became included in the soil sampling, resulting in a non-negligible bias (underestimate) in estimated soil carbon loss based on internationally agreed C-stock accounting. © 2020",Agroforestry and Bulk density and Carbon accounting and Carbon concentration and Climate change mitigation and IPCC and Soil carbon and Borneo and Greater Sunda Islands and Indonesia and Java and Kalimantan and Sulawesi and Sumatra and Sunda Isles and Elaeis and agroforestry and bulk density and carbon sequestration and climate change and land use change and pedotransfer function and pH and plantation forestry and soil carbon,10.1016/j.agee.2020.106879,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079837407&doi=10.1016%2fj.agee.2020.106879&partnerID=40&md5=56c75453ccf84c2d50a7e0b2f60c82eb,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 65,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2041

However, multiple ecological barriers are believed to hinder natural regeneration of native trees on degraded peatland and make restoration expensive. We evaluated if natural PSF regeneration occurs and what factors may influence it on eight different land use and land cover (LULC) classes with different types of disturbance, including drainage and fire, in a retired Acacia crassicarpa Benth. (Acacia) plantation landscape. The study involved 42 plots inside five PSF LULCs – intact, logged, burnt (1997, 2015), remnant and 212 plots at distances up to 2 km from the PSF edge in three Acacia plantation LULCs – unharvested, harvested, and burnt. The number of species per plot were similar between intact PSF (25 ± 6 (SD) per 20 m × 10 m plot), logged forest (30 ± 6) and 1997 burnt forest (30 ± 13) but lower in 2015 burnt forest (11 ± 10) and remnant forest (18 ± 11). Regeneration away from the PSF across all degraded LULCs varied from fern dominated areas with no regeneration to clusters with high stem densities. The plantation LULCs, unharvested (94 species) and harvested Acacia (71 species), had similar overall species diversity after 3–4 years of regeneration to the intact and logged PSF (90 species). In unharvested Acacia, total species diversity, species per plot and stem density decreased with distance from forest edge (1–300 m – 87 species; 9 ± 6 (SD) species per 20 m × 10 m plot; 1,056 stems/ha; 301–500 m – 33; 5 ± 2; 511 and >500 m – 38; 6 ± 3; 683). In harvested Acacia, there was low plot species diversity irrespective of distance from the forest (1–300 m – 51; 4 ± 2; 578; 301–500 m – 17; 4 ± 2; 1,100; >500 m – 48; 4 ± 2; 780). Factors which may influence regeneration differed between different LULCs, but there was a clear influence of distance from forest edge and dispersal mechanism – i.e. whether a tree was bird or mammal dispersed and the interaction between these two factors. While our study suggests that if not further disturbed by logging, drainage and/or fire, degraded PSF could regenerate naturally to a similar species diversity as intact PSF, the lower levels of natural regeneration further away from the forest may warrant selective planting of species which do not disperse over long distances. More study is needed on the factors facilitating natural regeneration, whether it leads to restoration of PSF ecosystem functioning and the role of Acacia as a potential regeneration catalyst. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Forest buffer and Indonesia and Natural forest regeneration and Peat swamp forest and Restoration and Biodiversity and Birds and Conservation and Ecology and Harvesting and Land Use and Indonesia and Acacia and Acacia crassicarpa and Aves and Filicophyta and Mammalia and Biodiversity and Birds and Conservation and Ecology and Harvesting and Image reconstruction and Land use and Mammals and Peat and Restoration and Tropics and Wetlands and Ecosystem functioning and Forest buffer and Global carbon emission and Indonesia and Land use and land cover and Natural forest regenerations and Natural regeneration and Peat swamp forests and biodiversity and bird and dicotyledon and dispersal and disturbance and forest edge and land cover and land use and mammal and peatland and restoration ecology and species diversity and swamp forest and wetland and Reforestation,10.1016/j.foreco.2020.117868,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078985594&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2020.117868&partnerID=40&md5=8a618c4090e14b28f30de0e626102248,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 27,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,APR 1,0378-1127 and 1872-7042,WOS:000518873600025,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2044, 5137"

Implementing agroforestry systems through a landscape approach has a strong potential for integrating nature conservation objectives into agricultural systems. A key challenge for implementing the landscape approach is that political processes and conservation initiatives operate in ‘silos’, being largely disconnected from farmers and local key agents responsible for tree governance. In this study we brought together different stakeholders in facilitated, structured focus discussions to analyse the role of actor groups in tree governance. We used social network analysis to quantitatively and qualitatively analyse agroforestry governance networks and actor interactions related to information exchange, finance flows, and regulation. The analyses were conducted at national, sub-national and local levels in four countries: Honduras, Peru, Indonesia, and Uganda. Using trees on farms as a boundary object enabled all participants to bridge common interests and illuminate some of the constraints and opportunities of local governance systems while overcoming institutional and ideological barriers. The quantitative results of the social network analysis identify a strong density of actor linkages. Despite this density, results indicate incoherent and fragmented actor networks undermining the support for agroforestry on all levels. Nevertheless, existing processes related to finance, information, and regulation can be better aligned to ensure an effective implementation and mainstreaming of agroforestry for biodiversity conservation. Building social capital among key actors on both national and local levels can reveal a strong potential for adaptive learning processes mainstreaming agroforestry as essential component of “good farming” and integrating incentive systems for a coherent and effective agroforestry governance. We conclude that redirecting both public and private funding towards continuous seed-funding for the facilitation of these integrated learning processes can transform landscape management and at the same time reduce transaction costs. © 2020, The Author(s).",Adaptive capacity and Aichi target 7 and Biodiversity and Net-Map and Social capital and Social network analysis,10.1007/s11625-020-00840-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088835273&doi=10.1007%2fs11625-020-00840-8&partnerID=40&md5=4725ed005fbbcce0ba41c46002317542,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 47,NA,JOUR,5,1417,1434,NA,SEP,1862-4065 and 1862-4057,WOS:000557335500001,AUG 2020,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2050, 4925"

Mating was mainly through outcrossing (0.97–1.0), but some crossing occurred among related trees (0.02–0.16) and were correlated (rpm = 0.06–0.22), indicating a mean effective number of pollen donors ranging from 4.5 to 18.2. Pollen dispersal distances reached 3905 m (mean of 1472 m), and mean effective pollination neighbor area of 792 ha. The effective population size (Ne) within family (2.73) was lower than expected for random mating populations. The number of trees (m) required for seed collection was estimated at 55 non-inbreed and not related trees to each other. The core collection consisted of 42 (50.6%) adults across the area. These individuals should be included in seed collection as they represent 100% of the total detected genetic diversity. The inclusion of S. macrophylla on the list of species available for exploitation is not indicated, because the species requires cross breeding for its maintenance and logging reduce the Ne and may negatively impact the pattern of genetic diversity. These will significantly increase the risk of genetic erosion and population extinction due to a lack of adaptive ability. Adults serve as pollen donors that ecologically and genetically contribute to the maintenance of gene flow and Ne. Because it is recognized as a threatened species worldwide, and due to the fact that in areas of natural occurrence the species presents low-density and shows difficulty establishing natural regeneration, we recommend that S. macrophylla be protected from selective logging. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Conservation genetics and Forest logging and Mahogany and Microsatellite loci and Spatial genetic structure and Tropical tree and Biodiversity and Collection and Conservation and Management and Pollen and Reforestation and Swietenia and Trees and Acre and Amazon River and Brazil and Swietenia and Swietenia macrophylla and Auxiliary power systems and Biodiversity and Conservation and Population statistics and Conceptual frameworks and Diameter-at-breast heights and Effective population size and Mahogany and Management strategies and Microsatellite loci and Spatial genetic structure and Tropical tree and conceptual framework and conservation status and dispersal and effective population size and gene flow and genetic structure and genetic variation and heterozygosity and outcrossing and population size and seed collection and Reforestation,10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118040,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081649106&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2020.118040&partnerID=40&md5=81fafe6e984b108d46be045a46482956,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 14,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2051

However, the progress has been slow and the plan cannot succeed without sustained social supports and political will. Although many previous studies argued for the need to see ecological restoration in socio-economic contexts, empirical assessments have been lacking for how restoration is operationalized on the ground. We interviewed 47 key informants involved in four different projects in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, and assessed their definitions, goals, and practices of peatland restoration. Most of the actors we interviewed defined peatland restoration primarily in an ecological context following the global concept of ecological restoration. However, all four restoration projects were designed without determining reference and trajectory conditions. Their intermediate goals and practices were more focused on engaging local communities and developing sustainable livelihood options than improving the ecological conditions of peatlands. To be internally consistent, peatland restoration needs to recognize a social dimension in its process, as well as in its goal. Setting clear trajectory conditions is also important to clarify achievable goals and measurable intermediate outcomes. We propose the following definition of peatland restoration: a process of assisting the recovery of degraded peatland ecosystems to achieve the appropriate trajectories defined through multi-stakeholder collaboration within social-ecological contexts. We hope to generate healthy debates to further refine the definition that encompasses both social and ecological dimensions to generate broader support for sustaining and expanding peatland restoration projects in Indonesia. © 2020 Society for Ecological Restoration",ecological restoration and Indonesia and peatland and peatland fires and peatland restoration and tropical developing country and Borneo and Indonesia and Kalimantan and developing world and greenhouse gas and peatland and restoration ecology and stakeholder and sustainability and sustainable development,10.1111/rec.13097,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077856681&doi=10.1111%2frec.13097&partnerID=40&md5=fbd3319fe683eae8717090db245c19e7,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 33,NA,JOUR,2,435,446,NA,MAR,1061-2971 and 1526-100X,WOS:000506651800001,JAN 2020,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2056, 5046"

But does that always happen? We monitored the tree layer, seed rain, and regenerating layer of 10-year and 20-year-old forests under restoration in southeast Brazil to verify if planted exotic trees were behaving as invasive; if they were influencing the species richness and abundance of regenerating native plants; and the probabilities of exotic trees perpetuating over time. Data from the three forest components (trees, seed rain, and regenerating) were collected in 12 permanent plots of 100 m2 each in each study area. Collected data were analyzed through generalized linear models (GLM) and Markov chains. We verified that exotic species were not behaving as invasive species. Of the five species planted, Acacia mangium, Syzygium cumini, and Psidium guajava were dispersing seeds but recruiting only six new individuals. In general, the species richness and abundance of exotic trees were not related to the richness and abundance of regenerating native plants. In addition, the chances of individuals’ transition between forest components were in most cases nil, so that exotic species should continue not to spread in the 10- and 20-year-old forests. We assume that biotic resistance was occurring in the assembled communities and this prevented exotic trees from behaving as invaders. Monitoring of forest components helped to better understand the role of non-native species in the dynamics of these novel ecosystems. Monitoring also indicated that not all recovering forests need management actions against exotic trees after a decade or two of restoration. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Biological invasion and Biotic resistance and Ecological indicators and Regenerating plants and Seed rain and Tree layer and Brazil and Ecosystem and Environmental Monitoring and Forests and Introduced Species and Brazil and Acacia mangium and Psidium guajava and Syzygium cumini and Conservation and Ecosystems and Markov chains and Rain and Restoration and Biotic resistance and Ecological restoration and Exotic tree species and Generalized linear model and Non-native species and Novel ecosystems and Southeast Brazil and Species richness and abundance and biomonitoring and forest dynamics and invasive species and native species and restoration ecology and species richness and tree and Acacia mangium and adult and article and clinical article and exotic species and female and forest and guava and human and human experiment and introduced species and invasive species and male and Markov chain and nonhuman and plant seed and species invasion and species richness and Syzygium cumini and Brazil and ecosystem and environmental monitoring and forest and Reforestation,10.1007/s10661-020-08583-w,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090165135&doi=10.1007%2fs10661-020-08583-w&partnerID=40&md5=b61129eb5732d5a939640b073537e1d3,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 4,NA,JOUR,10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2062

Not only is a large proportion of the aboveground diversity lost, but the belowground soil microbiome, which is important for the sustainability of soil function, is massively altered. Intermixing oil palms with native tree species promotes vegetation biodiversity and stand structural complexity in plantations, but the impact on soil fungi remains unknown. Here, we analyzed the diversity and community composition of soil fungi three years after tree diversity enrichment in an oil palm plantation in Sumatra (Indonesia). We tested the effects of tree diversity, stand structural complexity indices, and soil abiotic conditions on the diversity and community composition of soil fungi. We hypothesized that the enrichment experiment alters the taxonomic and functional community composition, promoting soil fungal diversity. Fungal community composition was affected by soil abiotic conditions (pH, N, and P), but not by tree diversity and stand structural complexity indices. These results suggest that intensive land use and abiotic filters are a legacy to fungal communities, overshadowing the structuring effects of the vegetation, at least in the initial years after enrichment plantings. © 2020 by the authors.

Many modelling approaches have been employed to simulate tropical grasses growth, but these have several limitations that must be solved by adapting them or creating new models. This study aimed to develop a tropical pasture model in the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) modelling framework, and to parameterise it to simulate Brachiaria brizantha ‘BRS Piatã’ growth, under grazing and cut-and-carry management. For this, three field experiments were conducted in the South-east of Brazil where pasture growth was measured in a cut-and-carry system, with irrigated and rainfed treatments, and in a rainfed grazing system. Model evaluation was performed through precision and accuracy indices and simulation errors. Under cut-and-carry management, forage productivity was estimated with R2 values from 0.89 to 0.94, Willmott agreement indices between 0.97 and 0.98, and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values of 0.88 to up to 0.92. This demonstrates the capacity of the APSIM-Tropical Pasture model to simulate tropical pastures. Simulation of phenology, early growth after sowing, partitioning and senescence during flowering, and reallocation and retranslocation of plant dry matter and nitrogen were important aspects for this capacity. Then, APSIM-Tropical Pasture can be used to simulate tropical pastures, but several requirements for further improvements have been identified, such as to improve the simulations of flowering for palisade grass, N effects on pasture yield, reallocation and retranslocation processes. Under grazing management, forage productivity was estimated with R2 = 0.80, Willmott agreement index of 0.91, and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency value of 0.62. Despite these reasonable results, simulations presented problems, since does not take into account the effect of grazing animals on pastures. This indicates that, in its current form, APSIM-Tropical Pasture is not able to simulate pastures under grazing effectively. However, this simulation of grazed system was important to identify main modelling constraints and direct future research to improve knowledge of processes and interactions needed for pasture model development. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",BRS Piatã cultivar and C<sub>4</sub> grass and Cut-and-carry and Forage and Grazing and Modelling and Brazil and Animalia and Bovine respiratory syncytial virus and Poaceae and Urochloa brizantha and accuracy assessment and dry matter and flowering and forage and grass and grazing and nitrogen and parameterization and pasture and precision and senescence,10.1016/j.agsy.2020.102917,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088928575&doi=10.1016%2fj.agsy.2020.102917&partnerID=40&md5=4fffbca58bf9bb453fd48a4bb4b2b19c,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 27,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,SEP,0308-521X and 1873-2267,WOS:000564756600016,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2066, 5295"

Using facilitation practices for natural regeneration of these areas aims to promote forest restoration by creating safe sites in the seedbed. This study aimed to assess the efficiency of brushwood and artificial perch as techniques to improve native plant establishment in an area covered by the inhibitory grasses of Urochloa. Field work was conducted between February 2014 and February 2016, in an area of lowland Atlantic rainforest in Morretes-PR. A set of 12 8 m × 5 m plots were established, corresponding to three treatments and four replicates, organized according to randomized block and split-plot design. The treatments were: brushwood, brushwood + artificial perch and control treatment. Evaluations were conducted at 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 months after the experiment was installed by counting and identifying regenerating woody species and visually estimating cover percentage of herbs and subshrubs species. Brushwood treatments with and without perch initially reduced Urochloa grasses; however, over time the initial effects ceased due to the rapid growth of grass at plot edges. Likewise, perches in this treatment did not increase native/woody species.

Within the SE Asia region, areas of deeper peat present the greatest carbon stocks, and therefore the greatest potential for future carbon emissions from degradation and fire. They also support most of the remaining lowland swamp forest and its associated biodiversity. Accurate maps of deep peat are central to providing correct estimates of peat carbon stocks and to facilitating appropriate management interventions. We present a rapid and cost-effective approach to peat thickness mapping in raised peat bogs that applies a model of peat bottom elevation based on field measurements subtracted from a surface elevation model created from airborne LiDAR data. Results: In two raised peat bog test areas in Indonesia, we find that field peat thickness measurements correlate well with surface elevation derived from airborne LiDAR based DTMs (R2 0.83-0.88), confirming that the peat bottom is often relatively flat. On this basis, we created a map of extent and depth of deep peat (> 3 m) from a new DTM that covers two-thirds of Sumatran peatlands, applying a flat peat bottom of 0.61 m +MSL determined from the average of 2446 field measurements. A deep peat area coverage of 2.6 Mha or 60.1% of the total peat area in eastern Sumatra is mapped, suggesting that deep peat in this region is more common than shallow peat and its extent was underestimated in earlier maps. The associated deep peat carbon stock range is 9.0-11.5 Pg C in eastern Sumatra alone. Conclusion: We discuss how the deep peat map may be used to identify priority areas for peat and forest conservation and thereby help prevent major potential future carbon emissions and support the safeguarding of the remaining forest and biodiversity. We propose rapid application of this method to other coastal raised bog peatland areas in SE Asia in support of improved peatland zoning and management. We demonstrate that the upcoming global ICESat-2 and GEDI satellite LiDAR coverage will likely result in a global DTM that, within a few years, will be sufficiently accurate for this application. © 2020 The Author(s).",Below-ground carbon stock and ICESat-2 DTM and LiDAR and Lowland and Peat and Peat thickness and Sumatra and Greater Sunda Islands and Sumatra and Sunda Isles and biodiversity and carbon emission and carbon sequestration and climate change and conservation status and field method and hydrocarbon exploration and ICESat and lidar and mapping method and peat and peatland,10.1186/s13021-020-00139-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082313398&doi=10.1186%2fs13021-020-00139-2&partnerID=40&md5=c47db14ee2d1dfca37d484b9d59dcb1a,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 26,NA,JOUR,1,NA,NA,NA,MAR 23,1750-0680,WOS:000522191200001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2070, 5203"

Recent studies found that significant logging residues (LR) (i.e. leaves, branches, and buttress roots) suitable for bioenergy production were often left in the felling area, triggering risks of forest fires and increased CO2 emissions due to wildfires or decomposition processes. For impact assessment of forest management practices, we collected primary harvesting data and estimated net primary productivity (NPP) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) for 13 forest plots in the Brazilian Amazon. We applied a process-based forestry growth model (BGC-Man) to analyze the impacts on forest dynamics of selective logging and removal of LR, subject to landscape, soil texture, and daily weather. We explored the following selective logging scenarios: the Legal Reserve (i.e. reference) scenario, a scenario with one cutting cycle over the whole period, and a scenario with three timber rotation periods of 30 yr. Two of the later scenarios were complemented with harvesting of the woody LR (Ø 10 cm) for charcoal production. For each scenario, we computed forest NPP and NEE over a 120 yr time horizon. Results suggest that using woody LR (i.e. 77% of total LR) for charcoal production would result in an economic gain equivalent to 24%–46% of the timber price. Our findings indicate that under scenarios where LR were removed, forest NPP recovered to the reference level and even higher, while income and jobs from harvesting LR for charcoal production were generated.

Reforestation on at least 43% (∼369 million ha) of reforestable area was predicted to potentially benefit threatened vertebrates. This is approximately 15% of the total area where threatened vertebrates occur. The greatest opportunities for conserving threatened vertebrate species are in the tropics, particularly Brazil and Indonesia. Although reforestation is not a substitute for forest conservation, and most of the area containing threatened vertebrates remains forested, our results highlight the need for global conservation strategies to recognize the potentially significant contribution that reforestation could make to biodiversity conservation.

C stocks in forests are decreased by logging before tree diversity is affected, while C stocks in monoculture tree plantations increase, but diversity does not. Agroforestry can break this hysteresis pattern, relevant for policies in search of synergy. We compared total C stocks and tree diversity among degraded forest, complex cacao/fruit tree agroforests, simple shade-tree cacao agroforestry, monoculture cacao, and annual crops in the Konawe District, Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. We evaluated farmer tree preferences and the utility value of the system for 40 farmers (male and female). The highest tree diversity (Shannon-Wiener H index 2.36) and C stocks (282 Mg C ha-1) were found in degraded forest, followed by cacao-based agroforestry systems (H index ranged from 0.58-0.93 with C stocks of 75-89 Mg ha-1). Male farmers selected timber and fruit tree species with economic benefits as shade trees, while female farmers preferred production for household needs (fruit trees and vegetables).

We surveyed three different pasture areas under SPSnuclei: shaded area around the nuclei (SAN), unshaded area around the nuclei (UAN), and all-day sunny area distant from the nuclei (SDN). In each area, the microclimatic variables were measured—air temperature (°C), relative humidity (%), illuminance (lux), wind speed (m/s), and soil surface temperature (°C). In addition, the diurnal behaviors of 39 Jersey dairy cows were evaluated. Grazing, standing rest, lying rest, standing rumination, and lying rumination were registered by scans every 10 min; drinking water was observed continuously. Microclimate differed (p < 0.05) among the SPSnuclei areas. Areas around the nuclei provided better conditions of air temperature (SAN, 31.05 °C; UAN, 31.92 °C; SDN, 33.39 °C), illuminance (SAN, 5665 lx; UAN, 61,065 lx; SDN, 75,380 lx), and soil surface temperature (SAN, 27.35 °C; UAN, 32.38 °C; SDN, 35.87 °C). The frequency of use of each SPSnuclei area by dairy cows was different (p < 0.01); the highest frequencies of the grazing (SAN, 12.6%; UAN, 4.8%; SDN, 11.1%), rumination (SAN, 21.7%; UAN, 3.1%; SDN, 1.9%), and rest (SAN, 35.6%; UAN, 5.4%; SDN, 3.7%) were registered in the areas around the nuclei.

Besides, post-planting maintenance is often neglected hampering seedling survival over time owing to alien grasses, which compete strongly with native plants for resources. To solve these issues, recently, an innovative technology called Nucleário has been developed in Brazil. Aiming to hinder alien competition filters, the Nucleário also attempts to condition a better microenvironment, reducing drought stress through the water storage tank, decreasing temperatures, which facilitates the survival and growth of seedlings in areas under restoration. Another method used to decrease alien grasses, which is inexpensive, is seedling crowning using cardboard lowing maintenance needs in restored areas. Cardboard has similar functions to Nucleário, such as protecting soil against loss of water and nutrients and reducing competition with invasive exotic grasses. Therefore, comparing them also with traditional manual weeding (i.e., clean-weeded crown by hoe), we aimed to verify which technique is most cost-efficient for seedling crown maintenance of Dipteryx alata Vog., which is an indigenous tree species with high economic value owing to its nuts. We tested three techniques in areas under restoration in the Cerrado, in the Environmental Protection Area “Córrego Guariroba” located in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. We monitored seedlings submitted to the three methods in the wet and the dry periods for biotic (competition with exotic grasses, herbivory, and growth) and abiotic (moisture and soil temperature) indicators. We observed that the Nucleário was the treatment that maintained the highest soil moisture, resulting in a larger canopy area. However, these effects do not reflect increases in the survival rate, diameter, and height of the seedlings. None of the treatments was effective in reducing herbivory. Nucleário was the most effective treatment in reducing the competition of seedlings with invasive grasses. Cardboard presented an implementation value 21.5 times lower than Nucleário and 1.2 times than manual crowning. Given the high purchase price, the Nucleário's cost-benefit ratio was very high compared to the crowning of cardboard and the manual weeding, which discourages us from recommending it for this species with high survival rates. Its project can be revised to decrease herbivory rates, as well as its efficiency tested in the short and long term in different ecosystems and species, particularly species susceptible to water stress. © 2020",Dipteryx alata and ecological engineering and intervention ecology and maintenance in reforestation and restoration ecology and weed competition and Brazil and Cost-Benefit Analysis and Ecosystem and Seedlings and Trees and Brazil and Campo Grande and Mato Grosso do Sul and Dipteryx alata and Poaceae and cerrado and drought stress and grass and growth and introduced species and maintenance and restoration ecology and seedling establishment and tree and wood and abiotic stress and Article and biotic stress and canopy and cardboard technique and controlled study and cost benefit analysis and cost effectiveness analysis and Dipteryx and Dipteryx alata and drought stress and environmental economics and environmental protection and forestry and herbivory and intermethod comparison and invasive species and manual crowning and Mato Grosso do Sul and microenvironment and native species and nonhuman and nucleario and organismal interaction and Paspalum notatum and plant growth and plant height and reforestation and scrub and seed size and seedling and seedling establishment and soil moisture and soil temperature and survival and survival rate and Urochloa decumbens and water supply and weed control and Brazil and ecosystem and seedling and tree,10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110900,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086439246&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2020.110900&partnerID=40&md5=95831cd2e3ed6a11d6fd1743c03a67a8,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 5,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,SEP 15,0301-4797 and 1095-8630,WOS:000554920300080,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2078, 5143"

Declining water quality has become an increasingly more significant global concern as economic activities and human populations expand and climate change markedly alters hydrological cycles. Changes in land-use/land-cover (LULC) pattern have been recognized as a major driver of water quality degradation, however different LULC types and intensities affect water quality in different ways. In addition, the relationships between LULC and water quality may differ for different spatial and temporal scales. The increase in deforestation, agricultural expansion, and urban sprawl in Brazil highlights the need for water quality protection to ensure immediate human needs and to maintain the quality of water supplies in the long-term. Thus, this manuscript provides an overview of the relationships between LULC and water quality in Brazil, aiming at understanding the effects of different LULC types on water quality, how spatial and temporal scales contribute to these effects, and how such knowledge can improve watershed management and future projections. In general, agriculture and urban areas are the main LULCs responsible for water quality degradation in Brazil. However, although representing a small percentage of the territory, mining has a high impact on water quality. Water quality variables respond differently at different spatial scales, so spatial extent is an important aspect to be considered in studies and management. LULC impacts on water quality also vary seasonally and lag effects mean they take time to occur. Forest restoration can improve water quality and multicriteria evaluation has been applied to identify priority areas for forest restoration and conservation aiming at protecting water quality, but both need further exploration. Watershed modelling has been applied to simulate future impacts of LULC change on water quality, but data availability must be improved to increase the number, locations and duration of studies. Because of the international nature of watersheds and the consistent relationships between land use and water quality in Brazil, we believe our results will also aid water management in other countries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",ecosystem services and forest conservation and land use pattern and water pollution and watershed management and watershed modelling and Agriculture and Brazil and Conservation of Natural Resources and Environmental Monitoring and Forests and Humans and Water Quality and Brazil and Climate change and Deforestation and Economics and Ecosystems and Land use and Restoration and Soil conservation and Water conservation and Water management and Water pollution and Water supply and Watersheds and Ecosystem services and Forest conservation and Forest restoration and Land use pattern and Land use/land cover and Land-cover types and Spatial and temporal scale and Water quality degradation and Watershed modelling and Watersheds management and anthropogenic effect and assessment method and climate change and future prospect and hydrological cycle and land cover and land use and spatiotemporal analysis and water management and water quality and agriculture and Brazil and deforestation and degradation and ecosystem regeneration and environmental planning and forestry and human and human needs and land use and mining and nonhuman and pasture and Review and seasonal variation and urban area and urbanization and water quality and water supply and watershed management and environmental monitoring and environmental protection and forest and Water quality,10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110879,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086447899&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2020.110879&partnerID=40&md5=31d8d2f9ba56215018ff73bf026a4be8,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 226,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,SEP 15,0301-4797 and 1095-8630,WOS:000554920300063,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2079, 4407"

Yet, a majority of Brazilian coffee farms are operated by ‘smallholders’, producers with relatively small properties and primarily reliant on family labor. While previous work indicates that climate change will decrease the area suitable for coffee production in Brazil, no study has assessed the impacts of climate change on coffee yields or the relative exposure and vulnerability of coffee producing regions to changes in climate hazards (climate-associated losses in yield). To address these knowledge gaps, we assess the sensitivity of coffee yields to temperature and precipitation variation from 1974 to 2017 to map coffee climate hazards. Next, we identify which coffee producing regions in Brazil have the highest exposure to climate hazards due to high dependence of coffee production as a proportion of agricultural area. Finally, we generate a Vulnerability Index to identify which regions are theoretically least able to adapt to climate hazards. Our study finds that since 1974, temperatures in Brazilian coffee growing municipalities have been increasing by ~0.25 ◦C per decade and annual precipitation has been decreasing during the blooming and ripening periods. This historical climate change has already resulted in reductions in coffee yield by more than 20% in the Southeast of Brazil. Minas Gerais, the largest coffee producing state in Brazil, has among the highest climate hazard and overall climate risk, exacerbated by ongoing coffee expansion. Additionally, many municipalities with the lowest adaptive capacity, including the country’s mountainous regions, also have high climate exposure and hazards. Negative climate hazard and exposure impacts for coffee producing regions could be potentially offset by targeting climate adaptation support to these high-risk regions, including research, extension, and credit subsidies for improved coffee varieties, irrigation, and agroforestry and diversifying agricultural production. © 2020 The Author(s).

Among various fauna, the Javan slow loris (Nycticebus javanicus), a critically endangered species, can survive in this agroforestry system. The use of spatial method on shade-grown coffee agroforestry seems unusual. We aim to investigate the utilization of tree and other vegetation by Javan slow lorises in a shade-grown coffee agroforestry ecosystem in Kemuning Forest. We followed two individuals (male and female) of slow lorises from December 2018 until May 2019 using radio collar. We recorded both vertical and horizontal positions of each individual based on their position on trees at two spatial dimensions (vertical and horizontal). To explore whether lorises select certain tree species, we laid 275 plots (2020m) in their habitat and using Chi-square test for the analysis. Our findings show that both male and female of Javan slow loris in shade-grown coffee agroforestry use different forest stratum for their activity. The female used 42.11% of their time to do exploratory activity in the outer part of the canopy, regardless the vertical position, and 43.76% in the middle part (vertical position) and the outer part (horizontal position) of the canopy. While the male mostly uses the inner part of the canopy (52.57%) and upper part of the canopy for feeding activity (64.37%). Both male (Chi-square test = 264.05, p < 0.05) and female (Chi-square test = 357.35, p < 0.05) lorises select tree species for their behavior. We provide here evidence of biodiversity conservation services by shade-grown coffee agroforestry practices in Indonesia. The intensity of coffee management under tropical trees seems does not impact significantly to the presence and behavior of slow loris, however precautionary measures to reduce poaching should be done as this endangered species threatened by illegal activity.

The first is to present a spatially explicit decision-support tool for mapping Forest Restoration Vocation (FRV) that includes socio-economic and institutional aspects in forest landscape restoration. The second is to discuss the ways in which the FRV has been applied in the Brazilian decision-making context. The FRV was used to prioritize areas for three different restoration modalities: assisted natural regeneration (passive restoration), forest plantation with native trees to conserve biodiversity and forest plantation for agroforestry systems (active restoration). The FRV is already being adopted as a planning tool to invest R$ 1.2 billion (approx. US$ 300 million) to restore 40,000 ha in the Rio Doce, Brazil—an area corresponding to 0.05% of the area of watershed. Due to the high level of degradation of the basin, there is a need to restore 1.6 Mha via forest plantations in riparian Areas of Permanent Preservation (APPs) while 30% of APPs can be effectively restored using natural regeneration. The FRV can be effective for gauging progress and monitoring forest restoration implementation metrics across the landscape and through time.

Today it covers about 142,400 ha in Brazil, with plantations concentrated in the southern region of the country. Black wattle may form nodules and establish rhizobial symbiosis capable of fixing N2, but rhizobial inoculation is not done in commercial plantations. About 40 kg ha−1 of urea is applied during seedling transplantation. In this review, evidences by which rhizobial inoculation affects monoculture, mixed cultivation, and agroforestry black wattle production systems were searched in literature. Previous measurements in cultivated forests have indicated that biological nitrogen fixation in black wattle may provide up to 200 kg of N ha−1 year−1 to the soil. Therefore, rhizobia inoculation may bring several opportunities to improve black wattle production systems. Black wattle is not a very selective partner in the rhizobial symbiosis, but the genus Bradyrhizobium dominates the rhizobial diversity of black wattle nodules. Investigation on rhizobial diversity in soils where the crop is cultivated may represent an opportunity to find more effective rhizobia strains for inoculants.

Amphibians are one of the most threatened and poorly known groups of vertebrates in several geographic areas, even though they play a central role in their own ecosystems. At different levels, amphibians make their contribution to proper ecosystem functioning. They act as regulators of the food web and nutrient cycling, and they also provide several valuable ecosystem services, e.g., as a food source and as animal models for lab research. In this sense, it seems clear that the maintenance of amphibian diversity should be one of the major goals for the several countries where their population decline is observed. However, we are still struggling with the very first step of this process, i.e., the correct identification of the amphibian species diversity. Over the past few decades, research on molecular identification of amphibians using DNA barcoding has encountered some difficulties related to high variability in the mitochondrial genome of amphibians, and a research gap is noticeable in the literature. We herein evaluated both COI and 16S rRNA mitochondrial genes for the molecular identification of frogs and tadpoles in a large fragment of the South American Atlantic Rainforest in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Our results suggest that both COI and 16S rRNA are informative markers for the molecular identification of the amphibian specimens with all specimens unambiguously identified at the species level. We also made publicly available 12 new sequences of Atlantic Rainforest amphibian species for the first time, and we discussed some conservation issues related to amphibians within the Atlantic Rainforest domains in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. © 2019 Amaral et al.

To fill this gap, we sampled Acrisols down to 3 m under three different land use systems; namely, recent cacao agroforestry (<2 years old; not deeper than 1 m), young and old rubber gardens (<10 years and >50 years), and secondary forest (>50 years) all located in Kapuas Hulu regency, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. We then assessed soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks as well as C accumulated in above- and belowground biomass, litter and dead wood debris at the soil surface. The amount of C stored in soils to a depth of 1 m exceeded the amount stored in living biomass (Σ C stored in roots, understorey and overstorey) strongly in the cacao agroforestry systems (69 Mg SOC vs. 12 Mg biomass-C ha− 1), slightly in young rubber gardens (85 Mg SOC vs. 69 Mg C ha− 1), but not in old rubber gardens (87 Mg SOC vs. 200 Mg C ha− 1) and secondary forests (65 Mg SOC vs. 138 Mg C ha− 1). Additionally in the older systems, up to 140 Mg C ha− 1 (old rubber gardens) and 116 Mg C ha− 1 (secondary forest) were found in soils to a depth of 3 m, thus raising soil C stocks by 60 to 80% relative to C stored in upper soil (0 to 1 m). We conclude that (1) the form of land use and land use change can substantially affect C stocks in living biomass, with aboveground biomass in old rubber gardens comparable to that of secondary forests; and (2) that land use change can reduce SOC in topsoil, but that substantial C stocks found in deep (down to 3 m) subsoil remain stable. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Agroforestry and Biomass and Cacao and Indonesia and Rubber garden and Secondary forest and Borneo and Indonesia and Kalimantan and Theobroma cacao and Biomass and Land use and Magnesium and Organic carbon and Rubber and Soils and Tropics and Above ground biomass and Agroforestry and Agroforestry system and Belowground biomass and Cacao and Indonesia and Secondary forests and Soil organic carbon and agroforestry and biomass and carbon sequestration and forest soil and garden and land use change and lowland environment and secondary forest and seed and soil carbon and tropical environment and Forestry,10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.07.022,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069615415&doi=10.1016%2fj.geoderma.2019.07.022&partnerID=40&md5=69587dae34b2656b13dc9646534043b7,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 25,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2104

In this article, we explore the current conditions and progress of forest restoration in Gunung Palung National Park in Indonesian Borneo. The aim of this research was to review forest restoration projects and their success in the park, and to analyse lessons learned from those projects. From 2009 till 2018, nearly 5000 ha of damaged forest in Gunung Palung National Park were replanted, but with only a 1% restoration success rate. The main reason for failed restoration is wildfire. We found four issues that should be resolved in forest restoration projects: fire management, weed management, cost calculation and defining an appropriate restoration strategy. Restoration projects in the park have estimated the price per seedling at around USD0.36 to USD0.78 for one year. We proposed a revised price per seedling of USD1 for the first year, with an additional 10 cents per year for the following three years, to account for maintenance and labour costs. One-time projects that focus only on planting are likely to fail, especially without fire prevention management. Successful forest restoration projects should do more than simply planting trees by also including care and maintenance after they are planted. With this in mind, we provide a standardised framework to guide decision-making and successful forest restoration.

Although grazing exclusion has been studied elsewhere, the consequences of alleviating the disturbance regime in grassland ecosystems remain unclear. In this paper, we present results of the first five years of an experiment in native grasslands of southern Brazil. Using a randomized block experimental design, we examined the effects of three grazing treatments on plant and arthropod communities: (i) deferred grazing (i.e., intermittent grazing), (ii) grazing exclusion and (iii) a control under traditional continuous grazing, which were applied to 70 x 70 m experimental plots, in six regionally distributed blocks. We evaluated plant community responses regarding taxonomic and functional diversity (life-forms) in separate spatial components: alpha (1 x 1 m subplots), beta, and gamma (70 x 70 m plots), as well as the cascading effects on arthropod high-taxa. By estimating effect sizes (treatments vs. control) by bootstrap resampling, both deferred grazing and grazing exclusion mostly increased vegetation height, plant biomass and standing dead biomass. The effect of grazing exclusion on plant taxonomic diversity was negative. Conversely, deferred grazing increased plant taxonomic diversity, but both treatments reduced plant functional diversity. Reduced grazing pressure in both treatments promoted the break of dominance by prostrate species, followed by fast homogenization of vegetation structure towards dominance of ligneous and erect species. These changes in the plant community led to increases in high-taxa richness and abundance of vegetation-dwelling arthropod groups under both treatments, but had no detectable effects on epigeic arthropods. Our results indicate that decision-making regarding the conservation of southern Brazil grasslands should include both intensive and alleviated levels of grazing management, but not complete grazing exclusion, to maximize conservation results when considering plant and arthropod communities. © 2020 Ferreira et al.

Nonetheless, intensified straw removal may aggravate the effects of mechanized harvesting and increase the risks of soil compaction, declining sugarcane yield. An experiment was designed, and four field studies were conducted to evaluate the cumulative effects of straw removal on soil physical attributes (bulk density, BD; soil resistance to penetration, SRP; macroporosity, MaP; microporosity, MiP, and mean weight diameter of soil aggregates, MWD) and their relationship with crop yield under clayey and sandy soils in the São Paulo state, Brazil. In each field study, four straw removal rates (no removal, NR; low removal, LR, removal of 5 Mg ha−1; high removal, HR, removal of 10 Mg ha−1; and total removal, TR, removal of 15 Mg ha−1) were arranged in a randomized block design with four replicates. The 4-year intensive management of straw removal (HR and TR) resulted in an increased soil compaction (BD and SRP values) and reduced the MWD in both sandy and clayey soils. Our findings also showed that these effects are more significant in sandy soils, where soil carbon content was substantially reduced in HR and TR treatments. Sites with higher BD and SRP induced by straw removal were strongly associated with lower sugarcane yields, especially in sandy soils. Conversely, our findings indicate that LR was not detrimental to soil physical quality and sugarcane yield. Nevertheless, considering the multifunctionality of straw in sustaining multiple ecosystem services in different soil types, straw management should be defined taking into consideration site-specific conditions. We advocate that recommendations for straw removal should also be combined with other conservationist soil management practices in order to minimize soil compaction and its negative implications on sugarcane yield and other ecosystem services. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Crop residues and Oxisols and Soil compaction and Soil resilience and Stalk yield and Agricultural wastes and Agronomy and Compaction and Crops and Ecosystems and Sand and Soil mechanics and Crop residue and Oxisols and Soil compaction and Soil resiliences and Stalk yield and Soils,10.1007/s12155-019-10000-1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068862294&doi=10.1007%2fs12155-019-10000-1&partnerID=40&md5=cc97dea4fc8c781246888e38e72bd819,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 55,NA,JOUR,4,789,800,NA,DEC,1939-1234 and 1939-1242,WOS:000502504300006,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2108, 4692"

Our main goal was to develop a robust habitat suitability model of Amazon-nut and to identify the most important predictor variables to support conservation and tree planting decisions. Localization: Amazon region, South America. Methods: We collected 3,325 unique Amazon-nut records and assembled >100 spatial predictor variables organized across climatic, edaphic, and geophysical categories. We compared suitability models using variables (a) selected through statistical techniques; (b) recommended by experts; and (c) integrating both approaches (a and b). We applied different spatial filtering scenarios to reduce overfitting. We additionally fine-tuned MAXENT settings to our data. The best model was selected through quantitative and qualitative assessments. Results: Principal component analysis based on expert recommendations was the most appropriate method for predictor selection. Elevation, coarse soil fragments, clay, slope, and annual potential evapotranspiration were the most important predictors. Their relative contribution to the best model amounted to 75%. Filtering of the presences within a radius of 10 km displayed lowest overfitting, a satisfactory omission rate and the most symmetric distribution curve. Our findings suggest that under current environmental conditions, suitable habitat for Amazon-nut is found across 2.3 million km2, that is, 32% of the Amazon Biome. Main conclusion: The combination of statistical techniques with expert knowledge improved the quality of our suitability model. Topographic and soil variables were the most important predictors.

The rural people derive multiple benefits from the highly diverse plants in their traditional gardens and the nearby natural forests. However, the conversion of natural forests and traditional gardens into monoculture plantations in many areas has reduced the plant diversity, which in turn has also reduced the botanical knowledge, especially among the younger generation. This study was conducted to know: (i) the diversity of plant species used by the people of Rejang tribe in Kota Agung Village, Kepahiang District, Bengkulu Province, Indonesia, (ii) the correlation between age and botanical knowledge, and (iii) the effect of gender on the botanical knowledge. Data were collected through interviews with five key informants and 68 villagers, and the data were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively using t-test and regression analyses. The results showed that the Rejang people in Kota Agung Village used 130 plant species for 12 different purposes. The three top use categories were food, medicine, and ornament. The botanical knowledge was positively correlated with age, and women had better botanical knowledge than men, presumably due to the longer time they spend in taking care of the homegardens.

Part of this has been the way that the forest controls regional climate including precipitation important for the ecosystem as well as agroforestry and farming. In addition, the Amazon also affects the global weather systems, so cutting down the rainforest significantly increases the effects of climate change, threatening the world's biodiversity and causing local desertification and soil erosion. The current fire activities and deforestation in the Amazon rainforest therefore have consequences for global sustainability. In the light of this, the current decisions made in Brazil regarding an increase in Amazon deforestation require policy changes if the global ecosystems and biodiversity are not to be set to collapse. There is only one way to move forward and that is to increase efforts in sustainable development of the region including limitation in deforestation and to continuously measure and monitor the development. The G7 countries have offered Brazil financial support for at least 20 million euros for fighting the forest fires but the president denies receiving such financial support and says that it is more relevant to raise new forests in Europe. In fact, this is exactly what is happening in Denmark and China in order to reduce climate change. Such activities should be global and include South America, Europe, Africa and Asia where deforestation is important issue. Forest restoration reduces climate change, desertification, and preserves both the regional tropical and global environment if the wood is not burned at a later stage but instead used in e.g. roads as filling material. Changes are therefore needed through improved international understanding and agreements to better avoid the global climate changes, from cutting down the precious rainforest before it is too late as rainforest cannot be re-planted. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Amazon and Carbon foot print and Climate change and Forest and Policy and Tree and Trophic and Africa and Asia and Brazil and China and Conservation of Natural Resources and Ecosystem and Europe and Humans and Rainforest and Trees and Tropical Climate and Africa and Asia and biodiversity and Brazil and China and climate and climate change and deforestation and Denmark and Europe and global climate and priority journal and rain forest and South America and sustainable development and tree and ecosystem and environmental protection and human and tropic climate,10.1016/j.envres.2019.108887,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075471661&doi=10.1016%2fj.envres.2019.108887&partnerID=40&md5=46272673d88d72f434740c7be9d4c3e5,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 20,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2120

Tree and herb species richness and tree density were positively associated with Oxisols, but negatively related to the proportion of native herbs. Species richness of herbs and density of seedlings decreased with time since rehabilitation, whereas species richness of woody plants increased. The proportion of native herbs and seedlings increased with stand age. We found few differences in soils between the planted stands and native forest. Our results demonstrated that successional vegetation of rehabilitated forests may play an important role in maintaining soil properties associated with soil order. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

2125,Scopus,Review,"Koutika, L.-S. and Richardson, D.M.",2019,Acacia mangium willd: Benefits and threats associated with its increasing use around the world,"Forest Ecosystems, FOREST ECOSYSTEMS",6,2,"Background: Acacia mangium, a fast-growing tree native to parts of Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Australia, has been cultivated outside its native environment and introduced into humid tropical lowland regions of Asia, South America and Africa over the last few decades. It is a multipurpose tree used in agroforestry, forestry and for restoration of degraded lands. It is also highly invasive in many regions where it has been introduced outside its native range. This paper reviews evidence of its obvious benefits and its negative impacts on biodiversity. Methods: A literature review on Australian acacias and especially on A. mangium was undertaken to highlight both benefits and threats associated with their increasing worldwide use outside their native ranges. Results: Through N2 fixed from the atmosphere, A. mangium improves soil fertility, especially by increasing N status and soil C accretion when introduced to N-limited areas; it thus has the potential to restore nutrient cycling in degraded systems. No studies have, however, been done to assess the effectiveness of A. mangium in restoring biodiversity of degraded lands. Most Australian acacias have traits that facilitate invasiveness, and 23 species have been recorded as invasive to date. A. mangium has been reported as invasive in Asia, Indonesia, Pacific Islands, Indian Ocean Islands, southern Africa and Brazil. Research on other invasive Australian acacias in several parts of the world has elucidated the types of impacts that are likely in different types of ecosystems and key options for mitigating impacts. Conclusions: A. mangium has the potential to restore nutrient cycling in degraded systems, but is highly invasive wherever it is planted. Many parts of the world have a large invasion debt for this species. Experience with other invasive acacias around the world suggests a suite of interventions that could be used to reduce invasions and mitigate impacts. Careful risk assessments should be undertaken prior to any new plantings of this species. © The Author(s). 2019.",Biodiversity and Biological invasions and C sequestration and Soil N status and Tree invasions,10.1186/s40663-019-0159-1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062603880&doi=10.1186%2fs40663-019-0159-1&partnerID=40&md5=fb7c7859ba5d919a2f44b229423dbeda,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 92,NA,JOUR,1,NA,NA,NA,JAN 29,2095-6355 and 2197-5620,WOS:000457319300001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2125, 3479"

We apply propensity score matching and regression to 81 beneficiary properties on 8848 ha and 398 control properties on 33,748 ha. We estimate the average treatment effect on the treated for changes in rates of reforestation and deforestation, and the resulting change in forest cover. Over the first 7 years of PAF (2010–2016), our results indicate that the project increased forest cover on participating properties by only 136 ha (95% confidence intervals of 8–265 hectares), or 1.5% relative to our estimate of the counterfactual scenario without PAF. Impacts on forest cover were caused mostly by reduced deforestation rather than reforestation. “Placebo” impact tests estimated using pre-intervention data indicate that our results are robust. The observed forest cover benefit came at the per-hectare cost of $32,963 ($16,917-$560,367) paid mostly with off-site mitigation funds.

Physical and chemical soils properties sustain supporting ecosystem services like plant production and the infiltration and provision of clean water. Carbon sequestration is a regulating ecosystem service important for climate regulation. Soils are also home of a large biodiversity whose participation in soil processes is critical for their sustainable use. Evaluating these functions to assess the provision of ecosystem services is an important challenge for which simple and accurate tools and methodologies are requested. In this work, the relationship of the soil macro-fauna with some soil-based ecosystem services was evaluated in three different regions of Colombia, Brazil and Nicaragua with rather contrasted conditions of soils and management options. In each country, we calculated a set of sub-indicators of physical quality, chemical fertility, organic matter accumulation, soil macro aggregation and macro-invertebrate communities abundance and diversity. The combination of these sub indicators in a General Indicator of Soil Quality (GISQ) provided an overall assessment of the quality of the soil and associated ecosystem services. The strong relationship observed between macrofauna indicators and soil physical, chemical and organic matter characteristics makes it a powerful tool for evaluating and monitoring soil quality. © 2019",Biodiversity and Indicators and Morphology and Soil quality and Brazil and Colombia and Nicaragua and Invertebrata and agricultural land and biodiversity and bioindicator and ecosystem service and physicochemical property and soil management and soil microorganism and soil organic matter and soil quality,10.1016/j.actao.2019.103446,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072345903&doi=10.1016%2fj.actao.2019.103446&partnerID=40&md5=b567473093b0824e5dc94096b576d54a,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 53,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2127

Monitoring biodiversity changes in areas under different management strategies is fundamental for species conservation. Our study is the first to assess the role of forest disturbance history on spider (Araneae) biodiversity in the westernmost portion of the Atlantic Forest. We analyzed taxonomic and functional aspects of spider assemblages in understories in a large forest fragment in southwestern Brazil. Spiders were sampled in five 30 m × 5 m plots over three seasons in three areas with different management histories: Clearcutting, selective logging, or native plots. We also characterized tree basal area, tree density, and canopy openness. The clear-cut plots showed more canopy openness and low habitat heterogeneity due to the high density of one pioneer native tree species. Forest structure in selective logging and native plots was similar. Spider richness, abundance, and functional richness were affected only by the season. Species composition also differed among the areas depending on the season. The abundance of web-building species was mainly associated with clear-cut areas in winter and spring. These results highlight the importance of natural regeneration in the Atlantic Forest after disturbance for the conservation of regional spider biodiversity. © 2020, Canadian Science Publishing.

Particularly, there are high expectations that the enforcement of the Brazilian Forest Code (BFC) will drive large-scale forest recovery and carbon mitigation. In this study, we quantified the potential role that ongoing forest regeneration may play in offsetting deficits from private properties with less vegetation cover than determined by the BFC, considering different law implementation settings. Focusing on the Amazon Biome, we overlaid property level data from a mandatory registry (≈ 250,000 properties) onto land cover maps to quantify on-site forest deficit offsets by ongoing forest recovery. Similarly, we estimated the share of regrowing forests in private properties potentially eligible for off-site deficit compensation (i.e. via market-based forest certificates trade). Regrowing forests could reduce, on-site, 3.2 Mha of forests deficits, decreasing non-compliance from private properties by 35%. Likewise, forest certificates availability increased by 3.4 Mha when we included regrowing forests in the calculations. This means an increase in the forest certificate offer-demand ratio from 0.9 to 2.0. On the one hand, trading certificates issued from recovering forests may represent a low-cost strategy for compliance with the BFC, a pathway for achieving restoration targets, and an additional source of income for landholders. To meet this potential, it is necessary to better conceptualize second-growth forests, advancing the poor definitions presented by the BFC, and offer an operational basis for their protection. On the other hand, including regrowing forests’ certificates in compensation schemes may further restrain the potential of the trading mechanism for conservation of unprotected old-growth forests and lead to positive net carbon emissions. We highlight that the BFC implementation must be carefully regulated to maximize synergies between compliance and forest resources conservation and enhancement. © 2019 The Authors",Additionality and Brazilian Forest Code and Forest carbon and Forest recovery and Governance and Offsetting and Amazonia and Brazil and carbon sequestration and compliance and forest management and forest resource and forestry policy and governance approach and old-growth forest and secondary forest,10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104163,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071649840&doi=10.1016%2fj.landusepol.2019.104163&partnerID=40&md5=8a0e4095718ef5b43e11a635ff015d79,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 5,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2135

Much of the output expansion has occurred in carbon- and biodiversity-rich forest lands of Malaysia and Indonesia (M&I), contributing to record levels of terrestrial carbon emissions and biodiversity loss. This has led to a variety of voluntary and mandatory regulatory actions, as well as calls for limits on palm oil imports from M&I. This paper offers a comprehensive, global assessment of the economic and environmental consequences of alternative policies aimed at limiting deforestation from oil palm expansion in M&I. It highlights the challenges of limiting forest and biodiversity loss in the presence of market-mediated spillovers into related oilseed and agricultural commodity and factor markets, both in M&I and overseas. Indeed, limiting palm oil production or consumption is unlikely to halt deforestation in M&I in the absence of active forest conservation incentives. Policies aimed at restricting palm oil production in M&I also have broader consequences for the economy, including significant impacts on consumer prices, real wages, and welfare, that vary among different global regions. A crucial distinction is whether the initiative is undertaken domestically, in which case the M&I region could benefit, or by major palm oil importers, in which case M&I loses income. Nonetheless, all policies considered here pass the social welfare test of global carbon dioxide mitigation benefits exceeding their costs. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

This book identifies why large-scale international forest conservation has failed to reduce deforestation in Indonesia and considers why key stakeholders have not responded as expected to these conservation interventions. The book maps the history of deforestation in Indonesia in the context of global political economy, exploring the relationship between international trade, the interests and ideology behind global sustainability programmes and the failures of forest conservation in Indonesia. Global economic and political ideologies are shown to have profoundly shaped deforestation. The author argues that the same forces continue to prevent positive outcomes. Case study chapters analyse three major international programmes: Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), the Norway-Indonesia bilateral partnership, and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in Indonesia. The findings provide insight into the failures of global climate change policy and suggest how the book’s theoretical model can be used to analyse other complex environmental problems. The book is a useful reference for students of environmental science and policy, political theory, international relations, development and economics.

Despite having undergone large scale deforestation, forest cover has shown signs of increases in the last decades. Here, to understand the degradation and regeneration history of Atlantic rainforest remnants near São Paulo, we combine a unique dataset of very high resolution images from Worldview-2 and Worldview-3 (0.5 and 0.3m spatial resolution, respectively), georeferenced aerial photographs from 1962 and use a deep learning method called U-net to map (i) the forest cover and changes and (ii) two pioneer tree species, Cecropia hololeuca and Tibouchina pulchra. For Tibouchina pulchra, all the individuals were mapped in February, when the trees undergo mass-flowering with purple and pink blossoms. Additionally, elevation data at 30m spatial resolution from NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and annual mean climate variables (Terraclimate datasets at ∼ 4km of spatial resolution) were used to analyse the forest and species distributions. We found that natural forests are currently more frequently found on south-facing slopes, likely because of geomorphology and past land use, and that Tibouchina is restricted to the wetter part of the region (southern part), which annually receives at least 1600 mm of precipitation. Tibouchina pulchra was found to clearly indicate forest regeneration as almost all individuals were found within or adjacent to forests regrown after 1962. By contrast, Cecropia hololeuca was found to indicate older disturbed forests, with all individuals almost exclusively found in forest fragments already present in 1962. At the regional scale, using the dominance maps of both species, we show that at least 4.3% of the current region's natural forests have regrown after 1962 (Tibouchina dominated, ∼ 4757 ha) and that ∼ 9% of the old natural forests have experienced significant disturbance (Cecropia dominated).","Biodiversity and Conservation of Natural Resources and Environmental Monitoring and Neural Networks, Computer and Rainforest and Species Specificity and Trees and biodiversity and classification and environmental monitoring and environmental protection and growth, development and aging and rain forest and species difference and tree",10.1371/journal.pone.0229448,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85080839870&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0229448&partnerID=40&md5=492deafa655b0fda7ea675c71b369d40,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 36,NA,JOUR,2,e0229448,NA,NA,FEB 28,1932-6203,WOS:000535239800013,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2138, 5127"

We project changes in potential total, threatened, endemic, and range-restricted mammals' species richness up to 2030.

In the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest, the biodiversity impacts of sugarcane expansion were mainly due to direct land-use change; in the Pantanal, they were largely due to indirect land-use change. The biodiversity impact of increased ethanol demand was projected to be smaller than the impact of other drivers of land-use change.

The simultaneous implementation of climate change mitigation (SDG 13) and forest protection (SDG 15) is an example of an interaction where the measures/policies that contribute to both goals can be identified and the overlaps eliminated. However, there are limited studies that quantitatively evaluate the synergy potential in the forest sector. This study is the first attempt to examine the synergy potential in the forest sector in Indonesia focusing on climate change mitigation and forest protection. We evaluated four scenarios that differentiated climate and forest policy options and assessed the effectiveness of implementing these two policies simultaneously by 2030, using a computable general equilibrium model and a land-use model. We found that the additional efforts needed for emission reduction were larger for the scenario not considering forest protection than for that considering forest protection. This caused differences in the mitigation measures introduced and the resulting land use that depended on the scenario. Consequently, mitigation costs would be reduced by implementing mitigation and forest protection policies simultaneously, suggesting that the synergy effect in the forest sector in Indonesia does exist. This also implies simultaneous contributions to SDGs 13 and 15 (Targets 13.2 and 15.2). To realize such synergies, which have not yet been considered, it is necessary for policymakers to fill the institutional gaps between the policies/strategies of mitigation and forest conservation and enforce the policies for SDGs. © 2018, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.",AFOLU model and Climate change mitigation and Computable general equilibrium model and Forest conservation and Indonesia and Synergy,10.1007/s11625-018-0650-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058474111&doi=10.1007%2fs11625-018-0650-6&partnerID=40&md5=07bab3d14c3f802991448781cd55c0fd,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 22,NA,JOUR,6,1657,1672,NA,NOV,1862-4065 and 1862-4057,WOS:000491421900013,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2147, 5205"

These symbiont fungi are fundamental on plant growth, nutrient cycling, biodiversity maintenance, etc., particularly on acidic/dystrophic soils as those of the Brazilian Cerrado. This study aimed to characterize the community composition and ecological interactions of AMF associated with the bamboo species Actinocladum verticillatum and Bambusa vulgaris vittata, under Cerrado vegetation in central Brazil. Roots and rhizospheric soil samples of A. verticillatum and B. vulgaris vittata were collected on 12 plots in the Gurupi (Tocantis state) and Porangatu (Goiás state) microregions. The roots’ mycorrhizal colonization rate, rhizospheric soil’ spore density, and the associated AMF genera were evaluated. There were no differences in the radical mycorrhizal colonization rates among the two bamboo species, although B. vulgaris vittata showed higher spore density than A. verticillatum. The genera Acaulospora, Claroideglomus, Diversispora, Scutellospora, Glomus, and Gigaspora were identified in both bamboo species, while Sclerocystis was present only on A. verticillatum.

However, existing strategies are associated with high costs, low effectiveness, and potential adverse economic impact on tropical countries and local people. Moreover, because the underlying causes of deforestation are not clearly understood, the policy options that would be most effective in halting deforestation are not known. Therefore, in this study, I examine the main factors influencing forest area change by synthesizing the results of a multinational data analysis, a Malaysian socio-economic survey, and Indonesian household surveys on deforestation that were conducted between 1990 and 2014. I reveal that poverty has a strong impact on forest area change and that high agricultural rent accelerates deforestation. I then use logical equations based on my own findings and those of previous studies to represent the relationships between deforestation, poverty, agricultural rent, and forest scarcity. From these equations, I derive clear and reasonable explanations for the causes of deforestation and assess the effectiveness of various policies and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation strategies to halt deforestation. I suggest that poverty-reduction strategies can represent sound and effective methods for reducing tropical deforestation. These findings will facilitate development of sustainable strategies that will both reduce deforestation over long term and reconcile forest conservation with social welfare. © 2019 The Author(s)",Agricultural rent and Climate change and Deforestation and Logical equations and Poverty reduction and REDD and Indonesia and Malaysia and climate change and conservation and deforestation and emission control and environmental policy and forest management and poverty alleviation and sustainability,10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.104746,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075169291&doi=10.1016%2fj.worlddev.2019.104746&partnerID=40&md5=300f58a87bb3c32e4a70eb0ca4d0581a,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 85,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2154

The species diversity was analysed by identifying the constituent species in the agroforest, and biomass and carbon storage potentials of the aboveground parts were measured and analysed. Results revealed that the spatial distribution patterns of plants in the agroforestry systems were random and the selected tree species were generally related to the sites altitude. Meanwhile, the diversity species index was moderate, ranging from 1.87 to 2.14. The mean proportion of the total carbon stored in the aboveground parts for trees was 77.458 tons per ha (97.74%), litter was 1.272 tons/ha (1.61%), and undergrowth was 0.516 tons/ha (0.65%).

To make use of such foods also helps in the preservation of local and native flora. Native plants should be reconsidered throughout their value chain, linking their socio-cultural importance, their health benefits and their economic advantages to local communities. Brazil has the richest flora in the world, with more than 56 thousand species of plants, corresponding to almost 20% of the world flora. The Atlantic Forest biome has around 20,000 plant species. Acca sellowiana is one of the native fruits of the highland region in southern Brazilian and it grows wild in the Atlantic Forest biome. The physical, chemical and sensory characteristics of four different cultivars of feijoa fruits are the focus of this study. In addition, this study evaluated the potential use of feijoa fruits in gastronomy. The oven drying technique and the osmotic dehydration method can provide potential gastronomic products with Acca sellowiana, that can become an important source of income for local families. Sensory analysis and culinary preparations have demonstrated that the wild feijoa fruits, via agroforestry production techniques, have a specific sensory niche since they imparts a ¨terroir¨ taste. The Helena feijoa cultivar presents stronger floral, sweet flavors than the other cultivars, and also is the largest in size and has the highest values for total soluble solids and a high pH. This study shows that there is a potential to develop new products with feijoa using the fruit, flower or leaves.

The Segara Anakan lagoon is a mangrove-fringed estuarine system in Java which is highly affected by deforestation, sedimentation, and land-use changes. The spatial variability of diversity, community composition, density, height, aboveground biomass and habitat complexity of the mangrove forest in relation to abiotic conditions was studied in 2014/2015. Vegetation characteristics were compared with those available from 2005/2006, and the effects of deforestation on the forest condition were assessed. In total, 15 mangrove tree species were recorded in 2015, six less than ten years ago. The two main areas of the lagoon, the central and eastern one, had a significantly different tree community composition. The central area was dominated by the palm Nypa fruticans and Aegiceras corniculatum and 74% of the ground was covered by the understorey plants Acanthus spp. and Derris trifoliata. Tree density, stand basal area, species number, aboveground biomass, and habitat complexity were significantly lower in the central area as a result of deforestation. Stand basal area and aboveground biomass decreased significantly over the 10 years as well as the density of Avicennia spp., Sonneratia spp., Ceriops spp., Aegiceras corniculatum, and Bruguiera spp. The eastern area was dominated by A. corniculatum and Rhizophora apiculata, and coverage with understorey plants was only 11%. The density of R. apiculata increased significantly over the 10 years as a result of natural regeneration and reforestation. The overall low tree height (2.8 m) and aboveground biomass (18.4 t dry mass ha−1) point to a young and degraded forest. In the central lagoon, mangrove reforestation is probably extremely difficult due to the strong expansion of understorey plants. It is assumed that ongoing deforestation will cause a further spread of understorey plants, a decrease in species number, tree density and habitat complexity. A decline in microhabitats and aboveground biomass can lead to a decrease of faunal species and biomass which in turn would influence nutrient cycling and impair the nursery function of the area. Also, important ecosystem services, particularly coastal protection against storms and prevention of coastal erosion are most likely affected. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Aboveground biomass and Deforestation and Habitat complexity and Mangrove vegetation and Reforestation and Temporal changes and Greater Sunda Islands and Indonesia and Java and Segara Anakan Lagoon and Sunda Isles and Acanthus and Aegiceras corniculatum and Avicennia and Bruguiera and Ceriops and Derris trifoliata and Nypa fruticans and Rhizophora apiculata and Rhizophoraceae and Sonneratia and aboveground biomass and basal area and coastal erosion and coastal protection and community dynamics and deforestation and estuarine environment and mangrove and nutrient cycling and reforestation and species diversity and species richness and temporal variation and tree,10.1016/j.ecss.2019.106300,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072231676&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecss.2019.106300&partnerID=40&md5=8969f4d9d3fc8820d30e86fb3e1c0da8,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 46,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,OCT 31,0272-7714 and 1096-0015,WOS:000489190500033,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2157, 3608"

Furthermore, ecosystem productivity depends on nutrient cycling and organic matter transformation in soils, highlighting the need to better understand the biological functioning of soil in natural and managed systems. Soil microbiota can be analyzed to monitor changes in soil functions, thereby serving as an indicator of ecological restoration.

In the three study areas, Acidobacteria was dominant phylum (20–38%), followed by Proteobacteria (8–13%), AD3 (4–12%), Verrucomicrobia (3–11%), and Firmicutes (3–8%). However, the results demonstrated a clear differentiation of soil microbial communities under native vegetation cover and pasture regardless of rainfall seasonality. The higher abundance of AD3 in the native cerrado area was an important variable differentiating natural and managed areas. Comparing the two pasture areas, the pasture under restoration treatment differed from the active pasture in terms of abundance of the most dominant phyla in the rainy period but not in the dry period. Proteobacteria was lower in the degraded pasture planted with native trees than in the active pasture, while the relative abundance of Acidobacteria showed the opposite trend.

The decline in these agroecosystems due to land-use changes poses as a major threat to Atlantic Forest biodiversity conservation. Therefore, efficient agricultural extension actions towards the maintenance of these agroforestry systems are paramount. This research evaluated the process of construction and sharing of knowledge in agricultural extension practices toward agroecological management of the Cabruca in three agrarian reform settlements, and the challenges for the persistence of Cabruca in this region. We interviewed seven farmers and three extension agents from the Cabruca Institute. The study showed that most of the proposed practices adopted by farmers were already part of the traditional Cabruca management. The main limitations for the adoption of new practices were that they required increased labor, which is scarce and expensive. In fact, exodus and aging of the rural population remain major threats for long-term sustainability and persistence of Cabruca agroecosystems. Other limitations for organic management include the absence of differentiated price and marketing channels for organic cocoa and other products for the Cabruca social biodiversity. Although the process of construction and sharing of knowledge was participatory, overall community participation in the process was low. Extensionists should devise and implement innovative community engagement strategies to empower these small-scale farmer communities to ensure the persistence of Cabruca in the region and consolidate organic management of Cabruca agroecosystems. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.",Agroecology and Agroforestry and Empowerment and Land reform and Rural extension technical assistance and Atlantic Forest and Bahia and Brazil and Theobroma cacao and agrarian reform and agricultural extension and agroecology and agroforestry and biodiversity and cocoa and conservation planning and empowerment and land reform and local participation and organic farming and rural development,10.1007/s10457-018-0303-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055751982&doi=10.1007%2fs10457-018-0303-x&partnerID=40&md5=ebf00b47885a01cb5b03dc5f8825e534,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 9,NA,JOUR,5,1961,1972,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2162

However, even in well-characterized groups such as birds, widely studied traits explain only a modest proportion of the variance in response across species. Here, we show that associations with particular forest types strongly predict the sensitivity of forest-dwelling Amazonian birds to agriculture. Incorporating these fine-scale habitat associations into models of population response dramatically improves predictive performance and markedly outperforms the functional traits that commonly appear in similar analyses. Moreover, by identifying habitat features that support assemblages of unusually sensitive habitat-specialist species, our model furnishes straightforward conservation recommendations. In Amazonia, species that specialize on forests along a soil-nutrient gradient (i.e. both rich-soil specialists and poor-soil specialists) are exceptionally sensitive to agriculture, whereas species that specialize on floodplain forests are unusually insensitive. Thus, habitat specialization per se does not predict disturbance sensitivity, but particular habitat associations do. A focus on conserving specific habitats that harbour highly sensitive avifaunas (e.g. poor-soil forest) would protect a critically threatened component of regional biodiversity. We present a conceptual model to explain the divergent responses of habitat specialists in the different habitats, and we suggest that similar patterns and conservation opportunities probably exist for other taxa and regions. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Providing oxygen to breathe, watershed protection, erosion control, carbon storage, and opportunities for people to connect with nature. Science warns us that at the rate forests are being destroyed, humans will alter the planet so significantly, that many lives (human and other species) will be extirpated. Recognition of the true value of forests, for their carbon storage function, is driving global agreements and policies to promote emissions reductions from land use across all biomes, but particularly in the tropics. Sizable levels of financial support have been directed at reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, in the scope of USD 1.1-2.7 billion per year. But is this enough? This level of investment is still dwarfed by income from timber, agriculture, mining and palm oil cultivation—key drivers of tropical forest loss. We describe opportunities for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, discuss risks in measuring emissions reductions and draw attention to key political, social and environmental challenges from a regional perspective of Southeast Asia; a region in the spotlight for the mass expansion of oil palm plantations and polluting wildfires. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, ground truthing a large area would be time consuming and expensive; and the results might be affected by changes in the vegetation structure over the duration of the survey. Moreover, this method was also effective in monitoring changes in biomass and carbon by year. This study was therefore critical due to the lack of similar studies in Indonesia, especially on Sumatera Island. This study has the puspose to estimate the total biomass and biodiversity value in Damar agroforest; and investigate the relationship between the carbon stock in agroforest biomass and the pixel value, and continued mapping the carbon. In addition, simple linear regression and multiple linear regression were applied to analyse the single spectral band ratios of 1 to 5 and 7; and it also applied the 10 vegetation indices such as Simple Ratio 4/3, NDVI, SAVI, Brightness, Greenness, Wetness, TNDVI, ND 73, Simple Ratio 7/3, and Ratio 327 as a biomass predictor. The results have found that the dominating species (51 %) was Shorea javanica belonging to the family of Dipterocarpaceae. In addition, 73 species belonging to 35 families were identified. Biodiversity was identified to be moderately stable and the distribution of species abundance falls in the moderate category. Thus 70 % of Damar agroforest areas might be dominated by one or more species. The significant model was successful in finding in spectral reflectance at band 7. In addition, the model based on simple linear regression produced of R2 = 0.44; F-stat. = 14.88 > F crit. = 4.38, p-value = 0.001, df = 1, 19; and the model has the lowest value of RMSE = 52.84. This model was chosen as the ideal model to predict a carbon content in Damar agroforest with equation Y = 267.83 - 1625.5 band 7. The average carbon content was estimated to be 130.19 Mg C/ha, such carbon content was nearly equal to that of Dipterocarp forest. It is therefore important to maintain the Damar agroforest ecosystem services with high biodiversity as well as natural forest; furthermore, it is also a preferable site for carbon trading. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Biodiversity and Biomass and Carbon and Ecosystems and Emission control and Linear regression and Remote sensing and Vegetation and Above ground biomass and Biodiversity values and Multiple linear regressions and Plant species diversity and Satellite remote sensing and Simple linear regression and Spectral reflectances and Vegetation structure and Forestry,10.1088/1755-1315/363/1/012005,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077473774&doi=10.1088%2f1755-1315%2f363%2f1%2f012005&partnerID=40&md5=b2fdb655158985a10299a10872b3ee70,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 2,NA,CONF,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2168

The forests also provide vital ecosystem services and livelihood support for millions of people in the region, including many indigenous communities. The Pan-Borneo Highway and several hydroelectric dams are planned or already under construction in Sarawak, a Malaysian state comprising part of the Borneo. This development seeks to enhance economic growth and regional connectivity, support community access to services, and promote industrial development. However, the implications of the development of highway and dams for forest integrity, biodiversity and ecosystem services remained largely unreported. We assessed these development projects using fine-scale biophysical and environmental data and found several environmental and socioeconomic risks associated with the projects. The highway and hydroelectric dam projects will impact 32 protected areas including numerous key habitats of threatened species such as the proboscis monkey (Nasalis larvatus), Sarawak surili (Presbytis chrysomelas), Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) and tufted ground squirrel (Rheithrosciurus macrotis). Under its slated development trajectory, the local and trans-national forest connectivity between Malaysian Borneo and Indonesian Borneo would also be substantially diminished. Nearly ~161 km of the Pan-Borneo Highway in Sarawak will traverse forested landscapes and ~55 km will traverse carbon-rich peatlands. The 13 hydroelectric dam projects will collectively impact ~1.7 million ha of forest in Sarawak. The consequences of planned highway and hydroelectric dams construction will increase the carbon footprint of development in the region. Moreover, many new road segments and hydroelectric dams would be built on steep slopes in high-rainfall zones and forested areas, increasing both construction and ongoing maintenance costs. The projects would also alter livelihood activities of downstream communities, risking their long-term sustainability. Overall, our findings identify major economic, social and environmental risks for several planned road segments in Sarawak-such as those between Telok Melano and Kuching; Sibu and Bintulu; and in the Lambir, Limbang and Lawas regions-and dam projects-such as Tutoh, Limbang, Lawas, Baram, Linau, Ulu Air and Baleh dams.

Agroforestry systems (AFS) have been quoted as one of the best options to mitigate environmental impacts and at the same time, improve smallholders’ livelihoods in agricultural areas. However, studies investigating the environmental aspects and yield of agroforestry systems in rural settlements, established by governmental initiatives, are still uncommon in the literature. Therefore, the goal of this paper was to assess the contribution of five biodiverse AFS, located in the Cerrado biome, to global warming mitigation and the provision of ecosystem services to smallholder farmers. Additionally, the importance of agroforestry projects to family farms in Brazil was discussed. Relying on data from forestry inventory and in-depth interviews with farmers, the crop yield (including fruit) was estimated; and the life cycle assessment method was used to determine the Global Warming Potential (GWP), accounting for all emissions to establish and manage the AFS up until the date of analysis. The results show the significant capacity of AFS sequester carbon, represented by the negative values of GWP, ranging from (−263) to (−496) t CO2 equivalents per hectare. Each farmer adopted different tree and crop species at the AFS establishment what influenced yields and GWP. The high number of fruit trees contributed positively to the AFS outputs, allowing farmers to consume and sell a large variety of products.

In response, Brazil has proposed a massive pasture restoration program that aspires to make ranching more competitive while at the same time reducing associated GHG emissions. Pasture restoration, however, is only one of several intensification options that could be employed to achieve these goals. Here we analyze potential production, economic return and GHG emissions from an intensification strategy based mainly on pasture restoration and compare its productive, economic and GHG emissions performances with intensification options more focused on supplemental feeding (grain-feed supplementation of grazing animals and animal finishing in feedlots). To this end, we developed a multi-sectoral, deterministic simulation model of the ranching system and applied it to Mato Grosso state, the largest producer and earliest adopter of intensive production. To account for GHG emissions, we performed a life cycle analysis of a complete beef production cycle. Our results show that an intensification strategy focused more heavily on pasture restoration does reduce GHG emissions but produces the least favorable economic and GHG emissions outcomes when compared with a range of supplemental feeding alternatives. In view of these results, Brazil should seek a more diversified strategies for cattle intensification in its climate mitigation policy. © 2019 The Author(s).

A Discourse Network Analysis of the Debate on Funding Mechanisms for REDD+ in Brazil,"Environmental Communication, ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNICATION-A JOURNAL OF NATURE AND CULTURE",14,NA,"One of the most contentious issues surrounding the forest conservation program REDD+ is the question whether it should be funded via international carbon markets. The controversy between market supporters and opponents has been especially marked in the public debate in Brazil, one of the main potential beneficiaries of REDD+ payments. In a remarkable shift of policy, the Brazilian Federal Government gave up its long-standing opposition to market-based funding in the run-up to the COP15, following several years of competition between two main discourse coalitions and their preferred story lines. These were analyzed here with discourse network analytical techniques. Brazil’s policy change may in part be explained by the failure of market opponents to employ positive arguments about alternative funding mechanisms, such as a public fund model; and by the increasing discursive dominance of a third emerging discourse coalition, which adopted major arguments of both sides in the debate.

Biochar enriched with organic fertilizer improves the survival and growth rate of Anthocepalus cadamba seedlings planted on degraded spodosols. Biodiversitas 20: 3741-3750. The application of biochar for the improvement of soil properties and fertility has drawn enormous interest worldwide nowadays and numerous application options are now available. This research was aimed to evaluate the effects of the application of biochar and organic fertilizers on the survival and growth of Anthocepalus cadamba seedlings planted on degraded spodosols soil on bioassay trial in the nursery. Bioassay trial was carried out in the nursery of Faculty of Forestry, Mulawarman University, Samarinda, Indonesia, employing a 2-factors Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with factor 1 was the rate of biochar application (i.e. six levels of treatment: 0 (control), 2, 5, 10, 25 and 100%v of biochar), and factor 2 (enrichment of organic fertilizers, i.e. with enrichment and without enrichment), and each treatment combination had 3 replications. The results showed that biochar application alone improved height and diameter growth rate of A. cadamba seedlings by 253% and 116% of control treatment (without biochar), respectively. Enrichment of organic fertilizers gave further improvement in height and diameter growth rate of A. cadamba seedlings to 386% and 150% of control treatment (without biochar), respectively. Furthermore, biochar application improved survival and biomass growth rate of the seedlings. Enrichment of organic fertilizers into biochar improved not only seedling growth rate but also more interestingly the carrying capacity of spodosols to biochar application rate. We concluded that biochar application complemented with enrichment of organic fertilizers on spodosols is highly promising for the improvement of both soil carbon sequestration and plant growth performance. © 2019, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

Although the caívas have helped maintain forest cover, there is a general lack of understanding of the effects of this system on species diversity and their potential for ecological restoration. Aiming to contribute to a better understanding of the forest dynamics (trees and regeneration) of these AFS, we present a six-year case study in which we monitored a caíva that has been used for animal husbandry for 70 years. We observe that forest management in the caíva modified the population structure mostly through reductions in the density of a few adult tree species. On the other hand, the potential regeneration shows consistent growth, including several species not found in the adult population. The caíva showed high levels of resilience in terms of regeneration, despite the extractive use of these remnants over several decades. This result demonstrates that the strategies used herein can help to restore forests with a dense and diverse forest cover within caívas.

The species can also be used in reforestation programs, which generate jobs and as a source of income and reduce the pressure of exploitation on natural rosewood populations. The objective of this study was to verify the influence of rosewood stands on physical and chemical soil attributes. This study was conducted at a rural farm in the Maués municipality, 350 km from Manaus, Amazonas State, Brazil. Samples were collected in five areas; 4-, 10- and 20-year-old rosewood stands, and 15- and 60-year-old secondary forests. The latter two served as control treatments, reflecting natural spontaneous succession conditions over time. Soil was sampled at 10 equidistant points within each area to measure physicochemical attributes, and at the center of each one, a soil profile was dug for description and classification of morphological characteristics. Based on the profile description, the soils were classified as Xanthic Hapludox. The results show that soil conditions under 20-year-old rosewood stand resembled those beneath the 60-year-old secondary forest, and likewise for the soil under the 10-year-old rosewood stand and the 15-year-old secondary forest. The soil bulk density ranged from 0.81 to 0.99 g cm−3 among all areas and no significant difference was found (P = 0.052). With exception to 4-year-old stand, the organic matter (2.68–5.87%) and carbon stock (18.57–31.71 Mg ha−1) did not differ significantly between stands and control treatments. For the soil macronutrients, nitrogen (0.10–0.22%), phosphorus (1.17–11.70 mg kg−1), calcium (0.03–0.31 mg kg−1) and magnesium (0.02–0.16 mg kg−1) were higher or equal in the rosewood stands in comparison to the two controls, while the potassium values (0.03–0.36 mg kg−1) were significantly higher in 60-year-old secondary forests only compared to the 10-year-old rosewood stands (P = 0.005). The soil beneath the 4-year-old rosewood stand, however, differed from the other four areas, having significantly higher natural clay content (>600 g kg−1) and higher topsoil chemical concentrations, associated with the more recent burning. This result represents the first step in addressing concern about sustainable soil use in rosewood forestry economics.

However, shifts in trophic niches with changes in land use are little studied and this applies in particular to belowground animals. Oribatid mites are among the most abundant soil animals, involved in decomposition processes and nutrient cycling. We analyzed shifts in trophic niches of six soil-living oribatid mite species with the conversion of lowland secondary rainforest into plantation systems of different land-use intensity (jungle rubber, rubber and oil palm monoculture plantation) in two regions of southwest Sumatra, Indonesia. We measured stable isotope ratios (13C/12C and 15N/14N) of single oribatid mite individuals and calculated shifts in stable isotope niches with changes in land use. Significant changes in stable isotope ratios in three of the six studied oribatid mite species indicated that these species shift their trophic niches with changes in land use. The trophic shift was either due to changes in trophic level (δ15N values), to changes in the use of basal resources (δ13C values) or to changes in both. The trophic shift generally was most pronounced between more natural systems (rainforest and jungle rubber) on one side and monoculture plantations systems (rubber and oil palm plantations) on the other, reflecting that the shifts were related to land-use intensity. Although trophic niches of the other three studied species did not differ significantly between land-use systems they followed a similar trend. Overall, the results suggest that colonization of very different ecosystems such as rainforest and intensively managed monoculture plantations by oribatid mite species likely is related to their ability to shift their trophic niches, i.e. to trophic plasticity. © 2019 Krause et al.",Animals and Arthropods and Carbon Isotopes and Nitrogen Isotopes and Rainforest and Soil and Tropical Climate and carbon and carbon 13 and nitrogen and nitrogen 15 and carbon and Carbon-13 and nitrogen and Nitrogen-15 and arthropod and Article and ecological niche and Indonesia and isotope analysis and land use and mite and monoculture and nonhuman and Oribatida and plantation and soil analysis and soil microflora and species difference and species identification and tropical rain forest and animal and rain forest and soil and tropic climate,10.1371/journal.pone.0224520,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074157326&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0224520&partnerID=40&md5=7cfabe8942b82c78f947ab51b4cca6bc,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 20,NA,JOUR,10,NA,NA,NA,OCT 25,1932-6203,WOS:000532638300031,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2198, 3577"

Using a Landsat image, we mapped the distribution of above-ground biomass all over the ASDU as of 2009. This distribution of above-ground biomass inside the AMFMU was not well correlated with the time that had elapsed since the last cycle of logging. The topography of the area may in fact be a more important factor. In total, 986 tree species were recorded in 70 plots (covering 8.3 ha in total). The species richness was not obviously different between recently harvested forests and primary forests, demonstrating that it is not severely affected by logging activity. As the above-ground biomass and tree species richness cannot be predicted by the years after harvesting alone, adaptive management with continuous monitoring is necessary to maintain the benefits of sustainable forest management. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Above-ground biomass and Biodiversity and Logging and Sarawak and Sustainable forest management and Tree species diversity,10.1007/978-981-13-7513-2_10,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075152020&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-13-7513-2_10&partnerID=40&md5=edb640bf06e8fe3a9b9d6038faddd0cb,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 1,NA,CHAP,NA,181,207,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2199

The lack of studies related to the quantification of its total biomass compromises the understanding of the dynamics of CO2 in this biome. Thus, it is relevant to develop studies aiming at obtaining accurate estimates of the carbon stock in the different phytophysiognomies that make the Cerrado, to include them in appropriate forest management models. Based on the hypothesis that the amount of carbon stored can vary according to the vegetation typology and vegetation compartments, the aerial stock of dry biomass and carbon were estimated in different compartments (arboreal, herbaceous-shrub and litter). The study was developed in open Brazilian savannah and soils on the sandstone and discussed the effect of fire on this phytophysiognomy. For the arboreal compartment were adjusted mathematical models to fit the biomass equations to estimate the individual stock of the trees in this compartment. The results of the stocks were discussed considering the effect of fire on the phytophysiognomy. Results: Based on the precision and extra distribution measures, the Schumacher-Hall (non-logarithmic) equation presented better results to estimate the individual biomass and carbon stocks of the open Brazilian savannah trees. The aboveground biomass was 12.88 Mg ha-1, corresponding to a total carbon stock of 5.91 Mg ha-1, where most of the stocks are in the herbaceous-shrub compartment (44%). The arboreal compartment accounts for the smallest part of the stocks, followed by the litter. Conclusions: The observed values are in the interval verified for other areas of savannah studied in Brazil. The values verified for the open Brazilian savannah in sandy soils are at the lower limit of this range, due to the nutrient-poor nature of this type of soil. The distribution of stocks in the different compartments above the ground points to the fragility of this environment to the random fire effect, common in the region. That shows the need for conservation measures for vegetation maintenance and soil protection to preserve adequate nutrient cycling in the ecosystem. © 2019 The Author(s).",Allometric equations and Biomass models and Sand soil and Savannic formations and Brazil and aboveground biomass and allometry and biome and carbon cycle and carbon sequestration and cerrado and equation and estimation method and forest management and herb and numerical model and nutrient cycling and sandy soil and savanna and shrub and tropical environment and typology,10.1186/s13021-019-0121-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065257581&doi=10.1186%2fs13021-019-0121-0&partnerID=40&md5=6888ea5a958aba9dbc041019e410e700,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 11,NA,JOUR,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2202

Data on carbon content of mangrove forests vary geographically due to differences in abiotic (climate, geomorphic settings, tides) and biotic (diversity, herbivory, bioturbation) conditions. Mangroves have been degraded worldwide and ecological restoration is an alternative to recover these ecosystems and their functionality. However, although growing and biomass after disturbances have been addressed, studies on the recovery of faunal groups are rare. The brachyuran crab assemblage is strongly integrated to carbon recycling and ecosystem functioning, since propagule consumption and fossorial activity can affect the diversity and biomass of mangroves. We assessed the aboveground biomass and carbon stock of differently managed mangrove areas in northeastern Brazil, after being deforested for shrimp culture and then abandoned, and compared data with other forests worldwide. After a decade, the area restored with Rhizophora mangle showed higher carbon stock than the self-recovered forest and similar amount as an older forest. We discuss the applied rehabilitation measures regarding the effects of management and brachyuran crabs on forest aboveground carbon storage. The effects of herbivory and bioturbation of brachyurans on the low recruitment of Laguncularia racemosa propagules, contributed to higher biomass levels in the restored forest through reinforcing the predominance of R. mangle, which stocks more aboveground carbon with respect to Laguncularia. This suggests that the particularities of target tree species and brachyuran assemblage need to be considered in mangrove restoration, since they are related to function recovering and carbon cycling in the ecosystem. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Biomass stock and Brachyuran crabs and Carbon sequestering and Ecosystem engineers and Ecosystem functioning and Mangrove restoration and Brazil and Decapoda (Crustacea) and Laguncularia and Laguncularia racemosa and Rhizophora mangle and Rhizophoraceae and aboveground biomass and biomass and carbon cycle and carbon sequestration and crab and ecosystem engineering and ecosystem function and mangrove and Neotropical Region and restoration ecology,10.1007/s11273-019-09654-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061207316&doi=10.1007%2fs11273-019-09654-7&partnerID=40&md5=23aadc63b6c99c7362d6a782200287f4,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 25,NA,JOUR,2-3,223,242,NA,JUN,0923-4861 and 1572-9834,WOS:000471654100003,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2204, 5118"

This biome has been fragmented and reduced to only 11.7% of its original range and currently its conservation relies considerably on the spontaneous regeneration of native forests in abandoned agricultural lands, a widespread phenomenon referred to in this study as passive restoration. We compare the regeneration strata of a 25-year-old secondary forest (restoration site) and of a primary forest (reference site) based on tree and shrub data in order to evaluate and characterize passive restoration in the surroundings of the Iguaçu National Park, in western Paraná State, Brazil. We recorded 589 individuals from 43 species in the restoration site and 831 individuals from 48 species in the reference site. We found smaller values of density, diversity, proportions of individuals from zoochoric and non-pioneer species; and a distinct floristic composition at the restoration site. However, plant diameter, species richness and proportions of zoochoric and non-pioneer species did not differ between sites, suggesting an appropriate successional trajectory, and the potential for the application of the passive restoration approach in the region. We found a greater number of indicator species at the reference site and some primary forest specialists were not even found at the restoration site, showing the importance of the maintenance of primary forests in the fragmented landscape in order to allow passive restoration to recover original forest attributes. © 2019, International Society for Tropical Ecology.",Biodiversity and Conservation and Forest recovery and Forest regeneration and Fragmentation and Secondary succession and Semi-deciduous forest and Brazil and Iguacu National Park and Parana [Brazil] and abandoned land and agricultural land and biodiversity and biome and conservation and deciduous forest and floristics and regeneration and restoration ecology and secondary forest and species richness and understory,10.1007/s42965-019-00017-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070613930&doi=10.1007%2fs42965-019-00017-0&partnerID=40&md5=b891c0a909578f300796de9ec94ba2fe,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 5,NA,JOUR,1,140,149,NA,MAR,0564-3295 and 2661-8982,WOS:000470336100014,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2206, 5074"

In Brazil, approximately 15% of the produced charcoal is discarded as charcoal fines, which are chemically similar to biochar. Therefore, we aimed to test charcoal fines as a strategy to increase soil carbon sequestration. Charcoal fines of hardwood Mimosa scabrella were incorporated into a Cambisol down to 10 cm (T1 = 0 and T4 = 40 Mg ha−1) in Southern Brazil. Soil samples were collected (0–30 cm) 20 months after charcoal amendment. Soil organic matter (SOM) acid extract, humic acid, fulvic acid, and humin fractions were separated. Solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra from charcoal and SOM in T1 and T4 were obtained before and after 165 days of incubation under controlled conditions. Charcoal increased soil carbon as fulvic (10–20 cm) and humic acids (10–30 cm) and, especially, as humin (0–5 cm), which probably occurred due to the hydrophobic character of the charcoal. The 13C NMR spectra and mean residence times (MRT) measured from incubation essays indicated that the charred material decomposed relatively fast and MRT of T1 and T4 samples were similar. It follows that the charcoal fines underwent similar decomposition as SOM, despite the high charcoal dose applied to the soil and the high aryl C contribution (78%) to the total 13C intensity of the charcoal NMR spectra. © 2019 by the authors.",<sup>13</sup>C NMR and Field experiment and Incubation and Mean residence time and Slow pool,10.3390/agronomy9070384,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070229530&doi=10.3390%2fagronomy9070384&partnerID=40&md5=47c92e5363b43f0f69eb5471ba19a72b,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 13,NA,JOUR,7,NA,NA,NA,JUL,2073-4395,WOS:000478660500064,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2211, 5234"

Meanwhile, surface soil, driven by runoff, enters shallow karst fissures (SKFs); these SKFs filled with soil have become the major habitat type in the area. Here, we explore the morphological characteristics of shallow karst fissures as well as the soil physical and chemical properties of the SKFs and comprehensively analyse the factors that influence the soil properties. Three key results are presented. First, a high heterogeneity of morphological characteristics exists for shallow karst fissures. According to the different characteristics of the vertical section, the SKFs can be divided into 5 types. These types are Rectangle-type, Pyramid-type, Funnel-type, Net-type and Diamond-type. In addition, the SKF dip angles were mainly between 60° and 90° (76.39%), the width of the top aperture was mainly between 20 and 40 cm (51.39%), and the trace lengths were mainly between 80 and 160 cm (76.39%). Second, compared with their characteristics of surface soil, the bulk density and fractal dimension of soil particles of the SKFs were both large, and the main composition of the SKF soil was clay. Third, the soil nutrients of the SKFs (the organic matter, total nitrogen and total phosphorus) were lower than the surface soil nutrients but not significantly so. The total potassium (TK) of the SKFs was greater than that observed for the surface and increased as the depth of the SKF increased. The soil nutrients of the SKFs were significantly affected by the fissure morphology. The poorly connected fissures had better soil fertility. When the morphological characteristics and soil properties of the SKFs were comprehensively considered, the vegetation types that were determined to be the best for use in the ecological restoration of areas of karst rocky desertification were deep-rooted plants with especially strong root penetration.

Even if fires directly affect the timber sector, most current logging practices often tend to increase rather than mitigate the problem. We argue that in order to involve the timber sector in fire mitigation policies in the Amazon it is crucial to assess the economic impact of fire on the sector. This paper describes EcoFire (Economic Cost of Fire), a spatially explicit model for valuing the economic losses to sustainable timber harvest operations in the Brazilian Amazon as a result of fire. To conduct this analysis, we have integrated a set of models that simulate the synergy between logging and fire spread and intensity. Our results show that fire affects roughly 2% of the timber production areas that would be harvested between 2012 and 2041. In burnt areas, fire causes losses on average of US$39 ± 2 ha/year (equivalent annual annuity), which represents a loss of 0.8% of expected rents. Yet losses can reach up to US$183 ± 30 ha/year in areas hit by recurrent fires that are near milling centres. The results indicate that some of the municipalities that are likely to accumulate most economic losses due to fire do not yet have local-level fire mitigation programmes. We therefore conclude that spatially explicit valuations of the economic impact of fire can pinpoint priorities to better target fire action plans as well as to engage local actors in integrated fire management practices.

In this work, we evaluated large-scale active restoration of intensively used pastures in southern Amazonia, where the highest deforestation rates are observed. With the construction of the Jirau Dam in the Madeira river (state of Rondônia, Brazil), a 3000-ha forest buffer zone has been established. This area was previously covered by African pasture grasses for cattle ranching. Eight mixed-species planting sites with variable grass management and ranging from 6 to 60 months post-planting were measured three times over 2.5 years. We also tested a gradient of restoration intensity in an experimental planting: (i) no intervention (control), (ii) harrowing and herbicides to control grasses, and (iii) harrowing and herbicides plus tree planting. Our goals were to understand the initial trajectory of actively restored sites, the role of harrowing and herbicide application in triggering natural regeneration, and the role of seedling planting on the initial vegetation structure. All tree species ≥30 cm in height were sampled in five circular 10-m-radius plots per site. Plant cover was also monitored using the step-point method. At 18 months, stem density ranged from 2500 to 14,490 ind·ha−1, demonstrating that density increased suddenly in most sites through colonization, although this was highly variable. Tree cover reached 81% in five years, virtually eliminating grass cover after 36 months. Recruits contributed more to basal area than planted seedlings. Although 17 species, on average, were planted in restoration sites, the number of species at the sites steadily increased over time, at a rate of 7 species·yr−1 per 1570 m2.

Harrowing and grass control were enough to trigger succession in sites where natural regeneration was not taking place, shifting these sites to the highly resilient route of early secondary forest succession in the Amazon.

Investigating the role of bamboo in Araucaria Forest succession in Southern Brazil,"Journal of Plant Ecology, JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY",12,NA,"Aims: Assessing the role of a dominant native bamboo species on tree species diversity and structure in the medium term. Methods: Over a 7-year period, we studied the natural regeneration of two dominant forest types in Southern Brazil (Araucaria Forest or AF; Bamboo Forest or BF) after a bamboo (Merostachys skvortzovii Send.) die-off between 2004 and 2006. The study was carried out in the Embrapa Research Station in Caçador, Santa Catarina State, Brazil. Important Findings: The die-off provided ideal conditions for the establishment of several species and it kickstarted forest succession dynamics, which in turn affected regeneration diversity. Tree species richness was relatively stable with a transitory increase between 2007 and 2014 in both AF and BF. However, species richness rose in BF because of a relative increase in abundance of some species (especially late and secondary species) while a plunge in some pioneer species drove an increase in diversity. Overall, we found that BF has a lower diversity of recruits and that density declined over time, while AF is more diverse, with a more stable density. In BF, the bamboo die-off created optimal conditions for initial regeneration development (mainly fast-growing pioneer trees), which quickly transited to higher size classes. Yet, after this initial stage of pioneer recruitment, the number of recruits dropped followed by a virtual absence of growth regardless of the species group as a result of a quick bamboo reestablishment. As bamboo recreated a dense understory it reduced species diversity to original levels, suggesting a self-maintaining cycle that halts forest succession. On the other hand, the bamboo die-off had little impact on AF where a slow recruitment process typical of old-growth forests was observed. The results indicate that the die-off event had a temporary effect on species diversity i.e. restricted to forests where bamboos are dominant in a similar process described in other southern South American forests. As the first study to observe the medium-term forest dynamics related to bamboo die-off, we can conclude that when being dominant, native bamboos can hinder forest regeneration, maintaining lower levels of diversity and arresting forest succession that lasts well beyond the short-term, post-die-off effects. Many forest fragments in the region are dominated by bamboos, thus their potential for conservation is at risk and requires appropriate management. © The Author(s) 2019.",biodiversity and dominant species and forest regeneration and forest succession and Merostachys skvortzovii Send,10.1093/jpe/rtz037,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076403945&doi=10.1093%2fjpe%2frtz037&partnerID=40&md5=0db18bfde51f4900d93986b6eed12cee,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 9,NA,JOUR,6,1034,1046,NA,DEC,1752-9921 and 1752-993X,WOS:000503278500011,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2226, 5092"

Brazil has already a wide variety of policy instruments and socioenvironmental governance options, as well as global commitments (ODS, Aich Targets, Paris Agreement) related to the objective of a sustainable future. However, inefficient management control or lack of incentive to comply with the rules pose risks to consolidating the path to this future. The country has strong and capable institutions, but infrastructural problems, slow processes, inefficient measurements and judicial, social and ecological conflicts obstruct a proficient performance.

The reclamation for sustainable ecosystem in mined land, including revegetation, is an obligatory program stipulated by the Indonesian government. This study evaluated the ecological improvement of revegetated land at the reclamation sub-areas (RSAs) of former limestone quarries in Tuban, East Java, Indonesia. The RSAs were coded as RSA 2010, RSA 2014, and RSA 2016 which represented the initial year of revegetation as well as the reclamation soil-material, namely the rejected soilproducts, topsoil, and spoils, respectively. Soil insects were collected from ten sampling plots at each RSA using pitfall traps. The data of arthropods were analyzed to describe the community structure by determining the Shannon Diversity Index (H’), Simpson’s index (D), Sorensen's similarity and Shannon evenness index (E). The soil organic carbon (SOC) content from the soil composites was analyzed according to the Walkley and Black method. The results showed that SOC value at RSA 2010 (1.851±0.38%) was higher than that at SRA 2014 (1.694±0.29%) and SRA 2016 (0.947±0.10%). There were 18 families found from eight orders of soil insects (Coleoptera, Diplura, Diptera, Entognatha, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Neuroptera, and Orthoptera) and one order from terrestrial crustacea i.e., Isopoda, family Tylidae. The ecological indices of RSA 2014 (H’=1.15; D=0.47; E=0.61) and RSA 2016 (H’=1,19; D=0.47; E=0.57) were higher than those of RSA 2010 (H’=0,61; D=0.71; E=0.43). The Pearson analysis indicated moderate negative correlation (r=0.55) between soil arthropod diversity index and SOC. The diversity of soil arthropods at reclaimed area indicated that the reclamation was successful.

The increasing concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) is most responsible for the climate change phenomenon. The increasing temperature of the environment affects agricultural production systems and the production potential of natural resources. Among the GHGs, carbon dioxide (CO2) gas plays a vital role in ecosystem sustainability and maintaining ecological functioning. Agricultural systems hold great potential in terms of CO2 sequestration and transformation for mitigating the adverse effects of climate change. Plant dynamics and soil processes are affected by increasing temperature and CO2 concentration. In temperature-limited regions, crops yields have increased, but tropical regions have been adversely affected. The processes of respiration and photosynthesis are mediated by climate change. Soil ecosystem services are also being disturbed as demonstrated by modifications in soil microbial populations and diversity. Among ecosystems, the agricultural ecosystem is most affected by fractional changes in temperature and CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. Climate mitigation options are needed, and forceful implementation and monitoring of environmental laws and regulations can help to minimize GHG emissions. Increasing the size of the green carpet, or afforestation, is an integral part of climate change mitigation options across the globe. Awareness among people regarding GHG emissions and their adverse effect on agricultural productivity is also a present demand.

However, the importance of these protected areas in the water cycle and the hydrologic connection with surrounding landscapes is little analyzed. In this study, we evaluated the role of preserved and deforested areas in the water balance in the Itacaiúnas River Basin using the MGB hydrological model. We estimated the impacts of land cover changes on evapotranspiration and discharge for four scenarios: Preserved (1984 land cover), Recent (2013 land cover, with 50% deforestation), Hypothetical deforestation of protected areas (70% deforestation) and complete deforestation of protected areas (79% deforestation). We showed that deforestation of the remaining preserved area could be responsible for a decrease of 23% (3.5 km³/year) in water transfer to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration. Furthermore, we showed that each 15% of deforestation occurring between the Preserved and Recent scenarios increased the average discharges by 5.4% (40 m³/s). Additionally, past land cover changes in the headwaters of the Itacaiúnas River Basin caused statistically significant changes in discharges inside the protected areas. This insight is considered important due to the association between increases in discharges and water quality issues. The results suggest that headwater areas of secondary drainages that run into the forested domains should be prioritized for reforestation programs.

SNP is surrounded by almost 50 thousand people whose livelihoods depend on SNP's resources before, during, and after the changing status of the area from production to conservation forest. Nowadays, about 6-7% of local community are categorised as poor people and surviving from their subsistence livelihoods. This study shows that the establishment of the park changes the livelihood strategies of local communities. People shifted their livelihood sources from forest resource extractions, particularly logging, to agriculture (farming and fishing). Some strategies to maintain and improve the livelihoods of local communities within the restrictive regulations of SNP management include: (1) regulating the collection of non-timber forest products so that it would not threaten the ecological balance of the forests; (2) developing agroforestry system; (3) involving local communities in the rehabilitation programs within rehabilitation zone; (4) developing ecotourism; and (5) involving in communities in the REDD+ program prepared by SNP. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Behavioral research and Conservation and Ecology and Agroforestry system and Ecological balance and Forest resources and Forest-dependent communities and Livelihood strategies and Non-timber forest products and Peat swamp forests and Rehabilitation programs and Forestry,10.1088/1755-1315/285/1/012005,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068251085&doi=10.1088%2f1755-1315%2f285%2f1%2f012005&partnerID=40&md5=089f6a05cad72d344ce7a07bbf8d612a,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 3,NA,CONF,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2245

A comparative analysis between two successional stages in southern brazil,"Diversity, DIVERSITY-BASEL",11,165,"Bamboos are opportunistic species that rapidly colonize open areas following forest disturbance, forming dense clusters that alter the regenerative processes and maintain lower levels of tree diversity. Widespread forest degradation, especially in Latin America and Asia, and human-induced introduction have allowed native and non-native bamboo species to thrive, hindering successional pathways that would otherwise lead to more diverse forests; such a large-scale phenomenon is a key concern in the conservation of forest resources around the globe. Despite previous research on this phenomenon, little is known about the long-term effects of bamboo dominance on forest structure and composition and the corresponding interaction with natural regeneration. As such, we sought to evaluate the long-term effects of bamboo dominance on the dynamics of adult forest populations considering two forest types (Bamboo Forest—BF and Araucaria Forest—AF) over an 11-year period in the Embrapa Research Station in Caçador, Brazil. We monitored 20 plots (15 × 15 m) in each forest type where we tagged, identified, and measured the height and diameter of all the trees taller than 1.5 m (H) and diameter at breast height (DBH) greater than 3.18 cm. Comparisons were based on forest species diversity and structure parameters. In BF, diversity of species increased after the bamboo die-off that occurred in 2006 with a subsequent reduction in the number of pioneer species overtime. However, secondary species remained stagnant demonstrating that recruitment and transition into higher size classes is restricted to the immediate die-off aftermath. On the other hand, plant diversity and structure in the relatively bamboo-free AF were stable with secondary species accounting for the most richness. Our results confirm that BF maintains significantly lower levels of diversity that are restricted to pioneer species; AF structure and diversity are not significantly affected by bamboo die-off and recolonization; and BF tree species are caught in a closed cycle of arrested successional development. The widespread presence of bamboos as dominant species in the region should become a part of the conversation pertaining to forest management and conservation in Brazil and other countries in south America and Asia. © 2019 by the authors.

The global portfolio of PES programs is estimated to represent an annual investment of more than USD $36 billion. Despite this substantial investment, the continued lack of systematic and rigorous impact evaluation of PES has contributed to uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of this tool for conservation. Here, we assessed the ability of two watershed PES programs to promote native forest conservation in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Those two focal programs are among the most well-established PES programs in Brazil, and form part of a larger network of PES programs intended to protect the drinking water supply of over 19 million people in the São Paulo metropolitan region. Using a counterfactual approach, we examined if enrollment in a PES program contributed to the conservation of on-farm native forest cover. With propensity score matching, we identified a set of neighboring, non-enrolled ‘control’ properties, with similar size, altitude, soil type, demographic density, presence of water sources and forest cover. We then estimated forest cover on enrolled and control properties before and after PES implementation with a differences-in-differences method, modeled as the probability of an observed change in on-farm forest area as a consequence of PES enrollment. We found that PES has a positive effect on forest cover, with PES enrollment over a five-year period associated with an additional 2.8–5.6% of farm area coverage in native Atlantic Forest, through forest regeneration. PES enrollment was associated with a non-significant trend toward decreased loss of vegetation. We discuss the implications of these results for understanding the contribution of PES to additionality in forest conservation. While positive, the relatively slow impact of PES on forest regeneration suggests that environmental managers should not count exclusively on PES mechanism to achieve conservation goals. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Additionality and Atlantic Forest regeneration and Avoided deforestation and Ecosystem restoration and Environmental services and Impact evaluation and Brazil and Sao Paulo [Brazil] and Sao Paulo [Sao Paulo (STT)] and conservation management and deforestation and ecosystem service and forest cover and forest ecosystem and restoration ecology,10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.11.054,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058648798&doi=10.1016%2fj.landusepol.2018.11.054&partnerID=40&md5=653e4057c708cc33d0f840d82a6c288f,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 90,NA,JOUR,NA,283,291,NA,MAR,0264-8377 and 1873-5754,WOS:000459358100026,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2250, 4171"

We additionally examined the publication of scientific papers on women’s participation and gender perspectives in forestry research. We employed Kendall’s W to examine the concordance of local peoples’ assessment of the knowledge of rural women related to forestry, the major barriers preventing women participating effectively in sustainable forestry and the tasks required to engage women better. The study revealed only very weak agreement regarding the knowledge of rural women about forestry (Kendall’s W = 0.47, p <.000). Local people considered women knew most about sustainable forestry and use of forest for various purposes and less about the trees and forests. The study found moderate agreement (Kendall’s W =.118, p <.000) concerning the major barriers preventing women participating effectively in sustainable forestry, with the most significant barrier being low female participation in decision-making bodies. There was very weak agreement on the highest priority task required to engage women better in forestry management (Kendall’s W =.035, p <.000). Quantitative content analysis was used to analyze the scientific papers. From 1992 to September 2018, 537 scientific papers were published in 171 journals, with study sites in 83 countries, related to women and gender in 1) forest, 2) REDD + and 3) community-based forestry. The countries most covered by the research were: Indonesia (27 articles), India (39), United States (45) and Nepal (51). There was a significant increase in the number of papers on women’s participation and gender mainstreaming in 1) forest (n = 482), and 2) community-based forestry (n = 20) from 2007, and in 3) REDD + discourses (n = 34) from 2011.

The protocol was developed following the plant or animal taxonomy framework by Linnaeus, considering that the first character has two mutually exclusive possibilities. It was elaborated in three parts: (1) a technical glossary, (2) a hierarchical key, and (3) a set of intervention actions that are indicated according to the case. Complementarily, ten degraded sites (lentic or lotic ecosystem), all located in continental regions of the Brazilian territory, were evaluated using this key. The protocol was thought to be applied to continental and superficial water bodies. It starts separating the lotic and lentic ecosystems, and after each part goes for specific ways, all of them finishing in one or more interventionist action(s). The set of actions presented is composed of fourteen scenarios, seven of them to be implemented on-site, five to be implemented off-site, and two to be implemented on- and/or off-site. The intervention actions range from simply monitoring, to revegetation of the riparian zone, to activities that target the reoxygenation of hypolimnion.

CO2 fluxes from drained tropical peatland used for oil palm plantation in relation to peat characteristics and crop age after planting. Biodiversitas 20: 1650-1657. Large expansion of oil palm plantation on peatland has changed its important role for carbon sink into carbon source. Conversion of peat swamp forest with high carbon density into monoculture of oil palm has released significant amount of carbon into atmosphere, either carbon previously stored in forest biomass or carbon stored in peat organic matter. Drainage canal to artificially lower groundwater level as prerequi site for oil palm cultivation provides favorable condition for soil microbes activities in decomposing peat organic matter, resulting in the increase of CO2 flux. The fluctuation of groundwater level and variation of environmental factors near the peat surface may regulate the rate of CO2 released from the soil. We aimed to measure CO2 fluxes from two sites of oil palm plantation with different peat characteristics and analyzed the correlation with groundwater level, soil temperature, air temperature, gravimetric water content, peat pH, oxidative reductive potential, and crop age. The measurement had been conducted from September 2016 to April 2017 in West Kalimantan, Indonesia using portable infrared gas analyzer EGM 4. In addition to soil sampling at the same time as the gas measurement, we collected soil samples for some peat characteristics analysis, consisting of bulk density, particle density, porosity, soil organic matter, ash content, carbon, and nitrogen content prior to CO2 flux measurement. Our result shows that the difference of peat chemical characteristics between two sites has resulted in different CO2 flux. Oil palm ages seemed to affect CO2 flux by regulating microclimatic condition around crop canopy. Young oil palm with less dense canopy associated with high CO2 flux. The soil temperature has positive correlation with CO2 flux and groundwater level, but it has negative correlation with gravimetric water content. However, there was insignificant relationship between CO2 fluxes and groundwater level unless the groundwater level reached more than 50 cm from the peat surface. It implies that CO2 flux is a complex process influenced by many peatland characteristics and environmental factors, particularly when groundwater level is high or near to the surface. © 2019, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

However, ecosystem disservices (EDS) and their influence on how people interact with ecosystems have received less attention. Objective: We aimed at assessing people’s preferences and perceptions of forest ES and EDS in three contrasted case studies. In the meantime, it aims at discussing the potential of considering both ES and EDS in landscape preference and sociocultural valuation studies. Methods: Interviews with stakeholders were conducted in an agroforestry landscape (France), in the Atlantic Forest and in the Pampa grasslands (Brazil). Identified ES and EDS were classified into a common typology and analyzed through discourse analysis and quantitative methods to assess the variability in ES/EDS perceptions among respondents and among forest types. Results: Respondents cited 19 ES classes and 11 EDS classes, with strong variability among case studies. Contrasted perceptions and preferences among respondents were revealed. In the agroforestry landscape, EDS were particularly emphasized by people and contributed to the variability in people’s perceptions. In the Atlantic forest landscape, forested areas tended to contrast based on cultural ecosystem services. In the Pampa case study, EDS were particularly salient in people’s preferences concerning exotic forest plantations. Conclusions: This study suggests that different types of forested areas produce specific ES/EDS, suggesting their complementarity at the landscape scale. The combination of ES and EDS therefore offers a promising research avenue for more consistent ES sociocultural valuations and for improving management recommendations. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Forest ecosystems and Landscape values and Perceptions and Place-based research and Preferences and Sociocultural valuation and Atlantic Forest and Brazil and France and agroforestry and ecosystem service and landscape change and landscape planning and perception and plantation forestry and preference behavior and questionnaire survey and stakeholder and typology,10.1007/s10980-019-00778-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062152887&doi=10.1007%2fs10980-019-00778-y&partnerID=40&md5=211983b79ea497f8690fed6001147cc2,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 31,NA,JOUR,7,1583,1600,NA,JUL,0921-2973 and 1572-9761,WOS:000478084800008,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2261, 4223"

The methodology was based on a case study, using Focal Groups and Field Notes as research instruments. On the basis of our analysis, there were social changes in the farmers’ organization and in the decision-making process, as well as in the landscape in the areas of AFS and surroundings, where agroecological principles were also applied to production. In Sumaré, the four farmers participating in the project organized themselves to obtain organic certification. Cooperacra, which works with a group of 10 farmers advanced in the process of agroecological transition, starting from an intensive organic horticulture production system to a biodiverse agroforestry system. Despite the short time of the project, the construction of knowledge in relation to agroforestry systems was perceived through management techniques incorporated by the farmers in their agroecosystems.

Groundwater table decline is the main driver of these negative processes and, therefore restoration of peatland hydrology is essential. Although groundwater table depth is critical to counteract peatland degradation, optimal depths are not generic for all peatlands, but depend on peat physical properties (i.e. water retention, unsaturated conductivity), which are related to the degree of peat humification (Fibric, Hemic, Sapric). Unfortunately only few of these peat physical properties are available while they are essential input data in hydrological models required to extend the usually short observed groundwater hydrographs. An experiment with the Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant model (SWAP) for two locations in Indonesian peatlands illustrates the impact of the degree of peat humification on physical properties and thereby on calculated groundwater table depth, hydrological drought and associated fires hazards. The Variable Threshold Method is applied to convert groundwater table depths into hydrological drought, and next the modified Keetch-Byram Drought Index (mKBDI) is used to assess wildfire hazard. Peat physical properties that reflect higher peat humification (Hemic and Sapric) result into lower water tables during dry periods, in particular during El Niño years, more severe hydrological drought, and an earlier and longer fire season. Using the limited available peat physical properties the importance is demonstrated of initiating a comprehensive programme to build a database of peat physical properties covering different environmental conditions in which tropical peatlands occur. Availability of such a database connected to a long-term monitoring programme, will support the ongoing rewetting, revegetation and revitalisation programme for Indonesian peatlands, which eventually will contribute to sustainable livelihoods for local people and reduce impact on the regional climate. © 2019 The Authors",Local people livelihood and Peatland hydrology and Revegetation and Revitalisation and Rewetting and Soil-water-atmosphere-plant modelling and Water retention and Indonesia and Biodegradation and Biodiversity and Deforestation and Drought and Ecosystems and Fires and Groundwater and Hazards and Peat and Physical properties and Revegetation and Soil conservation and Soil moisture and Local people and Peatland and Re-wetting and Revitalisation and Soil water atmosphere plants and Water retention and deforestation and drainage and drought stress and environmental management and groundwater and humification and livelihood and peat soil and peatland and physical property and revegetation and soil-vegetation interaction and water retention and water table and wildfire and Wetlands,10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.04.001,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064015366&doi=10.1016%2fj.geoderma.2019.04.001&partnerID=40&md5=1d08aad3243282ab57bc32493f78a38d,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 46,NA,JOUR,NA,160,169,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2266

Dung beetles perform relevant ecological functions in pastures, such as dung removal and parasite control. Livestock farming is the main economic activity in the Brazilian Pantanal. However, the impact of cattle grazing on the Pantanal's native dung beetle community, and functions performed by them, is still unknown. 2. This study evaluated the effects of cattle activity on dung beetle community attributes (richness, abundance, biomass, composition, and functional group) as well as their ecological functions (dung removal and soil bioturbation) in the Pantanal. In January/February 2016, dung beetles were sampled and their ecological functions measured in 16 sites of native grasslands in Aquidauana, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, 10 areas regularly grazed by cattle and six control ungrazed areas (> 20 years of abandonment). 3. In all, 1169 individuals from 30 species of dung beetles were collected. Although abundance, species richness, and biomass did not differ between grasslands with and without cattle activity, species composition and functional groups differed among systems. Large roller beetles were absent from non-cattle grasslands, and the abundance, richness, and biomass of medium roller beetles was higher in those systems. 4. Despite causing changes in species/functional group composition, the results of this study show that a density compensation of functional groups in cattle-grazed natural grasslands seems to have conserved the ecological functions (dung removal and soil bioturbation), with no significant differences between systems. 5.

A meta-analysis for the Brazilian Atlantic Forest,Forest Ecology and Management,433,NA,"Human land use has extensively degraded ecosystems, leading to biodiversity losses and reducing the provision of ecosystem services (ES). Agroforestry systems have been recommended as a cost-effective strategy that integrates production and biodiversity conservation, yet few studies have quantified the capacity of agroforestry systems to conserve biodiversity and ES provision. Here we quantify the effects of different types of agroforestry systems on biodiversity and ES in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We compared values of biodiversity and ES in different agroforestry systems with those found in conventional production systems and in old-growth forests (reference ecosystem). We assessed 72 studies encompassing 143 study sites and 1700 quantitative comparisons. In general, agroforestry and conventional production systems had lower values of mean effect size for biodiversity and ES provision than the reference systems. However, biodiverse agroforestry systems had higher values of mean effect size for biodiversity and ES provision than simple agroforestry systems and conventional production systems. The use of biodiverse agroforestry systems as an alternative production system reduces biodiversity loss and the negative impact on ES in production areas. Agroforestry systems provide up to 45% and 65% more benefits for biodiversity and ES levels, respectively, than conventional production systems; however, these benefits differ according to the type of agroforestry system. Our findings provide empirical evidence that a biodiverse agroforestry system is the best option to enhance biodiversity and ES in degraded areas where production systems based on sustainable management of natural resources are allowed by law.

SAFs that were deployed with management based on prune trees and maintenance of floristic diversity contributed with the improvement of the soil quality and the maintenance of fertility and C stocks at levels like in native vegetation.

Ecosystem services analysis can provide quantifiable goals for urban ecological regeneration that are determined by the site-specific ecology and climate of an urban area. In this research, the ecosystem service of habitat provision is the key focus. The role of urban green space and urban forests is crucial within this. Setting ambitious targets for urban ecological performance and ecosystem services provision is of great importance due to the large negative environmental impact that cities currently have on ecosystems and, therefore, ecosystem service provision, and because healthier ecosystems enable humans to better adapt to climate change through creating potentials for increased resilience. A comparative case study analysing the ecosystem service of habitat provision in two existing urban environments with similar climates (Cfb according to the Köppen Climate Classification System) but in different parts of the world, namelyWellington, New Zealand and Curitiba, Brazil, was conducted to examine how the ecosystem services analysis concept can used to devise urban habitat provision goals. The paper concludes that, although achieving habitat provision goals derived from ecosystem services analysis in urban areas is likely to be difficult, determining quantitative site- and climate-specific staged goals could enable urban design professionals to increase the effectiveness of conservation and regeneration efforts in terms of ecosystem service provision from urban green and blue spaces. © 2019 by the authors.",Cities and Climate change and Curitiba and Ecosystem biomimicry and Ecosystem services and Urban biodiversity and Urban ecology and Wellington and Analysis and Biodiversity and Cities and Ecosystems and New Zealand and Paper and Reforestation and Services and Brazil and Curitiba and New Zealand and North Island and Parana [Brazil] and Wellington [North Island] and Biodiversity and Biomimetics and Climate change and Environmental impact and Reforestation and Urban growth and Biomimicry and Cities and Curitiba and Ecosystem services and Urban biodiversity and Urban ecology and Wellington and biodiversity and ecosystem service and greenspace and habitat structure and mimicry and regeneration and urban area and urban design and urban forestry and urban planning and Ecosystems,10.3390/f10050391,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066816664&doi=10.3390%2ff10050391&partnerID=40&md5=d2f27b67c39e479ad24acdefa84acc10,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 14,NA,JOUR,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2278

The SMAF has successfully been tested as an objective tool to quantify land use and management effects on soil quality, including under some Brazilian soil conditions. Nevertheless, the SMAF potential to properly address soil quality changes under contrasting soil and climate conditions, and integrated farming systems must still must be investigated. Thus, a field study was conducted to apply the SMAF guidelines as a strategy for assessing land use (native vegetation, pasture, sugarcane, no-tillage, and integrated crop-livestock systems) effects on soil quality in southern Brazil. Soil samples were taken in three layers (0.0–0.10, 0.10–0.20, 0.20–0.30 m) of clay Ferralsol (traditional agricultural region), Sandy loam Ferralsol and Arenosol (new agricultural frontiers), in the state of Paraná, Brazil. The soil quality indicators investigated were: chemical attributes (pH, phosphorus and potassium), physical (bulk density) and biological (soil organic carbon). Using the SMAF scoring curves, the measured values were transformed (0 to 1 range) and an overall soil quality index (SQI) was calculated. Our findings revealed that long-term conversion from native vegetation to agricultural land uses (i.e., pasture, no-tillage/integrated crop-livestock system, or sugarcane) reduced soil quality assessed by SMAF scores, compromising the soil's capacity to perform its functions. Nevertheless, conservationist systems, e.g. the no-tillage, associated or not with the integrated crop-livestock system are promising alternative to enhances soil quality by increasing C content and soil chemical fertility compared to degraded pasture or conventional sugarcane cultivation. However, soil physical changes should be monitored to alleviate soil compaction in no-tillage cropping systems. In conclusion, this study provided important insights about soil quality changes induced by land use and diversified cropping systems. In that direction, new studies including a large number of sites, soil types and cropping systems are needed for validating our conclusions in a regional scale, enabling to support decision-making towards more sustainable expansion and intensification of agriculture in Brazil. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Age and Integrated crop-livestock system and Land use change and No-till and Sugarcane and Brazil and agricultural land and Arenosol and best management practice and clay soil and climate conditions and cropping practice and Ferralsol and land use change and mixed farming and sandy loam and soil fertility and soil quality and sugar cane and zero tillage,10.1016/j.agee.2019.05.006,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065883570&doi=10.1016%2fj.agee.2019.05.006&partnerID=40&md5=e512ce1bdc4311cb4be5372be316c232,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 65,NA,JOUR,NA,100,110,NA,SEP 1,0167-8809 and 1873-2305,WOS:000500208700011,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2282, 5409"

This paper aims to describe and discuss a method to estimate the carbon stocks in agroforestry land in Hutumury Village, Ambon. The formulation of allometric equation for nutmeg (Myristica fragrans Houtt) is used to predict the aboveground biomass of nutmeg-based agroforestry land. The carbon mass equation model was constructed based on a significant relationship between carbon mass of nutmeg tree and its diameters at breast height and tree height. In order to analyse the biomass content, a destructive sampling technique was used. After felling, dimensional measurement was performed for each tree. The results of the study showed that the equation model for estimating aboveground biomass of nutmeg tree was allometric equation of Power, i.e., Y = 134.353 * (D**2.424) or ln (Y) = ln (134.353) + (2.424 * ln (D)) with R2 (adj) = 0.977 and standard error (SE) = 0.183. This allometric equation is a local allometric model and much needed to support REDD+ especially in Maluku Province.

Northwestern Amazonia, and interfluvial forests there in particular, are assumed to exhibit little past human impact. We analyzed soils and floristic structure and composition of interfluvial forests located in the Içana River basin, northwestern Amazonia, to assess their degree of past human modification. Ancient Baniwa village sites, abandoned centuries ago, have given rise to “ancestral forests” with as much as 57% of all trees/palms belonging to a group of species managed currently by the Baniwa, compared to only 10% of such species in old-growth forests that are not remembered as having been inhabited or managed in Baniwa oral tradition. Participatory mapping and direct observations revealed ancestral forests to be widely distributed throughout the region, whereas old-growth forests are rare. Managed species in ancestral forests contributed 5-fold more to total tree/palm biomass than in old-growth forests. Human management has produced lasting changes in floristic composition, maintained total tree/palm biomass, and improved soil quality. This is the first study to demonstrate past human modification in Amazonian interfluvial forests, while explicitly isolating historical human management from edaphic effects on floristic structure and composition. Despite environmental limitations on human population size, posed by nutrient-poor black water rivers and acidic, sandy soils, indigenous peoples of northwestern Amazonia left a clear, lasting cultural legacy in ancestral forests. Given legal changes that threaten indigenous peoples' land rights currently under debate in Brazil, we call for a reconsideration of biodiversity conservation policies and indigenous rights in areas that show enduring legacies of management by indigenous populations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Biodiversity and Conservation and Ecology and Forestry and Nutrients and Rivers and Amazonia and Brazil and Biodiversity and Conservation and Ecology and Nutrients and Population statistics and Rivers and Soils and Biodiversity conservation and Direct observations and Environmental limitations and Floristic compositions and Human modification and Indigenous people and Nutrient-poor soils and Old-growth forest and anthropogenic effect and biodiversity and conservation status and forest soil and indigenous population and land rights and landscape and management practice and old-growth forest and soil nutrient and Forestry,10.1016/j.foreco.2019.04.020,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066761909&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2019.04.020&partnerID=40&md5=b902d7b352d65527ed1e482ac65b761e,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 37,NA,JOUR,NA,317,330,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2289

In northwestern Patagonia of Argentina, Pinus ponderosa (Pinaceae) afforestation plays a key role in ameliorate degraded soils, but may also reduce biodiversity. The ecological sustainability of this activity was assessed in Aguas Frías (38°46´ W, 70°54´ S) and Litrán (38°54´ W, 71°01´ S) forest stations, where species richness and life form diversity of plants were compared in vegetation units, fenced and unfenced against livestock. Eleven vegetation units were identified, including natural herbaceous-shrubby steppes, xerophilous and hygrophilous meadows, pure and mixed forests of Nothofagus pumilio (Nothofagaceae) and Araucaria araucana (Araucariaceae), and P. ponderosa planted forests of dissimilar canopy cover. Xerophilous meadows on rocky outcrops held 1/3 of total richness in an extremely restricted area. Hygrophilous meadows exhibited the largest number of families and native and exotic species, and lower diversity of life forms. Dense pine stands exhibited low values of light in the undergrowth, water in the topsoil, cover of undergrowth plants, frequency of hemicriptophytes and richness and diversity of life forms. As canopy cover decreased, values for these indicators resembled those of the steppe of reference. Within a plantation, greater compatibility between conservation of diversity and wood production requires maintenance of fencing, reduced tree spacing over long rotations and the development of buffer zones and biological corridors.

There have been few studies on the impact of this land-use change on stocks of soil organic matter (SOM) only one study reported the state of vigour of the pastures. The aim of this study was to estimate the overall change in SOM stocks 16 years after the removal of forest vegetation in this biome in southern Bahia and the installation of pastures of Brachiaria brizantha fertilized with N and maintained under controlled grazing. Soil samples were taken for evaluation of density and texture and for analyses of C and N total and 13C abundance to a depth of 100 cm at 100 m intervals along four transects of 400 m from the pastures into the forest. Grazing was found not to have any significant effect on soil density (compaction). The live weight gain of the Nellore cattle on both cultivars of B. brizantha, fertilized with 120 kg N ha−1 yr−1 as urea during 12 years, was close to 500 kg ha−1 yr−1. The gain in soil C was similar under the two grass cultivars, being approximately 15 Mg C ha−1 to a depth of 30 cm and 20 Mg C ha−1 to 100 cm. The 13C abundance data showed that the large gain in soil C was due to the slow decomposition of the forest-derived C (total loss 12.6 Mg C ha−1 over 16 years) and the large accumulation of C derived from the Brachiaria (total gain 43.2 Mg C ha−1).

To better understand the outcomes of these strategies, a sustainability assessment was conducted in properties that participated in the research (improved caívas; IC) and those that did not (traditional caívas; TC). The Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture Systems (SAFA) tool 2.0.0 for smallholders was chosen as it evaluates the productive unit as a whole using environmental, social, economic, and governance indicators and is tailored for small-scale production. All evaluated indicators showed higher scores for IC properties in relation to TC. In general, the SAFA analysis showed that when evaluated as productive systems, TCs are a strategic option for rural development, as 65% of their indicators were evaluated as good. With the support of rural outreach and research and the adoption of appropriate technologies, this percentage increased to 86% in ICs. These results confirm that with adequate support caívas can significantly contribute to the development of more sustainable livestock farming in Southern Brazil. © 2019 by the authors.",Agroforestry and SAFA and Sustainability indicators and Traditional ecological knowledge and Araucaria and Brazil and Parana [Brazil] and Santa Catarina and Animalia and Araucaria and agroforestry and animal husbandry and biodiversity and livestock farming and pastoralism and pasture and silviculture and sustainability and traditional knowledge,10.3390/su11113098,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067297307&doi=10.3390%2fsu11113098&partnerID=40&md5=294b92e2d56619411be995eb47d50ce4,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 25,NA,JOUR,11,NA,NA,NA,JUN 1,2071-1050,WOS:000472632200103,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2297, 5507"

In this study we compared the C balance reported by (i) national inventories that followed the simplified method (Tier 1) of IPCC (1996/2006), with (ii) an alternative estimation derived from the meta-analysis of science-based, peer-reviewed data. We used the global databases (i) EDGAR 4.2 to get data on GHG emissions due to land conversion and livestock/crop production, and (ii) HYDE 3.1 to obtain historical series on land-use/land cover (LULC). In terms of sequestration, our study was focused on C storage as soil organic carbon (SOC) in rural lands of four countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) within the so-called MERCOSUR region. Supported by a large body of scientific evidence, we hypothesized that C gains and losses in grazing lands are not in balance and that C gains tend to be higher than C losses at low livestock densities. We applied a two-way procedure to test our hypothesis: i) a theoretical one based on the annual conversion of belowground biomass into SOC; and ii) an empirical one supported by peer-reviewed data on SOC sequestration. Average figures from both methods were combined with LULC data to reassess the net C balance in the study countries. Our results show that grazing lands generate C surpluses that could not only offset rural emissions, but could also partially or totally offset the emissions of non-rural sectors. The potential of grazing lands to sequester and store soil C should be reconsidered in order to improve assessments in future GHG inventory reports. © 2019",Carbon balance and Emissions offset and GHG inventories and Grazing lands and SOC sequestration and Argentina and Brazil and Carbon and Carbon Sequestration and Grassland and Paraguay and Soil and Uruguay and Argentina and Brazil and Paraguay and Uruguay and Agriculture and Digital storage and Land use and Organic carbon and Soils and soil organic matter and carbon and Belowground biomass and Carbon balance and GHG inventories and Grazing land and Greenhouse gases (GHG) and Land use/land cover and Scientific evidence and Simplified procedure and agricultural land and carbon balance and carbon emission and carbon sequestration and emission inventory and grazing and meta-analysis and rural area and soil carbon and agricultural management and agricultural procedures and Argentina and biomass and Brazil and carbon balance and carbon footprint and carbon storage and controlled study and crop production and land use and livestock and Paraguay and priority journal and rangeland and Review and rural area and soil analysis and Uruguay and carbon sequestration and chemistry and grassland and meta analysis and soil and Greenhouse gases,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.01.130,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060202020&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2019.01.130&partnerID=40&md5=a3c645eaeb8791e74679bd758112201c,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 65,NA,JOUR,NA,531,542,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2299

Some of these negative impacts might be mitigated by mixed-species tree interplanting to create agroforestry systems, but there is little experience with the performance of trees planted in oil palm plantations. We studied a biodiversity enrichment experiment in the lowlands of Sumatra that was established in a 6- to 12-year-old oil palm plantation by planting six tree species in different mixtures on 48 plots. Three years after tree planting, canopy cover was assessed by drone-based photogrammetry using the structure-from-motion technique. Drone-derived canopy cover estimates were highly correlated with traditional ground-based hemispherical photography along the equality line, indicating the usefulness and comparability of the approach. Canopy cover was further partitioned between oil palm and tree canopies. Thinning of oil palms before tree planting created a more open and heterogeneous canopy cover. Oil palm canopy cover was then extracted at the level of oil palms and individual trees and combined with ground-based mortality assessment for all 3,819 planted trees. For three tree species (Archidendron pauciflorum, Durio zibethinus, and Shorea leprosula), the probability of mortality during the year of the study was dependent on the amount of oil palm canopy cover. We regard the drone-based method for deriving and partitioning spatially explicit information as a promising way for many questions addressing canopy cover in ecological applications and the management of agroforestry systems. © Copyright © 2019 Khokthong, Zemp, Irawan, Sundawati, Kreft and Hölscher.",agroforestry and Indonesia and photogrammetry and SfM and structure from motion and Sumatra and UAV and unmanned aerial vehicle,10.3389/ffgc.2019.00012,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067516772&doi=10.3389%2fffgc.2019.00012&partnerID=40&md5=d44e29bdfdac5da44596d1658259424f,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 41,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,APR 30,2624-893X,WOS:000516820100001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2300, 5579"

There is also evidence of adverse selection when acceptance of the amount offered is more sensitive to the service provision already being suited to the modes of production adopted. The results, on the other hand, indicate that farmers' decisions to join the program depend not only on their opportunity costs, but also on their perceptions about specific issues, such as their environmental knowledge or awareness, inertia to change production modes, fear of additional monitoring, and level of understanding of the program.

Mangroves play an important role in carbon storage, nutrient cycling and support for the marine food web. Mangrove soils are formed by fine particles rich in organic carbon and are subject to constant fluctuations in oxygen, salinity and nutrient availability due to fresh water flux and tidal variations. Microbes play an important role in nutrient cycling in mangrove soils; however, studies on the mangrove soil microbiome are scarce. Here we compare the microbiome of pristine mangrove soil located in an environmentally protected area in Guaratuba, Southern Brazil, with the microbiome of mangrove soil affected by the presence of carbonaceaous debris eroding from an archeological site known as Sambaqui. We show that although the Sambaqui site has a major effect on soil chemistry, increasing the soil pH by 2.6 units, only minor changes in the soil microbiome were detected indicating resilience of the microbial community to pH variations. The high alpha diversity indexes and predicted metabolic potential suggest that the mangrove soil microbiome not only provides important ecological services but also may host a broad range of microbes and genes of biotechnological interest. © 2018",16S sequencing and Biodiversity and MALDI-TOF bacteria and Mangrove and Sambaqui and Brazil and Carbon and Environmental Monitoring and Microbiota and Soil and Soil Microbiology and Wetlands and Rhizophoraceae and Bacteria and Ecology and Nutrients and Organic carbon and Soils and RNA 16S and carbon and 16s sequencing and Anthropogenic activity and MALDI-TOF and MALDI-TOF bacteria and Mangrove and Mangrove soils and Microbiome and Nutrients cycling and Sambaqui and Terrestrial environments and anthropogenic effect and bacterium and biodiversity and biome and human activity and mangrove and nutrient availability and nutrient cycling and pH and soil biota and anthropology and archeology and Article and biodiversity and biotechnology and Brazil and comparative study and controlled study and DNA sequence and ecology and environmental protection and gene and mangrove and metabolism and microbial community and nonhuman and nucleotide sequence and prediction and priority journal and soil acidity and soil chemistry and soil erosion and soil microflora and environmental monitoring and microbiology and microflora and soil and wetland and Biodiversity,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.07.094,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049805457&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2018.07.094&partnerID=40&md5=35ea1d20b7cb5eeeffc022c1ebd5239f,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 23,NA,JOUR,NA,1,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2314

Unclear and conflicting tenure has been the main challenge faced by the proponents of subnational REDD+ initiatives, and accordingly, they have expended much effort to remedy the problem. This article assesses how well REDD+ has performed in laying an appropriate tenure foundation. Field research was carried out in two phases (2010–2012 and 2013–2014) in five countries (Brazil, Peru, Cameroon, Tanzania, Indonesia) at 21 subnational initiatives, 141 villages (half targeted for REDD+ interventions), and 3,754 households. Three questions are posed: 1) What was the effect of REDD+ on perceived tenure insecurity of village residents?; 2) What are the main reasons for change in the level of tenure insecurity and security from Phase 1 to Phase 2 perceived by village residents in control and intervention villages?; and 3) How do intervention village residents evaluate the impact of tenure-related interventions on community well-being? Among the notable findings are that: 1) tenure insecurity decreases slightly across the whole sample of villages, but we only find that REDD+ significantly reduces tenure insecurity in Cameroon, while actually increasing insecurity of smallholder agricultural land tenure in Brazil at the household level; 2) among the main reported reasons for increasing tenure insecurity (where it occurs) are problems with outside companies, lack of title, and competition from neighboring villagers; and 3) views on the effect of REDD+ tenure-related interventions on community well-being lean towards the positive, including for interventions that restrain access to forest. Thus, while there is little evidence that REDD+ interventions have worsened smallholder tenure insecurity (as feared by critics), there is also little evidence that the proponents’ efforts to address tenure insecurity have produced results. Work on tenure remains an urgent priority for safeguarding local livelihoods as well as for reducing deforestation. This will require increased attention to participatory engagement, improved reward systems, tenure policy reform, integration of national and local efforts, and “business-as-usual” interests. © 2018 The Authors",Climate change and Deforestation and Forest and REDD+ and Tenure and Tropical developing countries and Brazil and Cameroon and Indonesia and Peru and Tanzania and deforestation and environmental policy and future prospect and policy implementation and policy reform and reforestation and smallholder and tenure system,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.01.010,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043498321&doi=10.1016%2fj.worlddev.2018.01.010&partnerID=40&md5=8e8a9a1374c9d9c0fc3142891fc3098b,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 39,NA,JOUR,NA,376,392,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2318

Nowadays, local smallholders still use traditional practices, such as burning, to promote vegetation for cattle grazing in highland grasslands. Even though burning is normally of small extent and low frequency, such management can slow down natural forest expansion and contribute to the maintenance of grasslands, by opposing the facilitative effect of nurse araucaria trees. To comprehend the interplay between human cultural management, species interactions and the environment, it is important to better understand how these relations affect diversity and composition. Our goal was to investigate how land management, biotic interactions and abiotic factors affect saplings species richness, abundance and composition. We hypothesized that (1) land management would decrease sapling richness and abundance and change sapling composition, (2) nurse araucaria trees would increase species richness and abundance and change sapling composition, and (3) the interactive effect between land management and nurse araucaria trees would shape sapling richness, abundance and composition. Data were collected in unmanaged and managed conditions, both beneath araucaria crowns and in nearby treeless areas. Our results indicate that abundance and species composition are affected by land management and araucaria crown influence. The highest values of sapling abundance were found beneath crowns in unmanaged areas. Species composition changed between all assessed combinations of land management and crown influence. Our study demonstrates the major roles of land management and facilitation in structuring communities, despite the effects of rock and grass cover. Moreover, our results clarify patterns and processes that may emerge in natural highland grasslands, such as the conversion of grasslands into forests and the loss of cultural landscapes when the main local management actions are excluded. © 2018 Barbizan Sühs et al.

This process threatens local grassland biomes as well as the livelihoods of farm families that utilize these grasslands. In the Río de la Plata grasslands region meat production and multispecies native grasslands have coexisted for more than 400 years. Low levels of meat productivity and farm income, however, trigger replacement of native grasslands by crops and leys and threaten the survival of local beef farming systems. We studied the economic and environmental performance of beef farming in the region based on interviews and field measurements on 280 case study farms with the following aims: (a) to identify the multi-functional economic and environmental performance of beef farms across the Rio de la Plata grasslands biome; (b) to identify farms with ‘outstanding’ multi-functional performance; (c) to compare performance levels with those found in other regions; and (d) to discuss the implications of the outstanding farms for the development of new systems of meat production. The representativeness of the case study farms was ascertained by comparing them with a farm typology constructed from survey data of 15,448 beef farms situated predominantly on native grasslands in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. We identified seven farm types on the basis of farm size, labour, farm specialization, land use and stocking rate. We identified positive deviant farms based on Pareto-ranking and compared these with a classification based on threshold values provided by experts. Out of the 280 farms, 41 were ranked as Pareto-optimal, i.e. outperformed other farms in one or more indicators without being outperformed in other indicators. Out of these, 5 were positive deviants, achieving on average 192 kg LW ha−1 yr−1 of livestock productivity and 201 US$ ha−1 year−1 farm income, having most favourable values for fossil energy consumption, phosphorus balance, carbon footprint and having over 95% of their land under native grassland as a proxy for biodiversity conservation value. Four of these farms belonged to farm types that together represented 55% of the population, suggesting scope for widescale improvement. Compared to the values reported for the OECD countries the beef farming systems of the Río de la Plata grasslands region consume less energy and positive deviant farms demonstrated approximately average livestock productivity and carbon footprint. Increasing livestock productivity in the Rio de la Plata grasslands region resulted in a stronger decline of the carbon footprint without compromising the current negligible levels of fossil fuel energy use. Further elucidation of management practices that lead to positive deviant performance will require modelling of the interaction of pasture and herd dynamics at farm level and is needed to support targeted policy support for sustainable natural grassland-based beef production in the region. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Carbon footprint and Grazing and Livestock and Multivariate analysis and Nutrient balance and South America and Sustainability and Argentina and Argentina and Brazil and Pampas and Rio de la Plata and Uruguay and Beef and Biodiversity and Conservation and Emission control and Energy utilization and Environmental management and Farms and Land use and Multivariant analysis and Nutrients and Pareto principle and Productivity and Sustainable development and Beef production and Case-studies and Economic and environmental performance and Farming system and Grazing and Livestock and Meat production and Multi variate analysis and Nutrient balance and South America and carbon footprint and crop plant and economic impact and ecoregion and environmental impact and farm and grassland and grazing and identification method and income and land use change and livestock farming and meat and multivariate analysis and nutrient budget and OECD and performance assessment and sustainability and Carbon footprint,10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.01.038,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042867758&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolind.2018.01.038&partnerID=40&md5=6fceab4aec302101803d9f2c53d8c939,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 60,NA,JOUR,NA,755,770,NA,JUN,1470-160X and 1872-7034,WOS:000430760900073,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2321, 5008"

Carbon stock assessment using forest canopy density mapper in agroforestry land in Berau, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 20: 2661-2676. In the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) program, remote sensing is the most important tool for measuring forest cover and carbon dynamic, including the utilization of software Forest Canopy Density (FCD) mapper. However, there have been rarely untested the accuracy of FCD applied in agroforestry landscapes to support carbon stock assessment compared to conventional field measurement data. This research was aimed to investigate the correlation between: (i) the value of FCD (%) and tree stand density (N/ha), (ii) the value of FCD (%) and basal area (m2/ha), (iii) the value of FCD (%) and total carbon stock (Mg C/ha), and iv) total carbon stock and percentage of canopy closure (%). Tree stand density, basal area, carbon stock and canopy profile were conventionally measured by trained members of local communities. The results of this study showed that the R2 between FCD and tree density was 37.7% (r = 61.4%), while the R2 between FCD and the basal area was 3.33% (r = 18.3%). The result of normality and heteroscedasticity tests showed that FCD was more accurate and precise in estimating the tree stand density model than the basal area model. Total carbon stock differed significantly (p<0.1) from tree density with R2 = 27.7% (r = 27.3%). Total carbon can be predicted using FCD with total carbon (Mg C/ha) = 13.005 + 0.826 FCD. Our findings suggest that FCD can be used as a new method to estimate tree density and total carbon stock cheaply, efficiently and accurately to support carbon stock assessment in agroforest practices.

Most climate strategies require maintaining or increasing land-based carbon3 while meeting food demands, which are expected to grow by more than 50 per cent by 20501,2,4. A finite global land area implies that fulfilling these strategies requires increasing global land-use efficiency of both storing carbon and producing food. Yet measuring the efficiency of land-use changes from the perspective of greenhouse gas emissions is challenging, particularly when land outputs change, for example, from one food to another or from food to carbon storage in forests. Intuitively, if a hectare of land produces maize well and forest poorly, maize should be the more efficient use of land, and vice versa. However, quantifying this difference and the yields at which the balance changes requires a common metric that factors in different outputs, emissions from different agricultural inputs (such as fertilizer) and the different productive potentials of land due to physical factors such as rainfall or soils. Here we propose a carbon benefits index that measures how changes in the output types, output quantities and production processes of a hectare of land contribute to the global capacity to store carbon and to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions. This index does not evaluate biodiversity or other ecosystem values, which must be analysed separately. We apply the index to a range of land-use and consumption choices relevant to climate policy, such as reforesting pastures, biofuel production and diet changes. We find that these choices can have much greater implications for the climate than previously understood because standard methods for evaluating the effects of land use4–11 on greenhouse gas emissions systematically underestimate the opportunity of land to store carbon if it is not used for agriculture. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.","Agriculture and Animals and Biofuels and Brazil and Carbon Footprint and Carbon Sequestration and Conservation of Natural Resources and Crops, Agricultural and Diet and Fertilizers and Food Supply and Forestry and Forests and Global Warming and Greenhouse Effect and Humans and Livestock and Rain and Soil and Zea mays and carbon and rain and biofuel and fertilizer and agricultural procedures and biodiversity and biofuel production and carbon footprint and carbon storage and climate change and crop production and ecosystem and environmental policy and fertilizer application and food industry and land use and Letter and maize and priority journal and quantitative analysis and reforestation and vegetation and agriculture and animal and Brazil and carbon sequestration and catering service and chemistry and crop and diet and environmental protection and forest and forestry and greenhouse effect and human and livestock and metabolism and prevention and control and procedures and soil and statistics and numerical data and supply and distribution",10.1038/s41586-018-0757-z,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058572459&doi=10.1038%2fs41586-018-0757-z&partnerID=40&md5=c2af557b55bcef315b71558c606e503c,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 379,NA,JOUR,7735,249,253,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2325

We identify a feedback mechanism between sea level and peatland carbon sequestration in Sundaland that reduced atmospheric CO2 concentration by about 4–5 ppm and increased δ13C by 0.05‰ during the Holocene.

Such studies would assist in informing ecological restoration of these degraded sites. Here, a chronosequence approach was used to investigate early-stage primary succession on overburden spoil wastes derived from coal mining in a tropical climate over a 64-month period. Plant species composition and several microclimatic and spoil physicochemical and microbial properties were measured, and responses analysed using regression and multivariate (nonmetric multidimensional scaling) analyses. A clear primary successional process was described showing that vegetation cover and species richness generally increased through time with a successional pathway from graminoids and herbs as the early dominants, shrubs in midsuccession, and trees in the later-successional stages. Two important differences were noted between our results and primary successions elsewhere; a lower abundance of nitrogen-fixing species and the colonization by some late-successional shrubs and trees at the start. During the succession, aggregate stability and organic matter (total C) increased—whereas electrical conductivity and some potentially toxic elements (Al, B) decreased. The constant high spoil moisture content appears to be an important determinant of vegetation development during primary succession and may be a factor in the rapid pace of succession detected here. The lessons for ecological restoration for coal overburden spoil under tropical conditions are that succession can proceed relatively rapidly. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",coal mining and ecological restoration and ecosystem development and species diversity and spoil physicochemical properties and tropical rainforest and Biodiversity and Coal and Coal mines and Nitrogen fixation and Reforestation and Restoration and Tropics and Vegetation and Coal mining and Ecological restoration and Ecosystem development and Physicochemical property and Tropical rain forest and Ecology,10.1002/ldr.3162,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053869128&doi=10.1002%2fldr.3162&partnerID=40&md5=e75bfe59d04c25c68360fed32c0e5c68,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 27,NA,JOUR,11,4050,4060,NA,NOV,1085-3278 and 1099-145X,WOS:000449541200020,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2330, 5124"

Although several lines of evidence indicate that peat burning was a dominant contributor to emissions in the region, El Niño-induced drought is also known to increase deforestation fires and agricultural waste burning in plantations. As a result, uncertainties remain with respect to partitioning emissions among different ecosystem and fire types. Here we measured the radiocarbon content (14C) of carbonaceous aerosol samples collected in Singapore from September 2014 through October 2015, with the aim of identifying the age and origin of fire-emitted fine particulate matter (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 μm). The Δ14C of fire-emitted aerosol was −76 ± 51, corresponding to a carbon pool of combusted organic matter with a mean turnover time of 800 ± 420 y. Our observations indicated that smoke plumes reaching Singapore originated primarily from peat burning (∼85%), and not from deforestation fires or waste burning. Atmospheric transport modeling confirmed that fires in Sumatra and Borneo were dominant contributors to elevated PM2.5 in Singapore during the fire season. The mean age of the carbonaceous aerosol, which predates the Industrial Revolution, highlights the importance of improving peatland fire management during future El Niño events for meeting climate mitigation and air quality commitments. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

By using occupational ergonomics approach, this paper aims to examine how the Indonesian mandatory SFM certification, the so-called Pengelolaan Hutan Produksi Lestari (PHPL) positioned forestry workers in its SFM scheme. This issue is important since forestry work is a well-known profession with high occupational safety and health (OSH) risk. Content analysis on occupational ergonomics-related national policies and the mandatory PHPL Criteria and Indicators (C&I), and interviews with forest managers, PHPL auditor, and forestry workers indicate the poor performance of the instrument to assess the occupational-ergonomics-related factors at a practical level. This study reveals that PHPL is more of administrative liability obligation fulfillments rather than performance-based fulfillments (meanwhile, OSH status should be seen as an outcome of a good safety culture rather than an artifact/document). This study verifies content-overlap among the verifiers, content mismatch between the verifiers and the actual characteristic of forest operation, and the absence of distinct assessment standard. This study also discovers the existence of “ergonomics holes” in the PHPL C&I: (1) promoting a safe working environment for forestry workers, (2) distinct organization structural linkage on safety responsibility assignments, (3) emergency procedure, (4) distinct qualification for heavy machine operator and chemical technician, (5) sub-contract workers, and (6) the importance of management commitment and workers’ participation.

Mangrove forests are considered some of the most carbon-dense ecosystems in the world with most of the carbon stored in the soil. In order for mangrove forests to be included in climate mitigation efforts, knowledge of the spatial distribution of mangrove soil carbon stocks are critical. Current global estimates do not capture enough of the finer scale variability that would be required to inform local decisions on siting protection and restoration projects. To close this knowledge gap, we have compiled a large georeferenced database of mangrove soil carbon measurements and developed a novel machine-learning based statistical model of the distribution of carbon density using spatially comprehensive data at a 30 m resolution. This model, which included a prior estimate of soil carbon from the global SoilGrids 250 m model, was able to capture 63% of the vertical and horizontal variability in soil organic carbon density (RMSE of 10.9 kg m-3). Of the local variables, total suspended sediment load and Landsat imagery were the most important variable explaining soil carbon density. Projecting this model across the global mangrove forest distribution for the year 2000 yielded an estimate of 6.4 Pg C for the top meter of soil with an 86-729 Mg C ha-1 range across all pixels.

Assessment on the effects of particle sizes (S) and application rates (R) of rice-husk biochar was executed through pot experiments in a greenhouse of Universitas Sriwijaya, Indonesia, from January to April 2017. The experiment was laid out in randomized block arrangement with three replications. S consisted of particle sizes ≤1 mm (S1) and > 1 mm (S2). R consisted of application rates at 1 t ha-1 (R1), 2 t ha-1 (R2), 3 t ha-1 (R3), and 4 t ha-1 (R4). Rice growth, yield, and growth analysis were measured during vegetative and generative stage. Soil chemical properties were analyzed after harvesting. Results indicated that application of biochar increased soil pH but did not affect cation exchange capacity (CEC), and availability of major soil nutrients. During vegetative stage, biochar application increased relative growth rate (RGR) and net assimilation rate (NAR) but decreased leaf are ratio (LAR). R3 treatment significantly increased grain weight per panicle, number of filled spikelet, and weight of 1000 grains. Root and stem N content tended to be higher with biochar application.

Although carbon releases are associated to the ecosystem functions of climate regulation and are essential ecological processes that sustain life, their incremental economic impact is difficult to estimate. Using the InVEST model, this work quantifies and assesses the value of the carbon balance generated by predictive land-use change (LUC) scenarios for the Northern Coast of São Paulo State, Brazil. In this case, carbon losses are explained by the suppression of natural vegetation and human intervention associated to global warming. We analyzed three scenarios: i) the more conservative “legal framework”; ii) the “status quo” which represents the current development level; and iii) the “new ventures” encompassing all new infrastructure projects in the region. The carbon losses in the “legal framework” and “status quo” scenarios are similar to those of past periods: around 3.7 million MgC in twenty years, pointing to net current values of US$ 47 million. However, carbon losses exceeded 7 million MgC when considering factors linked to the “new ventures” scenario, such as infrastructure logistics, oil-gas exploration and pressure on natural environments. In this case, monetary losses could amount to US$ 90 million in 20 years.

Rural development has been a simultaneous goal with a primary focus on irrigation. Irrigated agriculture, however, has suffered from poor soils, insufficient water management strategies, and a disregard for integrating grazing-based smallholdings outside of the irrigation schemes. Recurrent droughts are distressing all sectors. This synthesis assessed sustainable land management options by investigating the aquatic and terrestrial land use systems alongside their underlying ecosystem functions and services. Decisions about the allocation of scarce water proved to be both the major issue of land use discourses and driver of practices. The primarily hydroelectricity-focused water management practice cannot be maintained at the same level in the long run, as it has become ever more adverse towards competing water usages. The increasing use of the water and adjacent land also constitutes a major potential threat to water quality. Managed water level fluctuations should generally mimic natural patterns. Wind and solar power generation are suitable complements to agricultural land use. Cycling scarce nutrients between aquatic and terrestrial sectors is ambitious but promising, ultimately improving the generally poor soils in the area. Smart management of biodiversity can foster intensively-irrigated cropping, although the non-irrigated Caatinga ecosystem needs better management of its conflicting uses. Aims and responsibilities of multi-level planning and management require clarification and coordination between sectors, while practices of public participation should be revised in order to better support a comprehensive and transparent transition towards sustainability. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Access to water and Collaborative project and Diversity and Large dams and Sustainable land management,10.1007/s10113-018-1302-1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042608441&doi=10.1007%2fs10113-018-1302-1&partnerID=40&md5=f74e1f6d0366a16d6179c515d778c0a2,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 14,NA,JOUR,7,2005,2017,NA,OCT,1436-3798 and 1436-378X,WOS:000445234600011,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2358, 5463"

In this study, we seek to answer the following questions: 1) How do the different phenophases of two important native food species are expressed in the three phytophysiognomies of the Cerrado (Brazilian savannah) where they are collected? 2) How does rainfall influence the expression of the phenophases of these species on the evaluated phytophysiognomies? 3) Does the local ecological knowledge of the residents of the Araripe National Forest (hereafter FLONA) on the phenophases of native species of high importance correspond to what occurs in the three phytophysiognomies of the Cerrado? The phenological monitoring was executed monthly from January 2012 to December 2013. In order to retrieve the local knowledge about phenophases, key informants from three communities located around the FLONA were selected. Rainfall is a limiting factor for the expression of the reproductive phenophases of Caryocar coriaceum, differently from what occurs for the vegetative phases and for Hancornia speciosa. There were no significant differences between the local knowledge of communities that collect resources in the forest and most of the data collected in the phenological evaluation. In addition, there was no difference in the expression of the phenophases among the three phytophysiognomies, also corroborating with the local ecological knowledge. As for the community that collects in agroforestry yards, there were significant differences between knowledge and expression of phenophases. Thus, the use of local ecological knowledge of people who collect resources in the forest has proved to be reliable and may be promising mainly in rapid diagnoses of biodiversity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Ethnobiology and Ethnoecology and Participatory methodology and Phenological calendar and Phenology and Araripe National Forest and Brazil and Ceara and Caryocar and Hancornia speciosa and Arid regions and Biodiversity and Ecology and Rain and Ethnobiology and Ethnoecology and Participatory methodology and Phenological calendar and Phenology and agroforestry and biodiversity and cerrado and ethnobotany and limiting factor and management practice and methodology and native species and phenology and rainfall and savanna and semiarid region and strategic approach and traditional knowledge and Forestry,10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.07.016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050134624&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolind.2018.07.016&partnerID=40&md5=72d0e5c8861d4adfe294b9c9212a19f5,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 14,NA,JOUR,NA,75,84,NA,DEC,1470-160X and 1872-7034,WOS:000456907400008,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2361, 5565"

The region represents an important natural capital for biodiversity conservation as well as for agricultural and forestry production. However, little is known of the species richness and diversity of soil macroinvertebrates in this region. In the present study we evaluated earthworm species occurrence and richness in five land use systems (LUS) in the southern part of the Campos Gerais in Lapa county. Earthworms were handsorted from up to 18 soil monoliths on five occasions over three years (Feb. 2014, Feb., Mar., Nov. 2015, Jul. 2016) in the following LUS: old native forest, native grassland, young regenerating forest and grass lawn in the Uru Reserve and annual crop fields (soybean) in neighboring private farms (not all systems were sampled on all occasions). Nine earthworm species belonging to four families and five genera were found, of which six were native and three exotic species (Dichogaster gracilis, Amynthas gracilis, A. corticis). Of the native species, Urobenus brasiliensis and Andiorrhinus duseni (a large bodied-worm) are already well known from S and SE Brazil, while the remaining four were new species that require further description (Fimoscolex n.sp.1 and n.sp.2, Glossoscolex n.sp.1 and n.sp.2). In general, more species were found in February (summer) than March and November. The cropping system (soybean) had the lowest abundance and species richness in relation to other sites, although in the young and old forests no earthworms were found on some sample dates. Given the several new species found in this small reserve, and the relatively few sites studied thus far in the Campos Gerais, further efforts are needed to adequately characterize the earthworm fauna of the region, from which many other species are expected.

The objective of this work was to study the effect of land use system (LUS) on the abundance and diversity of soil spider families and their relationship with soil physical and chemical properties. The evaluated LUS were: native forest, eucalyptus reforestation, pasture, crop-livestock integration, and no-tillage crop. Samples were collected in three municipalities of Southern Plateau of Santa Catarina, considered as true replicates, during winter and summer. A total of 270 samples was taken in each area and season. The sampling points were arranged in a grid of 3 × 3 m, spaced by 30 m. We evaluated soil physical, chemical, and microbiological attributes and the abundance and diversity of spider families, collected by soil monolith and soil traps. A total of 448 spiders were captured, 152 in winter and 296 in summer, distributed in 24 families and 52 species/morphospecies. There was a seasonality effect related to the land use systems and the highest Shannon-Wiener diversity index was recorded in the native forest in both sampling periods. Most families of spiders have a direct dependence on soil physical and chemical properties, such as microporosity, exchangeable aluminum, calcium, magnesium, and potassium during the winter. Organic matter, nitrogen, pH in water, weighted average diameter, soil density, and microbial biomass carbon exhibited dependence during the summer. Vegetation type and soil management are the factors that seem to affect most the occurrence of spiders.

The objectives of the research were to evaluate the level of landscape vegetation diversity in agroforestry systems and to determine the effect of elevation, accessibility, and farmer's income and perception on vegetation diversity in agroforestry systems. The research was conducted in Sigi District, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. The method used was the Multidisciplinary Landscape Assessment approach. The research sites were located in 3 districts and 6 representative villages i.e. Padende and Sibedi in the lower landscape (23-75 m asl.), Balane and Doda in the middle landscape (148-504 m asl.), Dombu and Ongulero in the upper landscape (1163-1404 m asl.), with 5 replications in each village. The total area of the six villages was 3772.13 ha that consisted of 1217.13 ha of agroforestry systems (32.3%). The research covered a population of 392 households who had landed with agroforestry systems. A total of 30 agroforestry farmers and their land (minimum 0.25 ha, homogeneous land system) were selected as samples. Research activities like observation, survey, and analysis were divided into two aspects, namely biophysical and socioeconomic aspects. The results revealed that at landscape level agroforestry systems had relatively high plant species diversity (H'= 3.1) and needed to be optimized to enhance its role as buffering zone for biodiversity conservation and for supporting sustainable livelihood. Efforts to improve vegetation diversity must be adjusted to habitat conditions (elevation and soil health), where vegetation can grow and produce well. The regional development such as accessibility improvement is still needed and it will not threaten the vegetation diversity as long as there is a harmony between human activities and the environment. An increase in the level of income with a positive perception of farmers on the benefits of vegetation diversity in the future will have a main role in vegetation diversity conservation as fundamental asset in sustainable development. © 2019, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

Brazil has a great opportunity to successfully participate in REDD+ not only because of its huge Amazon forest area (ca. 4 million km2) but also because of its advanced forest monitoring system “PRODES”. However, this opportunity could be threatened due to the current differentiated monitoring capacities of most Brazilian Amazon states, markedly in High-Forest and Low-Deforestation (HFLD) regions. This is evident in the State of Amapá which despite its political will to support actions towards the design of its REDD+ strategy, is still struggling with key technical aspects of forest monitoring. To address this issue and to strengthen the on-going REDD+ design process we assessed a) land use and land cover (LULC) changes for period of 23 years (1985–2008); b) estimated CO2 emissions associated to these LULC changes; c) identified the main drivers and agents of deforestation, and d) discussed policy implications for REDD+ implementation in a HFLD area. We applied a methodology, which is capable of reducing cloud cover using temporal filters on the classified images, detecting deforestation (and forest degradation) in areas as small as 1 ha, and used the decision tree method to identify different LULC types. This methodology was able to demonstrate that forest cover in northern Amapá has remained almost untouched during the observed period of 23-years. As many other HFLD areas, this region has a great potential to receive financial benefits from the REDD+ mechanism, especially from voluntary markets that are largely interested in the conservation value of these areas. However, the use of high accuracy LULC classification approaches, with appropriate Measuring, Reporting and Verification systems should be part of the REDD+ implementation strategy of HFLD areas towards having high standards for certified carbon, and therefore improved chances to receive better prices for carbon offsets. The potential of REDD+ to be a fair and efficient mechanism will also depend on the recognition of the historical efforts to avoid deforestation in HFLD areas, mainly by Federal Governments, as an incentive for low-carbon development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Deforestation and Low CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and LULC classification and REDD+ and Remote sensing and Amapa and Amazonia and Brazil and carbon emission and deforestation and emission control and environmental monitoring and implementation process and land classification and land cover and land use change and remote sensing,10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.02.015,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044144936&doi=10.1016%2fj.landusepol.2018.02.015&partnerID=40&md5=6fc30f21b1b2f6e2635da0f71764f645,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 16,NA,JOUR,NA,414,421,NA,JUL,0264-8377 and 1873-5754,WOS:000435619900040,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2370, 4955"

Since the natural products of the mangrove forest, such as wood and seafood, are not able to meet the economic needs of the local community, some areas have been converted into brackish water ponds with traditional aquaculture systems. The growth of brackish water ponds over the last five decades has been identified as the main cause of ecosystem destruction. However, the mangrove ecosystem has been restored naturally through tidal action and seeds falling from mangrove trees. Methods: This study focused on the mangrove tree species Rhizophora apiculata, with ages ranging from 3 to 40 years. Initially, the study site (area, 1 ha) was plotted. The study sample size included 30% of the local population, chosen by systematic random sampling. The data collection was undertaken as follows: 1) measurement of the diameter and height of mangrove trees; 2) observation of local fish auctions; and 3) interviewing of fishers and local communities regarding the direct use of the natural products of the mangrove ecosystem. Results: It is suggested that the total income from wood production is IDR 742,425,000 year -1or US $0.933 person -1day -1. Furthermore, the total income from fishing is IDR 1,080,353,280 year -1or US $1.43 person -1day -1. Pre-thinning income level for wood harvesting is still low. The income difference between wood production and fishing resulted in the rate of overfishing reaching 45.5%. The highest observed wood production was reached at the age of 25 years, and the highest value of mean annual increment (MAI) is 5.39 m 3ha -1at the age of 40 years. Conclusions: This study showed that tree thinning, ranging from 90 to 350 trees ha -1, can increase the value of MAI by around 24.5%. © 2019 Lahjie AM et al.","Direct use and Economic valuation and Ecosystem services and Mangrove restoration and Bays and Conservation of Natural Resources and Ecosystem and Fisheries and Indonesia and Rhizophoraceae and Wetlands and adolescent and adult and article and child and female and fishing and forest and height and human and Indonesia and major clinical study and male and mangrove and nonhuman and peer review and plant seed and sample size and bay and ecosystem and environmental protection and fishery and growth, development and aging and Indonesia and Rhizophoraceae and wetland",10.12688/f1000research.17012.2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065636862&doi=10.12688%2ff1000research.17012.2&partnerID=40&md5=7d2b36c133bc006854bd80dd53cf8f81,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 20,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2374

Assessing the feasibility of forest plantation of native species: A case study of Agathis dammara and Eusideroxylon zwageri in Balikpapan, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 20: 2453-2461. Plantation forest using native species is very important effort to support biodiversity conservation. Still, analysis of its feasibility is needed to guarantee sustainable forest management. The research aims were to assess the feasibility of plantation forestry of Agathis dammara and Eusideroxylon zwageri based on production models and financial simulation of stands management. The production models were developed based on plantation forests in Balikpapan, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Using these plantations we developed models to estimate tree volume, total volume per hectare, Mean Annual Volume Increment (MAI) and Current Annual Increment (CAI) for each species. Financial analyses were carried out to assess the Pay Back Period (PBP), Net Present Value (NPV), Net Benefit/Cost (B/C) Ratio, Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Equivalent Annual Annuity (EAA). The results of production model showed that A. dammara stands would reach optimum production at the age of 25 years while that of E. zwageri at the age of 150 years. A. dammara stands produce higher MAI of 15.67 m3ha-1 year-1 and total volume of 383.72 m3ha-1 than E. zwageri with MAI 1.89 m3ha-1 year-1 and total volume of 282.78 m3ha-1. The result of financial analysis showed that A. dammara plantation had the IRR higher than the Minimum Acceptable Rate (MAR) and the Net B/C Ratio of higher than 1, while E. zwageri had the Net B/C Ratio of lower than 1. A. dammara plantation also had a positive NPV value of IDR 78,699,974 while E. zwageri plantation had a negative NPV value of IDR 91,439,292.

Uncontrolled late season fires promote deforestation, produce greenhouse gases (~25% of Brazil's land-use related CO2 emissions between 2003 and 2005) and are a major threat to the conservation of biodiversity in protected areas. Governmental institutions therefore implemented early dry season (EDS) prescribed burnings as part of integrated fire management (IFM) in protected areas of the Cerrado, with the aim to reduce the area and severity of late dry season (LDS) fires. The planning and implementation of EDS prescribed burning is supported by satellite-based geo-information on fuel conditions, derived from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data. The Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering algorithm was used to analyse the data, and the relationship between the resulting matched fractions (dry vegetation, green vegetation and soil) and in situ surface fuel samples was assessed. The linear regression of in situ data versus matched filter scores (MF scores) of dry vegetation showed an r2 of 0.81 (RMSE = 0.15) and in situ data versus MF scores of soil showed an r2 of 0.65 (RMSE = 0.38). To predict quantitative fuel load, a multiple linear regression analysis was carried out with MF scores of NPV and soil as predictors (adjusted r2 = 0.86; p < 0.001; standard error = 0.075). The fuel load maps were additionally evaluated by fire managers while planning EDS prescribed burning campaigns. The fuel load mapping approach has proven to be an effective tool for integrated fire management by improving the planning and implementation of prescribed burning, promoting pyrodiversity, prioritising fire suppression and evaluating fire management efforts to meet overall conservations goals.

Our results demonstrated that, when compared with the NV, intercropping systems conducted with minimum soil tillage were effective in maintaining and sometimes increasing the levels and stocks of SOC and some SOM fractions such as microbial C and humic substances, and therefore, these systems can be an alternative form of sustainable soil management in the semiarid region of Brazil. © 2019 CSIRO.",semiarid soils and soil organic matter and soil quality and soil tillage and Brazil and Cajanus cajan and Gossypium hirsutum and Sesamum indicum and Zea mays and Agronomy and Arid regions and Biogeochemistry and Biological materials and Forestry and Organic carbon and Intercropping systems and Semiarid soils and Soil carbon sequestration and Soil organic carbon and Soil organic matters and Soil quality and Soil tillage and Sustainable soil management and carbon sequestration and crop plant and intercropping and organic carbon and semiarid region and soil carbon and soil management and soil organic matter and soil quality and tillage and Soils,10.1071/SR17336,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063077205&doi=10.1071%2fSR17336&partnerID=40&md5=fecae461e3aa1bd2491544a8926b9b6a,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 15,NA,JOUR,3,266,275,NA,NA,1838-675X and 1838-6768,WOS:000463909500007,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2385, 5268"

Overall, density and basal area of canopy trees in the restoration plantation reached 73% and 46%, respectively, of the values found in the reference forest, but ground cover by exotic grasses was substantially higher in the planted forest.

Specifically, spectral-temporal trajectories associated with successional forest change occurring over prolonged periods of time may enhance periodic ‘snapshot’ monitoring methods, especially for species that exhibit complex and non-linear dynamics. In this paper, Landsat time-series are used to examine the spectral-temporal signatures of bamboo-dominated forest succession occurring within the critically threatened Araucaria Forest, a pine-dominated subtype of the Atlantic Forest in southern Brazil. Alteration of canopy structure through ongoing anthropogenic disturbance has increased understorey light climate and given opportunity for native invasive bamboos to flourish, resulting in drastic reduction of tree regeneration and loss of biodiversity. We aimed to evaluate how spectral-temporal signatures could be used to (1) characterize stages of bamboo-dominated forest succession, (2) identify synchrony of bamboo lifecycle dynamics and (3) classify regions of bamboo-dominated forest. Changepoint analysis was performed using an extracted sample spectral-temporal signature and trajectories were fit to the resulting segments using linear regression. Based on slope values of the fitted segments, a novel description incorporating temporal information of bamboo-dominated forest succession was developed which identified four broad phases: pioneer predominance, mature bamboo, dieback and pioneer regeneration. To determine the spatial and temporal synchrony of bamboo-dominated forest succession, a hybrid model was developed by combining the modelled segments and compared to a 32-year Landsat time-series of vegetation indices by calculating root-mean square error between each pixel in the study area. The hybrid model proficiently classified regions of bamboo-dominance, achieving between 77% and 90% accuracy, which also indicated lifecycle synchrony of bamboo populations within the study area. To further assess the performance of the hybrid model, a time-weighted dynamic time warping model approach was used to determine synchrony and classify regions of bamboo. The time-weighted dynamic time warping classifier had lower overall accuracy (68%–82%), but is still considered a useful tool for automated classification purposes that take advantage of multi-temporal imagery. To compare classification performance between ‘snapshot’ and multi-temporal imagery classifiers, a maximum-likelihood classification was performed, which attained lower overall accuracies than the hybrid model (75%–84%). Overall, the use of spectral-temporal signatures offers a novel and effective approach to both describing and modelling bamboo-dominated forest succession (and forest successional processes more generally) on a landscape-scale. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Atlantic Forest and Bamboo and Landsat time-series and Spectral-temporal modelling and Succession and Araucaria and Atlantic Forest and Brazil and Parana [Brazil] and Araucaria and Bambusa and Biodiversity and Mean square error and Reforestation and Satellite imagery and Time series and Trajectories and Atlantic forest and Forest succession and Hybrid model and Landsat time series and Multi-temporal imageries and Southern Brazil and Spectral-temporal modeling and Succession and Temporal models and Temporal signatures and accuracy assessment and anthropogenic effect and bamboo and biodiversity and canopy architecture and ecological modeling and environmental disturbance and Landsat and maximum likelihood analysis and regeneration and satellite imagery and spatiotemporal analysis and succession and time series analysis and vegetation classification and Bamboo,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.06.028,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049601280&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolmodel.2018.06.028&partnerID=40&md5=fb6134210b492293f37c59a8d30076e2,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 22,NA,JOUR,NA,316,332,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2390

Continued research has allowed us to re-evaluate the generalisations, and identify the gaps in our knowledge regarding these habitats, particularly in an Australian context. Seagrasses generally form part of a mosaic with other habitats within a seascape that contributes to its overall biodiversity of fish. Patterns of abundance and diversity of fish between seagrass and other habitats, such as unvegetated flats and reef habitats, is inconsistent and depends on the region, fish and seagrass species, and sampling method. Edge effects, adjacent habitats, and fragmentation can strongly influence fish assemblages. Seagrass structural complexity can enhance survival and growth of juvenile fishes, but recent studies show that survival rates of individual prey do not vary greatly across seagrass densities when densities of both prey and predators increase with seagrass density. The concept of the nursery habitat has been built on data from studies in estuaries or highly seasonal seagrass habitats, whereas recent studies in marine systems or cool temperate seagrass meadows suggest that this role does not always hold. Direct grazing on seagrasses by fishes occurs mainly in tropical regions, although there is a paucity of data on this process along with several other processes, from tropical Australia. Grazing on seagrasses by fishes appears to be limited in temperate regions, with consumption of seagrass restricted mainly to omnivorous species. However, tropicalisation, that is, the immigration of tropical grazers to higher latitudes due to global ocean warming, is predicted to increase grazing rates on temperate seagrasses. Reductions in seagrass biomass caused by increased grazing will disrupt connectivity processes between seagrass meadows and surrounding habitats, and are likely to have significant ramifications for the biodiversity and ecosystem services those other coastal habitats provide. Although other habitats rely on inputs of seagrass detritus, and the immigration of fish and fisheries species from their juvenile seagrass habitats, quantitative data on this link are limited. Evidence that fisheries declines, either directly or indirectly, have resulted from seagrass loss is equivocal to date, and therefore, the quantification of this role is still needed. Managing seagrass for fisheries is complex, and many fisheries agencies embrace ecosystem-based management, but do not have direct responsibility for seagrass habitat. Significant progress has been made in our knowledge of fish and fisheries in seagrasses, but our review highlights significant knowledge gaps where further research is recommended. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",NA,10.1007/978-3-319-71354-0_18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063512657&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-71354-0_18&partnerID=40&md5=57c26a6ba70240a158a8212d3a02a115,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 17,NA,CHAP,NA,589,627,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2391

In order to obtain food, water, raw materials and shelter, rural people modify forests and other ecosystems, affecting the supply of ecosystem services that contribute to livelihoods and well-being. Despite widespread awareness of the nature and extent of multiple impacts of land-use changes, there remains limited understanding of how these impacts affect trade-offs among ecosystem services and their beneficiaries across spatial scales. We assessed how rural communities in two forested landscapes in Indonesia have changed land uses over the last 20 years to adapt their livelihoods that were at risk from multiple hazards. We estimated the impact of these adaptation strategies on the supply of ecosystem services by comparing different benefits provided to people from these land uses (products, water, carbon, and biodiversity), using forest inventories, remote sensing, and interviews. Local people converted forests to rubber plantations, reforested less productive croplands, protected forests on hillsides, and planted trees in gardens. Our results show that land-use decisions were propagated at the landscape scale due to reinforcing loops, whereby local actors perceived that such decisions contributed positively to livelihoods by reducing risks and generating co-benefits. When land-use changes become sufficiently widespread, they affect the supply of multiple ecosystem services, with impacts beyond the local scale. Thus, adaptation implemented at the local-scale may not address development and climate adaptation challenges at regional or national scale (e.g. as part of UN Sustainable Development Goals or actions taken under the UNFCCC Paris Agreement). A better understanding of the context and impacts of local ecosystem-based adaptation is fundamental to the scaling up of land management policies and practices designed to reduce risks and improve well-being for people at different scales. © 2018 Fedele et al.

Increased agricultural production could reduce fallow period length with implications for manioc flour (farinha) production. We hypothesize that payments for environmental services (PES) programs may exacerbate reduction of fallow periods, thereby reducing per stem farinha productivity. To understand the household scale economic impacts of avoided deforestation under PES programs, we conducted interviews in 158 households from 32 communities in the Brazilian state of Amazonas. Using regression models, we assessed which variables most influenced farinha production, and calculated production costs and total revenues, with and without a PES program. Manioc yield increased by 22.83 kg per household per year for each additional year that the forest was left to recover before being cleared. Although production costs were higher for land cleared from older secondary forests, net profits on land cleared from primary forests were still higher. Total income from PES programs, when added to the secondary forest manioc profit, were higher than the foregone production in primary forest areas. However, when we considered only direct cash payments, we identified potential trade-offs. We conclude that PES programmes should consider possible long-term effects of payments on the livelihoods of participants. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Agriculture and Bolsa Floresta and Bolsa Verde and Deforestation and Manioc and PES and Amazonas [Brazil] and Amazonia and Brazil and Manihot esculenta and agricultural production and cost analysis and crop yield and deforestation and economic impact and ecosystem service and environmental economics and forest ecosystem and livelihood and rural population and secondary forest,10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.05.016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049349896&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolecon.2018.05.016&partnerID=40&md5=095dcc33274b0e07362eeca3919a2807,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 18,NA,JOUR,NA,378,388,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2396

Policies to avoid deforestation related to private commitments, economic incentives, and other support schemes are expected to improve the effectiveness of current command and control mechanisms increasingly. However, until recently, land tenure was unknown for much of the Brazilian territory, which has undermined the governance of native vegetation and challenged support and incentive mechanisms for avoiding deforestation. We assess the total extent of public governance mechanisms protecting aboveground carbon (AGC) stocks. We constructed a land tenure dataset for the entire nation and modeled the effects and uncertainties of major land-use acts on protecting AGC stocks. Roughly 70% of the AGC stock in Brazil is estimated to be under legal protection, and an additional 20% is expected to be protected after areas in the Amazon with currently undesignated land undergo a tenure regularization. About 30% of the AGC stock is on private land, of which roughly two-thirds are protected. The Cerrado, Amazon, and Caatinga biomes hold about 40%, 30%, and 20% of the unprotected AGC, respectively. Effective conservation of protected and unprotected carbon will depend on successful implementation of the Forest Act, and regularization of land tenure in the Amazon. Policy development that prioritizes unprotected AGC stocks is warranted to promote conservation of native vegetation beyond the legal requirements. However, different biomes and land tenure structures may require different policy settings considering local and regional specifics. Finally, the fate of current AGC stocks relies upon effective implementation of command and control mechanisms, considering that unprotected AGC in native vegetation on private land only accounts for 6.5% of the total AGC stock. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",aboveground carbon and Brazil and climate change and ecosystem services and forest Act and land tenure and land-use governance and Agriculture and Brazil and Carbon and Carbon Sequestration and Conservation of Natural Resources and Ecosystem and Forests and Ownership and carbon and agriculture and Brazil and carbon sequestration and chemistry and ecosystem and environmental protection and forest and legislation and jurisprudence and organization and management,10.1111/gcb.14011,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044789716&doi=10.1111%2fgcb.14011&partnerID=40&md5=8c82812546f8e8ab288d511dac013ff0,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 35,NA,JOUR,5,2129,2142,NA,MAY,1354-1013 and 1365-2486,WOS:000428879800024,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2399, 4377"

The motivations of farmers to take part in PES programs, however, is still largely unknown. Most of the recent studies on the theme have investigated factors influencing participation but a few of them have looked at the factors explaining the minimum financial compensation that farmers would expect to receive to join PES. Particularly scarce are the studies aiming to understand the relationships between the minimum amount of money (MAM) that farmers would demand to get involved in PES programs for forest conservation and restoration and the impacts of such programs on PES additionality. We focused our study on the early stages of the PES program of the Chapecó Ecological Corridor, an important agricultural region that provides vital ecosystem services in Southern Brazil. One hundred farmers from 21 municipalities were interviewed. Data were tested using maximum likelihood and the model selection approach. Almost all farmers interviewed (94%) manifested interested in taking part in a PES program focused on forest conservation, but only 48% would like to get involved in a forest restoration program. PES program modality (100%), farmers’ income (65%) and educational level (54%) were the most important variables influencing the minimum amount of money required by farmers to get involved. In average, the farmers would expect 35% more for forest restoration (US$ 185.56/ha) than for conservation (US$ 116.53/ha) programs. In any case, however, the net increase of forest cover resulting from the PES program would be insignificant. Nevertheless, PES could provide some additionality by halting forest degradation and by helping to curb small-scale and illegal deforestation. The low interest in restoration activities may jeopardize the PES program goals and cause negative impact on the implementation of the National Forest Act in the region. To overcome this constraint, the PES program managers should work with the farmers to raise awareness about the relevance of forest restoration in a region with seasonal water shortages, high level of erosion and of water pollution. © 2017",Additionality and Forest conservation and Forest restoration and Mata Atlântica and Atlantic Forest and Brazil and Mata Atlantica Biosphere Reserve and compensation system and conservation and ecosystem service and environmental legislation and farmers attitude and forest management and maximum likelihood analysis and restoration ecology,10.1016/j.jrurstud.2017.06.008,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021944145&doi=10.1016%2fj.jrurstud.2017.06.008&partnerID=40&md5=f55374d627fb3eb8b777d661e8714b67,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 46,NA,JOUR,NA,177,186,NA,AUG,0743-0167 and 1873-1392,WOS:000411545000015,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2403, 4323"

We used a mix of methods to complement ecosystem services identified in the academic literature with those perceived as such by local people. We analyzed these locally perceived mangrove services in relation to community livelihoods, and highlighted that local people identified four additional cultural services related to maintenance of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), creation and maintenance of social relationship, personal satisfaction and mental and physical relaxation. This demonstrates that local people have a symbolic relationship with the mangrove forest, which goes beyond the material approach normally used to evaluate ecosystem services.

This study aimed to evaluate the spatial variability of biological diversity indices of soil fauna under different land (agriculture and forest). Samples were collected in seven areas (millet, soybean, corn, eucalyptus, pasture crops, and preserved and disturbed Cerrado), in Maranhão state, Brazil. The soil fauna was caught trapped in pitfall traps, installed 3 m away from each other. In each area, 130 traps were maintained for seven days. After this period, they were removed and their content transferred to bottles and taken to the laboratory, where the insects were screened and identified at the level of orders and families. Eight indices were calculated, namely: individuals trap-1 day-1, Jackknife richness estimator, the Simpson, McIntosh, Shannon, and total diversity, and Simpson dominance, and Pielou equitability indices. The spatial variability was derived from the semivariograms fitted to Gaussian, spherical, and exponential geostatistical models. Statistical analysis showed medium values of the coefficient of variation for millet, except for the indices individuals trap-1 day-1 and McIntosh diversity, which were considered high. The values of the correlation matrix were negative for some indices, suggesting an inverse relationship. For millet, corn, eucalyptus, disturbed Cerrado, and pasture areas, the Shannon diversity index exhibited a pure nugget effect. For the areas of millet, corn, disturbed Cerrado and pasture, the total diversity index was adjusted to the Gaussian model. The degree of spatial dependence was considered high for the individuals trap-1 day-1 and Pielou equitability indices for millet. Only for soybean and pasture similarity in the scaled semivariograms was observed for the spatial variability of the indices, indicating similarity of performance. Soil management and land use affect the patterns of soil fauna abundance, richness, and diversity. The presence of groups such as Araneae, Diplura, and Poduromorpha are related to ecological equilibrium, quality, and sustainability of the agricultural systems studied. © 2018, Revista Brasileira de Ciencia do Solo.

The aim of this study was to perform a vegetation survey in a restoration site through three different techniques. The study site has 7.2 ha in a subtropical forest in Dois Vizinhos, Paraná state, Brazil and it is approximately 20 m from a secondary forest fragment. The experiment consisted of 12 plots with three treatments (T1-3) randomly distributed in four blocks. T1: natural regeneration through passive restoration. T2: set of nucleation techniques. T3: seedlings planted through filling and diversity lines (3x2 m). For sampling purposes, each plot was divided into 24 subplots. In order to evaluate plant presence, two years and eight months after the treatments implementation, a survey was conducted in three random subplots for each plot, where all plants taller than 50cm were identified and quantified. Native species richness was higher than 87% in all treatments, whereas the presence of herbaceous species was higher at passive restoration and woody species at plantation. The most common dispersal syndromes were anemochory and zoochory. By comparing planted and regenerated individuals for the three treatments, the plantation technique had the highest Shannon diversity index (3.017), with 148 individuals and 53 species sampled. However, there was no statistically significant difference. This higher diversity is related to the larger number of species planted, but it is still not facilitating regeneration species in its understory at this age. Considering only regenerated individuals, nucleation showed the highest Shannon diversity index (2.078) with a total of 908 individuals of 40 species, however, it wasn’t statistically significant different of passive restoration (Shannon = 1.965) which had 2,018 individuals of 40 species. The most floristic similar treatments were passive restoration and nucleation. Nucleation facilitated species natural regeneration (17 planted and 40 regenerated species) while passive restoration showed high resilience, therefore the use of passive restoration can be considered an effective alternative since its results did not differ statistically from nucleation, and the main advantage of this technique is the reduced cost. © 2018, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

The present study analyzed the land-use and land-cover changes between 2006 and 2012 in North Sumatra, Indonesia with emphasis to CO2 emissions. The land-use/land-cover consists of twenty-one classes. Redd Abacus software version 1.1.7 was used to measure carbon emission source as well as the predicted 2carbon dioxide emissions from 2006-2024. Results showed that historical emission (2006-2012) in this province, significant increases in the intensive land use namely dry land agriculture (109.65%), paddy field (16.23%) and estate plantation (15.11%). On the other hand, land-cover for forest decreased significantly: secondary dry land forest (7.60%), secondary mangrove forest (9.03%), secondary swamp forest (33.98%), and the largest one in the mixed dry land agriculture (79.96%). The results indicated that North Sumatra province is still a CO2 emitter, and the most important driver of emissions mostly derived from agricultural lands that contributed 2carbon dioxide emissions by 48.8%, changing from forest areas into degraded lands (classified as barren land and shrub) shared 30.6% and estate plantation of 22.4%. Mitigation actions to reduce carbon emissions was proposed such as strengthening the forest land, rehabilitation of degraded area, development and plantation forest, forest protection and forest fire control, and reforestation and conservation activity. These mitigation actions have been simulated to reduce 15% for forestry and 18% for peat land, respectively. This data is likely to contribute to the low emission development in North Sumatra. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Carbon dioxide and Deforestation and Fire protection and Global warming and Peat and Reforestation and Timber and Carbon dioxide emissions and Conservation activities and Historical emissions and Intensive land use and Land use and land cover change and Land use/land cover change and Plantation forests and Sumatra , Indonesia and Land use",10.1088/1755-1315/126/1/012111,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044424225&doi=10.1088%2f1755-1315%2f126%2f1%2f012111&partnerID=40&md5=9db7a12b3c0631b7131887fc3f83328d,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 14,NA,CONF,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,1755-1307,WOS:000447177400111,NA,NA,4th International Conference on Friendly City - From Research to Implementation For Better Sustainability,IOP,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2411, 5288"

In Southern Brazilian lowlands, irrigated rice (Oryza sativa L.) in combination with fallow for beef production is the dominant cropping system. This system is key to Brazilian food security but faces problems of resource use efficiency, soil preservation and greenhouse gas emissions typically associated to rice irrigation. In this research, a multi-criteria analysis of the usual rice-fallow system, and a number of alternative production Schemes – i.e., the more recent rice-soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) rotations and the newly developed systems based on large ridges, was made. The latter is based on the construction of large ridges (8 m width) on which rainfed maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean, conducted in no-tillage, are integrated with either beef-livestock production or cover crops in winter. This study was done in an experiment that lasted for nine years. The five cropping systems were managed as independent fields and a range of indicators related to crop management, productivity and sustainability was measured. The Rice-Fallow system required the lowest amount of energy, but it had the lowest energy use efficiency and highest carbon-based environmental footprints, when expressed as greenhouse gasses emitted per kg of food produced. The rice-soybean rotation system presented an improved performance for the carbon-based footprints in comparison to the rice-fallow system. Within rice-soybean rotation, using minimum-tillage instead conventional tillage increased the overall carbon balance and the carbon sequestered into the soil as organic matter. Most strikingly, the new ridge-based systems exhibited the most favourable values for many of the indicators. The more diverse rotation system, and particularly the extension of the growing season to winter, resulted in improvements in soil quality, biomass production and carbon sequestration into the soil. Water- and light- use efficiency were increased, whereas greenhouse gas emissions reduced. The ridge-based crop-livestock integration offered the best balance between food production and environmental preservation. This cropping system is potentially one of best alternatives to increase agricultural diversification and sustainability in the sub-tropical lowlands such as in southern Brazil. This shows that modifications of cropping systems can result in major simultaneous improvements in yield, resource-use efficiency and ecological sustainability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Crop rotation and Farming system and Soil management and Sustainability indicators and Wetland and Brazil and Glycine max and Oryza sativa and Zea mays and agricultural diversification and carbon balance and carbon sequestration and crop rotation and ecological footprint and farming system and food production and growing season and maize and mixed farming and multicriteria analysis and soil management and soybean and sustainability and wetland,10.1016/j.fcr.2017.07.001,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030550014&doi=10.1016%2fj.fcr.2017.07.001&partnerID=40&md5=32199402e2d24a82c831263bf4d06f78,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 32,NA,JOUR,NA,82,94,NA,OCT,0378-4290 and 1872-6852,WOS:000408784900009,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2413, 4991"

In order to identify alternative management regimes for peatlands, it is important to understand the sustainability of different peatland uses as well as the economic benefits peatlands supply under different land uses. This study explores the key sustainability issues in Indonesian peatlands, the ecosystem services supplied by peatlands, and potential responses to promote more sustainable peatland use. A literature review and spatial analysis were conducted. Based on predominantly government data, we estimate the amount of Indonesian peatlands that has been converted between 2000 and 2014. We quantify increases in oil palm and plantation forest crop production in this period, and we analyse key sustainability issues, i.e. peat fires and smoke-haze, soil subsidence and flood risk, CO2 emissions, loss of habitat (in protected areas), and social conflicts that influence sustainability of Indonesian peatlands management. Among others we show that CO2 emissions from peatlands in Indonesia can be estimated at between 350 and 400 million ton CO2 per year, and that encroachment of oil palm and plantation forestry (acacia, rubber) has taken place on 28% of protected areas. However, as we examine, the uncertainties involved are substantial.

We describe recent applications, developments, opportunities and limitations, mainly of the Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (for topsoil (VESS) and for subsoil (SubVESS)), and of the Visual Soil Assessment (VSA). Data are taken from experiments on compaction and from assessments made in farmer's fields in the UK, Brazil and New Zealand. The methods are widely used to detect compaction and are well-suited for monitoring changes in compaction status, particularly in relation to weather extremes. VESS proved useful in distinguishing grazing vs wheel compaction in the UK and Brazil by permitting detection of layers at different depths within the topsoil zone. The depths of compact layers are important for scoring management decisions for soil improvement. However the use of scores as limiting thresholds in different soil types needs the support of further soil measurements and/or additional visual assessments of soil and crop. VSA and VESS were also used to estimate the risk of significant soil emissions of nitrous oxide where compaction damage was present and rates of mineral N fertiliser were high. Visual assessments also have the potential to assess the risk of surface water runoff and nutrient loss. The potential role of soil colour was shown for the further development of visual evaluation techniques for a soil carbon storage index.

To enhance the co-benefits of forest conservation, it is important to promote synergies among the three measures—mitigation, adaptation, and biodiversity/ecosystem conservation—in the forest sector and eliminate the overlaps among the three measures. However, limited research exists on the analysis of their synergies. This study explores the potential for synergy among the three forest sector measures, utilizing: 1) indicators that assess enabling conditions for synergies among the three measures at the different institutional levels of policies and strategies, institutional arrangements, and financing and programs/projects; and 2) case studies of five countries in Southeast Asia: Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Lao PDR, and Cambodia. This analysis shows that the five countries all require various changes at different institutional levels in order to enhance their synergy potentials. The findings indicate the importance of national actors, financial mechanisms, programs, and projects in addressing the three measures. In terms of national actors, Thailand has the highest synergy potential due to its national-level committees and a single ministry that addresses all three measures. To enhance their synergy potentials, the other countries need to create national-level committees that address the three measures, and/or they need to enhance collaboration between the various ministries that represent the environment and forestry issues. At the financing and program/project aspects, Vietnam has the highest synergy potential.

Although safeguards represent a key step for promoting social responsibility in REDD+, they are challenging to operationalize and monitor. We analyzed the impacts of different types of REDD+ interventions (incentives vs. disincentives) on key safeguard-relevant indicators, i.e., tenure security, participation, and subjective well-being, as well as on reported forest clearing. We used household-level data collected in Brazil, Peru, Cameroon, Tanzania, Indonesia, and Vietnam from approximately 4000 households in 130 villages at two points in time (2010-2012 and 2013-2014). Our findings highlight a decrease in perceived tenure security and overall perceived well-being over time for households exposed to disincentives alone, with the addition of incentives helping to alleviate negative effects on well-being. In Brazil, although disincentives were associated with reduced reported forest clearing by smallholders, they were the intervention that most negatively affected perceived well-being, highlighting a clear trade-off between carbon and noncarbon benefits. Globally, although households exposed to REDD+ interventions were generally aware of local REDD+ initiatives, meaningful participation in initiative design and implementation lagged behind.

This research focused on two size classes of trees, namely medium trees (10≤dbh≤20 cm) and large trees (dbh>20 cm). Local community members were trained in plot establishment (60 plots, 50×50 m), tree diameter measurement, trees tagging, and herbarium collection. Local community members identified tree species by local names and listed the species uses. Results showed that agroforests as habitat obtained diversity indices (H’) of moderate category for Kampung Birang and high category for Kampung Merabu. Otherwise, Margalef’s index (Dmg) for the medium and large tree classes in Kampung Birang and Kampung Merabu were classified as high species richness category.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the influence of past land-use on natural regeneration in two secondary forests that established on abandoned pastures with different land use histories (Abandoned + Fire—15 years since the last fire event and Abandoned—36 years ago) in a lowland Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Both secondary forests exhibit low resilience for the three analyzed attributes: vegetation structure, richness, and species composition. Secondary forests affected by fire have the lowest values for species richness, aboveground biomass and leaf area index compared to old-growth forests. Secondary forests were dominated by Moquiniastrum polymorphum—Asteraceae, which was absent from the old-growth forests. Fire resistance, capacity to establish in nutrient-poor soils and efficient seed dispersal in human-modified landscapes are important attributes that may explain the dominance of this species. We demonstrate that even in sites considered appropriate for passive restoration a priori (e.g. located in a protected area, 36 years since abandonment and close to old-growth forests), secondary forests exhibited low aboveground biomass and communities were dominated by few species.

The litterfall deposition was 6.61 ± 0.53, 10.75 ± 0.86 and 11.83 ± 1.00 Mg ha-1 yr-1 for PM, FF and RN respectively, differing statistically from each other (p = 0.0025). The concentration of N, P, K, Mg and Ca was higher in the PM area in most assessment months due to planting fertilization. The S was the element that varied the most among the study areas. Regarding micronutrients, Cu, Fe, Zn and Mn had the lowest concentration in FF, and Mn had the highest concentrations in the RN ecosystem. The contents of N and K of the litter were higher in the RN ecosystems, not differing from the FF. The RN was the most efficient method of restoration. Litterfall is a good indicator of restoration of degraded areas. © 2018, Fundacao de Pesquisas Florestais do Parana.",Forest monitoring and Induction of regeneration and Nutrient cycling,10.5380/rf.v48i1.49288,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043791155&doi=10.5380%2frf.v48i1.49288&partnerID=40&md5=bdfd5012778a4f75b53900778c1e015d,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 13,NA,JOUR,1,37,48,"Deposição de serapilheira e nutrientes em áreas de mineração submetidas a métodos de restauração florestal em Paragominas, Pará",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2435

Past studies have revealed the fundamental role of aggregation promoted by soil conservation practices in the physical protection of C fractions. This study is based on the hypothesis that the increased physical C protection provides sufficient time to strengthen the interaction between C fractions and soil minerals, as being the pathway for C stabilization and accumulation in highly weathered soils. Thus, the objectives of this study were to: i) evaluate the C stocks including labile and mineral-associated C fractions in soil under conventional (CT), no-till (NT) and native vegetation (NV), and, ii) assess the C saturation level in different C fractions through the use of contrasting mathematical models of C accumulation. Soil samples were collected (0–100 cm depth) from agroecosystems established in tropical (Lucas do Rio Verde) and subtropical (Ponta Grossa and Londrina) regions of Brazil. The data show that all C fractions were affected by soil management systems. However, the impact was more pronounced with the labile C fractions than with the mineral-associated C fractions. The depletion of C stock of labile fractions in the 0–5 cm layer upon conversion of NV to CT accounted for 86, 89 and 72% of total C in soil of Ponta Grossa, Londrina and Lucas do Rio Verde, respectively. On the other hand, compared to CT, restoration of 89, 15 and 12% of these labile fractions was observed at these respective sites with adoption of NT. The mineral-associated C fraction was the best fit to a C saturation model at all sites. The estimated C saturation level for this fraction was 98.1, 60.2 and 39.1 g C kg− 1 silt + clay at the Ponta Grossa, Londrina and Lucas do Rio Verde sites, respectively, which is still far from the current C content. Thus, the long-term use of NT might be the pathway for physical protection of the labile C fractions as well as strong organo-mineral associations.

A forest moratorium policy that protects forest and peatland is a significant part of the INDCs; however, its effectiveness is unclear in the face of complex land-use and land-cover change. This study aims to assess the dynamics of land-use change and ecosystem service supply as a function of local decision-making. We developed an agent-based model, Land-Use Change and Ecosystem Services (LUCES), and used it to explore the possible effects of the forest moratorium policy on the land-use decisions of private companies and communities. Our simulations for two districts in Central Kalimantan show that the current implementation of the forest moratorium policy is not effective in reducing forest conversion and carbon emissions. This is because companies continue to invest in converting secondary forest on mineral soils and the moratorium does not affect community decision-making. A policy that combines a forest moratorium with livelihood support and increases farm-gate prices of forest and agroforestry products could increase the local communities’ benefits from conservation. Forest and agroforestry areas that are profitable and competitive are more likely to be conserved and reduce potential carbon emission by about 36 %. The results for the two districts, with different pressures on local resources, suggest that appropriate additional measures require local fine-tuning.

This study examined the spatial and temporal changes in land use and cover and their effects on the conservation of Atlantic Forest in a water source area in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo that is the second most densely populated territory in Brazil, the municipality of Diadema. Historical maps and trend scenarios were developed by applying the Markov chain in association with cellular automata. Forest conservation was assessed based on a set of landscape metrics of resource availability, fragment isolation, and trends of forest fragmentation. Our findings revealed an increase in urban growth of 37% in the last five decades directly associated to the clearing of 50% of forests in intermediate/advanced stages and 40% in early stages. The main drivers of landscape change were human-modified fields (41%) and net roads (54%). Optimal resource availability was drastically reduced (75%) while isolation increased (361.5%) among existing forest fragments. Therefore, future trends indicate that, without changes in the management of the area, deforestation may occur rapidly and continuously until 10% of forest remains, leading to potential adverse effects on water availability and quality of the Billings Reservoir and the local biodiversity. © 2018, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

Yet, the historical approach and strategic analysis of public policy building over the long term allows a better understanding of the stakes of action capacity of these policies. We therefore mobilize the advocacy coalition framework to show that protected areas creation is always due to coalitions of actors who belong to different professional fields and act at different scales but nevertheless share common stakes. On the basis of a comparative study in French and Brazilian Amazon, we show that if all coalitions for protected areas share a common objective of limited deforestation, they are still very different according to the type of conservation they promote (strict biodiversity conservation, population-based conservation or sustainable forest management). We also show that the ability of the coalitions to build efficient public policies is highly depending on internal factors (i.e. their ability to gather strategic resources) and on external factors (i.e. socio-political context and international pressure). Finally, the comparative analysis of coalitions pleading for the same type of protected areas in two different countries allows us to insist on the importance of qualitative embedded researches when it comes to understand why some protected areas have more chances to reach environmental effectiveness in one socio-political context than in another one. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Advocacy coalition and Amazon and Brazil and Environmental management and French Guiana and Protected area and Biodiversity and Brazil and Conservation of Natural Resources and Forests and Humans and Public Policy and Amazonia and French Guiana and Biodiversity and Conservation and Deforestation and Environmental management and Advocacy coalitions and Amazon and Brazil and Case-studies and Conservation policy and Creation process and French Guiana and Political context and Protected areas and Topdown and advocacy and biodiversity and comparative study and conservation management and deforestation and environmental management and governance approach and protected area and sustainable development and Brazil and comparative effectiveness and conservation biology and deforestation and environmental management and forest management and French Guiana and public policy and biodiversity and Brazil and environmental protection and forest and human and public policy and Public policy,10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.04.035,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018638881&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2017.04.035&partnerID=40&md5=c28cd682e8c9e148b6f5f60bbb2ea1e2,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 12,NA,JOUR,NA,99,109,NA,AUG 1,0301-4797 and 1095-8630,WOS:000403987500013,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2448, 5404"

In 2016, FSC certified a total forest area of 195 Mha across 80 countries. While there is considerable room for expanding FSC's reach, there has been a lack of incentives for producers to seek certification, particularly in tropical countries. Information about existing barriers and challenges to comply with FSC standards are fundamental to promote such incentives. The objective of this study was to explore the main challenges faced by firms in the FSC certification process and discuss their policy implications. This was carried out by analyzing the quantity, spatial distribution, non-compliant principles, potential triggers and thematic areas of non-conformities (NCs) to FSC certification disclosed in the Public Summary Reports of third-party audits in Brazil. More specifically it tried to understand the specific issues to which the NCs were potentially associated to. This study generated descriptive and inferential statistics of a sample of 1086 NCs to FSC standards disclosed in the 110 Public Summary Reports, from which the overall majority were related to the certification of plantation forests that had gone through maintenance audits. The occurrence of NCs was found to be most frequently associated with FSC Principles 4 (26,07%), 6 (21,82%) and 8 (13,72%), which are related to the themes “Community Relations and Worker's rights” “Environmental Impact” and “Monitoring and Assessment” respectively. Many NCs were triggered by aspects of forest planning, operation and monitoring, which altogether accounted for 42.91% of all NCs. Problems related to occupational health and safety were also a relevant theme, accounting for almost 20% of the total non-conformities. Findings from the Kruskal-Wallis tests suggest that auditors tended to identify similar NCs, regardless of the geographical region, of the type of forest and of the type of audit (certification or maintenance). Spearman Correlation tests indicated significant relationships between certified forest area and non-conformities with FSC Principles 4 and 7 (Community Relations and Worker's Rights, and Management Plans, respectively). The meaning of this relationship is unclear. Overall, findings corroborate previous studies that found FSC Principles 4 and 6 among the most challenging of the global FSC system. There seems to exist an opportunity for the development of stronger technical guidance and capacity building policies related to community relations, worker's rights, and environmental impacts. If such issues are already challenging in the context of large forest plantations, Brazilian policy-makers should expect small-scale firms to face even higher levels of difficulty, given their lack of financial and human resources.

The study assesses a comprehensive set of indicators in the three sustainability dimensions: environmental, economic, and social (socio-eco-efficiency). By prioritizing CLFi, the production area to meet the demand of grains, meat and energy for 500 Brazilians, from 2007 to 2014, reached 70 ha, while the conventional systems would need 420 ha to meet the same demand. This result shows that it is possible to increase production to meet the growing food global demand without the need of expanding the agricultural frontier, preserving the remaining forestland. CLFi combinations systems decreased 55% in climate change potential (2389 t of CO2 equivalent), when compared to the conventional systems. It was also observed that the more integrated systems improved the quality of employment, promoted future generation investments in society, and decreased the total production costs in 54%, when compared to conventional systems.

In recent decades, more than 15% of Amazonian forests have been converted into pastures, resulting in net C emissions (~200 tC ha−1) due to biomass burning and litter mineralization in the first years after deforestation. However, little is known about the capacity of tropical pastures to restore a C sink. Our study shows in French Amazonia that the C storage observed in native forest can be partly restored in old (≥24 year) tropical pastures managed with a low stocking rate (±1 LSU ha−1) and without the use of fire since their establishment. A unique combination of a large chronosequence study and eddy covariance measurements showed that pastures stored between −1.27 ± 0.37 and −5.31 ± 2.08 tC ha−1 yr−1 while the nearby native forest stored −3.31 ± 0.44 tC ha−1 yr−1. This carbon is mainly sequestered in the humus of deep soil layers (20–100 cm), whereas no C storage was observed in the 0- to 20-cm layer. C storage in C4 tropical pasture is associated with the installation and development of C3 species, which increase either the input of N to the ecosystem or the C:N ratio of soil organic matter. Efforts to curb deforestation remain an obvious priority to preserve forest C stocks and biodiversity. However, our results show that if sustainable management is applied in tropical pastures coming from deforestation (avoiding fires and overgrazing, using a grazing rotation plan and a mixture of C3 and C4 species), they can ensure a continuous C storage, thereby adding to the current C sink of Amazonian forests. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",carbon storage and CN coupling and deep soil and mixed-grass pasture and native forest and Biomass and Brazil and Carbon and Carbon Sequestration and Forests and Soil and Trees and Amazonia and carbon and soil and carbon sequestration and carbon sink and coupling and forest and grass and humus and native species and pasture and soil carbon and biomass and Brazil and carbon sequestration and chemistry and forest and soil and tree,10.1111/gcb.13573,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006984408&doi=10.1111%2fgcb.13573&partnerID=40&md5=adf73f70464c921ece78daf7678d1a40,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 23,NA,JOUR,8,3382,3392,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2462

The number of trees required to offset these emissions were also estimated. The GHG emissions were calculated based on pre-farm (e.g. agrochemical production, storage, and transportation), and on-farm activities (e.g. fertilization and machinery operation). Aboveground tree grass biomass and carbon storage in all systems was estimated with allometric equations. GHG emissions from the agroforestry systems ranged from 2.81 to 7.98 t CO2e ha-1.

Brazil is the world's largest producer of sugarcane and has in recent years, experienced a shift from traditional cane preharvest burning (B) to mechanized green-trashing (GT), whose consequences on soil organic carbon and nutrients are still uncertain. This study performed in the São-Paulo state, Southeast Brazil, investigated the impact of shifting from B to GT on soil organic carbon and nitrogen stocks, and chemical elements at three 4-year and one 12-year old trial sites. Soil samples were collected from four sites representing different soil types (clayey to sandy-clay Hapludox; Hapudult and sandy Quartzpsamment). Sampling was up to 0.4 m (0–0.05; 0.05–0.1; 0.1–0.2; 0.2–0.4 m) depths at six randomly selected pits from six plots (of 0.2 ha size each) per treatment arranged in randomized block design. The samples were analysed for carbon and nitrogen content and other soil properties such as texture, bulk density, aggregate stability, pH and chemical concentrations. Overall, conversion from B to GT increased fresh organic matter retained on soil surface by 12.8–13.0 Mg ha− 1 y− 1, and soil organic carbon and nitrogen stocks in the top 0.4 m soil layer by 1.06 Mg C ha− 1 y− 1 and 0.11 Mg N ha− 1 y− 1, respectively. The highest carbon sequestration rate (108‰ y− 1) occurred in the most carbon depleted soils, which were sandy soils with lowest proportion of macroaggregates and chemical elements such as calcium, magnesium and potassium. All the chemical elements also showed a general increase in concentration, especially within the topmost soil layer, because increased soil organic matter had greater ability to tighten them together. Considering the average sequestration rate of 1.06 ton ha− 1 y− 1, the resulting soil carbon sequestration rate for Brazil where 8.8 million hectares are under green-trashing of sugarcane residues would be 9.3 million ton C y− 1. However, intermittent tillage every 4–5 years for replanting poses limitations to carbon sequestration because a 12 year experiment which was sampled 1 year after replanting did not show any carbon sequestration, suggesting that all carbon stored between planting and replanting was lost at tillage. There is need for further research to quantify the dynamics of carbon stocks during and immediately after tillage and to find sugarcane replanting techniques which minimize soil disturbance and associated carbon losses. © 2017",C sequestration and Green-trashing and Land degradation and Soil aggregation and Soil fertility and Brazil and Sao Paulo [Brazil] and Biogeochemistry and Biological materials and Chemical stability and Degradation and Design of experiments and Global warming and Land use and Magnesium and Nitrogen and Organic carbon and Soils and C sequestration and Carbon and nitrogen and Carbon sequestration and Different soils and Green-trashing and Land degradation and Soil aggregation and Soil fertility and Soil organic carbon and nitrogen and Soil organic Carbon stocks and anthropogenic effect and burning and carbon sequestration and crop residue and environmental change and global warming and land degradation and soil aggregate and soil fertility and soil nutrient and soil organic matter and sugar cane and Tillage,10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.09.020,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030123603&doi=10.1016%2fj.geoderma.2017.09.020&partnerID=40&md5=6674fcbc690593b7ae0a00e75a85b6f4,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 22,NA,JOUR,NA,238,248,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2466

In protected areas in the Brazilian savannas (Cerrado), the predominant management policy is fire suppression, reflecting a cultural heritage which considers that fire always has a negative impact on biodiversity. Here we compare resultant fire-regimes in Canastra National Park (CNP), southeast Brazil, associated with areas under and without fire suppression management, based on a 16-year Landsat imagery record. In open grasslands of the Canastra plateau (CP), firefighting is undertaken under government-sanctioned regulation, whereas in the Babilonia sector, non-sanctioned fire management is undertaken by small farmers to promote cattle grazing and cropping. Fire regimes in the Canastra sector are characterized by few, very large, late dry season wildfires recurring at intervals of two years. Fire regimes in lowlands of the Babilonia sector are characterized by many small-scale, starting at the beginning of the dry season (EDS). In Babilonia uplands fire regimes are characterized by higher frequencies of large fires. The study illustrates major challenges for managing fire-prone areas in conflict-of-interest regions. We suggest that management planning in CNP needs to effectively address: i) managing conflicts between CNP managers and local communities; and ii) fire management practices in order to achieve more ecologically sustainable fire regimes.

Biochar addition to the composting feedstock was shown to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient leaching during the composting process, and to result in a fertilizer and plant growth medium that is superior to non-amended composts. However, the impact of biochar on the quality and carbon speciation of the organic matter in bulk compost has so far not been the focus of systematic analyses, although these parameters are key to determine the long-term stability and carbon sequestration potential of biochar-amended composts in soil. In this study, we used different spectroscopic techniques to compare the organic carbon speciation of manure compost amended with three different biochars. A non-biochar-amended compost served as control. Based on Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy we did not observe any differences in carbon speciation of the bulk compost independent of biochar type, despite a change in the FTIR absorbance ratio 2925 cm− 1/1034 cm− 1, that is suggested as an indicator for compost maturity. Specific UV absorbance (SUVA) and emission-excitation matrixes (EEM) revealed minor differences in the extractable carbon fractions, which only accounted for ~ 2–3% of total organic carbon. Increased total organic carbon content of biochar-amended composts was only due to the addition of biochar-C and not enhanced preservation of compost feedstock-C. Our results suggest that biochars do not alter the carbon speciation in compost organic matter under conditions optimized for aerobic decomposition of compost feedstock.

Previous life cycle assessment (LCA) studies have shown that dairy intensification reduces the carbon footprint of milk by increasing animal productivity and feed conversion efficiency. None of these studies simultaneously evaluated indirect GHG effects incurred via teleconnections with expansion of feed crop production and replacement suckler-beef production. We applied consequential LCA to incorporate these effects into GHG mitigation calculations for intensification scenarios among grazing-based dairy farms in an industrialized country (UK), in which milk production shifts from average to intensive farm typologies, involving higher milk yields per cow and more maize and concentrate feed in cattle diets. Attributional LCA indicated a reduction of up to 0.10 kg CO2e kg−1 milk following intensification, reflecting improved feed conversion efficiency. However, consequential LCA indicated that land use change associated with increased demand for maize and concentrate feed, plus additional suckler-beef production to replace reduced dairy-beef output, significantly increased GHG emissions following intensification. International displacement of replacement suckler-beef production to the “global beef frontier” in Brazil resulted in small GHG savings for the UK GHG inventory, but contributed to a net increase in international GHG emissions equivalent to 0.63 kg CO2e kg−1 milk. Use of spared dairy grassland for intensive beef production can lead to net GHG mitigation by replacing extensive beef production, enabling afforestation on larger areas of lower quality grassland, or by avoiding expansion of international (Brazilian) beef production. We recommend that LCA boundaries are expanded when evaluating livestock intensification pathways, to avoid potentially misleading conclusions being drawn from “snapshot” carbon footprints. We conclude that dairy intensification in industrialized countries can lead to significant international carbon leakage, and only achieves GHG mitigation when spared dairy grassland is used to intensify beef production, freeing up larger areas for afforestation. © 2017 The Authors.

However, which ecosystem functions are affected when highly diverse grasslands are converted remains largely unknown. As a model system, we studied 80 grasslands in Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil, comprising exceptionally diverse permanent grasslands that are traditionally managed with burning of accumulated biomass and moderate grazing, and four additional grassland types with different present or historical management: Permanent grasslands with reduced or increased current management intensity and secondary grasslands after past agricultural or silvicultural use. We measured ten ecosystem functions covering all major below- A nd aboveground ecosystem components and the processes that link them, using the novel rapid ecosystem function assessment approach. Ecosystem functions included primary and secondary production, and species interactions, that is, herbivory, pollination, predation, seed dispersal, and decomposition. Ecosystem functions differed significantly among grassland types, most distinctly between permanent and secondary grasslands. Historical land-use changes to agriculture and silviculture led to altered ecosystem functions even after reconversion to grassland, including lower primary and secondary production, lower decomposition, lower seed dispersal capabilities, and higher invertebrate herbivory. Current management practices explained additional variation in some ecosystem functions, including strong positive effects of intensified management on secondary production.

The findings suggest that conversion of grasslands to more intensive land-use types has long-lasting consequences for some ecosystem functions, with effects persisting even many years after reconversion, resulting in changes in the ecosystem services provided by these grasslands. © 2017 Leidinger et al.",Campos De Cima da Serra and Campos sulinos and Ecosystem function and Grassland and Land use and Management intensity and Rapid ecosystem function assessment (REFA),10.1002/ecs2.2032,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85039423525&doi=10.1002%2fecs2.2032&partnerID=40&md5=5c1b12cea792174755ac2950f3b8f282,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 27,NA,JOUR,12,NA,NA,NA,DEC,2150-8925,WOS:000423423200009,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2486, 4941"

However, the differences in post-fire vegetation dynamics between these ecosystems have seldom been compared using a uniform set of parameters. Additionally, post-fire dynamics of forest-savanna ecotones is poorly characterized. With the hypothesis that closed forest, savannas and ecotones will exhibit different post-fire responses, we studied the vegetation diversity, structure and dynamics in an upland forest-savanna vegetation mosaic in Minas Gerais, Brazil following a fire that occurred in September 2011. In January 2012, we identified, tagged, and measured the basal diameter of all regenerating juvenile tree stems within forty-six 4 m2 plots in closed forest, savanna and ecotone vegetation, and conducted recensuses in 2013 and 2014. We modelled the relationship between short-term dynamics parameters (recruitment, mortality, basal area loss and gain, and the turnover and net changes in the number of individual stems and basal areas) and vegetation type. Species diversity was higher in closed forests and ecotones than in savanna. Across all vegetation types, stem density decreased and basal area increased. Parameters such as recruitment, net changes in the number of individuals, and the gain, loss and turnover in basal area did not differ across vegetation types. However, stem mortality was higher in closed forest and ecotones combined than in savannas, and the net change in the number of individuals was the lowest in the savanna. Overall, our results support that within a climatically-similar vegetation mosaic, closed forests exhibit different post-fire regeneration dynamics from savanna as expected. Ecotones exhibited post-fire responses and dynamics more similar to closed forests than to savanna, but more studies will be needed to establish if this pattern is applicable to other areas. Understanding the longer-term vegetation dynamics and plant regeneration patterns is a potential next step that will help inform fire management strategies for forest-savanna mosaics. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Alternative stable states and Diversity and Fire disturbance and Forest-savanna ecotones and Structural change and Vegetation dynamics and Basal Area and Forest Fires and Mortality and Plants and Reforestation and Brazil and Minas Gerais and Dynamics and Ecology and Ecosystems and Fires and Forestry and Plants (botany) and Vegetation and Alternative stable state and Diversity and Fire disturbance and Forest-savanna ecotones and Structural change and Vegetation dynamics and basal area and biodiversity and ecotone and environmental factor and fire management and forest and heterogeneity and mortality and regeneration and savanna and upland region and vegetation dynamics and vegetation type and Reforestation,10.1016/j.foreco.2017.05.058,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020394129&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2017.05.058&partnerID=40&md5=79e4ed08bcb346394386a1527b2e51a0,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 12,NA,JOUR,NA,77,84,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2487

Each and every element of the living component of the system has its own role, either positive or negative, to play as a system component. So preservation and conservation of living organisms, whether they are tiny or large, become immense important in playing beneficial role in maintaining biodiversity. Mega-herbivorous animal such as elephant has major impact on the terrestrial ecosystems in which they live and thus on the animals that depend on these habitats. Elephant can be referred as ""keystone species"" because it facilitates feeding by other herbivores that disperse seeds and supports large assemblages of invertebrates, such as dung beetles, and lower plants such as algae and fungi apart from enriching soil nutrients through dung piles. These algae and fungi are preferred nutrient plants for some reptiles such as monitor lizard and star tortoise in the semiarid tropical forests. Dung beetle accumulation attracts many insectivorous birds. Dung deposition into water holes is being benefited to the Pisces and amphibians. Seed dispersal through alimentary canal induces germination and survival capacity of the seedlings to maintain the forest heterogeneity. Elephant also does some of the silvicultural practices such as creation of paths in dense forest, maintenance of grazing lawns and height of the trees and thinning in thick vegetation cover to keep the sustainable utility of the forest. Identification of subsoil water and natural salt licks through elephants' strong sense is also shared by the other animals especially the herbivores for which intake of minerals from the natural soil is most important for many physiological activities. The pachyderm is under severe threat due to various conservation problems such as loss of habitat, habitat quality and corridors, reduction of home range, population increase, impact of developmental activities, human-elephant conflict issues and poaching for ivory. Among the factors, some of them may be responsible for major proportions, and some of them involve less proportion.

However, it remains unclear how to synchronize ecological definitions and legal conservation strategies regarding mangroves, especially in developing countries, such as Brazil. The influence of human populations' socio-economic context in mangrove conservation policies, as well associated challenges in incorporating this influence, are underestimated or, often, largely ignored. Considering the recent threats emerging from changes in legislation and the lack of spatial and social-ecological integrated data to plan mangrove conservation in Brazil, this paper aims to answer the following questions: (1) What suitable measures could managers and other decision makers adopt for efficient mangrove conservation planning?; (2) What are the site-specific,social-ecological aspects that need to be taken into account when deciding on conservation and management strategies?; and (3) How could science contribute to the development of these measures? In order to achieve an ecosystem-based management approach, mangrove ecosystems should not be divided into sub-systems, but instead treated as an integrated system. Furthermore, interconnections with other coastal ecosystems must be assessed and taken into account. This is crucial for effective systematic conservation planning. Also, most of the particular social-ecological aspects in the different types of mangrove ecosystems along the Brazilian coast, and how those differences might be considered while planning for conservation, remain poorly understood. Based on similar drivers of change, geological features, and likely impacts of climate change, a macro-unit approach is proposed to group mangrove systems along the Brazilian coast and guide national policies. This paper draws parallels with management approaches worldwide to find common points and hence lessons to be applied in other regional realms. It considers the issues of legal vulnerability and needs for social-ecological data on mangroves, contributing toward systematic conservation planning and ecosystem-based management for these ecosystems. © 2017 Borges, Ferreira and Lacerda.",Brazil and Coastal-marine spatial planning and Ecosystem service and GIS-based data and Marine protected area and Social-ecological system,10.3389/fmars.2017.00353,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034024044&doi=10.3389%2ffmars.2017.00353&partnerID=40&md5=3902cee7ac0e502877c465e6dd1c6454,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 31,NA,JOUR,NOV,NA,NA,NA,NA,2296-7745,WOS:000457690600351,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2489, 3680"

In this paper, we highlight the Agrarian Change Project, a multi-disciplinary research initiative, that applies detailed socio-ecological methodologies in multi-functional landscapes, and assess the subsequent implications for conservation, livelihoods and food security. Specifically, the research focuses on land use impacts in locations which exhibit various combinations of agricultural modification/change across a forest transition gradient in six tropical landscapes, in Zambia, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Indonesia and Bangladesh. These methods include integrated assessments of the perceptions of ecosystem service provision, tree cover loss and gain, relative poverty, diets and agricultural patterns of change. Although numerous surveys on rural livelihoods are undertaken each year, often at great cost, many are hampered by weaknesses in methods and thus may not reflect rural realities. We attempt to highlight how integrating broader socio-ecological methods can be used to fill in those gaps and ensure such realities are indeed captured. Early findings suggest that the transition from a forested landscape to a more agrarian dominated system does not necessarily result in better livelihood outcomes and there may be unintended consequences of forest and tree cover removal.

In Indonesia, the expansion of palm oil plantations has led to non-sustainable land use practices in past years, particularly deforestation. More recently, the government has set ambitious targets for the adoption of biodiesel which will require expansion of oil palm plantations, thus putting further pressure on land. Meanwhile, the need to guarantee food supply, forest conservation and climate change mitigation also imply challenges when it comes to land allocation and use. This paper examines the role that land plays in the implementation of sectoral policies in Indonesia, exploring the availability of land to satisfy the multiple goals defined in national policies. We explore land competition resulting from allocations made in official policy documents starting with biofuel policy. The analysis of policy goals and coherence when it comes to land allocation is made in relation to agriculture, climate and forestry policies. We conclude that adjustments need to be made in the policies to avoid overlappings and misinterpretations when it comes to land allocation. The area made available for meeting each sectoral policy goal when taking into account cross sectoral interactions is: 14.2 Mha for agriculture, 43 Mha for climate mitigation measures, 9.2 Mha for forestry, and 20.9 Mha for biofuels.

This study aimed to evaluate the role of traditional cacao agroforests, known as “cabrucas,” on the conservation of the predatory beetle community compared to that of monodominant rubber agroforests. Predatory beetles were sampled in three habitats in Southeastern Bahia, Brazil: cabrucas and rubber agroforests and native Atlantic forests. In each habitat, 18 10 m2 plots were established, in which canopy cover was measured and beetles were sampled with a modified Malaise/window trap. Land use intensification did not affect the composition of predatory beetles, with the presence of widely distributed species that are also capable of colonizing simpler environments such as the rubber agroforest. Canopy cover had a positive effect on generalist predator diversity and we observed a reduction in the abundance and species richness of generalist predators with increasing habitat homogenization. Despite the simplified structure of the habitat, the remaining tree diversity and canopy cover in cabrucas supported a community of generalist predators similar to the one found in the native forest. Species diversity of bark beetle predators was higher in cabrucas, which may be due to the high diversity of bark beetles and the favorable abiotic conditions, whereas the low abundance of prey in the native forest and severe abiotic conditions in the rubber agroforest probably determined the lower diversity of generalist predators in these habitats. Cabrucas play an important role in the conservation, supporting a community of predatory beetles more similar to the one found in native forest and that is more effective at controlling populations of herbivores than in homogeneous rubber agroforests. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Biodiversity and Conservation and Land use and Pest control and Predation and Theobroma cacao and Atlantic Forest and Bahia and Brazil and Coleoptera and Scolytinae and Theobroma cacao and abundance and agroforestry and beetle and biodiversity and evergreen tree and forest canopy and habitat structure and land use change and natural enemy and pest control and predator and rubber and species conservation and species diversity and species richness,10.1007/s10457-016-9917-z,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84960340900&doi=10.1007%2fs10457-016-9917-z&partnerID=40&md5=5e2639128539b71a90d1666cccaa834c,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 24,NA,JOUR,1,201,209,NA,FEB,0167-4366 and 1572-9680,WOS:000394177900016,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2503, 5566"

The research involved an interview session of 106 and 261 smallholder farmers and an assessment of 27 and 14 agroforesty plots for carbon stock assessment and biodiversity assessment, respectively. Results indicated that the total carbon found among the crop components was 52.32 MgC/ha in Molawin-Dampalit Sub-Watershed and 244.26 MgC/ha in Way Betung Watershed, which suggested the high carbon sequestration potential of the woody perennials and understory crops in an agroforestry system. The farm lots being cultivated by the smallholder farmers were found to contribute to biodiversity conservation having a moderate biodiversity index of 2.59 and 2.53, respectively. With these findings, promotion of desired agroforestry systems in suitable portions of the watershed areas should be intensified and heightened to contribute to ecological balance across the landscape.

There is evidence that the turnover of BC in soils also depends on the soil mineral assembly. We studied the effects of paddy and non-paddy soil management and different major reference soil groups on BC storage. We hypothesized that overall BC storage in soil relates to paddy management and the abundance of reactive mineral phases such as Fe and Al oxides, and clay-sized minerals. Parallel to BC, black nitrogen (BN) should accumulate in soil. Paddy and non-paddy soils were sampled in three different climate zones (tropical, subtropical, and temperate). The soil profiles comprised six replicates of Andosols, Alisols and Vertisols from Java (Indonesia), and Alisols and Cambisols from China, as well as one Fluvisol and Gleysol from Northern Italy. Samples were taken by horizon down to > 1 m depth and analyzed for soil organic carbon (SOC) and BC. The latter was analyzed by oxidation to benzene polycarboxylic acids. Abundance of BN (as aromatic N) was estimated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analyses of selected topsoil horizons. In topsoils BC vs. SOC accumulation was affected by management for Andosol, Alisols in China, and Vertisols. However, both flooding and crop-residue management seemed to control this. BC contents relative to SOC also differed between the reference soil groups, independent of management (p < 0.0001), yet were surprisingly constant within replicates. We conclude that BC co-accumulated with SOC in all soils. However, the overall storage of BC (1 m depth) was affected by a combination of soil group and management. Vertisols contained the largest BC stocks (17–19 t ha− 1 in non-paddy and paddy fields), followed by Andosols and Alisols (6–10 t BC ha− 1 under paddy management; 3–8 t ha− 1 under non-paddy management). The Gleysol and Fluvisol had the smallest BC stocks, independent of soil use (3–4 t ha− 1). Aromatic N proportions increased to > 50% of total N after combustion of rice straw. However, aromatic N was barely, or not detectable in soil, and there was no correlation to BC. We conclude that burned crop residues were not a major source for aromatic N in soil. BC and aromatic N showed no distinct relations to soil properties, such as the abundance of clay-sized minerals, and Al and Fe oxides. Differences in BC stocks between the soils were most pronounced in the subsoils, likely caused by physical processes, such as swelling and shrinking of clays and/or translocation by leaching. Climate and regional soil-adjusted management also affected BC accumulation, but this first snapshot indicates that global BC maps may be linked to global soil maps. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Aluminum oxides and Black carbon and Black nitrogen and C sequestration and Clay-size fraction and Iron oxides and China and Greater Sunda Islands and Indonesia and Italy and Java and Sunda Isles and Agricultural wastes and Agronomy and Aluminum and Aromatic compounds and Aromatization and Clay minerals and Crops and Floods and Iron oxides and Minerals and Nitrogen and Organic carbon and Spectroscopic analysis and Storage management and X ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Aluminum oxides and Benzene polycarboxylic acids and Black carbon and C sequestration and Clay-size fraction and Crop residue burning and Crop residue management and Long-term C sequestrations and agricultural management and aluminum oxide and Andosol and black carbon and carbon sequestration and clay soil and crop residue and Fluvisol and Gleysol and iron oxide and nitrogen and organic carbon and oxidation and paddy field and soil carbon and soil management and soil profile and Vertisol and Soils,10.1016/j.geoderma.2016.08.026,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84988628656&doi=10.1016%2fj.geoderma.2016.08.026&partnerID=40&md5=9aa34bb476cba3a05d12a87c9187a495,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 13,NA,JOUR,NA,214,225,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2505

Results reveal that revenues from guayusa have not overtaken those from other cash crops. Commercializing guayusa can have benefits for farmers and the environment, provided that rigorous criteria that measure social and environmental impacts are adhered to. Furthermore, guaysa production is characterized by vertical integration where many individual farmers supply one processing and wholesale company in a short value chain fostering a locally tailored certification approach that is able to exert the continuation of the traditional agroforestry practices. Yet, sustainability initiatives, standards and certification only provide partial solutions for protecting ecosystem services in the Ecuadorian Amazon. © 2017 The Author(s).",Agroforestry and Chakra and Ecuador and Guayusa and Kichwa and Livelihoods and Amazonas [Brazil] and Brazil and Ecuador and Ilex guayusa and agroforestry and cash cropping and certification and commercialization and commodity and ecosystem service and evergreen tree and indigenous population and livelihood and native species and sustainability,10.1080/21513732.2017.1303646,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034610506&doi=10.1080%2f21513732.2017.1303646&partnerID=40&md5=c1978dae28fbffbee0d424b1d605ba72,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 9,NA,JOUR,1,191,203,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2506

To keep protected area, Indonesia government excludinged local people from protected forest by making a policy which prohibits grazing on protected forest. However, the success of protected forest management often depends on perception of local people because the policy has affected livestock owners who have interest in forest use. Exclusion of local people from protected forest leads loss of people income and unemployment. This study applied a socioeconomic approach to examine and analyze the livestock owner perception on forest grazing prohibition in Timor Island of Indonesia by conducting a household survey of 36 livestock owners. The study results showed that 30.6%, 50.0%, 19.4%, 0%, and 0% of livestock owners are totally disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, and totally agree, with grazing prohibition, respectively. In addition, people perception was significantly affected by number of livestock owned by people. It means that livestock owners mostly reject the policy on grazing prohibition. Indeed policy which prohibits grazing on the protected forest is not effective to be implemented. Government and policy maker should review the policy and consider the refusal of livestock owner toward exclusion policy.

We also assess the perceptions of stakeholders (donors, government, and non-government agencies) regarding the status of such schemes in Indonesia, and their views on what factors support or constrain their development. The main factors perceived to support payments for ecosystem services schemes were easily identifiable ecosystem services and service users, and the long-term support provided by individuals or institutions that facilitate the schemes, building on existing relationships between communities and these facilitating agencies. Stakeholders identified problems relating to regulation: the lack of regulation specifically in relation to payments for ecosystem services, but also overlap and uncertainties regarding regulations. Other constraining factors identified were the lack of recognition of environmental problems amongst potential buyers, and issues of rights and tenure for local communities. With so few operational programmes to date, covering a relatively small land area, and such constraints to further development, payments for ecosystem services schemes appear to have limited scope to supply ecosystem services successfully and sustainably at scale.

Such analyses are especially required for tropical biomes, which are usually subject to dynamic and heterogeneous land uses. Recent studies have suggested that many tropical biomes are passing through the process of “forest transition”, i.e. an overall change from forest loss to forest gain. However, this hypothesis remains scarcely tested, due to the difficulty of obtaining detailed, quantitative historical records of forest cover. In this study, we investigate 38 years of land use change in Brazil's Atlantic Forest, a biodiversity hotspot, from 1976 to 2014, using multitemporal datasets from aerial photographs and satellite images. We classified the historical series to produce land use maps and calculated a set of landscape metrics, including total forest cover, patch size, patch shape and patch connectivity. Our results indicated non-linear changes through time in forest loss and gain and also in landscape structure, which can be classified into two distinct periods. The first period (1976–1996) was marked by expressive forest loss and fragmentation, whereas the second (1996–2014) was characterized by a much less intense forest dynamics, with little deforestation being balanced by forest regeneration. We attribute the forest dynamics observed to temporal changes in socioeconomic factors, such as an increasing human settlements and changes in environmental protection policies. Our results show that current forests are a heterogeneous mosaic of forests with different ages, and support the hypothesis that forest transition is occurring in Atlantic Forest landscapes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Forest transition and Fragstat and Macacu Basin and Multitemporal and Atlantic Forest and Brazil and aerial photograph and biodiversity and forest management and fragmentation and land use change and satellite imagery and temporal variation and tropical environment,10.1016/j.apgeog.2017.03.006,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016073184&doi=10.1016%2fj.apgeog.2017.03.006&partnerID=40&md5=30b69a73fa6540dd5bc2606231e6fa9b,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 27,NA,JOUR,NA,93,100,NA,MAY,0143-6228 and 1873-7730,WOS:000401879500009,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2509, 5088"

In this context, plant functional traits could help to achieve this goal, as they directly affect ecosystem processes. Thus, modeling species composition based on species functional traits could provide ways to make predictions about future communities and to assess the functioning of the ecosystem. In order to evaluate how different restored communities are from their reference ecosystem, we used a trait-based modeling approach that predicts relative abundances of a community based on the functional composition of the reference ecosystem. We surveyed adult trees in the canopy and seedlings in the understory in both reference and 10 year-old restoration sites in two different locations in South of Brazil to gather information of species composition and their relative abundances. Functional composition was based on information of leaf traits for all species included in the survey. We applied the model on two different components: canopy and understory species. We found differences in functional composition between the restored communities and the reference sites, indicating that the ten-year old restored forests are still not similar to the reference ecosystem. Both the observed and the predicted understory communities were more similar to the reference ecosystem than the observed canopy communities. It indicates that species that established after restoration interventions have functional composition closer to the reference ecosystem than the set of species initially selected for planting. Modeling the community based on functional trait composition coupled with long-term monitoring of sites undergoing restoration would enable a better evaluation of restoration trajectories and management needs to modify ecosystem functions towards values found in reference sites. Restoration should focus on the recovery of functional composition, which would provide a better set of resources for organisms and promote changes in ecosystem processes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Ecosystem process and Functional ecology and Functional traits and Natural regeneration and Subtropical forest and Ecosystems and Restoration and Brazil and Ecology and Forestry and Function evaluation and Reforestation and Restoration and Surveys and Ecosystem process and Functional ecologies and Functional traits and Natural regeneration and Subtropical forests and biomonitoring and community composition and ecological modeling and ecosystem function and environmental restoration and forest ecosystem and functional change and functional group and regeneration and restoration ecology and subtropical region and Ecosystems,10.1016/j.foreco.2017.02.024,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013058622&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2017.02.024&partnerID=40&md5=c0bc911af98f3ef316b9d2d11ee5c664,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 19,NA,JOUR,NA,176,183,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2510

Ants are key into the ecosystem because act like engineers; hence, the loss of ants’ biodiversity may be a guide to measure the loss of essential functions into the ecosystems. The aim of this study was to evaluate soil ant’s richness and to estimate whether higher taxa levels (Subfamily and Genus) can be used as surrogates of species richness in different vegetation types (fallows, old-growth forests and agroforestry systems) in Eastern Amazon. The samples were taken in 65 areas in the Maranhão and Pará States in the period 2011-2014. The sampling scheme followed the procedure of Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility (TSBF). Initially, the vegetation types were characterized according to their age and estimated species richness. Linear and exponential functions were applied to evaluate if higher taxa can be used as surrogates and correlated with the Pearson coefficient. In total, 180 species distributed in 60 genera were identified. The results showed that ant species richness was higher in intermediate fallows (88) and old secondary forest (76), and was lower in agroforestry systems (38) and mature riparian forest (35). The genus level was the best surrogate to estimate the ant’s species richness across the different vegetation types, and explained 72-97 % (P < 0.001) of the total species variability. The results confirmed that the genus level is an excellent surrogate to estimate the ant’s species richness in the region and that both fallows and agroforestry systems may contribute in the conservation of Eastern Amazon ant community. © 2017, Universidad de Costa Rica.

We evaluated peat volume from two commonly referenced maps of peat distribution and depth published by Wetlands International (WI) and the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), and used regionally specific values of carbon density to calculate carbon stocks. Results: Peatland extent and volume published in the MoA maps are lower than those in the WI maps, resulting in lower estimates of carbon storage. We estimate Indonesia's total peat carbon store to be within 13.6 GtC (the low MoA map estimate) and 40.5 GtC (the high WI map estimate) with a best estimate of 28.1 GtC: the midpoint of medium carbon stock estimates derived from WI (30.8 GtC) and MoA (25.3 GtC) maps. This estimate is about half of previous assessments which used an assumed average value of peat thickness for all Indonesian peatlands, and revises the current global tropical peat carbon pool to 75 GtC. Yet, these results do not diminish the significance of Indonesia's peatlands, which store an estimated 30% more carbon than the biomass of all Indonesian forests. The largest discrepancy between maps is for the Papua province, which accounts for 62-71% of the overall differences in peat area, volume and carbon storage. According to the MoA map, 80% of Indonesian peatlands are <300 cm thick and thus vulnerable to conversion outside of protected areas according to environmental regulations. The carbon contained in these shallower peatlands is conservatively estimated to be 10.6 GtC, equivalent to 42% of Indonesia's total peat carbon and about 12 years of global emissions from land use change at current rates. Conclusions: Considering the high uncertainties in peatland extent, volume and carbon storage revealed in this assessment of current maps, a systematic revision of Indonesia's peat maps to produce a single geospatial reference that is universally accepted would improve national peat carbon storage estimates and greatly benefit carbon cycle research, land use management and spatial planning. © 2017 The Author(s).",Carbon emissions and Carbon pools and Climate change mitigation and Peat degradation and Tropical peatlands and Wetlands and Indonesia and Papua [(PRV) Indonesia] and biodiversity and carbon cycle and carbon emission and carbon sequestration and climate change and degradation and ecosystem service and land use change and land use planning and map and peatland and uncertainty analysis and wetland,10.1186/s13021-017-0080-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019357660&doi=10.1186%2fs13021-017-0080-2&partnerID=40&md5=0dd71bf738b4dc2e955fcaa7b66a5151,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 134,NA,JOUR,1,NA,NA,NA,MAY 19,1750-0680,WOS:000452076500001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2514, 4965"

In 1991, the World Bank responded to global concerns and to criticism by nongovernmental organizations by forming a conservation-oriented forest strategy. Managing a Global Resource is an outgrowth of the independent evaluation conducted by the World Bank's Operations Evaluation Department and discusses how effectively that strategy was implemented. In this detailed investigation, Uma J. Lele explores why the loss of forests and biodiversity has been so rapid in some developing countries (Brazil, Indonesia, and Cameroon) and not in others (China, India, and Costa Rica). She assesses future prospects for conservation in these six countries by critically examining their policies, institutional arrangements, and emerging national and international instruments to conserve forests and biodiversity. Together these six countries account for 25 percent of the world's forest cover and 44 percent of the world's population. Managing a Global Resource presents case studies of the forest sectors of each country in the context of overall development policies, interest groups, and governance issues. Lele's investigation finds a fundamental divergence in forest-rich countries between the global objectives of conservation and the local objectives of development and private profit. In some forest-poor countries, in contrast, natural resource loss has led the countries on their own accord to adopt a variety of conservation-oriented policies and programs. Despite the greater congruence between the global and national objectives in these forest-poor countries, competing demands on their resources and the constraints on their policies, institutions, and human capital make it difficult for them to affect forest and biodiversity conservation.

Throughfall quantity and carbon input beneath canopy gaps of varying size in degraded tropical peatland forest of West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 18: 1258-1264. Tropical peatland forest ecology, is mostly determined by peatland hydrological conditions. However, deforestation, forest degradation, or any other environmental disturbance can transform hydrological patterns and processes for peatland water movement, and thus alter carbon flow via water in this type of ecosystem. These changes arise from alteration in the quantity of throughfall (water that falls through plant canopies), in its interception, and in its evaporation to the atmosphere from vegetation surfaces. We have investigated the effects of a gradient of forest degradation levels, represented by canopy gaps (open, intermediate and closed), on throughfall quantity to the peatland forest floor. Nine plots, 50m x 50m in size, were stratified into the three forest canopy gap classes. Nine bucket collectors were used for throughfall, and tipping bucket rain gauges were set up for precipitation monitoring. Results show that annual precipitation in the area was 3,168.8 ± 111.3 mm, with a mean monthly rainfall of 264.0 ± 15.3 mm. Throughfall monitoring demonstrated that closed canopies transferred significantly more water as throughfall than intermediate or open canopies, due to differences in their effect on water movement through the canopies. The proportion of precipitation that passed through the canopies to the forest floor as throughfall was measured to be 76.5%, 77.3% and 89.4 %, or 202, 204 and 236 mm per month, respectively for open, intermediate, and closed canopies. It was found that higher levels of canopy cover resulted in significantly higher amounts of total organic carbon (TOC) content per unit of throughfall; specifically, 2.5 2.8 and 3.4 mg L-1 respectively for the open, intermediate, and closed canopies. When coupled with the higher quantity of throughfall in the closed canopy, the higher concentration of carbon results in a greater amount of carbon brought to the peatland forest floor by the throughfall pathway. This could also have impacts for other nutrients in the peatland soil. © 2017, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

This study aimed to evaluate mite populations from surveys in commercial coffee (Coffea arabica) orchards managed in different ways. Four different cropping systems were compared: a conventional system (CS), non-pesticide system (NPS), organic system (OS) and organic agroforestry system (OAS). Mite samples were taken from 24 coffee plantations (n = 6 for each management strategy). Six leaves per plant were collected from five sampling sites totalling 30 leaves from each plantation. Mites were removed from individual leaves, counted and identified to family level. Amongst the predatory mites, two families were detected; the Phytoseiidae was the most abundant family while the Stigmaeidae, generalist predatory mites, were only found in two management systems (NPS and AOS). Of the two families of phytophagous mites, the family Tenuipalpidae was the most abundant, but rarely found in AOS. The other phytophagous family, Tetranychidae, was less abundant in coffee crops than Tenuipalpidae, but the most abundant phytophagous family in CS.

GG and REDD+ are both considered important strategies and are often seen as synergistic in achieving major changes in economic, regulatory and governance frameworks. Of concern, however, is that GG is sometimes seen as greenwashing of economic activities (which could include forest conversion to other land uses) by an oversimplified presentation of win-win solutions without challenging the actual root causes of unsustainable growth. How GG and REDD+ can contribute to transformational change in policy and practice depends on the relationship between these narratives, especially whether their adoption in national level policies manifests synergies or discord. In this paper, we will answer this question through analysing: (1) how the two narratives have unfolded in Vietnam and Indonesia and to what extent REDD+ and GG rhetoric include concrete policy objectives; (2) what issues policy actors perceive as challenges for their implementation. A comparative, mixed methods approach was employed to analyze how REDD+ and GG are framed in national policy documents. This analysis was supported by data from interviews with policy actors in both countries in two points of time, 2011/12 and 2015/16. The findings highlight the challenges for implementation of both REDD+ and GG as individual policy programmes, and the dilution of the REDD+ agenda and decision makers' confusion about a GG strategy when these narratives are joined and translated by decision makers. Actors still perceive development and environmental objectives as a zero-sum struggle, favouring a development narrative that might lead to neither REDD+ nor green policy action. We conclude that REDD+ and GG can go hand in hand, if there is action to tackle deforestation and degradation. © 2018 BMJ Publishing Group.

These data provide an excellent basis for continental and global-scale analyses of drivers and solutions for deforestation, which were not possible in the past due to the incomparability of data elaborated by different agencies and for different regions. In this article, I compare subcountry tree and forest cover and deforestation rates computed from these datasets at a continental extent for Africa. I illustrate the application of these data by exploring the relation of deforestation with precolonial institutions, protected areas, and road density, timely examples that highlight the relevance of encountering discrepant data sources.

The understanding of the consequences of zinc application requires insight into ecological aspects of changes in soil microbial communities. Here, we evaluated the effects of zinc application on richness, diversity, evenness and structure of microbial functional genes in sugarcane-cultivated soil, and response thresholds of abundance for groups of microbial functional genes on different zinc concentrations added to the soil (0, 5, 10 and 20 kg Zn ha−1) in two sugarcane fields in the Northeastern São Paulo state, Brazil. Using a high-density functional gene array termed GeoChip 5.0, which contains 101,796 distinct probes belonging to gene categories involved in zinc transport, secondary metabolism, stress, virulence and nutrient cycling, differences were observed in the functional gene structure of microbial communities and abundance of specific gene families with a threshold between 5 and 10 kg Zn ha−1. However, the richness, diversity and evenness of functional genes did not differ across the zinc gradients in soil. Cluster analysis based on microbial functional subcategories revealed variation in abundances across the gradient of zinc concentrations in soil mainly for virulence, stress, secondary metabolism, and carbon- and phosphorus-cycling-related gene families. A threshold in abundance was observed between 5 and 10 kg Zn ha−1 with high abundance of microbial gene families associated with zinc transporter proteins, antioxidant enzymes, exoenzymes associated with infection, secretion proteins, virulence regulatory genes, carbon fixation, and phosphorus utilization in soils supplemented with up to 5 kg Zn ha−1. In these same soils, reduced abundance was observed for gene families associated with methanogenesis, metabolism of halogen and carotenoid, and antiphagocytosis compared with soil supplements with 10 or 20 kg Zn ha−1.

Recovery increases carbon sequestration into the soil and can potentially avoid deforestation; thereby reducing emissions intensity (EI), but only at increased investment cost per unit of area. We develop a multi-period linear programming (LP) model for grazing beef production planning to represent a typical Cerrado stocking and finishing beef farm. We compare economic and environmental performance of two alternative optimized pasture management approaches relative to the traditional practice (TRP), which is based on restoring pasture after a full degradation cycle of 8 years. The scenarios considered the difference made by access to subsidized credit through the Low Carbon Agriculture program (“Programa ABC”). The model estimates EI using upstream life cycle assessment (LCA), and dynamically estimates soil organic carbon (SOC) changes as a function of pasture management. The results show net present values (NPV) ranging from − 67 Brazilian reals per hectare-year (R$·ha− 1·yr− 1) to around 300 R$·ha− 1·yr− 1, respectively for traditional and optimized pasture management strategies. Estimated EI of the TRP is 9.26 kg CO2 equivalent per kg of carcass weight equivalent (kg CO2e/kg CWE) relative to 3.59 kg CO2e/kg CWE for optimized management. Highest emission abatement results from improved SOC sequestration, while access to credit could further reduce EI by around 20%. We consider the effects of alternative credit interest on both NPV and EI.

Current ethanol production is based on first generation (1G) technology, which ferments the sugars extracted from sugarcane stalks. Cellulosic ethanol (2G) can be produced from what is currently considered agricultural and agro-industrial residues (straw and bagasse), and also from dedicated high biomass-producing crops. 2G ethanol provides an opportunity to intensify production, obtaining more energy per unit of area cropped and potentially reducing the environmental footprint. Straw removal from the field has more negative than positive consequences for the environment and the production system, but the effects need to be evaluated at the site and regional levels. The use of bagasse as feedstock should be evaluated using life cycle assessment methods to account for its alternative uses as raw material and in cogeneration. Energy cane, a vigorous and rustic crop selected for total biomass production rather than for sucrose, is a promising feedstock for 2G ethanol. The presence of rhizomes, a deep root system, and intensive tillering contribute to erosion control, crop longevity, and soil carbon sequestration. There is a need for more long-term experiments focusing on soil quality, nutrient cycling, greenhouse gas emissions, and crop production using innovative techniques such as stable isotope labeling andintensive soil flux measurements with automatic chambers to understand the impact of removing crop residues for bioenergy production and of using highbiomass dedicated crops. Process-based models are useful in sustainability assessments of 2G sugarcane ethanol production since they take into account site and regional variability in soil biogeochemistry, climate parameters, management practices, plant genetic traits, and the interactions of these factors. The integration of models and geographic information systems allows for regional assessments of the potential impacts of bioenergy production, contributing to the identification and promotion of sustainable pathways for cellulosic ethanol production. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Crop residues and Energy cane and Life cycle assessment and Modeling,10.1007/978-3-319-49826-3_10,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032691124&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-49826-3_10&partnerID=40&md5=d474ebb3600511504c5dd22669f1b2b8,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 11,NA,CHAP,NA,177,195,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2555

There is a widely acknowledged need for more integrated approaches to sustainable land use that reconcile multiple landscape functions, sectors and stakeholders. However, this faces a number of challenges in practice, including the lack of policy coherence and institutional conflicts across agricultural and forest sectors. In this context, the global climate change mitigation mechanism of “reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation” (REDD+) has been flagged as a unique opportunity to stimulate the development and institutionalization of more integrated, “landscape” approaches to sustainable land use. In this article, we provide a reality check for the prospects of REDD+ to deliver on this promise, through analyzing three pioneer cases of REDD+ development and implementation in Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico. We analyze how REDD+ has operated in each of these three contexts, based on field work, key-informant interviews, and analysis of primary and secondary documents. Our findings suggest that REDD+ has stimulated development of “niche” sustainable land-use investments in each case, which aim to integrate forest conservation and agricultural development goals, but has done so while competing with business-as-usual incentives. We conclude that national and international political commitment to more integrated and sustainable land-use approaches is a precondition for, rather than a result of, transformative REDD+ interventions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Conservation and Degradation and Emission and Forests and Incentives and Agriculture and Climate change and Conservation and Deforestation and Economics and Forestry and Agricultural development and Forest conservation and Global climate changes and Global sustainability and Integrated approach and Landscape functions and Reducing emissions and Sustainable land use and Land use,10.1016/j.forpol.2016.12.013,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85008457435&doi=10.1016%2fj.forpol.2016.12.013&partnerID=40&md5=d8cf2fc40e6341ac9a2ca684175ed05c,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 56,NA,JOUR,NA,10,20,NA,MAY,1389-9341 and 1872-7050,WOS:000399519900002,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2567, 5199"

Five patterns of cocoa farming systems were considered: cocoa farming + mixed wood trees (agroforestry complex), cocoa farming + fruit trees (agroforestry simple), cocoa farming + candlenut trees (agroforestry simple), cocoa farming + teak trees (agroforestry simple), and monoculture cocoa farming. Five sample plots were made in each cocoa-farming pattern, sized 20 × 20 m for tree vegetation sampling. Subplots of 10 × 10 m, 5 × 5 m, and 2 × 2 m were used to sample vegetation at earlier growth stages. The results showed that using a pattern of cocoa + mixed wood trees (agroforestry complex) produced the highest biomass. A pattern of cocoa + candlenut gave the highest average income per year, but the pattern of cocoa + mixed wood trees did differ significantly from that using candlenut.

Due to the rapid expansion of afforestation in grassland ecosystems, we used environmental descriptors and structure of amphibian and reptile communities as a tool to assess the possible effects of forestry on wildlife. We used pitfall traps with drift fences in Eucalyptus afforestation and native grasslands of the Pampa biome from southern Brazil. Amphibians and reptile species richness was lower in afforestation than in native grasslands. Furthermore, the reptile community found in afforestation was a poor subset of the community recorded in native grasslands. Indeed, the structure of communities for both amphibians and reptiles in afforestation was highly dissimilar from the native grasslands, with major environmental descriptors that influenced this difference being related to the structure of undergrowth vegetation, incident light, and sodium concentration in soil. Amphibians and reptiles proved to be an efficient tool to assess the potential impacts effects of afforestation/forestation since the replacement of natural grassland ecosystems by eucalypt afforestation caused detectable negative effects on the diversity of herpetofauna.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the structure of copronecrophagous dung beetle communities inhabiting the main agroecosystems in southern Brazil and correlate the presence of these organisms with soil properties. From December 2012 to April 2013, samples of dung beetles were taken in the municipality of Tubarão, Santa Catarina, Brazil (28° 28’ S; 48° 56’ W) in corn, bean, and sugarcane crops, and in cattle pastures. Beetles were captured in 16 sampling sites, four from each agroecosystem, following a standardized methodology: 10 baited pitfall traps (feces and rotting meat) at a spacing of 50 m with exposure for 48 h. The beetles were identified, weighed, and measured. Soil analyses were performed in order to correlate data on organic matter, texture, macro and micronutrients, and pH with data on the abundance of beetle species using canonical correspondence analysis. A total of 110 individuals belonging to 10 species of dung beetles was found. Twenty-four individuals from seven species (with total biomass of 2.4 g) were found in the corn crop; five individuals from three species (1.8 g) were found in the bean crop; 81 individuals from nine species (30.3 g) were found in cattle pasture areas; and lastly, there were no dung beetles recorded in the sugarcane crop. In areas of cattle grazing, the tunnelers Dichotomius nisus and Trichillum externepunctatum correlated positively with organic matter content, whereas the roller species Canthon chalybaeus correlated positively with soil texture, preferring sandier soils. In corn crop areas, D. nisus was again correlated with organic matter content. Paracoprid dung beetle species were correlated with organic matter content in the soil, and species belonging to the roller functional group were associated with soil texture in the corn crop, preferring sandy soils. Information regarding the relationship of dung beetles with physical-chemical soil properties may be an important strategy for increasing fertility and management of soil conservation in agroecosystems. © 2017, Revista Brasileira de Ciencia do Solo.

At the same time, there is high uncertainty about how much revenue can reasonably be expected from land use emissions reductions initiatives. Despite this uncertainty, REDD+ projects and conservation initiatives that aim to take advantage of available or, more commonly, future funding from carbon markets have proliferated. This study used participatory multi-stakeholder workshops to develop divergent future scenarios of land use in eight landscapes in four countries around the world: Peru, Indonesia, Tanzania, and Mexico. The results of these future scenario building exercises were analyzed using a new tool, CarboScen, for calculating the landscape carbon storage implications of different future land use scenarios. The findings suggest that potential revenues from carbon storage or emissions reductions are significant in some landscapes (most notably the peat forests of Indonesia), and much less significant in others (such as the low-carbon forests of Zanzibar and the interior of Tanzania). The findings call into question the practicality of many conservation programs that hinge on expectations of future revenue from carbon finance.

The aim of this study was to find native PSF species that are suitable for reforestation in the open degraded peatlands. We established two planting experiments in degraded peat areas with 21 tree species to study the survival and growth in relation to environmental factors for 2 years. The study sites were located in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia in the degraded peatland of the Ex-Mega Rice area and along the degraded margins of the river Sabangau. Seed material collected from local forests was grown in a field nursery and planted 6–11 months later in the field. Growth and mortality of the seedlings and environmental variables (water table, temperature) were monitored frequently for two years. The effects of the environmental variables on growth were tested with mixed-effects models and on mortality with Cox regression. As a result, we could derive species-specific information of the seedlings’ early stage ecology and suitability for restoration. The most promising species based on the analysis were Shorea balangeran, Adenanthera pavonina, Dacryodes rostrata and Lithocarpus dasystachys.

With the progressive shift from a burned to a nonburned harvest system, most of the straw presently retained on the soil surface has become economically viable feedstock for bioenergy production. The trade-offs between the need to preserve soil quality and produce more bioenergy have been the subject of intense discussion. This study presents a synthesis of available information on the magnitude of the main impacts of straw removal from sugarcane fields for bioenergy production and therefore represents an easily available resource to guide management decisions on the recommended amount of straw to be maintained on the field to take advantage of the agronomic, environmental, and industrial benefits. Crop residues remaining on sugarcane fields provide numerous ecosystem services including nutrient recycling, soil biodiversity, water storage, carbon accumulation, control of soil erosion, and weed infestation. Furthermore, several studies reported higher sugarcane production under straw retention on the field, while few suggest that straw may jeopardize biomass production in cold regions and under some specific soil conditions. Pest control is among the parameters favored by straw removal, while N2O emissions are increased only if straw is associated with the application of N fertilizer and vinasse. An appropriate recommendation, which is clearly site specific, should be based on a minimum mass of straw on the field to provide those benefits. Overall, this review indicates that most of the agronomic and environmental benefits are achieved when at least 7 Mg ha−1 of dry straw is maintained on the soil surface. However, modeling efforts are of paramount importance to assess the magnitude and rates of straw removal considering the several indicators involved in this complex equation, so that an accurate straw recovery rate could be provided to producers and industry toward greater sustainability. © 2016 The Authors Global Change Biology Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2G bioethanol and bioelectricity and bioenergy and Saccharum spp. and soil management and soil quality and sugarcane trash and sugarcane yield and sustainability and Brazil and Agricultural wastes and Agronomy and Biodiversity and Bioelectric phenomena and Biomass and Economic and social effects and Ecosystems and Electrophysiology and Information management and Soils and Sustainable development and Water recycling and Weed control and Bio-energy and Saccharum spp and Soil management and Soil quality and Sugarcane yield and agronomy and bioenergy and crop residue and ecosystem service and environmental impact and ethanol and literature review and soil conservation and soil management and soil quality and soil surface and straw and sugar cane and sustainability and Soil conservation,10.1111/gcbb.12410,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85007198752&doi=10.1111%2fgcbb.12410&partnerID=40&md5=957882e20e08cbfd9c6ed4028b030cb7,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 191,NA,JOUR,7,1181,1195,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2584

In particular, malaria in the Amazon region is often cited as an example of how forest conservation can improve public health outcomes. However, despite a growing body of literature and an increased understanding of the relationship between malaria and land use / land cover change (LULC) in Amazonia, contradictions have emerged. While some studies report that deforestation increases malaria risk, others claim the opposite. Assessing malaria risk requires examination of dynamic processes among three main components: (i) the environment (i.e. LULC and landscape transformations), (ii) vector biology (e.g. mosquito species distributions, vector activity and life cycle, plasmodium infection rates), and (iii) human populations (e.g. forest-related activity, host susceptibility, movement patterns). In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review on malaria risk and deforestation in the Amazon focusing on these three components. We explore key features that are likely to generate these contrasting results using the reviewed articles and our own data from Brazil and Peru, and conclude with suggestions for productive avenues in future research. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Several vegetation attributes (e.g. street tree density and diversity) have important effects on biodiversity and ecological processes. In this study, we evaluated the influences of urban vegetation-represented by characteristics of street trees (canopy size, proportion of native tree species and tree species richness)-and characteristics of the landscape (distance to parks and vegetation quantity), and human impacts (human population size and exposure to noise) on taxonomic data and functional diversity indices of the bird community inhabiting streets. The study area was the southern region of Belo Horizonte (Minas Gerais, Brazil), a largely urbanized city in the understudied Neotropical region. Bird data were collected on 60 point count locations distributed across the streets of the landscape. We used a series of competing GLM models (using Akaike's information criterion for small sample sizes) to assess the relative contribution of the different sets of variables to explain the observed patterns. Seventy-three bird species were observed exploiting the streets: native species were the most abundant and frequent throughout this landscape. The bird community's functional richness and Rao's Quadratic Entropy presented values lower than 0.5. Therefore, this landscape was favoring few functional traits. Exposure to noise was the most limiting factor for this bird community. However, the average size of arboreal patches and, especially the characteristics of street trees, were able to reduce the negative effects of noise on the bird community. These results show the importance of adequately planning the urban afforestation process: increasing tree species richness, preserving large trees and planting more native trees species in the streets are management practices that will increase bird species richness, abundance and community functional aspects and consequently improve human wellbeing and quality of life. © 2017 Pena et al.

In the southern area of the bay, 82,120 ha of mangrove forest are actively undergoing a management regime conducted by PT. Bintuni Utama Murni Wood Industries (PT. BUMWI). Operations are focused upon woodchip production; however, sustainable forest management is also a priority as the area is Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC®) certified. Currently, PT BUMWI is approaching the completion of a 25-year rotation (with stands ranging from 0 to 25 years) which presents a good time to examine and evaluate current management practices and their effects on the forest concession. Part of a successful regeneration of a forest stand is attaining the range of ecological integrity and ecosystem functions similar to baseline forests. Forest structure and complexity, along with biodiversity at the stand level could function as regeneration criteria to evaluate the success of a sustainable forest management program. The objective of the study was to observe if the forest structure and biodiversity in secondary stands, considered as proxies for ecological integrity, would regenerate to similar levels within the 25 years as baseline forests. Post-harvest forest regeneration was evaluated in different aged secondary forest stands by measuring biomass, species composition and forest structure in circular plots along transects. Nonlinear regression was used to determine and predict different forest structure dynamics (sapling and stem densities, tree height, DBH), diversity and volumes throughout and beyond the 25-year rotation period. Dynamics in species composition and diversity of tree species was observed. Results suggest that the forest structure in secondary stands follows a natural regeneration dynamic over the rotation period but had not yet attained the same structure and composition as baseline forests at 25 years. Furthermore, growth models suggest that the harvest rotation may need to be extended to 30–40 years for secondary stands to attain similar ranges of forest structure, compositions and volumes to that of baseline forests. These observations will help future forest management of the concession as the company strives to manage secondary forests to keep the same ecosystem functions and high volumes observed in baseline forests. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Forest structure and Logging and Regeneration and Silviculture and Sustainable management and Forest Management and Forests and Harvesting and Indonesia and Plants and Reforestation and Indonesia and West Papua and Aves and Bins and Biodiversity and Ecology and Ecosystems and Function evaluation and Harvesting and Logging (forestry) and Natural resources and Reforestation and Rotation and Structure (composition) and Sustainable development and Environmental conditions and Forest stewardship councils and Forest structure and Regeneration and Silviculture and Sustainable forest management and Sustainable management and Vegetation regeneration and biodiversity and ecosystem function and forest management and geomorphology and growth modeling and mangrove and regeneration and secondary forest and sustainability and Forestry,10.1016/j.foreco.2017.01.022,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85012298942&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2017.01.022&partnerID=40&md5=e002518a1b3382c7a258e52901fb6cb1,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 76,NA,JOUR,NA,137,146,NA,APR 15,0378-1127 and 1872-7042,WOS:000398873700014,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2588, 5144"

Environmental mercury levels may harm the survival and diversity of the soil fauna. In this respect, efforts have been made to establish limit values of mercury (Hg) in soils to terrestrial fauna. Soil organisms such as earthworms and enchytraeids have intimate contact with trace metals in soil by their oral and dermal routes, reflecting the potentially adverse effects of this contaminant. The main goal of this study was to obtain Hg critical concentrations under normal and extreme conditions of moisture in tropical soils to Enchytraeus crypticus to order to assess if climate change may potentiate their acute and chronic toxicity effects. Tropical soils were sampled from of two Forest Conservation Units of the Rio de Janeiro State – Brazil, which has been contaminated by Hg atmospheric depositions. Worms were exposed to three moisture conditions, at 20%, 50% and 80% of water holding capacity, respectively, and in combination with different Hg (HgCl2) concentrations spiked in three types of tropical soil (two natural soils and one artificial soil). The tested concentrations ranged from 0 to 512 mg Hg kg−1 dry weight.

Assessment of changes in the community structure during the recovery of forests can be performed using indicator organisms. Dung beetles perform several ecological functions and show high sensitivity to natural and anthropogenic environmental changes. This study aimed to investigate the effect of regeneration time of Atlantic Forest sites on structure of Scarabaeinae assemblages. We sampled dung beetles using ten baited pitfall traps per site, in six sites grouped into three classes of forest regeneration time (~30, ~60 and >80 years) in the southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest, during January 2015. A total of 520 individuals belonging to 16 species and nine genera of dung beetles were sampled. Rarefied species richness did not differ between sites with different regeneration times. Average species richness and abundance of Scarabaeinae was smaller in areas of shorter recovery time. True alpha diversity was higher in areas with intermediate recovery whereas Shannon diversity showed higher values in areas of shorter recovery. Approximately 29 % of the variation in abundance data of Scarabaeinae was explained by environmental variables, with one-third of this variation explained also by spatial predictors. External factors such as landscape management and farming practices in the surroundings must be taken into consideration in management plans and the management of natural areas for the recovery of biodiversity in the Atlantic Forest. These external factors can considerably affect the structure of communities and lead to scenarios of greater diversity in intermediate regeneration sites due to the heterogeneity of the landscape. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Beta diversity and Bioindicators and Fragmentation and Spatial analysis and Atlantic Forest and Brazil and Coleoptera and Scarabaeinae and abundance and beetle and bioindicator and community structure and ecosystem service and forest dynamics and fragmentation and regeneration and species diversity and species richness,10.1007/s10841-016-9917-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84988699180&doi=10.1007%2fs10841-016-9917-3&partnerID=40&md5=eeae9c108d3fb0412795d1013eff4086,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 10,NA,JOUR,5,855,866,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2605

We assessed the effects of these LUC on the abundance and community structure of animals that inhabit soils belowground through a field survey using chronosequences of land uses comprising native vegetation, pasture, and sugarcane along a 1000-km-long transect across these two major tropical biomes in Brazil. Macrofauna community composition differed among land uses. While most groups were associated with samples taken in native vegetation, high abundance of termites and earthworms appeared associated with pasture soils. Linear mixed effects analysis showed that LUC affected total abundance (X2(1) = 6.79, p = 0.03) and taxa richness (X2(1) = 6.08, p = 0.04) of soil macrofauna. Abundance increased from 411 ± 70 individuals m-2 in native vegetation to 1111 ± 202 individuals m-2 in pasture, but decreased sharply to 106 ± 24 individuals m-2 in sugarcane soils. Diversity decreased 24% from native vegetation to pasture, and 39% from pasture to sugarcane. Thus, a reduction of ~90% in soil macrofauna abundance, besides a loss of ~40% in the diversity of macrofauna groups, can be expected when sugarcane crops replace pasture in Brazilian tropical soils. In general, higher abundances of major macrofauna groups (ants, coleopterans, earthworms, and termites) were associated with higher acidity and low contents of macronutrients and organic matter in soil. This study draws attention for a significant biodiversity loss belowground due to tropical LUC in sugarcane expansion areas. Given that many groups of soil macrofauna are recognized as key mediators of ecosystem processes such as soil aggregation, nutrients cycling and soil carbon storage, our results warrant further efforts to understand the impacts of altering belowground biodiversity and composition on soil functioning and agriculture performance across LUC in the tropics. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Bioenergy crops and Land use change and Soil biodiversity and Agriculture and Animals and Biodiversity and Brazil and Insecta and Invertebrates and Oligochaeta and Saccharum and Soil and Atlantic Forest and Brazil and Animalia and Coleoptera and Formicidae and Isoptera and Saccharum and Agriculture and Animals and Biodiversity and Biofuels and Carbon and Crops and Forestry and Land use and Tropics and Vegetation and soil organic matter and Bioenergy crops and Community composition and Community structures and Ecosystem process and Land-use change and Nutrients cycling and Soil biodiversity and Soil carbon storage and biodiversity and bioenergy and biome and cerrado and community structure and energy crop and land use change and relative abundance and soil fauna and species richness and sugar cane and ant and Article and beetle and biodiversity and Brazil and community structure and earthworm and energy crop and Isoptera and land use and macronutrient and nonhuman and pastureland and population abundance and priority journal and soil acidity and soil fauna and species richness and sugarcane and vegetation and agriculture and animal and biodiversity and chemistry and growth, development and aging and insect and invertebrate and Oligochaeta and physiology and soil and sugarcane and Soils",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.04.116,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84973131571&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2016.04.116&partnerID=40&md5=d438b1211ac7a4fecc38b30c094bf21d,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 67,NA,JOUR,NA,160,168,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2611
2612,Scopus,Book chapter,"Knoke, T.",2016,Forest management,"Tropical Forestry Handbook, Second Edition",3,NA,"Sustainable forest management (SFM) is here considered as all practices to produce a continuous flow of desired forest goods and services without undue reduction in the forest’s inherent values and future productivity and without undue undesirable effects on the physical and social environment (according to ITTO (2006) Status of Tropical Forest Management 2005). SFM has often been regarded as a means for the salvation of the still declining tropical forests. In this chapter, I investigate under which circumstances the expectation of SFM being an option to preserve tropical forests may be true. This question is addressed in three parts, mainly based on the existing literature, but partly also through simulations. The topics addressed are: (I) the characteristics of SFM for tropical natural forests, (II) the characteristics of planted forests in the tropics, and (III) SFM embedded in a land-use model together with agricultural land-use options. The results for part I show that SFM of natural forests would basically lead to decreasing timber yield, moderately reduced carbon stocks, and only marginally disturbed biodiversity. The economic performance of SFM is relatively low and inferior compared to the economic performance of planted forests and agricultural alternatives. The planted forests, investigated in part II, promise high profitability, even in the case of some native tree species. However, simulations by means of an economically driven land-use model show that planted forests would expand their area into natural forests, if afforestation is not directed to abandoned lands and if natural forests are not preserved by means of conservation payments transferred to land users. These results lead to part III, where SFM in natural forests and afforestation of abandoned lands are considered as parts of a more comprehensive land-use portfolio, in this case designed for the example of Ecuador, considering croplands and pastures as agricultural options. The composition of the land-use portfolio is controlled by the economic yield and risk of the land-use options considered. SFM of natural forests generates little economic yield for the land users; however, because of the vast area under consideration, the necessary conservation transfers to land users may greatly be reduced if the management of natural forests is considered. The afforestation of abandoned lands also increases the profitability of the resulting land-use portfolio and sequesters additional carbon on top of that. However, the recultivation of part of the abandoned lands back to pasture turned out to be a very important option as well. It helps in producing enough food, which, and in turn, secures moderate food prices. Moderate food prices have the advantage being responsible for moderate conservation payments to compensate for the opportunity costs of the preservation of natural forests. As a result, strategies to produce enough food without additional CO2 emissions can be designed at a minimal conservation costs. The analyses show that SFM and afforestation can complement agricultural land-use portfolios. This is also shown in more detail based on a farm-level consideration. It is concluded that SFM in natural forests and planted forests is a valuable option to increase the efficiency of sustainable land-use portfolios. It is, ultimately, of utmost importance to embed these forestry options in comprehensive land-use models to avoid undue undesirable effects, which could potentially be caused by indirect land-use change. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.",Deforestation and Economic land-use model and Sustainable forest management and Tropical agriculture and Tropical plantations,10.1007/978-3-642-54601-3_139,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85017660675&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-642-54601-3_139&partnerID=40&md5=3246ca1f26dfddfc4e9167a2697a1073,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 1,NA,CHAP,NA,1763,1791,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2612

Plant diversity after 16 years post coal mining in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 17: 531-538. Post coal mining areas need to be rehabilitated through reclamation and revegetation. The objective of this study was to evaluate plant diversity after 16 years of revegetation activities in a coal mining reclamation site in East Kalimantan. In an effort to restore plant diversity, the coal mining company began by planting fast growing species as pioneers, then planting local species after three years. This study compared a 20 hectare reclamation site with conditions in the pre-mining area, which covered 14,988 hectares. Vegetation sampling was conducted in 20 plots measuring 20x20 m2 along line transects, with 100 m distance between plots. A total of 104 plant species were found in the reclamation site, consisting of 76 tree species and 28 herbaceous species. Tree species consisted of 35 planted local species (e.g., Dryobalanops aromatica, Eusideroxylon zwageri, Macaranga gigantea), 25 planted nonlocal species, and 16 local species that grew spontaneously (e.g., Leucaena glauca, Lansium domesticum, Shorea laevis). In comparison, 133 species were found in the pre-mining site, consisting of 132 local tree species, one non-local tree species (Acacia mangium) and 52 herbaceous species. Tree species diversity index in the reclamation site after 16 years post mining (i.e., 3.54) was still lower than in the pre-mining area (4.29); while the diversity indices for herbaceous plants were relatively similar (2.97 and 2.67 in the reclamation and pre-mining sites respectively). The slightly higher diversity of herbaceous plants in the reclamation site may be attributed to higher coverage per species in this site, despite lower species richness. © 2016, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

This modeling approach posits an assumed goal or objective that a decision-maker seeks to optimize subject to a set of biological constraints. The power of this method derives from its ability to evaluate a wide array of alternative policy or management innovations over timescales that are radically longer than the timescales considered in many other approaches to economic analysis. In this chapter, we review techniques and applications of two complementary classes of bioeconomic models that have been used to analyze alternative strategies for sustainable use of tropical forests. First, continuoustime bioeconomic models have been used to derive dynamic policy prescriptions for optimally balancing tropical timber production and tropical forest conservation over very long time scales. Second, discrete-time bioeconomic models have been used to evaluate alternative on-the-ground timber harvesting strategies. Emerging threats associated with climate change could be addressed with bioeconomic models that consider the resilience of tropical forests to potentially catastrophic changes. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.",Ecosystem service benefits and Non-market values and Optimal control and Social welfare and Time preference and Tropical forest conservation,10.1007/978-3-642-54601-3_221,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85017628956&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-642-54601-3_221&partnerID=40&md5=85e3ba20208bf5b6e40c9637f8470673,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 1,NA,CHAP,NA,2897,2921,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2618

In Sumatra, Indonesia, lowland rainforest has mainly been transformed by smallholders into oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) and rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) monocultures, interspersed with jungle rubber (rubber agroforests) and a few forest remnants. In two regions of the Jambi province, we conducted point counts in 32 plots of four different land-use types (lowland rainforest, jungle rubber, rubber plantation and oil palm plantation) as well as in 16 nearby homegardens, representing a small-scale, traditional agricultural system. We analysed total bird abundance and bird abundance in feeding guilds, as well as species richness per point count visit, per plot, and per land-use system, to unveil the conservation importance and functional responses of birds in the different land-use types. In total, we identified 71 species from 24 families. Across the different land-use types, abundance did not significantly differ, but both species richness per visit and per plot were reduced in plantations. Feeding guild abundances between land-use types were variable, but homegardens were dominated by omnivores and granivores, and frugivorous birds were absent from monoculture rubber and oil palm. Jungle rubber played an important role in harbouring forest bird species and frugivores. Homegardens turned out to be of minor importance for conserving birds due to their low sizes, although collectively, they are used by many bird species. Changes in functional composition with land-use conversion may affect important ecosystem functions such as biological pest control, pollination, and seed dispersal. In conclusion, maintaining forest cover, including degraded forest and jungle rubber, is of utmost importance to the conservation of functional and taxonomic bird diversity. © 2016 Prabowo et al.

Because grasslands are typically grazed by livestock and wildlife, the invasion is a community process modulated by herbivory. We hypothesized that the invasion of native South American grasslands by Eragrostis plana Nees, an exotic tussock-forming grass from Africa, could be deterred by grazing if grazers switched dietary preferences and included the invasive grass as a large proportion of their diets. Bos taurus (heifers) and Ovis aries (ewes) grazed plots with varying degrees of invasion by E. plana in a replicated manipulative experiment. Animal positions and species grazed were observed every minute in 45- min grazing session. Proportion of bites and steps in and out of E. plana tussocks were measured and used to calculate several indices of selectivity. Both heifers and ewes exhibited increasing probability of grazing E. plana as the proportion of area covered by tussocks increased, but they behaved differently. In agreement with expectations based on the allometry of dietary preferences and morphology, ewes consumed a low proportion of E. plana, except in areas that had more than 90% E. plana cover. Heifers consumed proportionally more E. plana than ewes. Contrary to our hypothesis, herbivores did not exhibit dietary switching towards the invasive grass. Moreover, they exhibited avoidance of the invasive grass and preference for short-statured native species, both of which should tend to enhance invasion. Unless invasive plants are highly palatable to livestock, the effect of grazing to deter the invasion is limited, due to the inherent avoidance of the invasive grass by the main grazers in the ecosystem, particularly sheep. © 2016 Bremm et al.

Soil and leaf nutrient status on growth of Macaranga gigantea in secondary forest after shifting cultivation in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 17: 409-416. Macaranga gigantea is an important pioneer plant species in the tropical secondary forest of Kalimantan and as far the attractive wood species was not commercially cultivated. This study aims to determine the soil and nutrient status on growth of M. gigantea in the secondary forest particularly after shifting cultivation activity. For this purposes, the observation plots with 50m x 50m sizes were made and measured to collect the data of diameter, height, soil conditions and leaf nutrient concentrations (N, P and K) of M. gigantea in different ages of natural growth. A simple linear correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship of plant growth with the leaf and soil nutrient concentrations as well. The results showed that the soil condition on growth of M. gigantea has the average at pH 4.7, CEC 5.57 meq/100g, base saturation 30.22%, and the concentration of soil nutrients were 0.062±0.015% (N), 12.65±4.9 ppm (P), and 57.76±33 ppm (K). We also found that the leaf nutrient concentration was 1.94±0.13% (N), 0.22±0.08% (P) and 0.66±0.27% (K), respectively. Moreover, the highest growth of diameter was found from the 6 years old of plant (27.88 m). The annual yield of diameter and high were 4.65 cm year-1 and 2.96 year-1 and it was gradually decreased until the 10 years old of plant. The negative correlations was observed from the soil nutrient K and growth of diameter and high of M. gigantea (r=0.95, p< 0.05). The positive correlation was observed from the P and K content in the leaf of plant and growth of M. gigantea (diameter, height and volume increment, p<0.1). We suggested that phosphorus and kalium content was play an important roles on the growth of M. gigantea and this nutrient factor should be considered well when this species will be cultivated for the commercial purposes in the future. © 2016, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

A Case Study for Central Kalimantan, Indonesia","Environmental Management, ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT",57,NA,"There is increasing experience with the valuation of ecosystem services. However, to date, less attention has been devoted to who is actually benefiting from ecosystem services. This nevertheless is a key issue, in particular, if ecosystem services analysis and valuation is used to support environmental management. This study assesses and analyzes how the monetary benefits of seven ecosystem services are generated in Central Kalimantan Province, Indonesia, are distributed to different types of beneficiaries. We analyze the following ecosystem services: (1) timber production; (2) rattan collection; (3) jelutong resin collection; (4) rubber production (based on permanent agroforestry systems); (5) oil palm production on three management scales (company, plasma farmer, and independent smallholder); (6) paddy production; and (7) carbon sequestration. Our study shows that the benefits generated from these services differ markedly between the stakeholders, which we grouped into private, public, and household entities. The distribution of these benefits is strongly influenced by government policies and in particular benefit sharing mechanisms. Hence, land-use change and policies influencing land-use change can be expected to have different impacts on different stakeholders. Our study also shows that the benefits generated by oil palm conversion, a main driver for land-use change in the province, are almost exclusively accrued by companies and at this point in time are shared unequally with local stakeholders. © 2015, The Author(s).",Beneficiaries and Benefits and Ecosystem accounting and Ecosystem management and Ecosystem services and Agriculture and Carbon Sequestration and Conservation of Natural Resources and Ecosystem and Indonesia and Socioeconomic Factors and Central Kalimantan and Indonesia and Calamus rotang and Dyera costulata and Elaeis and Agriculture and Carbon and Ecology and Economics and Environmental management and Forestry and Land use and Palm oil and Agroforestry system and Beneficiaries and Benefits and Carbon sequestration and Ecosystem management and Ecosystem services and Rubber production and Valuation of ecosystem services and accountability and agroforestry and ecosystem management and ecosystem service and governance approach and land use change and monocotyledon and rice and stakeholder and agroforestry and Article and carbon sequestration and case study and ecosystem and Elaeis and employment and environmental management and government and household and human and Indonesia and jelutong resin collection and land use and oil palm production and paddy production and peatland and plantation and policy and rattan collection and rubber production and timber production and wood and agriculture and economics and environmental protection and procedures and socioeconomics and Ecosystems,10.1007/s00267-015-0623-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84954375159&doi=10.1007%2fs00267-015-0623-9&partnerID=40&md5=8061c134ba92ad4d95d6cf70efa7e99c,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 38,NA,JOUR,2,331,344,NA,FEB,0364-152X and 1432-1009,WOS:000368638500008,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2636, 3952"

Reduced-impact farming systems such as agroforests, have been proposed to increase biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. In regions where oil-palm plantations already dominate the landscape, this increase can only be achieved through systematic ecological restoration. However, our knowledge about the underlying ecological and socio-economic processes, constraints, and trade-offs of ecological restoration in oilpalm landscapes is very limited. To bridge this gap, we established a long-term biodiversity enrichment experiment. We established experimental tree islands in a conventional oil-palm plantation and systematically varied plot size, tree diversity, and tree species composition. Here, we describe the rationale and the design of the experiment, the ecosystem variables (soil, topography, canopy openness) and biotic characteristics (associated vegetation, invertebrates, birds) of the experimental site prior to the establishment of the experiment, and initial experimental effects on the fauna. Already one year after establishment of the experiment, tree plantings had an overall positive effect on the bird and invertebrate communities at the plantation scale. The diversity and abundance of invertebrates was positively affected by the size of the tree islands. Based on these results, we expect a further increase of biodiversity and associated ecological functions in the future. The long-term interdisciplinary monitoring of ecosystem variables, flora, fauna, and socio-economic aspects will allow us to evaluate the suitability of tree islands as a restoration measure. Thereof, guidelines for ecologically improved and socio-economically viable restoration and management concepts could be developed. © 2016 Teuscher, Gérard, Brose, Buchori, Clough, Ehbrecht, Hölscher, Irawan, Sundawati, Wollni and Kreft.",Agroforestry and Applied nucleation and Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning and Ecological restoration and Ecosystem services and Tree planting,10.3389/fpls.2016.01538,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84991735500&doi=10.3389%2ffpls.2016.01538&partnerID=40&md5=e62aef62326f809634907ceedf747bad,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 86,NA,JOUR,OCTOBER2016,NA,NA,NA,OCT 17,1664-462X,WOS:000385443300001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2641, 4446"

Restoration on farmland however threatens agricultural output and the livelihoods of small family farmers, leading to weak enforcement of the law and a national debate over the Code which resulted in revisions in 2012 that significantly reduced legally mandated restoration. To inform the design of effective environmental policies, we interviewed 60 typical dairy family farmers utilizing pasture-based agroecological grazing practices to assess their perceptions and knowledge of the pre-2012 Forest Code, its impacts and their willingness to comply. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) identified three distinct clusters: farmers who understood the forest code and its ecological impacts and were willing to comply; farmers who understood the ecological benefits of restoration, but were unwilling to comply; and those with little knowledge of benefits or interest in compliance. We evaluate three policy options for promoting restoration, paying particular attention to their impacts on farmer livelihoods and on their intrinsic willingness to restore and preserve forest cover.

However, information on the influence of shade trees on SOC stock up to 100 cm depth is scarce in the literature. The objectives of this study were to quantify the SOC storage under different cacao AFS, natural forest and pasture to a depth of 100 cm; and to evaluate the origin of SOC using the 13C isotopic ratio as an indicator of relative contribution of trees (C3 plants) and grass (C4 plants), after 4 years of pasture conversion into cacao and rubber AFS. SOC was determined by dry combustion in six layers (0-10, 10-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80 and 80-100 cm). The natural abundance of 13C technique was used only on cacao and rubber lines in contrast to the SOC accumulated by pasture before conversion into AFS. The SOC stock in a depth between 0-100 cm was significantly high in the pasture and in both younger cacao and rubber AFS (4 years old). Systems that were more than 20 years old 'cabruca', cacao and Erythrina and cacao and rubber system (20 years) had lower SOC stocks and did not differ significantly from the natural forest. In the surface layers of soil there were significant differences in the SOC stock. However, below 20 cm all the systems were similar to each other. The SOC stock in the first 20 cm accounted between 31 and 44% of total SOC stored in the 100 cm in the seven systems, followed by 19-23% at a depth of 20-40 cm, 15-18% at a depth of 40-60 cm and 11-14% in the last two depths. After four years of establishment cacao and rubber AFS were the most efficient systems in the accumulation of SOC in the first 20 cm of soil and consequently up to 100 cm deep. Cacao was more efficient than rubber tree to accumulate C3-derived C. While the rubber increased by almost 70% of C3, cacao increased 131%.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of cacao traditional cultivation system (CTCS) on the conservation of the herbivorous insect community when compared with a monodominant rubber agroforest, a type of agricultural system for cacao cultivation. The insects were sampled in three habitats in Southeastern Bahia, Brazil: native forests, CTCS and rubber agroforests. In each habitat, 18 plots of 10 m2 were established, and the structural measures were collected and herbivorous insects were sampled with a Malaise/window trap. The diversity of folivorous decreased with the simplification of vegetation structure, but species composition was similar among habitats. In addition to a decrease in the availability of resources in monodominant rubber agroforests, the latex present in these systems have limited the occurrence of species that cannot circumvent latex toxicity. The diversity of sap-sucking insects was similar among habitats, but species composition was similar only in the CTCS and native forest, and it was different in the rubber agroforest. We observed turnover and a higher frequency of individuals of the family Psyllidae in the rubber agroforest. The biology and behavior of Psyllids and absence of natural enemies enable their diversity to increase when they are adapted to a new host. We observed a shift in the composition of xylophagous insects in the rubber agroforest compared to that in other habitats. Moreover, this agroforest has low species richness, but high individual abundance. Latex extraction is likely an important additional source of volatile compounds discharged into the environment, and it increases the attraction and recruitment of coleoborers to these sites. We concluded that CTCS has an herbivorous insect community with a structure similar to the community found in native forests of the region, and they present a more interesting conservation strategy when compared to rubber agroforests. We also emphasized the potential risk of local pest outbreaks in rubber agroforests for both the rubber and associated cacao trees. © 2016, Universidad de Costa Rica.

Many factors impact forest regeneration, including time and intensity of pasture use before abandonment, and proximity of a source of propagules. Given these conditions, it is necessary to better investigate the effect of such factors on the natural regeneration of abandoned pastureland. Here we employed chronosequences to study secondary forest succession in abandoned pastures along the Madeira River, Rondônia, Brazil. We installed 314 m2 plots in 36 abandoned pastures previously subjected to long-term use (average of 9 years), but now at different stages of natural regeneration. All tree species stems ≥30 cm in height were identified, and their diameter was measured at ground level. Using a historical series of Landsat satellite images, time of pasture encroachment (""encapoeiramento""), time of pasture use, and time since last use were all calculated. The percentage of forest cover adjacent to each plot was calculated using a circular buffer (120 m radius) overlaid on a land-cover classification. Model selection procedure was used to access the importance of four predictors on natural regeneration variables (species density, basal area, stem density). We sampled 6380 stems belonging to 202 morphospecies grouped into 138 genera and 51 families. The two most important species were Vismia guianensis and Vismia gracilis that together represented 40% of abundance, 70% of frequency, and 101% of IVI (Importance Value Index) of the plants sampled. Most species (164) were recorded in a maximum of four out of 36 plots sampled. Species density increased by ca. five species per year after pasture encroachment. Occurrence of rare species increased with time following encroachment, while relative abundance and basal area of the main pioneer species decreased with the advance of forest succession. Time of pasture encroachment, time of pasture use, and time since last use had significant effect on natural regeneration, whereas cover of surrounding forest had limited influence. Although constrained by long-term use, natural regeneration in abandoned pastures occurred relatively rapidly based on the high occurrence of resprouting pioneer species, which formed secondary sites during the first years of succession.

For seagrasses, median above- and below-ground biomass was 0.29 and 1.13 Mg C ha−1 respectively; the median soil pool was 118.1 Mg C ha−1. Combining plant biomass and soil, median carbon storage in an Indonesian seagrass meadow is 119.5 Mg C ha−1. Extrapolated to the estimated total seagrass area of 30,000 km2, the national storage value is 368.5 Tg C. For mangroves, median above- and below-ground biomass was 159.1 and 16.7 Mg C ha−1, respectively; the median soil pool was 774.7 Mg C ha−1. The median carbon storage in an Indonesian mangrove forest is 950.5 Mg C ha−1. Extrapolated to the total estimated mangrove area of 31,894 km2, the national storage value is 3.0 Pg C, a likely underestimate if these habitats sequester carbon at soil depths >1 m and/or sequester inorganic carbon. Together, Indonesia’s seagrasses and mangroves conservatively account for 3.4 Pg C, roughly 17 % of the world’s blue carbon reservoir. Continued degradation and destruction of these wetlands has important consequences for CO2 emissions and dissolved carbon exchange with adjacent coastal waters. We estimate that roughly 29,040 Gg CO2 (eq.) is returned annually to the atmosphere–ocean pool. This amount is equivalent to about 3.2 % of Indonesia’s annual emissions associated with forest and peat land conversion.

Land sparing and land sharing have been suggested as alternative approaches to reconcile this threat with the need for land to produce food. To examine which approach holds most promise for grassland species, we examined how bird population densities changed with farm yield (production per unit area) in the Campos of Brazil and Uruguay. We obtained information on biodiversity and crop yields from 24 sites that differed in agricultural yield. Density-yield functions were fitted for 121 bird species to describe the response of population densities to increasing farm yield, measured in terms of both food energy and profit. We categorized individual species according to how their population changed across the yield gradient as being positively or negatively affected by farming and according to whether the species' total population size was greater under land-sparing, land-sharing, or an intermediate strategy. Irrespective of the yield, most species were negatively affected by farming. Increasing yields reduced densities of approximately 80% of bird species. We estimated land sparing would result in larger populations than other sorts of strategies for 67% to 70% of negatively affected species, given current production levels, including three threatened species. This suggests that increasing yields in some areas while reducing grazing to low levels elsewhere may be the best option for bird conservation in these grasslands. Implementing such an approach would require conservation and production policies to be explicitly linked to support yield increases in farmed areas and concurrently guarantee that larger areas of lightly grazed natural grasslands are set aside for conservation. © 2016, Society for Conservation Biology.",Bird density and Bird responses to yield and Cattle ranching and Eucalypt and Land sharing and Land sparing and Northern Campos and Soya and Agriculture and Animals and Biodiversity and Birds and Brazil and Conservation of Natural Resources and Grassland and Brazil and Campos dos Goytacazes and Rio de Janeiro [Brazil] and Uruguay and Aves and Bos and agriculture and biodiversity and bird and cattle and conservation planning and crop yield and endangered species and grassland and grazing and land management and livestock farming and population density and ranching and soybean and species conservation and agriculture and animal and biodiversity and bird and Brazil and environmental protection and grassland,10.1111/cobi.12635,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84949942872&doi=10.1111%2fcobi.12635&partnerID=40&md5=f2b7aeca831f91c239b9f55a28b91d6b,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 45,NA,JOUR,3,618,627,NA,JUN,0888-8892 and 1523-1739,WOS:000379945600019,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2656, 5498"

Certain areas are more resilient, and in those areas, natural forest regeneration, for example, can be encouraged. The aim of this study was to identify areas of greater resilience in order to support the connection of Atlantic Forest fragments with ecological corridors. Forest fragments in the municipality of Paraíba do Sul, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, were mapped using the supervised maximum likelihood classification of an Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Landsat-8 sensor image. Next, we analyzed the influence of terrain attributes (aspect, incident solar radiation, slope, and curvature profile) on natural regeneration. The areas with the greatest potential to achieve natural regeneration and to form ecological corridors were indicated through fuzzy membership functions. Within Paraíba do Sul, 31% of the territory is covered by vegetation in different stages of regeneration. Recordings were made of 1,251 forest fragments in a middle or advanced stage of regeneration. These fragments are usually situated in the southeast, south, and southwest aspects, in areas that receive the least amount of global solar radiation (Wh·m-2) per year, and on slopes with an angle of inclination greater than 20%.

We used a shotgun metagenomic approach to compare undisturbed (native) soil and soils cropped for 23 years with soybean/maize under conservation tillage-""no-Till"" (NT)-and conventional tillage (CT) systems in the Cerrado biome. Results: Soil management and fertilizer inputs with the introduction of agriculture improved chemical properties, but decreased soil macroporosity and microbial biomass of carbon and nitrogen. Principal coordinates analyses confirmed different taxonomic and functional profiles for each treatment. There was predominance of the Bacteria domain, especially the phylum Proteobacteria, with higher numbers of sequences in the NT and CT treatments; Archaea and Viruses also had lower numbers of sequences in the undisturbed soil. Within the Alphaproteobacteria, there was dominance of Rhizobiales and of the genus Bradyrhizobium in the NT and CT systems, attributed to massive inoculation of soybean, and also of Burkholderiales. In contrast, Rhizobium, Azospirillum, Xanthomonas, Pseudomonas and Acidobacterium predominated in the native Cerrado. More Eukaryota, especially of the phylum Ascomycota were detected in the NT. The functional analysis revealed lower numbers of sequences in the five dominant categories for the CT system, whereas the undisturbed Cerrado presented higher abundance. Conclusion: High impact of agriculture in taxonomic and functional microbial diversity in the biome Cerrado was confirmed. Functional diversity was not necessarily associated with taxonomic diversity, as the less conservationist treatment (CT) presented increased taxonomic sequences and reduced functional profiles, indicating a strategy to try to maintain soil functioning by favoring taxa that are probably not the most efficient for some functions.

High productivity, less harvesting time, and deeper silvicultural knowledge are the beneficial factor for choosing those exotics species. However, the use of a wide variety of native tree species becomes more significantly important in reforestation projects due to the greater biodiversity benefits and wider environmental services. This research was carried out as a multiyear observation and continuous experiment to value how native tree species can be prospective alternatives in providing and supporting human need. The performances of two native Indonesian Shorea species, Shorea leprosula and Shorea selanica, were evaluated at a dipterocarp planting trial in two different sites in Indonesia. Growth data was obtained from 15 and 17 years old plots, twelve 100 m X 100 m square plots on mineral soils (Gunung Dahu Experimental Forest/GDEF, Bogor) and eight resembled plots on frequently flooded peat land (PT. Arara Abadi/PT. AA, Riau). Survival rates were varied, ranged from 36-77%, diameter at breast height from 13.7-24.9 cm, tree height from 10.8-16.9 m, mean volume from 0.119 m3/tree-0.567 m3/tree, and total volume from 79.420 m3/ha-215.412 m3/ha. Growth rates of planted saplings were affected by species, site and spacing distance. The development of man-made dipterocarps forest in the tropic, especially in South East Asia can be as prospective as developing an exotic fast growing plantation. Eventhough in situ conservation would give the most benefit in conserving genetic resources of native tree species, establishing man-made dipterocarp forest still have higher environmental value than using exotic tree species such as acacia. Moreover, establishing man-made dipterocarp forest is considered more environmental friendly and possess lower to no risk of species invasion compare to those of developing exotic trees plantation. © 2016, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

Predicting net livestock impacts on soil organic carbon stocks remains challenging, however, due to the dependence on animal loads and on soil and environmental parameters. The objective of this study was to better understand grazing effects on soil organic carbon in seasonal tropical dry forests of north-eastern Brazil (Caatinga) by quantifying carbon stocks of the upper soil profile (0-5cm depth) and greater soil depths (>5cm depth down to bedrock) along a gradient of grazing intensity while accounting for other influencing factors such as soil texture, vegetation, landscape topography, and water availability. We analysed soil organic carbon, soil clay content, altitude above sea level, soil depth to bedrock, distance to the nearest permanent water body, species diversity of perennial plants and aboveground biomass on 45 study plots located in the vicinity of the Itaparica Reservoir, Pernambuco, Brazil. Livestock (mainly goats and cattle) are unevenly distributed in the studied ecosystem, thus grazing intensity was accounted for based on the weight of livestock droppings per square metre and classified as no or light, intermediate, or heavy grazing. The mean soil organic carbon in the area was 16.86 ± 1.28 Mg ha-1 C with approximately one-quarter found in the upper 5 cm of the soil profile (4.14 ± 0.43 Mg ha-1 C) and the remainder (12.57 ± 0.97 Mg ha-1 C) in greater soil depths (>5cm). Heavy grazing led to significantly lower soil organic carbon stocks in the upper 5 cm, whereas no effect on soil organic carbon of the soil overall or in greater soil depths was detectable. The soil's clay content and the altitude proved to be the most relevant factors influencing overall soil organic carbon stocks and those in greater soil depths (>5cm). Our findings suggest that grazing causes substantial release of carbon from Brazilian dry forest soils, which should be addressed through improved grazing management via a legally compulsory rotation system.

Aiming at the conservation of water resources, the main objective of this study was to assess the performance of Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA), a multicriteria decision analysis, in the prioritization of areas for forest restoration. The study area is a Brazilian river basin, originally covered by Atlantic Forest. The relevant criteria to this decision-making process were identified as land-use suitability, soil erodibility, erosivity, proximity to roads, and proximity to surface water. We proposed three order weight sets, based on the decision strategy space, with medium-to-high risk-taking and medium tradeoff among the criteria (OWA1); medium risk-taking and total tradeoff (WLC), representing the traditional Weighted Linear Combination method; and medium-to-low risk-taking and medium tradeoff among the criteria (OWA2). Then, using an OWA operator (as a GIS routine), we produced maps for the three solutions, which were reclassified in five priority levels (very low, low, medium, high and very high). We did the cross tabulation among the solutions, for areas classified as high and very-high priority, and some environmental characteristics, intrinsically related to the criteria: land-use/land-cover, soil erodibility, distance from the surface water, soils and slope. WLC resulted in 54% of the Corumbataí river basin with high priority to forest restoration; 37% with very-high priority; and 9% with medium priority, and the spatial distribution of classes was intrinsically related to two main criteria: proximity to surface water and soil erodibility. OWA1 resulted in one alternative with 80% of the basin classified as very-high priority to forest restoration and 20% as high priority. Such classes' distribution is the result of the distribution of order weights, to obtain the desired risk level. In OWA2, due to the distribution of order weights among the criteria, the prioritization of areas occurred differently from the previous alternatives, with no predominance of one or more criteria. Under this scenario, the river basin presented 1% of this area with very low priority for forest restoration; 17% with low; 63% with medium; 10% with high; and 9% with very-high priority. OWA is suitable for the prioritization of areas, once it allows us to control the criteria influence on the final solution, through the tradeoff. This implies, however, the method's ability to normalize the criteria to a continuous scale, since the categorization in the criteria maps affects the spatial distribution of the alternatives. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..",Decision-making and Landscape restoration and Multicriteria evaluation and OWA method and Atlantic Forest and Brazil and Corumbatai Basin and Sao Paulo [Brazil] and Conservation and Decision making and Decision theory and Erosion and Forestry and Geographic information systems and Land reclamation and Land use and Natural resources management and Restoration and Risk management and Rivers and Soils and Spatial distribution and Surface waters and Water conservation and Watersheds and Decision making process and Environmental characteristic and Landscape restoration and Multi-criteria decision analysis and Multi-criteria evaluation and Ordered weighted averaging and OWA method and Weighted linear combinations and decision making and environmental management and land use planning and landscape ecology and multicriteria analysis and prioritization and restoration ecology and river basin and road transport and soil erosion and surface water and trade-off and water resource and Water resources,10.1016/j.ecoleng.2016.05.069,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84973352770&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoleng.2016.05.069&partnerID=40&md5=149dfa6fecc13c002c67fec95096e447,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 52,NA,JOUR,NA,255,267,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2679

It is a component, not a synonym, of sustainable forest management. In this chapter, I will set out a vision of natural tropical forest silviculture (from here on, SNTF) in relation to two factors: first, the considerable volume of scientific information generated on natural tropical forests during the 20 years since the publication of Lamprecht’s review, and second, the challenges of the twenty-first century and the new frameworks within which society expects SNTF to be carried out. These frameworks include those that are directly relevant, such as the principles and criteria of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). But the conservation and sustainable use of all ecosystems in a framework centered around the needs of people have also been conceptualized in major advances like that of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA 2005). Additionally, by the end of 2015, governments led by the United Nations will have set out their Sustainable Development Goals and, under the auspices of the UNFCCC, will finalize the successor to the Kyoto Protocol in the continuing efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the consequent climate change. All these international processes can be thought of as key elements of the UNEP-led Green Economy Initiative, which seeks a low-carbon, resource efficient, and socially inclusive path for economic development; in all of them, SNTF can play a potentially important role; and all of them may influence the ways in which SNTF can be implemented. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.",Biodiversity and Climate change mitigation and Global change and Sustainable forest management and Timber and Tree growth and Tropical forest,10.1007/978-3-642-54601-3_121,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85017596153&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-642-54601-3_121&partnerID=40&md5=06d231a23df8efd04907f94f06a4802e,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 5,NA,CHAP,NA,1605,1638,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2694

Tropical peat soils are the result of thousands of years of dead biomass accumulation, and when burned are globally significant net sources of carbon emissions. The El Nino year of 2015 saw huge areas of Indonesia affected by tropical peatland fires, more so than any year since 1997. However, the Depth of Burn (DoB) of these 2015 fires has not been assessed, and indeed has only previously been assessed in few tropical peatland burns in Kalimantan. Therefore, DoB remains arguably the largest uncertainty when undertaking fire emissions calculations in these tropical peatland environments. We apply a SfM photogrammetric methodology to map this DoB metric, and also investigate combustion heterogeneity using orthomosaic photography collected using the UAV system. We supplement this information with pre-burn airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, reducing uncertainty by estimating pre-burn soil height more accurately than from interpolation of adjacent unburned areas alone. Our pre-and post-fire Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) show accuracies of 0.04 and 0.05 m (root-mean-square error, RMSE) respectively, compared to ground-based global navigation satellite system (GNSS) surveys. Our final DoB map of a 5.2 ha degraded peat swamp forest area neighboring Berbak National Park (Sumatra, Indonesia) shows burn depths extending from close to zero to over 1 m, with a mean (±1σ) DoB of 0.23 ± 0.19 m. This lies well within the range found by the few other studies available (on Kalimantan; none are available on Sumatra). Our combustion heterogeneity analysis suggests the deepest burns, which extend to 1.3 m, occur around tree roots. We use these DoB data within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default equation for fire emissions to estimate mean carbon emissions as 134 ± 29 t·C·ha-1 for this peatland fire, which is in an area that had not had a recorded fire previously. This is amongst the highest per unit area fuel consumption anywhere in the world for landscape fires. Our approach provides significant uncertainty reductions in such emissions calculations via the reduction in DoB uncertainty, and by using the UAV SfM approach this is accomplished at a fraction of the cost of airborne LiDAR-albeit over limited sized areas at present. Deploying this approach at locations across Indonesia, sampling a variety of fire-affected landscapes, would provide new and important DoB statistics for producing optimized carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions estimates from peatland fires. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Carbon emissions and Depth of burn (DoB) and Indonesia and Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and Peat fire and Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) and Structure from motion (SfM) and Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Climate change and Combustion and Deforestation and Fires and Forestry and Gas emissions and Global positioning system and Greenhouse gases and Importance sampling and Mean square error and Peat and Photogrammetry and Sampling and Soil pollution and Soils and Tropics and Uncertainty analysis and Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and Wetlands and Carbon emissions and Depth of burn (DoB) and Forest degradation and Indonesia and Light detection and ranging and Structure from motion and Optical radar,10.3390/rs8121000,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85002943961&doi=10.3390%2frs8121000&partnerID=40&md5=25e527bc9464230431d1d42a6b4458cf,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 45,NA,JOUR,12,NA,NA,NA,DEC,2072-4292,WOS:000392489400029,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2698, 5157"

Here we demonstrate the significant contribution that traditional agroforests with shaded tree crops can make to landscape C storage, and thus climate change mitigation, focusing on the cocoa (Theobroma cacao) agroforests (locally known as cabrucas) of southern Bahia, Brazil. Using published allometric relationships and tree inventories of 55 shaded cocoa farms, 6 mature forests, 8 disturbed forests and 7 fallows, we calculate average aboveground C stocks of 87 and 46 Mg ha−1 in traditional and intensified cocoa agroforests, respectively, 183 Mg ha−1 in old-growth forests, 102 Mg ha−1 in disturbed forests and 33 Mg ha−1 in fallows. Based on the most recent land cover data available, we estimate that cocoa agroforests hold 59 % of the total aboveground C stocks of the tree dominated vegetation in this landscape, while forests hold 32 % and fallows hold 9 %. Carbon stocks of intensified cocoa agroforestry systems were only little over one-half of those of traditional agroforests, indicating a threat to landscape C stocks from current land use trends. We show that in agroforests as in natural forests, C stocks are highly concentrated in the largest trees. This suggests that the intensification of traditional agroforests, which generally involves increasing the density of cocoa and other tree crops and reducing the density of shade trees, is possible without greatly affecting their C storage if large trees are conserved. In order to conserve the climate stabilizing effect of traditional agroforests and steer necessary intensification measures towards climate-friendly solutions, we suggest that biodiversity and C-rich traditional agroforests should be included in current discussions about Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) and/or their owners be rewarded for their environmental services through other incentive mechanisms. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Atlantic forest biome and Brazil and Climate change mitigation and Cocoa and Land use intensification and Theobroma cacao and Atlantic Forest and Bahia and Brazil and Theobroma cacao and agricultural intensification and agroforestry and agrometeorology and allometry and biodiversity and carbon sequestration and carbon sink and climate change and cocoa and deforestation and ecosystem service and fallow and incentive and land cover and land use change and landscape ecology and species inventory and traditional agriculture,10.1007/s11027-013-9530-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84941878326&doi=10.1007%2fs11027-013-9530-7&partnerID=40&md5=69d7f98c0c2b38adbc9e48bbd0c0cc42,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 49,NA,JOUR,7,1175,1190,NA,OCT,1381-2386 and 1573-1596,WOS:000361432300009,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2704, 5428"

The loss and degradation of coastal lagoons can adversely affect waterbirds, which depend crucially on wetland habitats. This study investigates the effects of a number of environmental variables on waterbird habitat use. Specifically, we assessed the abundances of six waterbird guilds in relation to hydrochemical, structural, and anthropogenic factors in 351 survey blocks of 22 tropical coastal lagoons of southeastern Brazil. Patterns of habitat use were analyzed using generalized mixed models. We found that water depth was the most important variable influencing the waterbird assemblage. Increasing water depth reduced the abundance of small and large wading birds, dabbling ducks, and diving birds. Extreme values of salinity negatively affected diving birds and large wading birds. Vegetation height influenced shorebirds negatively, while it influenced vegetation gleaners positively. Anthropogenic factors played an important role in structuring the habitat of small wading birds, dabbling ducks, diving birds and fishing birds. Our study indicates that the various guilds showed specific responses to different habitat variables. We conclude that the maintenance of water depths in the range of 0-20. cm, the preservation of a mosaic of vegetation heights, and the reduction of livestock grazing pressure are among the most important aspects for supporting high avian abundance and biodiversity in tropical coastal lagoons. Management strategies should therefore address a specific number of structural and hydrochemical attributes of coastal lagoons and should carefully consider the effects of land use practices. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Aquatic birds and Conservation and Generalized linear mixed models and Human-induced changes and Management and Tropical biology and Water depth and Waterfowl and Wetlands and Brazil and Anas and Anatidae and Aves and abundance and anthropogenic effect and coastal lagoon and habitat conservation and habitat use and seabird and tropical environment and water depth,10.1016/j.biocon.2015.02.027,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84924872617&doi=10.1016%2fj.biocon.2015.02.027&partnerID=40&md5=03a9165b14350f6dec73e419b9921072,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 89,NA,JOUR,NA,12,21,NA,JUN,0006-3207 and 1873-2917,WOS:000355061300002,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2706, 5483"

Assessing the use of community participation in reforestation to address illegal logging in West Kalimantan,"Tropical Conservation Science, TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE",8,NA,"Gunung Palung National Park in West Kalimantan, Indonesia has been persistently threatened by illegal logging for the past several decades. Subsequent fires have led to the encroachment of noxious grasses such as Imperata cylindrica, which have arrested succession to secondary forest within and around the park. Since 2009, local NGO Alam Sehat Lestari (ASRI) has reforested 20 hectares of degraded Imperata grassland within the park, with the goal of restoring forest area and decreasing the incidence of illegal logging inside the park by providing jobs and income to local people. In February 2013, a survey was conducted to assess the social impacts of the reforestation program, and to test the hypothesis that participation in reforestation can reduce instances of illegal logging through two pathways: (1) economic improvement for participants; (2) altering perceptions towards illegal logging. Structured interviews were conducted with 50 local residents, one-third of which identified as former illegal loggers, to gauge their perceptions towards forest conservation and illegal logging. The survey found that 80% of respondents believed that the reforestation program helped to reduce illegal logging in the park. However, the pathways through which this change occurred were different from those hypothesized. There was little evidence supporting the “perceptions change” pathway, but greater evidence supporting the “economic improvement” pathway through the medium of skill-building rather than direct economic improvement. Approximately 50% of participants reported engaging in self-directed tree planting activities post-involvement. These results suggest that forest restoration can effectively be used as a community-engagement tool to address illegal logging. © Erica Pohnan, Hotlin Ompusunggu, and Campbell Webb.",Community engagement and Illegal-logging and Reforestation and Southeast Asia and Tree planting and Imperata and Imperata cylindrica and Poaceae,10.1177/194008291500800107,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84925362437&doi=10.1177%2f194008291500800107&partnerID=40&md5=b96eb7d56254431e46f557cfb661a639,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 17,NA,JOUR,1,45,57,NA,MAR,1940-0829,WOS:000351545700007,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2708, 5100"

Our aim was to identify a set of soil variables capable of discriminating between disturbed, reforested, and native Araucaria forest soils such that these variables could be used to monitor forest recovery and maintenance. Soil samples were collected at dry and rainy season under the three forest types in two state parks at São Paulo State, Brazil. Soil biological, chemical, and physical properties were evaluated to verify their potential to differentiate the forest types, and discriminant analysis was performed to identify the variables that most contribute to the differentiation. Most of physical and chemical variables were sensitive to forest disturbance level, but few biological variables were significantly different when comparing native, reforested, and disturbed forests. Despite more than 20 years following reforestation, the reforested soils were chemically and biologically distinct from native and disturbed forest soils, mainly because of the greater acidity and Al3+ content of reforested soil. Disturbed soils, in contrast, were coarser in texture and contained greater concentrations of extractable P. Although biological properties are generally highly sensitive to disturbance and amelioration efforts, the most important soil variables to discriminate forest types in both seasons included Al3+, Mg2+, P, and sand, and only one microbial attribute: the NO2− oxidizers. Therefore, these five variables were the best candidates, of the variables we employed, for monitoring Araucaria forest disturbance and recovery. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Discriminant analysis and Forest disturbance and Reforestation and Soil microbiology and Soil quality indicator and Microbiology and Quality Control and Reforestation and Soil and Brazil and Coniferophyta and Environmental Monitoring and Forests and Rain and Soil and Trees and Brazil and Sao Paulo [Brazil] and Araucaria and Chemical analysis and Discriminant analysis and Microbiology and Physical properties and Reforestation and Soil quality and Textures and carbon and nitrogen and Rain and Soil and Biological properties and Biological variables and Chemical variables and Disturbance level and Forest disturbances and Soil microbiology and Soil quality indicators and Vegetation formations and coniferous forest and discriminant analysis and environmental disturbance and environmental monitoring and forest management and forest soil and reforestation and soil microorganism and soil property and soil quality and analysis of variance and Araucaria forest and Article and atomic absorption spectrometry and biodiversity and biomass and Brazil and cation exchange and climate and controlled study and discriminant analysis and environmental monitoring and forest and geographic distribution and land biome and physical chemistry and reforestation and soil analysis and soil fumigation and soil property and soil quality and vegetation and chemistry and Coniferophyta and forests and Soil and Trees and Quality control,10.1007/s10661-015-4398-5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84936792240&doi=10.1007%2fs10661-015-4398-5&partnerID=40&md5=e6df3c917a08a1d9cc804a6e24120c3b,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 3,NA,JOUR,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2714

It is estimated that more than 23 million hectares (62 %) of the total global tropical peatland area are located in Southeast Asia, in lowland or coastal areas of East Sumatra, Kalimantan, West Papua, Papua New Guinea, Brunei, Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, Sarawak and Southeast Thailand. Tropical peatland has a vital carbon-water storage function and is host to a huge diversity of plant and animal species. Peatland ecosystems are extremely vulnerable to climate change and the impacts of human activities such as logging, drainage and conversion to agricultural land. In Southeast Asia, severe episodic droughts associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, in combination with over-drainage, forest degradation, and land-use changes, have caused widespread peatland fires and microbial peat oxidation. Indonesia’s 20 Mha peatland area is estimated to include about 45-55 GtC of carbon stocks. As a result of land use and development, Indonesia is the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases (2-3 Gtons carbon dioxide equivalent per year), 80 % of which is due to deforestation and peatland loss. Thus, tropical peatlands are key ecosystems in terms of the carbon-water cycle and climate change. © Springer Japan 2016.",NA,10.1007/978-4-431-55681-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018223834&doi=10.1007%2f978-4-431-55681-7&partnerID=40&md5=ccd21bd9a82778a5d6c6e45b40f079bd,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 70,NA,BOOK,NA,1,651,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2715

The following questions are addressed: are the floristic structure and composition of regenerating trees affected by the various land-use types applied in the agricultural settlements? Do tree-regeneration patterns respond similarly to distinct land-use mosaics? Is there a relationship between tree regeneration and soil characteristics among the land-use types? The regeneration was inventoried at 45 sampling points in each settlement. At each sampling point, fourteen soil variables were analyzed. Nine different land-use types were considered. The floristic structure and composition of the settlements showed differences in the density of individuals and species and high species heterogeneity among the land-use types. The maximum Jaccard similarity coefficient found between land-use types was only 29 %. Shade-tolerant species were the most diverse functional group in most land-use types, including pasture and annual crops, ranging from 91 % of the number of species in the conserved and exploited forests of Travessão 338-S to 53 % in the invaded pastures of Maçaranduba. The land-use types influenced significantly the floristic structure and composition of regenerating trees in two agricultural settlements, but not in third the settlement, which had greater forest cover. This finding demonstrates that the composition of each land-use mosaic, established by different management approaches, affects regeneration patterns. Tree regeneration was related to soil characteristics in all mosaics. Preparation of the area by burning was most likely the determining factor in the differences in soil characteristics between forests and agricultural areas. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Biodiversity and Conservation and Family farm and Land-use types and Landscape and Agriculture and Biodiversity and Brazil and Conservation of Natural Resources and Forests and Humans and Regeneration and Rivers and Soil and Trees and Agriculture and Biodiversity and Conservation and Deforestation and Forestry and Reforestation and Soil surveys and Soils and Structure (composition) and soil and Agricultural areas and Different land use types and Jaccard similarity coefficients and Land use type and Landscape and Number of species and Soil characteristics and Tree regeneration and agriculture and biodiversity and Brazil and environmental protection and forest and growth, development and aging and human and physiology and procedures and regeneration and river and soil and tree and Land use",10.1007/s00267-015-0500-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84934442338&doi=10.1007%2fs00267-015-0500-6&partnerID=40&md5=edefa5f1b10bdd70d6aab17a637cb14f,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 8,NA,JOUR,2,342,354,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2716

This assessment on peatland definition is intended to adjust existing definition of peatland and further work to improve the existing peatland map that will help identify the gaps amongst various peatland definition. This chapter consists of part, which provides an overview of the importance of peatland both at global and national context, including variety of assessment of peatland contribution to GHG emission.Based on available references, there are two broad peatland definitions: Authoritative and Scientific. In Indonesia, currently there are three Ministries operate under their own authoritative designations of peatland. The Ministry of Environment of Indonesia defines ‘peat’ as a plant residue formed naturally through long-term decomposition processes, accumulating in swamp areas or static reservoirs. The Ministry of Agriculture defines ‘peat’ as soil formed as a result of organic matter accumulation with a naturally occurring composition of greater than 65 % from the decaying vegetation growing on it, whose decomposition is slowed down by anaerobic and wet conditions. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Forestry defines ‘peat’ as organic matter residue accumulating over a long period of time. Several scientific definitions have been introduced and acknowledged by scientific communities, including those developed. These definitions are based on field observations and analyses of peat soil properties. Key elements include physical peat properties, such as degree of decomposition (humification), bulk density, water content, porosity and others, and chemical properties, such as carbon content, ash content, pH, and C/N ratio.

B.K. Simon & S.W.L. Jacobs - Poaceae) is an invasive C4 grass that known to slow ecological succession in restoration sites. This study aimed to evaluate the responses of the woody species and M. maximus itself to manual removal in a 20-year-old reforestation site. Forty-five 5. ×. 5-m plots were established in 2008 and evaluated until 2012. The plots were divided into three treatments: control (CON), manual removal for one year (MR1), and manual removal for two years (MR2). All individuals of woody species >10. cm were sampled. Canopy cover, grass cover, and the number of seedlings of M. maximus were also recorded. After the first weeding, M. maximus seedlings were manually uprooted every four months, for a total of three times in MR1 (2008-2009) and six times in MR2 (2008-2010). After the manual removal was stopped, the seedlings of M. maximus were counted and were allowed to grow in order to assess its reestablishment potential. The number of new grass seedlings decreased drastically after the first year with repeated removals and did not differ between removal treatments at any time, even after removals halted, indicating that one year of removal was sufficient to displace the grass. With the exclusion of Guinea-grass, an increase in the abundance and richness of other exotic species was observed until the second year. However, the increase in canopy cover during the four years likely benefited native woody species and impaired M. maximus and other exotics. In addition, after four years, although the woody species richness did not differ between the three treatments, the total abundance and pioneer species richness were higher in both removal treatments. These findings suggest that the grass slows ecological succession. However, both the increase in canopy cover and decrease in grass cover indicate that, in the absence of fire, native vegetation will suppress Guinea-grass. Furthermore, grass removal from the understory of early secondary forests and reforestations can be used to accelerate succession, reducing both fire risk and failures of ecological restoration initiatives. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Adaptive management and Ecological restoration and Exotic grasses and Invasive exotic species and Panicum maximum Jacq and Atlantic Forest and Brazil and Panicum maximum and Poaceae and Conservation and Forestry and Plants (botany) and Reforestation and Restoration and Adaptive Management and Ecological restoration and Exotic grasses and Invasive exotic species and Panicum maximum and abundance and adaptive management and grass and invasive species and reforestation and regeneration and restoration ecology and risk assessment and seedling and species richness and woody plant and Ecology,10.1016/j.foreco.2015.10.004,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84943572576&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2015.10.004&partnerID=40&md5=ac49175c126fbddb300ae049fc7b493c,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 19,NA,JOUR,NA,141,146,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2719

Nevertheless, agricultural expansion and the constant search for higher productivity are main factors leading to biodiversity loss. Thus, the promotion of rural sustainable development is considered a major challenge for Brazilian agricultural policy. In this context, agroforestry system of production might represent a viable solution, since it promotes biodiversity conservation without jeopardizing farm output. However, the complexity of the system may represent an obstacle to its legal implementation. Hence, this paper aims to analyse whether the Brazilian legal framework is well enough structured to implement this system in all its complexity. More widely, this research is seeking solutions to the conflict between traditional farming methods and the biodiversity conservation imperative in Brazil. In order to assess these issues question applied research was implemented and supported by an in-depth literature and legislation review. Amongst the results, this paper shows that according to the green economy’s theory of strong sustainability, the agroforestry way of production represent a sustainable agricultural system because the quality and the quantity of each component of the natural stock is maintained in its original state.

They represent a sustainable alternative form of land-use for small-scale agriculture, responding to the economic development needs of communities and offering a number of ecosystem services. This article presents an evaluation of the short- and medium-term profitability of two experimental agroforestry systems where fruit trees are predominant, which were established in 2009 in the Tapajós region of the Brazilian Amazon, state of Pará. An analysis of net present value (NPV) confirms that the two experimental systems studied recover their total implementation and operating costs within a 20 years time horizon. These results underlie that prices of inputs are stable and farmers have access to markets, credit, and agricultural knowledge. The two experimental systems are compared to plots under traditional slash-and-burn cultivation, and Bragantino system. The results support changes to public policies in order to facilitate alternatives to slash-and-burn cultivation by supporting access to credit, knowledge of alternative agricultural practices, transportation systems, and industries that transform agricultural products.

We found that i) evaluation on effects and costs of mitigation measures from a long-term viewpoint and their continuing implementation are required to increase future mitigation potentials under a limited budget. ii) a long-term reduction target will also play an important role for cost-effective countermeasure selection. iii) reforestation of slow glowing species and enhanced natural regeneration will cause great increase in mitigation potential in the country. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Agriculture and Climate change and Indonesia and Land use change and Mitigation potentials,10.1007/s11027-013-9498-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84882744678&doi=10.1007%2fs11027-013-9498-3&partnerID=40&md5=86bffd702b23af402ad85671f40c2e1e,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 38,NA,JOUR,3,409,424,NA,MAR,1381-2386 and 1573-1596,WOS:000349637200005,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2734, 5226"

Thirteen species of diurnal frogs were recorded, six of which were restricted to one of the river margins. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated a significant effect of the river as a barrier. Multiple regression analyses suggested that the environmental variables structuring frog assemblages differ on either side of the river.

Of this, 57 Gt (65%) are stored in Indonesian peatlands. Large-scale exploitation of land, including deforestation and drainage for the establishment of oil palm plantations, is changing the carbon balance of Indonesian peatlands, turning them from a natural sink to a source via outgassing of CO2 to the atmosphere and leakage of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the coastal ocean. The impacts of this perturbation to the coastal environment and at the global scale are largely unknown. Here, we evaluate the downstream effects of released Indonesian peat carbon on coastal ecosystems and on the global carbon cycle. We use a biogeochemical box model in combination with novel and literature observations to investigate the impact of different carbon emission scenarios on the combined ocean-atmosphere system. The release of all carbon stored in the Indonesian peat pool, considered as a worst-case scenario, will increase atmospheric pCO2 by 8 ppm to 15 ppm within the next 200 years. The expected impact on the Java Sea ecosystems is most significant on the short term (over a few hundred years) and is characterized by an increase of 3.3% in phytoplankton, 32% in seagrass biomass, and 5% decrease in coral biomass. On the long term, however, the coastal ecosystems will recover to reach near pre-excursion conditions. Our results suggest that the ultimate fate of the peat carbon is in the deep ocean with 69% of it landing in the deep DIC pool after 1000 years, but the effects on the global ocean carbonate chemistry will be marginal. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Biogeochemical modeling and Carbon cycle and Carbon emissions and Indonesia and Tropical peat and Aquatic Organisms and Atmosphere and Biomass and Carbon and Carbon Cycle and Carbon Dioxide and Ecosystem and Indonesia and Oceans and Seas and Seawater and Soil and Indonesia and Anthozoa and Elaeis and carbon and carbon dioxide and sea water and soil and atmosphere-ocean system and carbon cycle and carbon emission and carbon sequestration and deep sea and degradation and dissolved inorganic carbon and ecological impact and marine ecosystem and peatland and aquatic species and atmosphere and biomass and carbon cycle and chemistry and ecosystem and Indonesia and sea and soil,10.1111/gcb.13108,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84954397340&doi=10.1111%2fgcb.13108&partnerID=40&md5=c2f512f10fe2b735efb4d5c063e04eff,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 25,NA,JOUR,1,325,337,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2741

A 22-year time series of classified Landsat images was used to evaluate deforestation and forest regeneration in riparian permanent preservation areas over the past two decades, focusing on the municipality of Paragominas in the state of Pará in eastern Amazonia. There was no evidence that riparian forests had been more effectively protected than non-riparian forests. Instead, deforestation was found to be comparatively higher inside riparian permanent preservation areas as recently as 2010, indicating a widespread failure of private property owners to comply with environmental legislation. There was no evidence for higher levels of regeneration in riparian zones, although property owners are obliged by law to restore such areas. A number of factors limit improvements in the protection and restoration of riparian forests. These include limited awareness of environmental compliance requirements, the need for improved technical capacity in mapping the distribution and extent of riparian forests and the boundaries of private properties, and improved access to the financial resources and technical capacity needed to support restoration projects.

We briefly review the key features of REDDC that have been discussed in international negotiations as well as evaluate the estimated break-even prices for emission reductions through forest conservation. On the basis of estimation results, we conclude that, while REDDC would be potentially beneficial for mitigating global climate change as well as beneficial to the local community, many issues need to be better understood before arriving at a workable institutional designs. Our estimates for the Central Kalimantan case show that the break-even price for carbon is USD 15.45 per ton of carbon, which is far below the average price of carbon credits in 2009. This figure would be reduced to USD 0.71 per ton of carbon, when we include carbon captured in peat. On the other hand, the break-even price becomes much higher than the price of the carbon credits when we consider the possibilities of oil palm plantations.

We analyzed soil Cstock (Mgha-1), soil bulk density (BD, gcm-3) and soil organic carbon concentration (Corg, %) from 155 plots in 20 oil palm plantations across the major production areas of Indonesia, identifying trends during a production cycle on 6 plantations with sufficient spread in plot age. Plots were sampled in four management zones: weeded circle (WC), interrow (IR), frond stacks (FS), and harvest paths (HP); three depth intervals 0-5, 5-15 and 15-30cm were sampled in each zone. Compared to the initial condition, increases in Corg (16.2%) and reduction in BD (8.9%) in the FS zone, was compensated by decrease in Corg (21.4%) and increase in BD (6.6%) in the HP zone, with intermediate results elsewhere.

In other words, it is a highly political concept, and its utility depends on the arena in which it is used and what it is used for. Following a political ecology framework, and based on a literature review, bibliometric analyses, and brief examples from two tropical rainforest countries, this review investigates four moments in the construction and application of the ecosystem services idea: socio-historical (the emergence of the discourse), ontological (what knowledge does the concept allow?), scientific (difficulties in its practical application), and political (who wins, who loses?). We show how the concept is a boundary object with widespread appeal, trace the discursive and institutional context within which it gained traction, and argue that choices of scale, definition, and method in measuring ecosystem services frustrate its straightforward application. As a result, it is used in diverse ways by different interests to justify different kinds of interventions that at times might be totally opposed. In Madagascar, the ecosystem services idea is mainly used to justify forest conservation in ways open to critique for its neoliberalization of nature or disempowerment of communities. In contrast, in the Brazilian Amazon, the discourse of ecosystem services has served the agendas of traditional populations and family farm lobbies.

To reverse this process, rehabilitating degraded lands, restoration plantations with native tree species show significant potential to rebuild the forest habitat and promoting carbon sequestration. High input silviculture (intensive fertilization and weed control), similar to those applied in commercial production forest plantations can increase productivity, accelerating forest restoration process. We evaluated the effects of two contrasting silvicultural systems, ""traditional"" (based on common silviculture of forest reforestation in Brazil - low input) and ""intensive"" (based on commercial plantations - high input) on carbon (C) stocks of a restoration plantation. We also compared the plantations with a mature forest remnant. Six years after planting, forest C stock (coarse roots and aboveground biomass) under intensive silviculture reached 23.3MgCha-1, more than 3-fold the stock under traditional silviculture (6.9MgCha-1). Under both silvicultural systems, soil showed constant C stock (average of 33MgCha-1). The C accumulation in biomass with intensive silviculture reached 12.8% of that stored in the mature forest (181.5MgCha-1), compared with just 3.8% for traditional silviculture.

This represents one of the first studies of the ecology, diversity, and structure of campos de murundus termite savannas in the vast seasonal wetlands of southern Amazonia. We aimed to improve understanding of this threatened system by assessing species richness, abundance, and co-occurrence among trees and herbs of murundus (earth mounds), investigating the environmental and biological mechanisms underlying these patterns, and discussing implications for biodiversity conservation. Methodology. We identified every tree, shrub, subshrub, and herb on 373 murundus across 11 ha at Araguaia State Park, southern Amazonia. We constructed species abundance distributions of trees and herbs, assessed best-fit models, and tested for nonrandom patterns of species co-occurrence using checkerboard scores. Using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), we assessed the affinities among tree species and their positions in murundus. Pivotal results. A total of 166 species, 123 genera, and 49 families occupied the murundus. The species abundance distribution of trees followed a lognormal distribution, whereas that of herbs was best described by a Mandelbrot distribution. Observed C-score indices for trees and herbs were significantly larger than expected by chance, indicating nonrandom distributions and species segregation among murundus. DCA revealed a strong gradient in species occurrence within murundus, suggesting that internal structuring may be hydrologically based (e.g., variation in mound microrelief). Conclusions. Environmental (e.g., flooding) and biological (e.g., competition between plants) factors are important for controlling the occurrence of tree and herb species on the murundus. The murundus function as critical bases for the maintenance of species diversity in this extensive floodplain, thereby deserving recognition among ecosystems with high conservation priorities. © 2015, by The University of Chicago.

To test this, we examine whether socio-environmental certification of Brazilian coffee farms contributes to local conservation, particularly in terms of deforestation control, habitat protection and regeneration, and connectivity. The analysis compared changes in landscape structure and connectivity in certified farms before (1995-2002) and after nine years from the beginning of the certification process (2002-2011), using as a reference the surrounding landscape and a control group of non-certified farms. To quantify changes in landscape connectivity we used probabilistic indices of functional connectivity based on graph theory, and two species of terrestrial mammals with contrasting dispersal capacities and habitat requirements: Priodontes maximus (giant armadillo) and Marmosops incanus (gray slender mouse opossum). Our results show that changes in the last decade have been subtle, but that certified farms differ from surrounding areas for the greater deforestation control and habitat availability for both land cover types, and for the greater connectivity for P. maximus. The difference between certified and non-certified farms is not clear-cut, however, we have evidence that the certified farms contributed more than the surrounding areas to the conservation of the studied species when the balance of gains and losses of connectivity is considered. The subtle differences in temporal changes and groups might be partially explained by the fact that certified farms already had a different conservation profile at the beginning of the certification process. Despite the limitations in the sampling size (small number) and time scale (only nine years after certification) which may hinders the detection of certification effects, our findings indicate that certification was important in controlling deforestation and the conversion of new natural areas to agricultural lands. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Brazilian Cerrado and Forest conservation and Impact assessment and Land use change and Sustainable Agriculture Network and Brazil and Mammalia and Marmosops incanus and Priodontes and Priodontes maximus and Agriculture and Biodiversity and Deforestation and Ecosystems and Forestry and Graph theory and Importance sampling and Land use and Mammals and Reforestation and Vegetation and Brazilian cerrado and Forest conservation and Impact assessments and Land-use change and Sustainable agriculture and agricultural land and alternative agriculture and biodiversity and certification and coffee and connectivity and dispersal and environmental impact assessment and farm and habitat availability and land use change and landscape structure and mammal and nature conservation and spatiotemporal analysis and Conservation,10.1016/j.foreco.2015.08.021,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84940375417&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2015.08.021&partnerID=40&md5=bb6394e36b2afd61e1b5b47b1f50c989,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 34,NA,JOUR,NA,181,194,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2765

Conservation efforts in these post-frontier zones seek to protect the remaining forest fragments and promote sustainable agricultural practices that absorb labor, meet market demand, and generate ecosystem services. Assessments of these efforts often find that rates of sustained uptake are disappointingly low and that impacts are difficult to discern, but this could be due to the short-time frames of both the efforts themselves and their evaluation. We investigate the impacts of participation in an internationally sponsored farmer association that for 15 years promoted sustainable agricultural practices in the heavily deforested state of Rondônia, Brazil. Using data from a georeferenced four-period panel survey of farmers in combination with remote sensing data on land use spanning the life of the association, we apply matching methods to estimate the impacts of participation. We find that membership resulted in more diversified production systems, including more land allocated to agroforestry. Members also deforested less of their farms, but this difference is not statistically significant after we control for selection bias in membership. © 2015 International Association of Agricultural Economists.",Agroforestry and Brazilian Amazon and Diversification and Genetic matching and Impact evaluation and Productive conservation and Tropical deforestation and Amazonas [Brazil] and Brazil and Rondonia and Nia and agroforestry and alternative agriculture and conservation planning and deforestation and ecosystem service and green revolution and land use change and long-term change and remote sensing,10.1111/agec.12200,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84954372639&doi=10.1111%2fagec.12200&partnerID=40&md5=c6576cf14b34701b07d559ade95ef614,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 12,NA,JOUR,NA,83,102,NA,NOV,0169-5150 and 1574-0862,WOS:000367554600007,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2766, 4793"

We evaluated the influence of the landscape’s percentage of forest cover and shaded cocoa plantations on the community of zoochorous bromeliads in southern Bahia, Brazil. We selected two contrasting landscapes, one dominated by Atlantic tropical rainforest and the other by traditional cocoa plantations. In each landscape we sampled three forest fragments and three areas of cocoa plantation, where we conducted a survey of epiphytic bromeliads of the genera Aechmea and Hohenbergia in eight plots of 400 m2 in each area. The number of trees differed between landscapes and habitats, and was higher in forest fragments than in shade cocoa plantations, but the number of phorophytes was similar between landscapes and habitats. Highest richness of Aechmea and Hohenbergia species was found in forest fragments in landscapes where forests are predominant. Contrary to expectations, the richness in the other areas was relatively low, and extremely low in the landscape dominated by cocoa plantations, ranging from zero to four species per fragment. Bromeliad abundance was not different among landscapes and habitats, but the shade cocoa plantations located in predominant agroforest landscape showed the higher number of stands. Moreover, the species found in the cocoa plantations were more drought-tolerant species. These results suggest that the conservation of species of these genera depends on factors such as the conservation status of each forest fragment and the microclimatic alterations in the habitats, and not only on the percentage of forest in the landscape per se. © Virgínia de Fernandes Souza, Jamille de Assis Bomfim, Talita Fontoura and Eliana Cazetta.",Anthropogenic disturbances and Atlantic forest and Bromeliads and Forest cover and Aechmea and Bromeliaceae and Hohenbergia and Theobroma cacao,10.1177/194008291500800108,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84925374346&doi=10.1177%2f194008291500800108&partnerID=40&md5=a7f3d77494c9ebebf038afcc3fe044f2,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 6,NA,JOUR,1,58,75,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2767

The expansion of Araucaria angustifolia had a human influence in southern Brazil, where historically hunter-gatherer communities used the pinhão, araucaria's seed, as a food source. In the north of the state of Santa Catarina, the Araucaria Forest is a mosaic composed of cultivation and pasture inserted between forest fragments, where pinhão and erva-mate are gathered; some local communities denominate these forest ecotopes as caívas. Therefore, the aim of this study is to understand how human populations transform, manage and conserve landscapes using the case study of caívas from the Araucaria Forests of southern Brazil, as well as to evaluate the local ecological knowledge and how these contribute to conservation of the Araucaria Forest. Methods: This study was conducted in the northern plateau of the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil in local five communities. To assess ethnoecological perceptions the historical use and management of caívas, semi-structured interviews, checklist interviews and guided tours were conducted with family units. Results: In total 28 family units participated in the study that had caívas on their properties. During the course of the study two main perceptions of the ecotope caíva were found, there is no consensus to the exact definition; perception of caívas is considered a gradient. In general caívas are considered to have the presence of cattle feeding on native pasture, with denser forest area that is managed, and the presence of specific species. Eleven management practices within caívas were found, firewood collection, cattle grazing, trimming of the herbaceous layer, and erva-mate extraction were the most common. Caívas are perceived and defined through the management practices and native plant resources. All participants stated that there have been many changes to the management practices within caívas and to the caíva itself. Conclusions: These areas still remain today due to cultural tradition, use and management of plant resources. Through this cultural tradition of maintaining caívas the vegetation of the Araucaria Forest has been conserved associated to the use of the Araucaria Forests native plant resources. © 2015 Machado Mello and Peroni.",Araucaria forests and Caívas and Cultural landscapes and Historical ecology and Landscape ethnoecology and Adult and Aged and Animals and Biodiversity and Brazil and Cattle and Ecology and Ecosystem and Environmental Monitoring and Family and Forests and Humans and Middle Aged and Population Density and Rural Population and Trees and Young Adult and Araucaria and Araucaria angustifolia and Bos and adult and aged and animal and biodiversity and bovine and Brazil and classification and ecology and ecosystem and environmental monitoring and family and forest and human and middle aged and population density and procedures and rural population and tree and young adult,10.1186/s13002-015-0039-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84934325779&doi=10.1186%2fs13002-015-0039-x&partnerID=40&md5=3ab5fc965286fd1250cb0bbab0e27389,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 37,NA,JOUR,1,NA,NA,NA,JUN 9,1746-4269,WOS:000357256000001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2772, 5416"

Brazil is the seventh country with the highest rate of mercury in the atmosphere. The major input of Hg to ecosystems is through atmospheric deposition (wet and dry), being transported in the atmosphere over large distances. The forest biomes are of strong importance in the atmosphere/soil cycling of elemental Hg through foliar uptake and subsequent transference to the soil through litter, playing an important role as sink of this element. Soil microarthropods are keys to understanding the soil ecosystem, and for such purpose were characterized by the soil fauna of two Units of Forest Conservation of the state of the Rio de Janeiro, inwhich one of the areas suffer quite interference from petrochemicals and industrial anthropogenic activities and other area almost exempts of these perturbations.

The biochar was characterized using pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and then added to an Oxisol under savannah climate. This soil was amended with 0, 5, 10, 20 and 40 Mg ha- 1 of biochar in a randomized complete block design with four replications and cultivated with soybean over four cropping seasons (CSs; 120 days each). Soil samples from the 0-10 cm top layer were collected at the end of the first and fourth CSs and analyzed for CO2 emissions, isotopic C abundance (13C/12C ratio) and enzymatic activity (fluorescein diacetate and dehydrogenase). The biochar showed a low degree of thermal modification. Its relative decomposition rate was higher (k = 0.32-1.00 year- 1) than generally claimed (k = 0.005-0.0005 year- 1), and higher than the decomposition of native SOC (k = 0.22 year- 1).

The land use systems evaluated were native forest, an Eucalyptus plantation, pasture, a crop-livestock integration area, and a no-tillage crop area. Samples were collected from a 3 × 3 grid with a total of nine points at a distance of 30 m from each other, in winter and summer, in three municipalities in the southern Santa Catarina highlands, Brazil, considered as true replications. Soil physical and chemical properties were analyzed and the abundance and diversity of macrofauna were evaluated by the TSBF (Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility) method. Soil organisms belonging to 16 taxonomic groups were distinguished, with 4,702 individuals m-2 in the winter and 7,438 individuals m-2 in the summer. There was an interaction effect between the season and land use system, with fluctuation in the soil organism population dependent on land use and related to soil physical and chemical properties, demonstrated by redundancy analysis, which showed high correlation between environmental variables and soil fauna. Changes in the composition of soil macrofauna were observed in land use systems with more human impact.

Despite recognition of the campos rupestres as a global biodiversity hotspot, little is known about the diversity of P-acquisition strategies and other aspects of plant mineral nutrition in this region. To explore nutrient-acquisition strategies and assess aspects of plant P nutrition, we measured leaf P and nitrogen (N) concentrations, characterized root morphology and determined the percentage arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization of 50 dominant species in six communities, representing a gradient of soil P availability. Leaf manganese (Mn) concentration was measured as a proxy for carboxylate-releasing strategies. Communities on the most P-impoverished soils had the highest proportion of nonmycorrhizal (NM) species, the lowest percentage of mycorrhizal colonization, and the greatest diversity of root specializations. The large spectrum of leaf P concentration and variation in root morphologies show high functional diversity for nutritional strategies. Higher leaf Mn concentrations were observed in NM compared with AM species, indicating that carboxylate-releasing P-mobilizing strategies are likely to be present in NM species. The soils of the campos rupestres are similar to the most P-impoverished soils in the world.

These fauna are highly vulnerable to impacts, because this condition can frequently be easily altered. Moreover, environmental determinants of the biodiversity patterns of caves remain poorly understood and protected. Therefore, the main goal of this work is to propose a cave conservation priority index (CCPi) for a rapid assessment for troglobiotic and troglophile protection. Furthermore, the troglobiotic diversity, distribution and threats have been mapped in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. To propose the CCPi, the human impacts and richness of troglobiotic and troglophile species of 100 caves were associated. Data related to troglomorphic/troglobiotic fauna from another 200 caves were used to map the troglobiotic diversity and distribution. The CCPi reveals extremely high conservation priority for 15 % of the caves, high for 36 % and average for 46 % of the caves. Fourteen caves with extremely high priorities should have urgent conservation and management actions. The geographical distribution of the 221 known troglobiotic/troglomorphic species allowed us to select 19 karst areas that need conservation actions. Seven areas were considered to have urgent priority for conservation actions. The two richest areas correspond to the “iron quadrangle” with iron ore caves (67 spp.) and the “Açungui limestone group” (56 spp.). Both areas have several caves and are important aquifers. The use of the CCPi can prevent future losses because it helps assessors to select caves with priorities for conservation which should receive emergency attention in relation to protection, management and conservation actions. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Biodiversity and Cave conservation and Cave fauna and Cave vulnerability and Conservation priority and Animals and Biodiversity and Brazil and Caves and Conservation of Natural Resources and Ecosystem and Environment and Forests and Human Activities and Humans and Animals and Aquifers and Biodiversity and Conservation and Forestry and Geographical distribution and Hydrogeology and Iron ores and Lime and iron and limestone and Biodiversity patterns and Brazilian Atlantic forests and Cave fauna and Conservation actions and Conservation priorities and Environmental determinants and Environmental stability and Management and conservations and aquifer and Article and Brazil and case study and cave and cave conservation priority index and conservation biology and environmental aspects and related phenomena and environmental impact and environmental protection and fauna and forest management and geographic distribution and human and human impact (environment) and invertebrate and nonhuman and rain forest and reforestation and species distribution and species diversity and species richness and animal and biodiversity and ecosystem and environment and forest and human activities and Caves,10.1007/s00267-014-0414-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84925500704&doi=10.1007%2fs00267-014-0414-8&partnerID=40&md5=a100d60621709a14c356726783dac8e8,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 45,NA,JOUR,2,279,295,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2785

Preventative measures include inhibiting the further dispersal and recruitment of established invasive species. We expect coffee production in agroforestry systems to reduce the recruitment of exotic species relative to monoculture stands because intercropped trees function as environmental filters that select for individuals with traits such as shade tolerance. If ecologically similar species are also closely related phylogenetically, such environmental filters should reduce phylogenetic diversity, supporting the coexistence of closely related species. Here, we test whether the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of native and exotic species in agroforestry systems is lower than in monocultures. We sampled the understory in 180 plots distributed in both habitats in three study sites within the Araponga municipality, Brazil, and measured understory light availability. Phylogenetic diversity was calculated as the net relatedness index (NRI) and the nearest taxon index (NTI). Understory light availability was lower in agroforestry systems. Of the 48 species found, 25 occurred in agroforestry systems, three of which were exotics. Forty-two species were found in monoculture stands (including 13 exotics). As expected, NRI and NTI indicated lower phylogenetic diversity in agroforestry systems than in monoculture stands. Agroforestry systems provide less favorable habitats for exotic species, filtering them from the understory. The mechanisms that select against exotic species remain unknown; however, shading might exclude predominantly heliophytic exotic species from the agricultural matrix. Therefore, agroforestry systems may function as buffer zones preventing invasion into sensitive ecosystems. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Assembly rules and Buffer zones and Exotic species and Nearest taxon index and Net relatedness index and Phylogenetic diversity and Prevention of biological invasion and Brazil and agroforestry and biodiversity and biological invasion and buffer zone and coexistence and coffee and light availability and phylogenetics and taxonomy,10.1007/s10457-014-9765-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928230812&doi=10.1007%2fs10457-014-9765-7&partnerID=40&md5=81db2ac6555e7a534aa6c9363f19cc8c,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 32,NA,JOUR,2,279,289,NA,APR,0167-4366 and 1572-9680,WOS:000351195300007,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2789, 5592"

Thereby, the study demonstrated that the understanding of pressure types imposed on the remaining forest fragments through an indicator can contribute to management programs and territorial planning, giving conditions to the forest restoration in areas of strong anthropic pressure, and that the employment of fuzzy logics and geoprocessing could contribute significantly to diagnosis and trouble characterizations. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Anthropic pressure indicator and Geoprocessing and Inference fuzzy system and Remaining forest fragments and Brazil and Sao Paulo [Brazil] and Conservation and Fuzzy inference and Fuzzy logic and Fuzzy systems and Land use and Program diagnostics and Reforestation and Forest fragments and Forest restoration and Geoprocessing and Geoprocessing techniques and Management programs and Pressure indicator and Successional stages and Territorial planning and anthropogenic effect and edge effect and environmental indicator and fuzzy mathematics and geometry and habitat fragmentation and habitat management and human activity and pressure effect and regeneration and restoration ecology and riparian forest and spatial analysis and succession and territorial planning and Forestry,10.1007/s12665-015-4253-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84937513689&doi=10.1007%2fs12665-015-4253-6&partnerID=40&md5=d48ab629e162ae5fc957dca1cb5e20a6,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 10,NA,JOUR,3,2481,2488,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2793

Forest inventory data (diameter and height) from permanent plots, measured between 2010 and 2013, were used to estimate the biomass (dry weight) using an allometric equation. Basic wood density (BWD) and carbon content were only determined for species with high ecological importance. Carbon stock was obtained by three indirect methods: multiplying dry biomass (DB) by the carbon content (M1) obtained through laboratory analysis; multiplying the DB by the factor 0.5 (M2); and use of an allometric equation (M3). The species with the lowest and highest carbon content were Lafoensia vandelliana (43.70%) and Anadenanthera peregrina (46.60%). As for the BWD, the species that showed the lowest and highest value were Cecropia pachystachya (0.31 g cm-3) and Anadenanthera peregrina (0.72 g cm-3).

In rural areas, it can be used as a soil amendment to increase soil fertility. Fuel-constrained villagers may however prefer to use biochar briquettes as a higher-value fuel for cooking over applying it to soils. A systems-oriented analysis using life cycle assessment (LCA) and cost benefit analysis (CBA) was conducted to analyze these two alternative uses of biochar, applying the study to a rural village system in Indonesia. The results showed soil amendment for enhanced agricultural production to be the preferential choice with a positive benefit to the baseline scenario of -26 ecopoints (LCA) and -173 USD (CBA) annually pr. household. In this case, the positive effects of carbon sequestration to the soil and the economic value of the increased agricultural production outweighed the negative environmental impacts from biochar production and the related production costs. Use of biochar in briquettes for cooking fuel yielded negative net effects in both the LCA and CBA (85 ecopoints and 176 USD), even when positive health effects from reduced indoor air pollution were included. The main reasons for this are that emissions during biochar production are not compensated by carbon sequestration and that briquette making is labor-intensive. The results emphasize the importance of investigating and documenting the carbon storage effect and the agricultural benefit in biochar production-utilization systems for a sustainable use. Further research focus on efficient production is necessary due to the large environmental impact of biochar production. In addition, biochar should continue to be used in those soils where the agricultural effect is most beneficial. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",Agriculture and Carbon and Charcoal and Environment and Fertilizers and Indonesia and Rural Population and Socioeconomic Factors and Soil and Indonesia and Briquets and Environmental impact and Forestry and Fuels and Indoor air pollution and Life cycle and Rural areas and Soils and Waste incineration and biochar and carbon monoxide and charcoal and methane and unclassified drug and Agricultural productions and Carbon sequestration and Economic values and Incomplete combustion and Organic materials and Production cost and Socio-economic impacts and Sustainable use and agricultural production and carbon sequestration and combustion and cost-benefit analysis and environmental economics and environmental impact and health risk and life cycle analysis and pyrolysis and rural area and socioeconomic impact and soil amendment and soil fertility and sustainable development and valuation and waste and agricultural land and agriculture and cacao and carbon sequestration and carbon storage and climate change and cooking and cost benefit analysis and environmental impact and Indonesia and indoor air pollution and life cycle assessment and particulate matter and review and rural area and sensitivity analysis and socioeconomics and soil amendment and wood and Cost benefit analysis,10.1021/es405190q,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84899856770&doi=10.1021%2fes405190q&partnerID=40&md5=73865ba5d0a961e6dd7f3b45d785f08b,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 54,NA,JOUR,9,4664,4671,NA,MAY 6,0013-936X and 1520-5851,WOS:000335720100004,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2806, 5195"

The first is the establishment of multi-stakeholder agencies as intermediary bodies between funders and planters to manage the funds and to distribute incentives to planters. The second implication is that specific contracts assign objectives to land users in the form of conditions for payments that are believed to increase the chances for sustained impacts on the ground. These implications are important in the assessment of the potential of PES to operate as new and effective funding schemes for forest restoration. They are analyzed by looking at two prominent payments for watershed service programs in Indonesia-Cidanau (Banten province in Java) and West Lombok (Eastern Indonesia)-with combined economic and political science approaches. We derive lessons for the governance of funding efforts (e.g., multi-stakeholder agencies are not a guarantee of success; mixed results are obtained from a reliance on mandatory funding with ad hoc regulations, as opposed to voluntary contributions by the service beneficiary) and for the governance of financial expenditure (e.g., absolute need for evaluation procedures for the internal governance of farmer groups). Furthermore, we observe that these governance features provide no guarantee that restoration plots with the highest relevance for ecosystem services are targeted by the PES. © 2014 by the authors.",Afforestation and Cidanau and Forest restoration and Incentives and Indonesia and Large-scale governmental programs and Lombok and Multi-stakeholder agency and Payments for environmental services and Watershed services and Banten and Cidanau Basin and Greater Sunda Islands and Indonesia and Java and Lesser Sunda Islands and Lombok and Sunda Isles and West Nusa Tenggara and Computer software and Finance and Java programming language and Reforestation and Restoration and Watersheds and Afforestation and Cidanau and Forest restoration and Incentives and Indonesia and Lombok and Multi-stakeholder and Payments for environmental services and afforestation and ecosystem service and environmental policy and environmental restoration and forest management and governance approach and incentive and stakeholder and watershed and Conservation,10.3390/f5030404,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84902513551&doi=10.3390%2ff5030404&partnerID=40&md5=c8356b1a7a7aa81d313c7d3283465b05,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 22,NA,JOUR,3,404,424,NA,MAR,1999-4907,WOS:000333403600002,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2809, 4270"

These factors may be especially important in transition areas, leading to spatial gradients in the plant community.; Methods: This study was performed in the understorey of an abandoned Eucalyptus grandis W. Hill ex Maiden plantation between a savanna and a forest, 490 m apart, in south-eastern Brazil. This study assessed whether the spatial variation in several variables related to the understorey’s structure and composition is best described by linear or non-linear (quadratic) models. The linear model would indicate a gradient between the two vegetation types, whereas the quadratic model would indicate a stronger effect of the plantation’s edges.; Results: There was a gradient in species composition between the two edges of the plantation. Mean vegetation height was greatest at the savanna edge and lowest in the centre of the plantation. The total number of individuals per plot and the phylogenetic diversity decreased with distance from the savanna edge. Different patterns were observed for different dispersal syndromes, with animal dispersal being more common at the savanna edge, wind dispersal in the centre of the plantation and self dispersal at the forest edge.; Conclusions: The greater number of individuals at the savanna edge may indicate that dispersal and arrival of diaspores are the most important factors influencing community structure and composition of the understorey of this abandoned E. grandis plantation, with most propagules coming from the savanna area. The smaller vegetation height in the centre of the fragment may also indicate older colonisation at the edges. Therefore, in addition to highlighting the recovery potential of undergrowth beneath abandoned Eucalyptus spp. plantations, these results show that this recovery is spatially heterogeneous and that dispersal plays a large role in it. This should be taken into account in restoration projects. The authors recommend careful consideration before removing regenerating Eucalyptus spp. trees as part of the site restoration. Instead the focus should be on the recovery potential of the undergrowth, with gradual removal of Eucalyptus trees, if necessary. © 2014, Dodonov et al.",Cerrado and Community composition and Dispersal and Diversity and Ecotone and Restoration and Structure and Brazil and Eucalyptus grandis and Image reconstruction and Recovery and Refractory materials and Restoration and Structure (composition) and Vegetation and Cerrado and Community composition and Dispersal and Diversity and Ecotone and biodiversity and community composition and community structure and deciduous forest and dispersal and ecotone and environmental restoration and forest management and savanna and understory and vegetation dynamics and Reforestation,10.1186/s40490-014-0010-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84907246641&doi=10.1186%2fs40490-014-0010-y&partnerID=40&md5=5adb2c2549fa89a9252bee9c89d8b3dd,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 13,NA,JOUR,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2812

We also review studies on forested stream biota following hurricane, drought, and flooding events. This chapter also evaluates reforestation of degraded lands and recovery of forests after abandonment of paved roads. All the studies combined cover the major land cover changes that take place throughout the tropics and which require attention to conserve tropical biodiversity. These changes range from limited extractions of resources from forests to deforestation and conversion to pastures. When tropical forests are converted to pastures, more intensive management actions are needed to restore lands, including planting of introduced species capable of growing on degraded lands. Results from the LEF have demonstrated the high resistance and resilience of tropical forests and the success of plantings in the restoration of forest cover on degraded lands. In both streams and forests, species composition shifts from native to introduced species when anthropogenic disturbance regimes become prevalent over the natural disturbance regimes. © 2014 Springer New York.

These tropical ecosystems cover an estimated 284 to 300 km2 of the Earth' s surface (Spalding et al., 2001) and are considered among the most valuable on Earth, providing economic goods and services worth in excess of US$375 billion a–1 to millions of people (Best and Bornbusch, 2005). They are zones of high biological diversity, habitat for about a quarter of all known marine species, important components of the global carbon cycle, and provide the physical foundation for a number of mid-ocean nation states. Indeed, reefs possess benefits under four categories of ecosystem services (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). Such benefits include: regulation of incident oceanographic swell conditions to control reef and lagoon circulation, reduce shoreline erosion, protect beaches and coastlines from storm surges, and control beach and island formation; provision of food resources (fisheries) and aggregates for building (coral and sand), as well as the provision of land surface area and associated subsurface water resources, especially through reef island construction; supporting nutrient cycling and active carbonate production to build reef and reef island structures; and cultural benefits that include spiritual identity for indigenous communities and potential for tourism and recreation-based income. Coral reefs worldwide are considered to be in serious ecological decline as a consequence of anthropogenic impacts, natural stresses and climate change (e.g. Hughes et al., 2003; Buddemeier et al., 2004). Broad-scale assessments (e.g. Wilkinson, 2004) have argued that 20% of the world' s coral reefs have been destroyed and that 25% of reefs are under imminent or long-term risk of collapse. In the Indo-Pacific region, it has been calculated that coral cover loss rates were 2% per year (losses of 3168 km2 a–1) between 1997 and 2003 (Bruno and Selig, 2007). © Cambridge University Press 2009.",Aluminum alloys and Beaches and Carbon and Climate change and Ecology and Ecosystems and Geomorphology and Landforms and Shore protection and Water resources and Anthropogenic impacts and Ecosystem services and Global carbon cycle and Global environmental change and Indigenous community and Millennium ecosystem assessments and Shoreline erosion and Tropical ecosystems and Reefs,10.1017/CBO9780511627057.008,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-74449092867&doi=10.1017%2fCBO9780511627057.008&partnerID=40&md5=573384f880680c9e6e6582d531383292,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 36,NA,CHAP,NA,180,213,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2814

This is especially true when using conservation offsets (i.e., protected areas) because achieving no net loss requires avoiding equivalent loss. Our objective was to determine if offsetting the impacts of mining achieves no net loss of native vegetation in Brazil's largest iron mining region. We used a land-use change model to simulate deforestation by mining to 2020; developed a model to allocate conservation offsets to the landscape under 3 scenarios (baseline, no new offsets; current practice, like-for-like [by vegetation type] conservation offsetting near the impact site; and threat scenario, like-for-like conservation offsetting of highly threatened vegetation); and simulated nonmining deforestation to 2020 for each scenario to quantify avoided deforestation achieved with offsets. Mines cleared 3570 ha of native vegetation by 2020. Under a 1:4 offset ratio, mining companies would be required to conserve >14,200 ha of native vegetation, doubling the current extent of protected areas in the region. Allocating offsets under current practice avoided deforestation equivalent to 3% of that caused by mining, whereas allocating under the threat scenario avoided 9%. Current practice failed to achieve no net loss because offsets did not conserve threatened vegetation. Explicit allocation of offsets to threatened vegetation also failed because the most threatened vegetation was widely dispersed across the landscape, making conservation logistically difficult. To achieve no net loss with conservation offsets requires information on regional deforestation trajectories and the distribution of threatened vegetation. However, in some regions achieving no net loss through conservation may be impossible.

To quantify the impact of the management it is important to assess losses or gains of carbon, as well as the sustainability of the management system. This study quantified the impact management under a Small-Scale Sustainable Forest Management Plan, which is a recently created category of authorized management for small managers in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. Impact was quantified on the number of individuals, the biomass of natural regeneration, and the damage to the remaining trees 2 months after logging. The impact of these changes on carbon stock was estimated. The study was carried out in the Uatumã Sustainable Development Reserve, Amazonas, Brazil, where two areas of small-scale forest management and one control were evaluated. Average total carbon stock previous to logging was estimated at 161.25 ± 9.66 MgC ha-1. Two months after logging, reductions were found of 3% in one managed area (MA1) and 8.3% in the other (MA3), including the carbon stock from the harvested timber. For each harvested tree, the logging caused damage to 12 trees in MA1 and four trees in MA3. The reductions in carbon stock and number of trees damaged per harvested tree were less than the reductions found for higher impact forest management and other experiences in community forest management. No significant alteration was found in the carbon stock of natural regeneration. However, there was an increase in the number of individuals, both in the logged areas and in their respective control areas. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",biomass and conservation units and emissions reduction and global warming and logging and REDD and Amazonas [Brazil] and Brazil and Biomass and Carbon and Emission control and Global warming and Harvesting and Logging (forestry) and Planning and Sustainable development and Carbon stocks and Conservation units and Emissions reduction and Management systems and Natural regeneration and Number of trees and REDD and Sustainable forest management and biomass and community forestry and forest management and global warming and logging (timber) and management practice and sustainable development and sustainable forestry and Reforestation,10.1080/10549811.2013.836717,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84893504909&doi=10.1080%2f10549811.2013.836717&partnerID=40&md5=ebeb08c5568a3d1acf626dcb698ad6cf,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 3,NA,JOUR,2,127,151,NA,NA,1054-9811 and 1540-756X,WOS:000209679100002,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2828, 5260"

Both tree survival and growth were investigated among three Diameter at Breath Height (DBH) classes (20-40, 40-60, ≥60cm) to assess the contribution of each DBH class to the post-logging AGB recovery. Before logging, mean tree density and AGB per plot (dbh≥20cm) were 187±14 trees ha-1 and 377.6±62.8Mgha-1 respectively. Although big trees (dbh≥60cm) only represented 9.3% of the total tree density, they gathered almost half of total AGB. During the post-logging period (8years), the mortality of large trees was found to drive the annual net changes and largely overcame the AGB gain in the smaller DBH classes. Indeed, plots with high post-logging mortality of large trees showed negative carbon balance t over the study period (8years). The over mortality of large trees injured by logging contributed significantly to the annual AGB losses (up to 40%) in the first years after logging. Due to the overwhelming importance of this size class in carbon stocks and dynamic, reducing logging damages and intensity might have great impact in the post-logging biomass dynamics. We estimated that reducing logging intensity from 6 to 3 stems ha-1 would save 27.7Mg C ha-1 for a 35years rotation cycle. To compensate this loss of profits, compensatory payments of avoided CO2 emission should worth US $ 6.5/Mg of CO2. This price falls into the range of prices of the international carbon market. Sustainable forest management aiming at enhancing carbon stocks could therefore promote the preservation of the large trees.

The Pepital River is the main water supply for Alcântara (Brazil) and its forests are disappearing. This is affecting water volume and distribution in the region. Promoting forest restoration is imperative. In deprived regions, restoration success depends on the integration of ecology, livelihoods and traditional knowledge (TEK). In this study, an interdisciplinary research framework is proposed to design riparian forest restoration strategies based on ecological data, TEK and social needs.Methods: This study takes place in a region presenting a complex history of human relocation and land tenure. Local populations from seven villages were surveyed to document livelihood (including 'free-listing' of agricultural crops and homegarden tree species). Additionally, their perceptions toward environmental changes were explored through semi-structured interviews (n = 79). Ethnobotanical information on forest species and their uses were assessed by local-specialists (n = 19). Remnants of conserved forests were surveyed to access ecological information on tree species (three plots of 1,000 m2). Results included descriptive statistics, frequency and Smith's index of salience of the free-list results.Results: The local population depends primarily on slash-and-burn subsistence agriculture to meet their needs. Interviewees showed a strong empirical knowledge about the environmental problems of the river, and of their causes, consequences and potential solutions. Twenty-four tree species (dbh > 10 cm) were found at the reference sites. Tree density averaged 510 individuals per hectare (stdv = 91.6); and 12 species were considered the most abundant (density > 10ind/ha). There was a strong consensus among plant-specialists about the most important trees. The species lists from reference sites and plant-specialists presented an important convergence.Conclusions: Slash-and-burn agriculture is the main source of livelihood but also the main driver of forest degradation. Effective restoration approaches must transform problems into solutions by empowering local people. Successional agroforestry combining annual crops and trees may be a suitable transitional phase for restoration. The model must be designed collectively and include species of ecological, cultural, and socioeconomic value. In deprived communities of the Amazon, forest restoration must be a process that combines environmental and social gains. © 2014 Celentano et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Adult and Aged and Agriculture and Brazil and Conservation of Natural Resources and Ecosystem and Environment and Female and Forests and Humans and Knowledge and Male and Middle Aged and adult and aged and agriculture and Brazil and ecosystem and environment and environmental protection and female and forest and human and knowledge and male and middle aged,10.1186/1746-4269-10-11,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84894345035&doi=10.1186%2f1746-4269-10-11&partnerID=40&md5=f32c08d5a393bdb9fa89e46163fdc5c3,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 35,NA,JOUR,1,NA,NA,NA,JAN 27,1746-4269,WOS:000334622700001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2844, 4854"

Recently, controversial revisions to the Forest Code in Brazil have been implemented which include a reduction in the width of protected riparian buffer zones required along rivers. In order to model the impact of legislative changes on ecosystem services, we used the integrated valuation of environmental services and tradeoffs (InVEST) tool to assess a 30,000. ha watershed in southern Brazil and carbon sequestration as an indicator for ecosystem services. The results demonstrate that the adoption of improved agriculture practices, development of secondary forests and especially the conversion of land into more restrictive types of land-use has a significant and positive impact on the levels of carbon sequestered. On the other hand, the easing of riparian zone requirements shows an important potential loss in carbon sequestration. More importantly, reducing the size of the buffer zone might result in land-conversion into agriculture or pasture, impacting both carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services. However, the easing of restrictions on riparian areas under the revised Forest Code might be overshadowed by changes to Legal Forest Reserve provisions which could have a much greater impact on carbon sequestration. Despite the restrictions imposed by various pieces of legislation, the loss of ecosystem services due to a reduction in the protected riparian area, as well as possible land conversion due to changes in Legal Forest Reserves, are possible unless efforts involving narrowing the gap between research and policy, effective law enforcement, and implementing attractive payment for ecosystem services programs, are put in place. We believe that introducing incentives to farmers to maintain the protection of riparian areas by implementing agroforestry systems, such as erva-mate (Ilex paraguariensis), would be beneficial socioeconomically and ecologically and should be integrated into the Forest Code. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Agricultural incentives and Carbon sequestration and Ecosystem services and Forest management and InVEST and Riparian zones and Brazil and agricultural practice and biodiversity and carbon sequestration and conservation management and ecosystem service and environmental impact assessment and environmental policy and forest management and incentive and land use planning and law enforcement and policy implementation and protected area and regulatory framework and riparian zone and socioeconomic impact and trade-off and watershed and agroforestry and buffer zone and regulatory approach,10.1016/j.landusepol.2014.08.003,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84907342690&doi=10.1016%2fj.landusepol.2014.08.003&partnerID=40&md5=2fa7a15ea651df5b9f3179d53b961345,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 31,NA,JOUR,NA,329,339,NA,JAN,0264-8377 and 1873-5754,WOS:000347018700031,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2846, 4068"

It aims to attract new sources of 'green' capital to fund emissions reductions from avoided deforestation and sustainable forest management. REDD+ is transforming forest conservation, as a diverse array of new stakeholders become involved. Not surprisingly, REDD+ has proved divisive, as critics concern themselves with issues of power, justice, and commodification, while practice-oriented researchers tackle similar issues from different perspectives, focusing on benefit sharing, safeguards, additionality, measuring and verification. In this paper we explore the different roles of critical and practical research, and argue that there is a need for greater sharing of knowledge across current divides. We draw on our own experiences of conducting a research project on REDD+ in Indonesia that involved critical and practice-oriented researchers. We argue that critical research disconnected from practical matters can have perverse outcomes for practitioners who are ultimately working towards similar goals; while uncritical practice-oriented research has the potential to lead to a dilution of core values of environmental justice and conservation. In contrast, forms of practical critique provide ways of researching REDD+ that have practical value while maintaining critical insights. © 2014 Victoria University of Wellington and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",Critique and Indonesia and Political ecology and Practice and REDD,10.1111/apv.12064,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84917689237&doi=10.1111%2fapv.12064&partnerID=40&md5=d0de81785d3abd76b5c05f3e59519005,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 38,NA,JOUR,3,277,291,NA,DEC,1360-7456 and 1467-8373,WOS:000346359700003,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2851, 5012"

Based on analyses of long, up-to-date series observations on burnt area, rainfall, and tree cover, we demonstrate that fire activity is negatively correlated with rainfall and is positively associated with deforestation in Indonesia.

This paper reviews the evolution of multi-level policy dialogues, processes, and actions related to REDD+ social safeguards (e.g., Cancun Safeguards 1-5) among policy makers, civil society organizations, and within the media in Brazil, Indonesia and Tanzania, three countries with well advanced REDD+ programs. We find that progress on core aspects of social safeguards is uneven across the three countries. Brazil is by far the most advanced having drafted a REDD+ social safeguards policy. Both Brazil and Indonesia have benefited from progress made by strong sub-national entities in the operationalization of REDD+ safeguards including free prior and informed consent (FPIC), participation, and benefit sharing. Tanzania has weakly articulated how social safeguards will be operationalized and has a more top-down approach. We conclude that in all three countries, measuring, reporting and verifying progress on social safeguards is likely to be a complex issue. Stakeholders with vested interests in REDD+ social safeguards operate in polycentric rather than nested systems, suggesting that aggregation of information from local to national-scale will be a challenge. However, polycentric systems are also likely to support more transparent and comprehensive safeguards systems.

At Manaus, and at the end of the time-series, over 50% of regenerating forests were older than 16 years, whilst at Santarém and Machadinho d'Oeste, 57% and 41% of forests respectively were aged 6-15 years, with the remainder being mostly younger forests. These differences were attributed to the time since deforestation commenced but also the greater frequencies of reclearance of forests at the latter two sites with short periods of use in the intervening periods. The majority of clearance for agriculture was also found outside of protected areas.

They provide a wide range of ecosystem services and have recently become known for their exceptional capacity to store carbon. Research shows that mangrove conservation may be a low-cost means of reducing CO2 emissions. Accordingly, there is growing interest in developing market mechanisms to credit mangrove conservation projects for associated CO2 emissions reductions. These efforts depend on robust and readily applicable, but currently unavailable, localized estimates of soil carbon. Here, we use over 900 soil carbon measurements, collected in 28 countries by 61 independent studies, to develop a global predictive model for mangrove soil carbon. Using climatological and locational data as predictors, we explore several predictive modeling alternatives, including machine-learning methods. With our predictive model, we construct a global dataset of estimated soil carbon concentrations and stocks on a high-resolution grid (5 arc min). We estimate that the global mangrove soil carbon stock is 5.00±0.94 Pg C (assuming a 1 meter soil depth) and find this stock is highly variable over space. The amount of carbon per hectare in the world's most carbon-rich mangroves (approximately 703±38 Mg C ha-1) is roughly a 2.6±0.14 times the amount of carbon per hectare in the world's most carbon-poor mangroves (approximately 272±49 Mg C ha-1). Considerable within country variation in mangrove soil carbon also exists. In Indonesia, the country with the largest mangrove soil carbon stock, we estimate that the most carbon-rich mangroves contain 1.5±0.12 times as much carbon per hectare as the most carbon-poor mangroves. Our results can aid in evaluating benefits from mangrove conservation and designing mangrove conservation policy. Additionally, the results can be used to project changes in mangrove soil carbon stocks based on changing climatological predictors, e.g. to assess the impacts of climate change on mangrove soil carbon stocks. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.",blue carbon and ecosystem services and mangroves and predictive modeling and REDD and soil carbon and Indonesia and Rhizophoraceae and Artificial intelligence and Climate change and Conservation and Developing countries and Ecology and Ecosystems and Learning systems and Soils and Ecosystem services and mangroves and Predictive modeling and REDD and Soil carbon and biogeochemistry and carbon dioxide and carbon emission and conservation management and data set and ecosystem service and emission control and global perspective and mangrove and prediction and soil carbon and Carbon,10.1088/1748-9326/9/10/104013,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928951551&doi=10.1088%2f1748-9326%2f9%2f10%2f104013&partnerID=40&md5=ba6586b578c739a82bbbf702e22281dd,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 124,NA,JOUR,10,NA,NA,NA,OCT,1748-9326,WOS:000344964000017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2873, 3639"

2881,Scopus,Book chapter,"Gallery, R.E.",2014,Ecology of tropical rain forests,Ecology and the Environment,NA,NA,"Occupying less than 7 % of Earth's land surface, tropical rain forests harbor perhaps half of the species on Earth and are ecologically, economically, and culturally crucial for issues in global food security, climate change, biodiversity, and human health. Geographically located between the latitudes 10°N and 10°S of the equator, lowland tropical rain forest ecosystems share similar physical structure but vary in geology, species composition, and anthropogenic threats across the forests of Southeast Asia, Australia, Africa, and Central and South America. Mature tropical rain forests are stratified by multiple canopy and understory layers, and physiognomic properties include evergreen broadleaf tree species, a preponderance of species with large leaves to aid with sunlight capture in the light-limited understory, and leaf properties such as entire margins and drip tips that channel water efficiently from the leaf surface. Lianas are increasing in abundance and biomass in a number of tropical rain forests. The additive effects of an increase in liana biomass are correlated with a reduction in tropical forest carbon (C) storage, a value that is currently not considered in global vegetation models. Most rain forest tree species do not grow, flower, or fruit year-round. Peaks in leaf flushing, flowering, and fruiting coincide with the high irradiance and low water stress associated with the onset of the wet season. This synchrony is common and largely driven by resource availability, though biotic explanations for synchrony include selection to attract pollinators or seed dispersers and to avoid herbivory and seed predation. With few exceptions, species richness across the tree of life is highest in equatorial tropical regions and decreases towards the poles. Tropical rain forests harbor approximately two thirds of the estimated 350,000-500,000 extant flowering plant species on Earth, with high rates of endemism and large numbers of rare species. Numerous evolutionary and ecological hypotheses to explain the origin and maintenance of high biological diversity in tropical forests have garnered support and include biogeographic history, evolutionary mechanisms of adaptation and speciation, range size and distribution constraints, and ecological mechanisms promoting species coexistence. Continental drift, climate constraints, and long-distance dispersal are responsible for some of the similarities and differences in species across tropical regions. Familial similarity among forests in Amazonia and Southeast Asia can be as high as 50 %, while independent diversification and species radiation mean that much fewer genera (around 10 %) are shared. Gradients in climate, parent material and soil age, topography and landscape stability, and atmospheric deposition result in strong heterogeneity in soil nutrient availability from local to regional scales. Soil order, which is generally correlated with soil fertility as a strong predictor of aboveground net primary productivity in tropical forests. Tropical forests account for approximately 40 % of terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP), store half of Earth's vegetative C stocks but less than 10 % of its soil C stocks. The relationships between rainfall, temperature, soil fertility, and NPP are complex and require more experimental manipulations to tease apart the interactions. Intact tropical forests are net C sinks, but the uptake of C (1.1 ± 0.3 Pg C year-1) in intact tropical forests is counteracted by the emissions from tropical biome conversion - a net C source to the atmosphere of 1.3 ± 0.2 Pg C year-1 that results in a tropical biome net C balance of approximately zero. Stronger El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) effects are increasing the frequency and severity of droughts, fires, hurricanes and cyclones, and flooding events. Recovery of aboveground biomass, species composition, and forest structure all depend on the type and severity of disturbance and its effect on soil fertility. Greater use of remote sensing imagery from satellites, airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, and unmanned drones will allow accurate tracking of disturbance and C stocks as well as monitoring of phenology, foliar canopy chemistry, individual species identification, and biodiversity estimates from local to regional scales. The tropical biome is undergoing significant change. Understanding the drivers and impacts of these changes will require sustained advances across multiple disciplines. Ultimately as a society, we are left asking what is the capacity of our remaining and regrowing tropical rain forests to adapt to long-term anthropogenic and climate change and what can we do to moderate these effects while nourishing a healthy human population. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.",NA,10.1007/978-1-4614-7501-9_4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027232037&doi=10.1007%2f978-1-4614-7501-9_4&partnerID=40&md5=081fa2e6df132de5403c8603aa02a94d,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 20,NA,CHAP,NA,247,272,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2881

However, knowledge of their long-term effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and functional SOC fractions linking soil resilience capacity and crop yield is still limited. The aims of this study were to: (i) assess the long-term (16 years) effects of tillage systems (i.e., conventional - CT, minimum - MT, no-till with chisel - NTch, and continuous no-till cropping systems - CNT) on SOC in bulk soil and functional C fractions isolated by chemical (hot water extractable organic C - HWEOC, permanganate oxidizable C - POXC) and physical methods (light organic C - LOC, particulate organic C - POC, mineral-associated organic C - MAOC) of a subtropical Oxisol to 40cm depth; (ii) evaluate the soil resilience restoration effectiveness of tillage systems, and (iii) assess the relationship between the SOC stock enhancement and crop yield. The crop rotation comprised a 3-year cropping sequence involving two crops per year with soybean (Glycine max, L. Merril) and maize (Zea mays L.) in the summer alternating with winter crops.

The relative C conversion ratio of 0.398 at CNT was more efficient in converting biomass-C input into sequestered soil C than NTch (0.349), MT (0.136), and CT (0.069). The soil under CNT in 0-10cm depth contained ~1.9 times more HWEOC and POXC than those under CT (P<0.05), and concentrations of LOC and POC physical fractions of SOC were significantly higher throughout the year under CNT. Considering CT as the disturbance baseline, the resilience index (RI) increased in the order of MT (0.10)<NTch (0.43)<CNT (0.54). Grain yield was positively affected by increase in SOC stock, and an increase of 1Mg Cha-1 in 0-20cm depth resulted in an increase in yield equal to ~11 and 26kg grainha-1 of soybean (R2=0.97, P=0.03) and wheat (R2=0.96, P=0.03), respectively. The data presented emphasizes the role of labile fractions in the overall SOC accumulation processes in soils managed under CNT and their positive impacts on the soil resilience restoration and on agronomic productivity. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Biomass-C input and Labile and stable fractions and No-till cropping systems and Resilience and Temporal changes and Yield and Brazil and Agricultural machinery and Agronomy and Amino acids and Crops and Grain (agricultural product) and Nitrogen fixation and Productivity and Restoration and Soils and Biomass-C input and Cropping systems and Labile and stable fractions and Resilience and Temporal change and Yield and agricultural production and agronomy and biomass and carbon sequestration and crop rotation and disturbance and Oxisol and productivity and resilience and restoration ecology and soil carbon and soil management and soil organic matter and soil quality and soybean and tillage and Soil pollution,10.1016/j.still.2013.09.010,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84886530384&doi=10.1016%2fj.still.2013.09.010&partnerID=40&md5=aa34a640702a4269efaf7e87582db212,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 129,NA,JOUR,NA,38,50,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2882

Accessible predictive tools are required to estimate likely soil carbon (C) losses and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from peat soils under this land use change. Research and modelling efforts in tropical peatlands are limited, restricting the availability of data for complex soil model parameterisation and evaluation. The Tropical Peatland Plantation-Carbon Assessment Tool (TROPP-CAT) was developed to provide a user friendly tool to evaluate and predict soil C losses and CO2 emissions from tropical peat soils. The tool requires simple input values to determine the rate of subsidence, of which the oxidising proportion results in CO2 emissions. This paper describes the model structure and equations, and presents a number of evaluation and application runs. TROPP-CAT has been applied for both site specific and national level simulations, on existing oil palm and Acacia plantations, as well as on peat swamp forest sites to predict likely emissions from future land use change. Through an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, literature reviews and comparison with other methods of estimating soil C losses, the paper identifies opportunities for future model development, bridging between different approaches to predicting CO2 emissions from tropical peatlands under land use change.

It can be considered as the spatial manifestation of deforestation and degradation in a landscape. Forest fragmentation thus results in the same loss of ecosystem services as these other forms of land-cover change, but how does it affect livelihoods? We propose here an analysis of the livelihood impacts of tropical forest fragmentation, which will begin with a better definition of the spatial processes involved in fragmentation. As it is difficult to analyse the impacts of fragmentation without consideration of the associated impacts of the causes - or drivers - of forest fragmentation, we will analyse them in detail. Fragmentation results from a range of drivers that are categorized into five groups: (i) economic factors; (ii) governance factors; (iii) demographic factors; (iv) technological factors; and (v) cultural factors. Economic factors are prevalent in decisions, with forest conservation often being a luxury for wealthy people. Stakeholders who gain direct economic returns from deforestation - from logging, farming and facilitated access to markets - will also benefit globally from forest fragmentation, the benefits from these drivers by far outweighing the loss of ecosystem services. However, forest dwellers and isolated forest communities will often have to choose between 'modern' life or the cultural specificities that shaped their identity.

The current worldwide trends of reduction in natural forest and expansion of forest plantations increases the need for forest managers to contribute to water conservation, implementing management plans that integrate economic (productivity and growth), social (equity of access to water and land-use conflicts) and environmental (climate change and biodiversity impacts) factors. In this paper, we show examples of forest management alternatives at macro- and meso-scales that could contribute to improve water conservation in forest plantation landscapes. At the macroscale, we assess water use in different forest plantation areas in Brazil by analyzing the theoretical thresholds for the management of evapotranspiration. Then, using data from an experimental catchment, we modeled water yield reduction by a forest plantation over multiple years and assessed how different meso-scale forest plantation management alternatives affected water flow regulation. Results show that at a macroscale it is important to consider the natural climatic constraints of water availability. Evidence shows that forest plantations in the tropics use water according to its availability, and the appropriate choice of species/varieties and associated forest management options are crucial for water conservation. At the meso-scale we found that the proportion of native forest plays an important role in the reduction and regulation of water use, and therefore a system of mosaic management may be able to stabilize water flow across plantation landscapes. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Brazil and Catchment and Eucalyptus plantation and Landscape management and Sustainable forest management and Water use and Biodiversity and Brazil and Eucalyptus and Hydraulics and Plantations and Runoff and Sustainable Forest Management and Water and Water Management and Water Supply and Brazil and Eucalyptus and Biodiversity and Catchments and Climate change and Flow of water and Hydraulics and Runoff and Water conservation and Water supply and Brazil and Eucalyptus plantations and Landscape management and Sustainable forest management and Water use and biodiversity and catchment and climate change and economic analysis and evapotranspiration and forest management and growth rate and landscape and plantation forestry and sustainable development and threshold and water flow and water management and water use efficiency and Forestry,10.1016/j.foreco.2012.10.015,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878108036&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2012.10.015&partnerID=40&md5=f964be30e22a33cc3349b3d93d039f89,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 101,NA,JOUR,NA,58,66,NA,AUG 1,0378-1127 and 1872-7042,WOS:000320485000007,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2902, 5376"

Although many studies investigate management impacts, data on the long-term change of species communities in agroecosystems are scarce. We analysed the long-term change in diversity and composition of ant communities in cacao agroforestry systems in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia and attempted to disentangle the driving factors of this change. Ant communities were resampled in 2009 from sites for which previous surveys had been conducted either in 2001 (the rainforest-poor Palolo region) or 2003 (the rainforest-rich Kulawi region) using insecticide fogging. Ant community composition changed significantly over time in Palolo and Kulawi. The change in ant species richness differed between regions. Species richness increased in Kulawi, probably due to the increasing availability of nest sites and microhabitats as trees grow larger and older. In the Palolo region, species richness decreased, suggesting that the high local intensification and landscape-wide changes may have counteracted the effects of tree age. Changes in ant communities over time were significant, but were more difficult to explain than expected, despite clear difference in management changes within and between regions. The findings suggest that the landscape-scale differences between the two study regions play a more important role for species diversity and its composition than changes in local management.

We hypothesized (i) that C sequestration in no-tillage soil is further enhanced by high input cropping systems and (ii) that the sequestered C is stored mainly in the mineral associated fraction. The objective of this study was to assess, in 2003, the C sequestration and stabilization in a subtropical Acrisol (Eldorado do Sul, Brazil) subjected to 18-year conventional tillage [CT] and no-tillage [NT] combined with two cropping systems: black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb) as winter cover crop - maize (Zea mays L.) as summer grain crop [Ot/M]; and black oat plus vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) as winter cover crops - maize in summer intercropped with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp) cover crop [Ot+V/M+C]. Soil C stock in the 0-20cm layer was higher in NT than in CT, either in Ot/M (31.1 vs. 27.8Mgha-1, P<0.05) or Ot+V/M+C (37.3 vs. 32.8Mgha-1, P<0.05). Annual C sequestration rate in NT relative to CT was 0.25Mgha-1 in Ot+V/M+C and 0.18Mgha-1 in Ot/M, in agreement to the higher biomass-C addition and legume cover crops inclusion in Ot+V/M+C (7.6 vs 4.0Mgha-1 year-1) and to our first hypothesis. Increase in the proportion of large macroaggregates (9.51-4.76mm) and of mean weight diameter occurred in NT soil up to 10cm depth, both in Ot/M and Ot+V/M+C.

Aren or sugar palm (Arenga pinnata (Wurmb) Merr.) is a multipurpose tree that provides livelihoods for local people and food for other biota in the landscape. However, its domestication is still limited in many places, such as in Batang Toru Forest Block, an area of high conservation value, including habitat for the Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii). Options for aren management were prioritized as part of a landscape-scale conservation study by comparing domestication levels in the area. Data on economic indicators and ecological knowledge were gathered through interviews with key farmers, focus groups and transect walks. Four representative villages were selected for the study, that is, (i) two villages with no domestication of aren; and (ii) two villages with aren cultivation in rubber-based land-use systems. Costbenefit analyses suggested that in a rich biodiversity area, such as Batang Toru, although aren was one of the sources of local livelihoods, additional investment for domestication beyond cultivation was not an option considered by farmers. Farmers still perceived wildlife as an efficient mode of aren regeneration, supported by the coexistence of people and other biota in the area. It appears the value of aren for local people's livelihoods and conservation can be enhanced by increasing its stocking density.

Many studies emphasize the role of above-ground shoots in attenuating waves, enhancing sedimentation and preventing erosion. This raises the question if short-leaved, low density (grazed) seagrass meadows with most of their biomass in belowground tissues can also stabilize sediments. We examined this by combining manipulative field experiments and wave measurements along a typical tropical reef flat where green turtles intensively graze upon the seagrass canopy. We experimentally manipulated wave energy and grazing intensity along a transect perpendicular to the beach, and compared sediment bed level change between vegetated and experimentally created bare plots at three distances from the beach. Our experiments showed that i) even the short-leaved, low-biomass and heavily-grazed seagrass vegetation reduced wave-induced sediment erosion up to threefold, and ii) that erosion was a function of location along the vegetated reef flat. Where other studies stress the importance of the seagrass canopy for shoreline protection, our study on open, low-biomass and heavily grazed seagrass beds strongly suggests that belowground biomass also has a major effect on the immobilization of sediment. These results imply that, compared to shallow unvegetated nearshore reef flats, the presence of a short, low-biomass seagrass meadow maintains a higher bed level, attenuating waves before reaching the beach and hence lowering beach erosion rates. We propose that the sole use of aboveground biomass as a proxy for valuing coastal protection services should be reconsidered. © 2013 Christianen et al.","Biomass and Conservation of Natural Resources and Ecosystem and Geography and Geologic Sediments and Hydrocharitaceae and Hydrodynamics and Indonesia and Models, Theoretical and Water Movements and Testudines and article and biomass allocation and biomass production and canopy and controlled study and coral reef and environmental change and environmental erosion and environmental monitoring and environmental protection and hydrodynamics and nonhuman and radiative forcing and rangeland and seagrass and seashore and sediment",10.1371/journal.pone.0062413,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878378433&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0062413&partnerID=40&md5=2fd79a70dadd2ee1a90824a3d081bc1e,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 218,NA,JOUR,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2917

This increased supply of beef is expected to occur primarily through on-farm productivity increases. The strategies for reducing resultant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions should be evaluated in the context of the production system and should encompass a broader analysis, which would include the emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon sequestration. This paper provides an insight into CH4 measurement techniques applicable to grazing environments and proposed mitigation strategies, with relevance to the production systems that are predominant in grazing systems of Australia and Brazil. Research and technology investment in both Australia and Brazil is aimed at developing measurement techniques and increasing the efficiency of cattle production by improving herd genetics, utilization of the seasonal feed-base and reducing the proportion of metabolizable energy lost as CH4. Concerted efforts in these areas can be expected to reduce the number of unproductive animals, reduce age at slaughter and inevitably reduce emission intensity (EI) from beef production systems. Improving efficiency of livestock production systems in tropical grazing systems for Australia and Brazil will be based on cultivated and existing native pastures and the use of additives and by-products from other agricultural sectors. This approach spares grain-based feed reserves typically used for human consumption, but potentially incurs a heavier EI than current intensive feeding systems. The determination of GHG emissions and the value of mitigation outcomes for entire beef production systems in the extensive grazing systems is complex and require a multidisciplinary approach. It is fortunate that governments in both Australia and Brazil are supporting ongoing research activities. Nevertheless, to achieve an outcome that feeds a growing population while reducing emissions on a global scale continues to be a monumental challenge for ruminant nutritionists.",Air Pollutants and Animal Husbandry and Australia and Brazil and Environment and Environmental Monitoring and Environmental Remediation and Methane and methane and air pollutant and animal husbandry and Australia and Brazil and ecosystem restoration and environment and environmental monitoring and evaluation and metabolism and methodology and review,10.1017/S1751731113000670,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84887692268&doi=10.1017%2fS1751731113000670&partnerID=40&md5=b39494bc6b2f9891d909cad7f26af62c,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 54,NA,JOUR,NA,363,372,NA,JUN,1751-7311 and 1751-732X,WOS:000328502300016,NA,NA,5th Greenhouse Gases and Animal Agriculture (GGAA) Conference,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2919, 5240"

However, the carbon benefits of REDD projects may be compromised by leakage, or displacement of deforestation to areas outside of the reserve. Through environmental modeling techniques it is possible to simulate scenarios that represent changes in land use and land cover and thus assess the possible trajectories and magnitude of deforestation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Juma reserve in reducing deforestation and to estimate projected carbon emission by 2050. The simulated scenarios were: (1) baseline scenario, without the creation of the Juma reserve; (2) scenario with leakage (SL) where the creation of the reserve would cause a spatial shift in deforestation, and (3) scenario with reduced leakage (SRL), where the amount of deforestation resulting from leakage is reduced. Considering the study area as a whole (Juma reserve +120-km buffer zone), there would be a 16.0% (14,695km 2) reduction in forest cover by 2050 in the baseline scenario, 15.9% (14,647km 2) in the SL and 15.4% (14,219km 2) in the SRL, as compared to what was present in 2008. The loss of forest cover within the limits of the Juma reserve by 2050 would be 18.9% (1052km 2) in the baseline scenario and 7.1% (395km 2) in the SL and SRL. From the simulated scenarios, the carbon stock in the total study area was estimated to be reduced from 1.63 Pg C (Pg=10 15g=1 billion tons) in 2008 to 1.37 Pg C in 2050 in the baseline scenario and in the SL and to 1.38 Pg C in the SRL. In the area of the Juma reserve, the carbon stock would be reduced from 0.10 Pg C in 2008 to 0.08 Pg C in 2050 (baseline) or 0.09 Pg C (SL and SRL). The Juma reserve was effective in reducing carbon emission by 2050, but the reduction would be substantially less than that calculated in the Juma REDD project.

Nevertheless, the spatial distribution of this component of biodiversity is still unknown for most groups, which limits its application for selecting priority areas to conserve. In the present study, we reconstructed the phylogeny of Minaria (Apocynaceae) based on plastid (trnH-psbA, rps16, trnS-trnG and trnD-trnT) and nuclear (ITS and ETS) DNA markers and 34 morphological characters, and analysed the geographic distribution of the phylogenetic diversity (PD) and endemism (PE) in this genus. Minaria includes 21 species that are highly concentrated in the Espinhaço Range, in eastern Brazil, most of which (?75%) are narrowly distributed. The spatial analyses of PD and PE of Minaria indicate four evolutionary relevant areas in this region. The Serra do Ciṕo and the Diamantina Plateau contain 10 endemic species and present the highest levels of PD. However, the two other areas also deserve special attention. Rio de Contas has high levels of PE, because of two endemic sister species that represent a phylogenetically isolated lineage and the Southern Espinhaço Range houses the most critically endangered species of the genus. Most endemic species of Minaria occur in vegetation islands on rocky outcrops (campos rupestres). These low-fuel areas are less susceptible to fire, suggesting that the Espinhaço Range has served as a historical refuge for fire-sensitive lineages. Our results suggest that conservation units in the Espinhaço Range cover a great proportion of the evolutionary diversity of Minaria and that fire management is probably an important strategy to preserve this endemic biodiversity. © 2012 The Natural History Museum.",Asclepiadoideae and Bahia and Biogeography and Campos rupestres and Endangered species and Endemism and Fire management and Metastelmatinae and Minas Gerais and Neotropics and Apocynaceae and Asclepiadoideae,10.1080/14772000.2012.705356,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84869098180&doi=10.1080%2f14772000.2012.705356&partnerID=40&md5=bbbc48a824cbd36931b22935db723bcf,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 28,NA,JOUR,3,317,331,NA,NA,1477-2000 and 1478-0933,WOS:000309130300006,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2921, 5356"

Planted forests represent an increasing proportion of the global forest area and partly compensate for the loss of natural forest in terms of forest area, habitat for biodiversity and ecological function. At current rates, over 30% of the remaining natural forest area will be lost by the end of the century and planted forests would then represent over 20% of the total forest area. This places a greater demand on planted forests to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity and their provision of biodiversity-dependent ecosystem services. We reviewed recent trends of deforestation, afforestation and reforestation to evaluate the effects on forest biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services. We placed particular emphasis on eucalypt plantations which continue to expand in numerous countries, especially in Brazil where rapid plantation expansion is creating the largest area of cultivated eucalypt forest worldwide. While government policies to associate plantation establishment with the protection and restoration of natural forests appear to be effective in the highly fragmented Atlantic forest, deforestation continues in Amazonia, mainly due to forest conversion associated with agricultural expansion.

For example, Brazil has developed two systems-that is, PRODES (Program for the Estimation of Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon) (http://www.obt.inpe.br/prodes/) and DETER (Real Time Deforestation Monitoring System) (http://www.obt.inpe.br/deter/)-to monitor annual deforestation by using Landsat and MODIS data, respectively. © 2014 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Biodiversity and Climate change and Land use and Real time systems and Space research and Vegetation and Agricultural land and Brazilian Amazon and Environmental process and Land-use change and Monitoring system and Multi-temporal and Primary forest and Vegetation change and Deforestation,10.1201/b15159,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84896261112&doi=10.1201%2fb15159&partnerID=40&md5=7ee81b028bf86371b785793d11898d66,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 6,NA,CHAP,NA,127,140,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2930

Mitigation potential, especially in the forestry sector, looms large. Niles et al. (2002) estimate for Latin America that forest restoration and avoided deforestation together could result in up to 128 Mt of carbon emission reductions annually (68% of the world total) as opposed to 9.3 Mt through sustainable agricultural change (see chapters by Minang et al. and Gockowski and Van Asten for examples from Africa). The Amazon forest is the world’s largest continuous tropical rainforest covering over 4% of the earth’s land surface. Between 1977 and 2010, 618, 000 km2 of forest area was converted to pasture and agricultural crops in the Brazilian Amazon alone.1 Carbon emissions from Amazon deforestation are estimated to account for 24% of global carbon emissions from land-use change (Aragão and Shimabukuro 2010). In the countries with large shares of their territory in the Amazon region (Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru), combined AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry and other Land Use) emissions account for over 83% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions2 thus representing the most important sector for climate change mitigation. AFOLU-based climate change mitigation has been ridden with obstacles. Afforestation and reforestation (A/R) initiatives, for example, the only AFOLU measure eligible under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol, account for only 17 out of a total of 2, 970 registered projects3 approved since the CDM’s inception-complicated rules and high transaction costs have been binding constraints, and pilot experiences were often confined to the voluntary market (Michaelowa and Jotzo 2005). © 2012 ICRAF and CIAT, for the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security.",NA,10.4324/9780203144510-45,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123128117&doi=10.4324%2f9780203144510-45&partnerID=40&md5=d0d6d36a0e79178f0b8c38d0d9006ee3,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,CHAP,NA,399,410,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2937

However, accurately quantifying alterations in soil organic carbon (SOC) due to land-use changes remains to be a major challenge. Using a meta-analysis, our objective was to evaluate tillage effects on SOC stocks in Brazil's Amazon and Cerrado biomes. Two approaches: (1) the classical SOC annual change rate which provides only an arithmetic average of SOC changes, and (2) the rate of annual change adjusted from management factors derived according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) SOC methodology, which allows a temporal dataset adjustment, were used. Regardless of approach, conservation technologies such as no-tillage (NT) and integrated crop-livestock (ICL) systems were identified as viable options for SOC sequestration, increasing it between 9 and 16%. One exception was adoption of NT in the Amazon forest, where SOC decreased by 9% over 20 years. Comparing results of the two approaches showed substantial differences between them. For conversions from NT to ICL or from native vegetation to full tillage (FT), the IPCC-based approach produced SOC stock estimates that were 65 and 47% lower, respectively, than with the classical approach. The IPCC approach also identified modeling covariate effects and was influenced less by outliers, thus reducing the risk of under or overestimating soil management effects on SOC. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and IPCC-based method and Land use change and SOC stock rates and Amazonas [Brazil] and Brazil and Agricultural machinery and Agronomy and Climate change and Land use and Classical approach and Conservation technologies and Intergovernmental panel on climate changes and IPCC-based method and Land-use change and Management factors and Soil organic carbon and Stock rates and biome and carbon dioxide and carbon sequestration and cerrado and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and land use change and soil carbon and Carbon dioxide,10.1016/j.still.2013.06.002,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84880032394&doi=10.1016%2fj.still.2013.06.002&partnerID=40&md5=850a875b758934da411408956e098358,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 30,NA,JOUR,NA,75,84,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2939

Carbon (C) sequestration in plant and soil systems offers an opportunity for mitigating the greenhouse effect (Lal 2004) but the relationship between soil carbon stocks (CS) and carbon fixation in natural and anthropic vegetation remains one of the least studied issues. Emphasis has been placed on measurements of carbon fixation by forests or measurements of carbon emissions following land-use changes. As agriculture represents one of the major land-use systems, there is a close relationship between soil carbon (SC) capture and emissions and the allocation of land for agriculture. Many management practices can increase soil CS as well as above-ground carbon in biomass, including soil conservation practices (e.g., no-tillage, reduced tillage, terracing), incorporation of crop residues, increases in cropping intensity and fertilization, and conversion of cropland to permanent grasslands or forests. Although the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) protocol has prioritized only above-ground carbon sequestration via afforestation and reforestation (A/R), the soil might represent an even larger carbon sink. In this respect, one of the challenges for the incorporation of agriculture into post-Kyoto agreements (after 2012) is to develop simple and effective methodologies for measuring, monitoring and verifying SC in cropping, farming and land-use systems. The Instrumentation Center of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA) has worked to address this challenge. EMBRAPA’s team has used spectroscopic techniques, with high potential for field application, to analyze whole soil samples without sample preparation. Particularly, positive results have been obtained using Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS), Laser-Induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy (LIFS) and Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). Methodologies using LIBS and NIRS are being developed for soil C quantification and LIFS equipment was developed to evaluate C stability in soils. A partnership between EMBRAPA and the International Potato Center (CIP) has been conducive to the assessment of soil CS and C stability in different agroecosystems in the Southern Peruvian Andes, Kenya and Brazil, using stateof-the-art non-destructive analytical methods.

Cover of plants was registered in 120 plots of 1m2 in grasslands located at two distances from small watercourses in pasture and eucalypt plantation areas within a livestock ranching landscape. Livestock density is reduced in plantation areas. Species composition beneath tree plantations was significantly different from both pasture and nearby permanent protection areas. Permanent protection areas near plantations were also compositionally different from pastures. Eucalypt plantation was the environment type where ruderals were most abundant. Growth form cover distribution in pasture areas showed a consistent pattern, with graminous herbs being the most common growth form followed by prostrate herbs, prostrate subshrubs, and standing subshrubs. In plantation areas, the dominance of the graminoid herb growth form increased markedly, as well as standing herbs. These increases occurred mainly at the expense of prostrate herbs and subshrubs, which were significantly reduced. Plot-level species density was significantly affected by distance from watercourse and, more importantly, was significantly influenced by the interaction between management regime and distance to watercourse. It was reduced in eucalypt plantations relative to permanent protected areas.

The objectives of this study were to implement simultaneous assessment of community attributes (richness, abundance and biomass, each calculated for total-beetle assemblages as well as small- and large-beetle assemblages) and three ecological functions of dung beetles (dung removal, soil perturbation and secondary seed dispersal), to compare the effects of habitat disturbance on both sets of response variables, and their relations. We studied dung beetle community attributes and functions in five land-use systems representing a disturbance gradient in the Brazilian Amazon: primary forest, secondary forest, agroforestry, agriculture and pasture. All response variables were affected negatively by the intensification of habitat disturbance regimes, but community attributes and ecological functions did not follow the same pattern of decline. A hierarchical partitioning analysis showed that, although all community attributes had a significant effect on the three ecological functions (except the abundance of small beetles on all three ecological functions and the biomass of small beetles on secondary dispersal of large seed mimics), species richness and abundance of large beetles were the community attributes with the highest explanatory value.

Species richness per ∼50. km side cell ranged from 1 to 2149 taxa, but with most of the areas presenting between 1 and 58 taxa. Population accessibility, expansion of agriculture and grazing pressure were found to be the key drivers of immediate extinction risk.

Currently, about 7.3 million ha of forests are lost annually, releasing an estimated 5.8 gigatons of carbon dioxide (Gt CO2) per year into the atmosphere. This represents 12-17% of human-generated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. On the other hand, forests have the capacity to act as sinks (the ability to absorb and hold CO2 for long periods). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment report puts the total potential for avoiding carbon emissions through aggressive forestry practice changes on 700 million ha of forest at about 60-80 billion tons, or about 12-25% of current fossil fuel emissions over a period of 50 years. As a corollary, forests and trees have been at the heart of strategies and negotiations for mitigating GHG emissions in the last few years. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) are two key policy instruments that have emerged in the last few years to enable climate change mitigation through forests and trees. The CDM is a mechanism employed within the context of the Kyoto protocol to enable carbon sequestration through afforestation and reforestation (A/R), but has had little success so far in developing countries (Boyd et al. 2009). Meanwhile agreement was reached on the key principles for a REDD+ mechanism at the 16th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Cancún. The REDD+ idea suggests a mechanism in which countries that reduce national level deforestation to below an agreed level would receive compensation or rewards. These countries may also make commitments to stabilize or further reduce deforestation in the future. Such reductions can be obtained through “reducing emissions from deforestation, "" “reducing emissions from forest degradation, "" “conservation of forest carbon stocks, "" “sustainable management of forests, "" and “enhancement of carbon stocks.” The reductions and rewards must contribute to sustainable development. The level of sustainable development benefits, costs and trade-offs to be expected from a REDD+ type of scheme remains a fundamental question, as very little evidence currently exists, but expectations of win-win situations are high. At what point, or when, will carbon represent a good proposition to land users seeking to put land into alternative livelihoods and biodiversity conservation uses? This chapter examines the trade-offs between carbon and alternative land uses in the southern forest zone of Cameroon. It uses evidence from long-term research by the Alternatives to Slash-and-Burn (ASB) Partnership for the Tropical Forest Margins (see also chapter by Gockowski and Van Asten). In line with current global forest and tree climate mitigation strategies, the ASB Partnership is conducting research on how to reduce deforestation along tropical forest margins without compromising agricultural productivity and the provision of environmental services. ASB was created in 1994 as a partnership between international and national research organizations and universities, and is currently working in a network of sites across the humid and sub-humid tropics. ASB research primarily focuses on the sustainability of impacts in terms of livelihoods, agricultural productivity, environmental services, and the trade-offs therein. Uniform indicators, methods and approaches have been applied to understand land use, carbon, biodiversity, agricultural productivity and livelihood impacts across more than 12 sites (Palm et al. 2005). This chapter focuses on trade-offs between carbon, profitability and biodiversity in order to provide insights into the potential for REDD+ and other mechanisms to meet the triple objectives of climate, development and conservation using Cameroon as an example. © 2012 ICRAF and CIAT, for the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security.",NA,10.4324/9780203144510-44,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123157128&doi=10.4324%2f9780203144510-44&partnerID=40&md5=b1871f74a4d76dd40ba32560661b82d2,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,CHAP,NA,391,398,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2956

In the case of Amazonian dark earth (ADE) soils, the increased amount of this material is believed to be due to anthropogenic action by ancient indigenous populations. In this study, we use 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing to assess the bacterial diversity observed in the BC found in ADEs as well as in the dark earth itself and the adjacent Acrisol. Samples were taken from two sites, one cultivated with manioc and one with secondary forest cover. Analyses revealed that the community structure found in each sample had unique features. At a coarse phylogenetic resolution, the most abundant phyla in all sequence libraries were Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Proteobacteria that were present in similar relative abundance across all samples. However, the class composition varied between them highlighting the difference between the Acrisol and the remaining samples. This result was also corroborated by the comparison of the OTU composition (at 97 % identity). Also, soil coverage has shown an effect over the community structure observed in all samples. This pattern was found to be significant through unweighted UniFrac as well as P tests. These results indicate that, although the ADEs are found in patches within the Acrisols, the contrasting characteristics found between them led to the development of significantly different communities. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Amazonian soils and Carbon stock and Dark earth and Land use and Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria and Bacterial Typing Techniques and Biodiversity and Brazil and Charcoal and DNA, Bacterial and Genes, rRNA and Microbial Consortia and Proteobacteria and RNA, Ribosomal, 16S and Sequence Analysis, DNA and Soil Microbiology and Verrucomicrobia and Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria and Bacteria (microorganisms) and Manihot esculenta and Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia and biochar and charcoal and RNA 16S and unclassified drug and Acidobacteria and acrisol and Actinobacteria and Amazonian dark earth soil and article and cassava and community structure and DNA library and forest and gene sequence and microbial community and microbial diversity and nonhuman and phylogeny and population abundance and priority journal and Proteobacteria and pyrosequencing and soil and species composition and species cultivation and Verucomicrobia",10.1007/s10482-013-9942-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84879881000&doi=10.1007%2fs10482-013-9942-0&partnerID=40&md5=f94de5a07bcd2b16da14891468c2170d,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 62,NA,JOUR,2,233,242,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2960

The interference of human activities on the Biosphere is so significant that it has doubled the amount of reactive nitrogen due to industrial fertiliser production (Haber-Bosch), fossil fuel burning and land-use change over the last century. In this context, the Brazilian La Plata Basin contributes to the alteration of the nitrogen cycle in South America because of its huge agricultural and grazing area that meets the demands of its large urban centres - Sao Paulo, for instance - and also external markets abroad. In this paper, we estimate the current inputs and outputs of anthropogenic nitrogen (in kg N.km-2.yr-1) in the basin. In the results, we observe that soybean plays a very important role in the Brazilian La Plata, since it contributes with an annual entrance of about 1.8 TgN due to biological nitrogen fixation. Moreover, our estimate indicates that the export of soybean products accounts for roughly 1.0 TgN which is greater than the annual nitrogen riverine exports from Brazilian Parana, Paraguay and Uruguay rivers together. Complimentarily, we built future scenarios representing changes in the nitrogen cycle profile considering two scenarios of climate change for 2070-2100 (based on IPCC's A2 and B2) that will affect land-use, nitrogen inputs, and loss of such nutrients in the basin.

Deforestation has been a part and parcel of Indonesia's economic development and it is the principal source of Indonesia's large greenhouse gas emissions. Indonesia has committed to curb its greenhouse gas emissions, mostly through reduced deforestation. We assess challenges and options for avoiding deforestation under the decentralized system, using Indonesia's fiscal transfer system. We find that schemes for improving land management and deforestation need to be structured around the interests of local governments and actors. Positive incentives for local governments will need to be created to compensate them for foregone profits and to facilitate alternative development.

The impacts of latex and bark harvesting on the genetic diversity of Himatanthus drasticus (Apocynaceae),Forest Ecology and Management,310,NA,"The importance of genetic variation for maintaining biological diversity and evolutionary processes is widely accepted; however, limited action has been taken to protect genetic diversity in natural populations. Until recently, it was assumed that the exploitation of non-timber forest products, such as fruits, barks and exudates, had low environmental impact, but recognition that the harvesting of these plants can affect several biological levels, including genetic diversity and structure, has been growing. Nevertheless, the effect of harvesting non-timber forest products on the genetic diversity of the harvested species is poorly understood. The objective of this work is to assess the impact of harvesting on the genetic diversity of Himatanthus drasticus (Apocynaceae), a tree of the Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado) that is highly exploited for its medicinal latex. We tested the hypothesis that harvesting can cause a trade-off between survival and reproduction in H. drasticus, reducing the effective population size as well as the genetic diversity in highly exploited populations. The study was conducted in the Araripe National Forest, a preserved Cerrado area in Ceará State, Brazil. We sampled six populations that included two different levels of harvesting (high-harvest and low-harvest) and characterized the genetic diversity and structure in two groups (adults and seedlings) using microsatellite markers. We verified high levels of polymorphism in H. drasticus; however, significant levels of inbreeding in all studied populations were also observed. We found a higher degree of genetic structure in the seedling group when compared with the adult group, a difference that was most likely due to seed rain deposited in nearby locations. No differences were detected in adult genetic diversity levels between populations under different harvesting intensities. However, seedling allelic richness was significantly lower in the high-harvested populations, indicating allelic losses that may be associated with the exploitation of bark and latex. Evidence of genetic loss due to overharvesting was supported by significant bottleneck signatures observed in the seedling group of two out of three high-harvest populations. The establishment of a conservation strategy is imperative to avoid future genetic losses and ensure the long-term viability of H. drasticus populations. The information obtained in this study has been integrated with ecological information about the effects of latex tapping on phenology, demography and biomass recovery of exploited populations, with the goal of proposing a sustainable management plan for the species. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Brazilian Savanna and Cerrado and Janaguba and Non-timber forest products and Sustainable management and Biodiversity and Forest Products and Genes and Harvesting and Himatanthus and Latex and Sustainable Forest Management and Araripe Basin and Brazil and Ceara and Biodiversity and Environmental impact and Forestry and Genes and Latexes and Sustainable development and Brazilian Savanna and Cerrado and Janaguba and Non-timber forest products and Sustainable management and allele and bark and cerrado and conservation genetics and fruit and genetic marker and genetic structure and genetic variation and harvesting and inbreeding and medicinal plant and nontimber forest product and phenology and polymorphism and population size and rubber and seed rain and survival and sustainable development and sustainable forestry and Harvesting,10.1016/j.foreco.2013.08.049,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84884370808&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2013.08.049&partnerID=40&md5=2aea2a1d60f5c46360d4df8586d6fea6,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 11,NA,JOUR,NA,434,441,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2975

To implement appropriate landscape planning for conserving biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, appropriate information is required about parameters of habitat suitability among various anthropogenic habitats with a range of distances to forests and vegetation characteristics, but such information is limited. We examined differences in avian communities between a remnant forest and four types of man-made forest (two mature plantations and two agroforests) in a forest-agricultural landscape of West Java, and we analyzed the effects of both local and landscape factors on various types of species richness in this landscape. The results from non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed avifauna in the two types of agroforest was clustered separately from that in the remnant forest, mainly because drastic declines in the abundance of forest specialists (including IUCN red-listed species) and their replacement with open-habitat generalists. The mixed-tree agroforests were colonized by 30 % of forest specialists and forest-edge species found in the remnant forest, and maintained the highest richness of species endemic to Indonesia among man-made forests, implying that some forest specialists and endemics might have adapted to ancient landscape heterogeneity. High proportion of insectivorous birds was found in the remnant forest (more than 50 %) and drastically decline in man-made forests, although the species richness of insectivores did not decline significantly in broad-leaved plantations. We concluded that protection of remnant forests should be prioritized to conserve forest bird diversity.

Since the annual changes in forest carbon stock under this kind of management are relatively small and often under the canopy, they cannot easily be assessed using remote sensing, so ground-level data collection is likely to be essential over large areas of forests. The potential role of communities in measuring, monitoring and reporting carbon stock changes in their forests has been explicitly mentioned in UNFCCC documentation on methodology for REDD+, the extended form of REDD that includes forest enhancement, sustainable forest management and forest conservation. This book presents practical methods by which communities can do it. These methods were developed and tested with communities in villages in Africa and Asia under a six-year research programme. The reliability of the data gathered by the community is shown to be equivalent to that of professional forest inventories while the costs are much lower. Involvement of local communities in collection of this data may be the most cost-effective solution for national REDD+ programmes. Moreover, it could provide the basis for a transparent system for distribution of the financial rewards from REDD+ and the carbon market. The book first presents the policy context, concepts, methods and general results, which include estimates of typical carbon savings resulting from community management in different types of tropical forests. It also looks at the governance issues that may be involved and a variety of ways in which incentive schemes might be designed to encourage communities to participate. The second half of the book is devoted to case studies from the countries involved in the research. These provide both ideas and practical experience to enable agencies to engage with local communities to monitor carbon stock changes. © Margaret M. Skutsch, 2011. Published by Taylor & Francis.

Each year, tropical forests draw down 15% of global emissions (Trumper et al. 2009), while deforestation and agricultural emissions are responsible for over 20% of global emissions (McKinsey & Company 2009). In Australia, the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector provides the largest abatement opportunity available, accounting for 25% of the country’s total emissions (Australian Government 2010). A recent assessment of GHG abatement potential through change in rural land-use demonstrates for the state of Queensland, the second largest state in Australia, that the overall attainable GHG abatement was 140 Mt CO2e/ yr, or 77% of that state’s emissions (Eady et al. 2009). By 2020 rural land use is projected to offer about 40% of the low-cost emissions reductions opportunity (ClimateWorks Australia 2010).

We measured above- and below-ground carbon stocks as well as the species richness of four groups of plants and eight of animals on 14 representative plots in Sulawesi, Indonesia, ranging from natural rainforest to cacao agroforests that have replaced former natural forest. The conversion of natural forests with carbon stocks of 227-362 Mg C ha-1 to agroforests with 82-211 Mg C ha-1 showed no relationships to overall biodiversity but led to a significant loss of forest-related species richness. We conclude that the conservation of the forest-related biodiversity, and to a lesser degree of carbon stocks, mainly depends on the preservation of natural forest habitats. In the three most carbon-rich agroforestry systems, carbon stocks were about 60% of those of natural forest, suggesting that 1.6 ha of optimally managed agroforest can contribute to the conservation of carbon stocks as much as 1 ha of natural forest. However, agroforestry systems had comparatively low biodiversity, and we found no evidence for a tight link between carbon storage and biodiversity. Yet, potential win-win agroforestry management solutions include combining high shade-tree quality which favours biodiversity with cacao-yield adapted shade levels. © 2012 Kessler et al.",Animals and Biodiversity and Biomass and Cacao and Carbon and Conservation of Natural Resources and Forestry and Indonesia and Soil and Trees and Tropical Climate and carbon and agroforestry and article and biodiversity and cacao and carbon storage and conservation biology and environmental protection and forest management and habitat and Indonesia and landscape and nonhuman and rain forest and shade and species richness,10.1371/journal.pone.0047192,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84867528880&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0047192&partnerID=40&md5=776638cd5308d50c70e92d10b3e937b8,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 51,NA,JOUR,10,NA,NA,NA,OCT 15,1932-6203,WOS:000309995100074,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2990, 5531"

The few studies undertaken on this subject did not include any microbiological survey and interactions between microbiological and physical-chemical attributes to assist in understanding the development of this system. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify microbiological indicators of soil quality that vary with seasonality and physical and chemical characteristics or along a time gradient of four areas-undisturbed forest (NT) and 20 (R20), 10 (R10), and 5 year-old (R05) recovering reforested areas-in two seasons (austral summer and winter). All analyzed soils had a high bulk density, due to mechanization during the course of sugar cane plantation. Lower soil bulk density values were found at NT (1.33gcm-3) and R20 (1.37gcm-3 Macroporosity at NT (0.21m3m-3) was about twice as high than at R20 and R10, and four times higher than at R05. Also, total carbon (TC) and total N (TN) were twice as high at NT in both seasons. NO3-N contents varied according to season and recovery age, being greatest at the NT site and about three times higher in summer. Microbial biomass of carbon (MBC) and urease varied consistently with recovery age, independently of eventual differences in soil physical attributes. Dehydrogenase, in the winter, was most influenced by soil texture. Attributes as humidity and microporosity had a negative influence on dehydrogenase activity and on MBN. Soil bulk density was negatively correlated with the microbial biomass and urease activity. On the other hand, macroporosity had a positive effect on CO2-C evolution, microbial biomass of nitrogen (MBN) and acid phosphatase activity. There was a higher correlation between microbiological attributes, especially between MBC, MBN, and urease or dehydrogenase activity. T-RFLP showed greater similarity of the Bacteria community between NT and R20, only in the summer.

Typically, a PA is at the start of a 'forest transition' gradient. The establishment of a PA influences the whole gradient. We analyzed the temporal patterns of land-use change inside and outside four PAs, with one located in each of Laos, Indonesia, Madagascar and Cameroon. In Laos, in the Viengkham landscape, the rates of conversion of natural forest increased after the designation of the PA and were higher than the spatial baseline predicted. In the three other landscapes, the policies associated with the implementation of PAs increased the conversion rate immediately outside the boundary of the PAs. In Indonesia, in the Bungo landscape, forms of land-use associated with multifunctional agroforestry activities involving rubber trees land-use became the target for conversion to oil palm and monoculture rubber tree crops when the rules on the protection of the remaining natural forest were tightened. We tested a new metric for the degree of integration of forest in multifunctional landscapes which recognizes the surrounding matrix, both as surrogate habitat and as a corridor for tree species. Two important findings were: (i) a 'leakage' zone of influence of at least 10. km around a PA needs to be included for quantification of the deforestation and degradation changes that may be due to forest protection inside the PA and (ii) agroforest and other mixed tree cover can maintain or increase the degree of integration of forest in the multifunctional landscape for biodiversity maintenance and conservation, while providing a source of livelihood for the local people. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Agroforest and Biodiversity conservation and Climate change mitigation and Edge contrast and Habitat edge and Cameroon and Indonesia and Laos and Madagascar and Elaeis and Hevea brasiliensis and agroforestry and biodiversity and climate change and environmental policy and forest management and habitat conservation and land use planning and landscape and policy implementation and protected area,10.1016/j.landusepol.2012.02.006,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858402795&doi=10.1016%2fj.landusepol.2012.02.006&partnerID=40&md5=31aec633793cec276b7c3f7c4158ff77,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 67,NA,JOUR,1,38,56,NA,JAN,0264-8377 and 1873-5754,WOS:000311193400004,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2996, 5461"

This article uses evidence on past debt-for-nature deals and similar debt mechanisms to assess a recent second wave of such swaps. It outlines five typical shortcomings of this form of financial transaction: that they often fail to deliver additional resources to the debtor country and/or debtor government budget; often fail to deliver more resources for conservation/climate purposes; often have a negligible effect on overall debt burdens (and, as such, do not generate more 'indirect' benefits); and are often in conflict with principles of alignment with government policy and alignment with government systems (these two last shortcomings being important elements within the new aid delivery paradigm). Our analysis is applied to a recent debt-for-nature swap between the United States and Indonesia. We show that this case, which we consider a litmus test for current swap practice, performs unevenly across the five shortcomings. First, although the US-Indonesian swap does increase available resources to Indonesia at the country level, it does not generate extra budgetary room for the Indonesian government. Second, the extent to which the resources provided by the swap are additional to other donor support and reserved domestic budget lines for conservation goals is unclear. Third, the swap is too insignificant to create indirect (positive) economic effects. Regarding alignment issues, fourth, the swap is very much in line with current national policy, but, fifth, appears at odds with the new aid delivery paradigm's insistence on system alignment. We argue that if a second generation of debt-for-nature swaps is to be pursued then they need to avoid the common pitfalls associated with this form of finance. Moreover, there is a need to debate broader ways of linking debt service repayments to climate mitigation and adaptation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Conservation International and Debt swaps and Forest conservation and Indonesia and United States and Indonesia and United States and adaptive management and climate change and conservation management and debt and economic impact and environmental economics and governance approach and mitigation and precipitation (climatology) and resource availability,10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2010.10.001,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78751701414&doi=10.1016%2fj.gloenvcha.2010.10.001&partnerID=40&md5=5ae74246817ef8e884fecd3cf54cb137,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 42,NA,JOUR,1,93,102,NA,FEB,0959-3780 and 1872-9495,WOS:000293811200012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","3005, 5297"

Drainage, deforestation and peat fires are the main reasons for the release of huge amounts of carbon from peatlands. Successful restoration of degraded tropical peatlands is of high interest due to their huge carbon store and sequestration potential. The blocking of drainage canals by dam building has become one of the most important measures to restore the hydrology and the ecological function of the peat domes. This study investigates the capability of using multitemporal radar remote sensing imagery for monitoring the hydrological effects of these measures. The study area is the former Mega Rice Project area in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, where peat drainage and forest degradation is especially intense. Restoration measures started in July 2004 by building 30 large dams until June 2008. We applied change detection analysis with more than 80 ENVISAT ASAR and ALOS PALSAR images, acquired between 2004 and 2009. Radar signal increases of up to 1.36 dB show that high frequency multitemporal radar satellite imagery can be used to detect an increase in peat soil moisture after dam construction, especially in deforested areas with a high density of dams. Furthermore, a strong correlation between cross-polarised radar backscatter coefficients and groundwater levels above -50 cm was found.

It also describes the current uses and the scale of economic benefits derived from planting Australian acacias, and speculates about possible future trends in usage. This information is crucial for the evaluation of overall human-mediated transfers of Australian acacias as a global experiment in biogeography. Location Australia and Global. Methods ATSC databases were used to determine which taxa were sent to which regions of the world and in what numbers. Location, scale and value of uses of the most important species were described from a review of published and grey literature, and we drew on our collective experience to speculate about future trends. Results The ATSC despatched samples of 322 taxa (or roughly a third of Acacia species native to Australia) between 1980 and 2010 to 149 countries. Plantations in SE Asia and South Africa supplying the pulp and paper industry cover an area of over 2Mha and produce pulp worth around $US4.3B p.a. In SE Asia, pulpwood species also provide logs for an expanding industry based on solid wood product. Tannin is produced from Acacia mearnsii in South Africa and Brazil. A suite of multi-purpose species helps meeting the demand for food, fodder, fuelwood, poles and site amelioration in dry zone regions of Africa and elsewhere and are widely incorporated into agro-forestry systems. Acacia saligna is the most widely planted non-timber species with around 600,000ha established worldwide. Many acacia species also have horticultural uses particularly in Europe. Main conclusions The ATSC has been the major agent for systematic exploration and worldwide dissemination of Australian acacias over the past 30 years, but seed from local and regional sources of exploited species will dominate future movements. The scale of production from currently planted species will expand to meet the demands of population growth, using improved varieties. Plantations for energy and carbon sequestration might become increasingly widespread. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Australian acacias and Fuelwood and Horticulture and Pulpwood plantations and Site ameliora-tion and Solid wood plantations and Australia and Acacia and Acacia mearnsii and Acacia saligna and Animalia and agroforestry and carbon sequestration and database and economic impact and fodder and food and fuelwood and future prospect and global perspective and horticulture and human activity and land reclamation and legume and natural resource and phytogeography and phytoremediation and population growth and pulp and paper industry and tannin and wood,10.1111/j.1472-4642.2011.00814.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79961151669&doi=10.1111%2fj.1472-4642.2011.00814.x&partnerID=40&md5=5eec9f58167abc2f56d9c44d964a3405,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 137,NA,JOUR,5,837,847,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,3015

Agricultural expansion has driven rapid economic development but has also had major impacts on biodiversity and the conservation of ecosystem services in the country. 2.Here, we analyse recent advances in applied ecological research on the consequences of agricultural expansion for biodiversity in Brazil, identify knowledge gaps, and discuss how ecological science can help guide the development of more sustainable agricultural systems. 3.The majority of native vegetation in Brazilian biomes is found within private lands, emphasizing the importance of recent reforms to the Brazilian Forest Act legislation. Using the example of the Forest Act, we critically assess the extent to which ecological research has provided guidance for policy decisions to date. We identify important knowledge gaps regarding the ecological impacts of agricultural expansion in Brazil and the general disconnection between ecological science and environmental policy processes. 4.Synthesis and applications. Increased efforts are needed from both researchers and policy makers to engage from the earliest stage possible in the identification, assessment and communication of environmental issues and possible management solutions.

The importance of organic carbon to the physical, chemical, and biological aspects of soil quality is well recognized. However, total organic carbon measurements might not be sensitive indicators of changes in soil quality. Adoption of procedures that can extract the more labile fraction preferentially might be a more useful approach for the characterization of soil organic carbon resulting from different soils. This study aimed to evaluate organic carbon (C) fractions distribution in different soil layers up to 50 cm depth in two soil orders under cacao (Theobromacacao) agroforestry systems (AFS) in Bahia, Brazil. Soil samples were collected from four depth classes (0-5, 5-10, 10-30 and 30-50 cm) under two cacao agroforestry systems (30-year-old stands of cacao with Erythrina glauca, as shade trees) in Latosol and Cambisol, in Bahia, Brazil. The determination of oxidizable carbon by a modified Walkley-Black method was done to obtain four C fractions with different labile forms of C (fraction 1: labile fraction; fraction 2: moderate labile fraction; fraction 3: low labile fraction and fraction 4: recalcitrant fraction). Overall, at two cacao AFS, the C fractions generally declined with increase in soil depth. The C fractions 1 and 2 were 50% higher on upper layers (0-5 and 5-10 cm). More than 50% of organic C was found in more labile fraction (fraction 1) in all depths for both soils. High value of C fraction 1 (more labile C)-to-total organic C ratio was obtained (around 54-59%, on Latosol and Cambisol, respectively), indicating large input of organic matter in these soils. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Cacao and Carbon quality and Carbon sequestration and Erythrina glauca and Labile carbon and Bahia and Brazil and Erythrina fusca and Theobroma cacao and agricultural trade and agroforestry and Cambisol and carbon sequestration and evergreen tree and legume and organic carbon and oxidation and soil carbon and soil chemistry and soil depth and soil organic matter and soil quality,10.1007/s10457-010-9300-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79951768438&doi=10.1007%2fs10457-010-9300-4&partnerID=40&md5=71b5a8ae04dc593c610f5537f7bc5ae1,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 85,NA,JOUR,3,213,220,NA,MAR,0167-4366 and 1572-9680,WOS:000287500200004,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","3023, 5377"

The level of uncertainty in historic carbon emissions estimates is also critical for REDD+, since high uncertainties could limit climate benefits from credited mitigation actions. Here, we analyzed source data uncertainties based on the range of available deforestation, forest degradation, and forest carbon stock estimates for the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso during 1990-2008.Results: Deforestation estimates showed good agreement for multi-year periods of increasing and decreasing deforestation during the study period. However, annual deforestation rates differed by > 20% in more than half of the years between 1997-2008, even for products based on similar input data. Tier 2 estimates of average forest carbon stocks varied between 99-192 Mg C ha -1, with greatest differences in northwest Mato Grosso. Carbon stocks in deforested areas increased over the study period, yet this increasing trend in deforested biomass was smaller than the difference among carbon stock datasets for these areas.Conclusions: Estimates of source data uncertainties are essential for REDD+. Patterns of spatial and temporal disagreement among available data products provide a roadmap for future efforts to reduce source data uncertainties for estimates of historic forest carbon emissions. Specifically, regions with large discrepancies in available estimates of both deforestation and forest carbon stocks are priority areas for evaluating and improving existing estimates. Full carbon accounting for REDD+ will also require filling data gaps, including forest degradation and secondary forest, with annual data on all forest transitions. © 2011 Morton et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Amazon and Approach and Ipcc and Landsat and Redd+ and Tier and Amazonia and Brazil and Mato Grosso and biomass and carbon emission and carbon sequestration and conservation management and data set and deforestation and forest management and Landsat and secondary forest and sustainable development and uncertainty analysis,10.1186/1750-0680-6-18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84855179735&doi=10.1186%2f1750-0680-6-18&partnerID=40&md5=75cfc94789741df63bde2e5eeeac325d,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 19,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,3025

Under the existing treaty, the Kyoto Protocol and its “flexible mechanisms” - particularly the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) - have succeeded in building a billion dollar market for emission reduction projects in developing countries. Since the decision to include efforts to reduce emissions from tropical deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) in the 2007 Bali Action Plan, considerable attention has focused on designing a REDD and REDD+ program for inclusion in the next global climate agreement. The positions taken by different countries on REDD are driven by their circumstances - from those with large areas of standing forest to those with few remaining forests, from those facing rapid rates of deforestation to those engaged in reforestation. The overarching issues to be decided in developing the framework of a REDD mechanism include: the scope of the forestry activities to be covered; the scale of accounting for forestry activities and the baseline for measuring reference emissions levels; the type of financing to be provided for REDD activities; how to address fundamental issues of capacity and governance; and the consideration of co-benefits. There is some convergence around the scope of a REDD mechanism, the need to ultimately undertake activities at a national scale, the likelihood that financing will be both fund and market based, and the potential to implement REDD in phases. However, many contentious issues remain, including how to set baselines and accounting rules for REDD/REDD+ and how to incorporate governance concerns. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.",Commerce and Deforestation and Developing countries and Emission control and Reforestation and Timber and Clean Development Mechanism and Emission reduction and Flexible mechanisms and Forest degradation and Global climates and Reference emissions levels and Tropical deforestation and Tropical forest and Forestry,10.1007/978-94-007-2232-3_18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84955700116&doi=10.1007%2f978-94-007-2232-3_18&partnerID=40&md5=a5773fb464bae199850c271d39c10c22,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 1,NA,CHAP,NA,377,387,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,3029

This study aimed to evaluate the long-term effects (19 years) of tillage (CT-conventional tillage and NT-no tillage) and crop rotations (R0-monoculture system, R1-winter crop rotation, and R2-intensive crop rotation) on total, particulate and mineralassociated organic carbon (C) stocks of an originally degraded Red Oxisol in Cruz Alta, RS, Southern Brazil. The climate is humid subtropical Cfa 2a (Köppen classification), the mean annual precipitation 1,774 mm and mean annual temperature 19.2 °C. The plots were divided into four segments, of which each was sampled in the layers 0-0.05, 0.05-0.10, 0.10-0.20, and 0.20-0.30 m. Sampling was performed manually by opening small trenches. The SOM pools were determined by physical fractionation. Soil C stocks had a linear relationship with annual crop C inputs, regardless of the tillage systems. Thus, soil disturbance had a minor effect on SOM turnover. In the 0-0.30 m layer, soil C sequestration ranged from 0 to 0.51 Mg ha-1 yr-1, using the CT R0 treatment as base-line; crop rotation systems had more influence on soil stock C than tillage systems. The mean C sequestration rate of the cropping systems was 0.13 Mg ha-1 yr-1 higher in NT than CT. This result was associated to the higher C input by crops due to the improvement in soil quality under long-term no-tillage. The particulate C fraction was a sensitive indicator of soil management quality, while mineral-associated organic C was the main pool of atmospheric C fixed in this clayey Oxisol. The C retention in this stable SOM fraction accounts for 81 and 89 % of total C sequestration in the treatments NT R1 and NT R2, respectively, in relation to the same cropping systems under CT. The highest C management index was observed in NT R2, confirming the capacity of this soil management practice to improve the soil C stock qualitatively in relation to CT R0.

The Cerrado is the second largest biome of Brazil and one of the most threatened savanna ecosystems. 3.Here, we use dung beetles (Scarabaeinae) to investigate the effects of the land-use changes associated to afforestation on Cerrado insect biodiversity. We sampled dung beetles in candeia (4- and 6-year-old) and eucalyptus plantations (1- and 4-year-old), natural candeia formations (candeiais), native grasslands and natural forests. 4.Dung beetle diversity in plantations was lower than in grasslands and forests, but was not different from diversity in natural candeiais. Candeia and 1-year-old eucalyptus plantations, grasslands and natural candeiais all had similar community composition, distinct from natural forests. Four-year-old eucalyptus plantations were intermediate between those two groups. Overall, afforestation was detrimental for dung beetles. 5.Differences between exotic and native plantations were only apparent in older plantations, and seemed to be due to differences associated to canopy openness rather than to the origin of the planted species. Candeia plantations were of better conservation value for open-area species (62% species shared between grasslands and candeia plantation) whereas eucalyptus plantations were so for forest species (26% species shared between forests and eucalyptus plantations).

Three Oxisols (sandy, loamy, and clayey) under 14-year-old eucalypt (Eucalytus camaldulensis Dehnh.) coppice stands and native cerrado vegetation were sampled to a depth of 1m, in order to assess whether soil texture controls SOC response to afforestation in central Brazil. Both SOC concentration and stocks were proportional to contents of clay+silt to 1m depth, with no effect of eucalypt plantation. However, there was a 40% decrease in water-stable aggregates of 2-8mm size in all soils under eucalypt stands in the 0-0.05m depth, which probably helped to release occluded particulate organic matter (POM) into free POM. In the 0-0.05m depth, SOC partition throughout particle-size fractions (sand, silt, and clay) was unaltered in the loamy and clayey Oxisols, whereas in the sandy Oxisol, clay-bound SOC strongly decreased simultaneously with a strong increase in free POM. As free POM is often more susceptible to decay than clay-bound SOC, this change suggests a higher susceptibility to SOC change in sandy soils. Soil respiration in the 0-0.05m depth was more strongly correlated with the mean weight diameter and clay+silt contents than with SOC and nitrogen concentrations, with no effect of eucalypt plantation. In conclusion, soil texture affects total SOC retention and soil respiration, with little or no effect of eucalypt plantation. However, decreased aggregation and lower POM occlusion occurred in all soils planted with eucalyptus, suggesting that SOC levels in eucalypt plantations can be better conserved with less intensive soil preparation practices, especially in coarse-textured soils. © CSIRO 2011.",carbon partitioning and carbon storage in soil and forest soils and soil respiration. and Brazil and Eucalyptus and Biological materials and Carbon and Reforestation and Silt and Textures and Carbon partitioning and Cerrado and Coarse-textured soils and Eucalypt plantations and forest soils and Mean weight diameter and Nitrogen concentrations and Oxisols and Particle-size fractions and Particulate organic matters and Sandy soils and Silt contents and Soil organic C and Soil preparation and Soil property and soil respiration. and Soil textures and afforestation and aggregation and biomass and carbon sequestration and cerrado and clay and coppice and evergreen forest and forest soil and loam and native species and organic carbon and Oxisol and particle size and partitioning and plantation forestry and silt and soil aggregate and soil organic matter and soil property and soil respiration and soil texture and Organic carbon,10.1071/SR11264,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-81855203451&doi=10.1071%2fSR11264&partnerID=40&md5=92ee2b28efb45ec5aa51f1123bda586d,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 30,NA,JOUR,7,614,624,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,3035

This increase primarily results from the burning of fossil fuels and the conversion of tropical forests to agriculture, with concomitant negative impacts upon the global climate. Agricultural activities account for about 13.5 per cent of total anthropogenic GHG emissions (Rogner et al, 2007) and release mainly nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) (about 45 per cent of agricultural GHG emissions each), with CO2 accounting for the remaining share (Baumert et al, 2005). Agricultural N2O and CH4 emissions are expected to increase by 35 to 60 per cent in 2030 due to increased nitrogen fertilizer use, animal manure production and livestock numbers. In contrast, CO2 emissions are likely to remain at the same level due to stable or declining deforestation rates, and increased adoption of conservation tillage practices (Smith et al, 2007). Mitigating agricultural GHGs can be achieved by reducing emissions through more efficient management of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) flows and by enhancing C storage in soil and vegetation (Smith et al, 2007). Agroforestry systems (AFS) are one means by which the impacts of climate change can be mitigated. The role that AFS play can be increased through payment for ecosystem services (PES) systems that reduce agricultural emissions and increase the quantity of carbon stored. Carbon sequestration (or atmospheric CO2 removal) as an ecosystem service of AFS is generally quantified as the amount of C stored in trees. Nevertheless, increasing tree density in agroforests may also modify soil fluxes of N2O or CH4, which have a global warming potential (GWP) 298 and 25 times higher than CO2, respectively (Forster et al, 2007). Nitrogen-fixing species used as shade trees (e.g. in coffee plantations) may increase soil emissions of N2O (Hergoualc’h et al, 2008) and reduce the soil CH4 sink (Palm et al, 2002). © Bruno Rapidel, Fabrice DeClerck, Jean-François Le Coq and John Beer 2011.",NA,10.4324/9781849775656-11,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123133011&doi=10.4324%2f9781849775656-11&partnerID=40&md5=624a42db46760d1c68dc465fd71c1324,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,CHAP,NA,19,36,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,3036

A spatially explicit analysis along the Transamazon Highway in Brazil,Forest Ecology and Management,267,NA,"Understanding actor-specific responsibility for deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is key in adjusting policy and resource allocation in the face of current forest destruction. However, previous research shows that there is great variability in such assessments. To contribute to the ongoing discussions on forest conservation and rural development policies in the Amazon, this paper studies actor-specific deforestation and its environmental effects in four municipalities situated along the Transamazon Highway. We used spatially explicit methods that integrate a database of 8281 georeferenced properties with a time series of remote-sensing data covering four periods between 1986 and 2007. We also included landscape ecology metrics as improved indicators of the complex environmental effects of forest fragmentation. The analysis demonstrates that smallholders (defined as colonists who own less than 100ha of land) were responsible for 23% of total deforestation in the study region while accounting for 55% of the total properties. We also explored the relationship between property size and deforestation at the property level, finding that it closely follows a power distribution. Property deforestation increased with property size, while the percentage of property deforestation decreased. In spite of this, compliance with current legal requirements to maintain 50% of property forest cover was not statistically different between smallholders and largeholders. In comparison to municipalities dominated by medium- and large-scale ranchers, the smallholder-dominated municipality of Medicilândia showed better performance in all applied landscape metrics with well-established relationships with the provision of important environmental goods and services. Although all studied municipalities showed severe accumulated deforestation, Medicilândia experienced an abrupt decrease in municipal deforestation after 1999 to just 0.03%year -1, while municipalities dominated by larger holders maintained or increased their previous deforestation rates to between 0.90% and 1.34%year -1 in the same period. This indicates that the smallholders' productions schemes in our study area might present potential for agricultural frontier stabilization based on improved land-use efficiency. The policy implications of our findings are discussed, especially with regard to the role of smallholders in productive forest conservation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Amazon and Cattle ranching and Deforestation and Landscape ecology and Property size and Smallholders and Brazil and Conservation and Deforestation and Ecology and Planning and Remote Sensing and Amazonia and Brazil and Bos and Conservation and Ecology and Public policy and Regional planning and Remote sensing and Rural areas and Amazon and Cattle ranching and Landscape ecology and Property size and Smallholders and cattle and conservation management and database and deforestation and ecosystem service and environmental effect and environmental indicator and environmental protection and forest management and land use and landscape ecology and livestock farming and nature-society relations and property market and remote sensing and resource allocation and rural development and rural policy and smallholder and Deforestation,10.1016/j.foreco.2011.11.046,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84255195504&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2011.11.046&partnerID=40&md5=4af1ac11076565fe4a44d965e67518e0,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 94,NA,JOUR,NA,58,73,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,3038

However, increasing political support following the “2007 Bali Action Plan” for reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD), which was spearheaded by developing countries themselves, as well as scientific evidence about the current emissions from tropical forests surpassing those of the global transportation sector has led to a consensus that a post Kyoto architecture will expand to include forest activities excluded under the CDM. The positions taken by different countries on what is now referred to as “REDD+” are often explained by the condition, and state, of their own forests. The overarching issues to be decided in developing the framework of a REDD+ mechanism include: the scope of the forestry activities to be covered; the scale of accounting for forestry activities and the baseline for measuring reference emissions levels; the type of financing to be provided for REDD+ activities; how to address fundamental issues of capacity and governance; and the consideration of co-benefits. Many of these remain contentious so that the role of REDD+ in addressing tropical forest challenges remains uncertain Despite the many different interests of the countries seeking to take part in a REDD+ mechanism and their different positions, it is possible summarize what is known and what is not known about the key components of a REDD+ mechanism and where the debate stands on these issues as of the fall of 2010. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.",Climate change and Commerce and Deforestation and Developing countries and Emission control and Gas emissions and Industrial emissions and Reforestation and Timber and Tropics and Clean Development Mechanism and Climate Change Agreements and Emission reduction and Flexible mechanisms and Reducing emissions and Reference emissions levels and Scientific evidence and Transportation sector and Forestry,10.1007/978-94-007-2232-3_17,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84955706727&doi=10.1007%2f978-94-007-2232-3_17&partnerID=40&md5=ee952e329f4fee7cb1f9df1509679ba1,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 4,NA,CHAP,NA,357,376,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,3044

The importance of bacteria and fungi in regulating nutrient cycles has led to an interest in their diversity and composition in mangroves. However, very few studies have assessed Archaea in mangroves, and virtually nothing is known about whether mangrove rhizospheres affect archaeal diversity and composition. Here, we studied the diversity and composition of Archaea in mangrove bulk sediment and the rhizospheres of two mangrove trees, Rhizophora mangle and Laguncularia racemosa, using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and pyrosequencing of archaeal 16S rRNA genes with a nested-amplification approach. DGGE profiles revealed significant structural differences between bulk sediment and rhizosphere samples, suggesting that roots of both mangrove species influence the sediment archaeal community. Nearly all of the detected sequences obtained with pyrosequencing were identified as Archaea, but most were unclassified at the level of phylum or below. Archaeal richness was, furthermore, the highest in the L. racemosa rhizosphere, intermediate in bulk sediment, and the lowest in the R. mangle rhizosphere. This study shows that rhizosphere microhabitats of R. mangle and L. racemosa, common plants in subtropical mangroves located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, hosted distinct archaeal assemblages. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.","Archaea and Biodiversity and Brazil and Cluster Analysis and Combretaceae and Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis and DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic and DNA, Archaeal and DNA, Ribosomal and Genes, rRNA and Molecular Sequence Data and Phylogeny and Plant Roots and Rhizophoraceae and Rhizosphere and RNA, Archaeal and RNA, Ribosomal, 16S and Sequence Analysis, DNA and Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid and Brazil and Rio de Janeiro [Brazil] and Archaea and Fungi and Laguncularia racemosa and Rhizophora mangle and Rhizophoraceae and Electrophoresis and Genes and Microorganisms and Nutrients and RNA and Sedimentology and Sediments and archaeal DNA and archaeal RNA and ribosome DNA and RNA 16S and 16S rRNA gene and Archaea and Archaeal and Denaturing gradient gel electrophoreses (DGGE) and Laguncularia racemosa and Mangrove sediments and Mangrove species and Mangrove tree and Microhabitats and Nutrient cycle and Pyrosequencing and Sediment flux and Structural differences and bacterium and electrokinesis and fungus and mangrove and nutrient cycling and open ocean and rhizosphere and sampling and species diversity and species richness and archaeon and article and biodiversity and Brazil and chemistry and classification and cluster analysis and Combretaceae and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and DNA barcoding and DNA sequence and genetics and isolation and purification and microbiology and molecular genetics and nucleotide sequence and phylogeny and plant root and Rhizophoraceae and rhizosphere and RNA gene and sequence homology and Soils",10.1128/AEM.00386-12,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84866146323&doi=10.1128%2fAEM.00386-12&partnerID=40&md5=c7daacc0956b87849fd5e350b2e69cbd,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 221,NA,JOUR,16,5520,5528,NA,AUG,0099-2240 and 1098-5336,WOS:000307139500006,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","3046, 3501"

We investigated the diversity of rumen methanogens in Mediterranean water buffaloes maintained in Brazil under different diets: corn silage, grazing pasture, or sugar cane.

The 467 clones were assigned to 19 species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Four OTUs were represented in all three libraries, eight OTUs were library-specific, six OTUs were found in only the corn silage and pasture grazing libraries, and one OTU was shared only between pasture grazing and sugar cane libraries. We found that Methanobrevibacter-related sequences were the most abundant in the water buffaloes sampled for our analysis, in contrast to previously reported studies showing that Methanomicrobium mobile-like methanogens were the most abundant methanogens in water buffaloes of Murrah and Surti breeds sampled in India.

SESA grasslands have a rich avifauna that includes 22 globally threatened and near-threatened species, and many other species have suffered local population extinctions and range reductions. In addition to habitat loss and fragmentation, grassland birds in SESA are threatened by improper use of agrochemicals, unfavorable fire management regimes, pollution, and illegal capture and hunting. Studies to date have provided information about the distribution of grassland birds, the threats populations face, and the habitat requirements of some threatened species, but more information is needed concerning dispersal and migration patterns, genetics, and factors that influence habitat use and species survival in both natural and agricultural landscapes. There are few public protected areas in the region (1% of original grasslands), and many populations of threatened grassland birds are found on private lands. Therefore, efforts to preserve grassland habitat must reconcile the interests of land owners and conservationists. Current conservation efforts include establishment of public and private reserves, promotion of agricultural activities that reconcile production with biodiversity conservation, development of multilateral conservation projects across countries, and elaboration of action plans. Measures that result in significant losses to private land owners should include economic compensation, and use of economic incentives to promote agriculture and forestry in native grassland areas should be discouraged, especially in priority areas for grassland birds. Although more studies are needed, some actions, particularly habitat protection and improved management of public and private lands, should be taken immediately to improve the conservation status of grassland birds in SESA. © 2012 The Authors.

In this study we used a chronosequence of advancing (19-62-yr old) Atlantic forest regeneration following slash-and-burn agriculture to infer successional shifts in seed rain in terms of seed density, species richness, taxonomic and functional composition, and local spatial distribution. After monitoring seed rain during 12 months in 60 1-m 2 seed traps, we recorded over 400,000 seeds belonging to 180 morphospecies. From early to late-successional stage, seed rain decreased in density, increased in per capita species richness, gradually changed in species composition, and became less aggregated spatially. Regardless the age of forest stand, vertebrate-dispersed seeds accounted for 67-75% of all species recorded. Large-seeded species typical of old-growth forests, on the other hand, accounted for only 5-8% of the species recorded in the seed rain, a proportion around five times smaller than that reported for the old-growth forests of the same study site (31%). Our results suggest that the secondary forests considered, which are embedded in one of the largest (3500 ha) and best preserved remnant of the severely fragmented Atlantic forest of Northeast Brazil, may fail attaining older successional stages due to the reduced availability of large-seeded late-successional species. This regeneration constraint may be even stronger in smaller, more isolated forest remnants of the region, potentially reducing their ability to provide ecosystem services. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.",Forest disturbance and Habitat fragmentation and Resilience and Secondary forest and Seed rain and Slash-and-burn agriculture and Atlantic Forest and Brazil and Vertebrata and chronosequence and ecosystem resilience and ecosystem service and environmental disturbance and habitat fragmentation and old-growth forest and regeneration and secondary forest and seed rain and shifting cultivation and spatial distribution and species richness and succession,10.1016/j.actao.2011.12.002,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84855426307&doi=10.1016%2fj.actao.2011.12.002&partnerID=40&md5=5545c06da71b239e3e85aab5fb97e702,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 38,NA,JOUR,NA,61,66,NA,FEB,1146-609X and 1873-6238,WOS:000302832700008,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","3074, 4794"

External co-investment-e.g., through incentives from programs to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) and eco-certification-needs to synergize with local efforts by understanding local dynamics and conditions for free and prior informed consent. We assessed the perceptions and behavior of rubber agroforest farmers under existing conservation agreements as a step toward institutionalized reward schemes for agro-biodiversity using questionnaires and role-playing games (RPG). To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply such a combination of methods to explore the perceptions of payments for environmental services (PES). Results revealed a strong conservation belief system and social norms in the research site, with indications that individual interest in converting old rubber agroforest to oil palm, with consequent private gain and loss of local social agro-biodiversity benefits, is suppressed in the social context of a role-playing game. In the game, all financial bids by external agents to secure an oil palm foothold in the village, were rejected despite indications of declining income in the village. Agents promoting an eco-certification scheme in the RPG had success and the responses obtained in the game can assist in the actual rollout of such a scheme without creating unrealistic expectations of its financial benefits.

Foremost among the challenges is quantifying nation's carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation, which requires information on forest carbon storage. Here we estimated carbon storage in India's forest biomass for the years 2003, 2005 and 2007 and the net flux caused by deforestation and degradation, between two assessment periods i.e., Assessment Period first (ASP I), 2003-2005 and Assessment Period second (ASP II), 2005-2007.Results: The total estimated carbon stock in India's forest biomass varied from 3325 to 3161 Mt during the years 2003 to 2007 respectively. There was a net flux of 372 Mt of CO 2 in ASP I and 288 Mt of CO 2 in ASP II, with an annual emission of 186 and 114 Mt of CO 2 respectively. The carbon stock in India's forest biomass decreased continuously from 2003 onwards, despite slight increase in forest cover. The rate of carbon loss from the forest biomass in ASP II has dropped by 38.27% compared to ASP I.Conclusion: With the Copenhagen Accord, India along with other BASIC countries China, Brazil and South Africa is voluntarily going to cut emissions. India will voluntary reduce the emission intensity of its GDP by 20-25% by 2020 in comparison to 2005 level, activities like REDD+ can provide a relatively cost-effective way of offsetting emissions, either by increasing the removals of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by afforestation programmes, managing forests, or by reducing emissions through deforestation and degradation. © 2011 Sheikh et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Brazil and China and India and South Africa and afforestation and carbon dioxide and carbon emission and carbon flux and carbon sequestration and climate change and deforestation and emission control and emission inventory and environmental degradation and forest cover and greenhouse gas and Gross Domestic Product and physical geography and phytomass,10.1186/1750-0680-6-15,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84155191005&doi=10.1186%2f1750-0680-6-15&partnerID=40&md5=38c63cf5f7526a9e8aeb68410a02c10f,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 52,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,3097

Efforts are therefore required to try to minimize further degradation and restore tropical forests in a sustainable way. This is the first research-based book to examine this problem in East Africa. The specific focus is on the forests of Ethiopia, Tanzania and Uganda, but the lessons learned are shown to be applicable to neighbouring countries and others in the tropics. A wide range of forest types are covered, from dry Miombo forest and afromontane forests, to forest-savannah mosaics and wet forest types.

The objective of this study was to identify structural and floristic patterns in secondary forests generated in abandoned fields with varying historic uses. Changes in vegetation were surveyed using chronosequences from 2 to 70 years. Stands with different land use histories in three areas of northern Misiones, Argentina, were considered. Adults (DBH ≥ 10 cm), saplings (3 ≥ DBH < 10 cm), seedlings (DBH < 3 cm and height ≥ 50 cm) and non-arboreous vegetation (herbaceous plants and shrubs) were surveyed. Data was analyzed using multivariate techniques (TWINSPAN, Detrended Correspondence Analysis, Cluster Analysis, and Kruskal-Wallis test). In the floristic analysis, two main forest groups were identified: one made up of primary forest and oldest secondary forest (>20 years), and another of the youngest secondary forests (<20 years). Basal area and density of individuals (seedlings, saplings, and adults) rapidly increased during the first two decades, and subsequently the adult category reached values comparable to those of mature forests (32 m2/ha and 850 individuals/ha). During the early years of succession, the forests showed floristic and structural differences related to history of use previous to abandonment; abandoned annual crops showed the greatest densities of saplings and seedlings, while abandoned pastures presented only individuals in the seedling category, and at very low densities. In stands analyzed since the beginning of succession, species of several ecological groups were present (pioneer, initial secondary, late secondary), while climax species appeared only in the seedling category, and in abandoned pastures no species of the later groups were recorded. Our results suggest that differences recorded during the early years of regeneration in sites with varying historic uses may be generated mainly by remnant vegetation at the time of abandonment of the fields (grasses and remnant monoculture plants). After 20 years of succession, it was no longer possible to differentiate the forests structurally or floristically, regardless of age or historic use of each stand. Due to their rapid regeneration capacity, the forests studied play an important role from the start of the successional process in heterogeneous anthropogenic landscapes such as that of Misiones, and contribute to maintaining biodiversity while providing numerous environmental services. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

First, we briefly characterize the savanna ecosystem and summarize the main published data on C stocks under natural conditions. The effects of increased land use pressure in the Cerrado and current uncertainties of estimations of changes in land cover and land use are reviewed next. Thereafter, we focus on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics due to changes in land use, particularly conversion to pastures and soybean-based cropping systems, and effects of management practices such as soil fertilization, crop rotations and tillage practices. Most studies considered here suggest that more intensive agriculture, which include no-till practices and the implementation of best or recommended management practices (RMP), reduces SOC losses after land use conversion from conventional tillage-based, monocropping systems; however, these studies focussed on the first 0.3 m of soil, or less, and seldom considered full carbon accounting. To better estimate possible global warming mitigation with agriculture in the Cerrado more comprehensive studies are needed that analyse fluxes of the biogenic greenhouse gases (GHG; CO2, N2O and CH4) to determine the net global warming potential (GWP). Follow up studies should include the application of an integrated modelling system, comprised of a Geographic Information System (GIS) linked to dynamic modelling tools, to analyse SOC dynamics and make projections for possible changes in net C flows in the Cerrado region upon defined changes in soil use and management. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It was evaluated the influence of ""Aroeira"", whose density in the area was 140 trees/ha, on the following parameters of the B. brizantha cv.

The tree component, composed of the tree species M. urundeuva in the experimental density adopted, increased dry matter and crude protein of the forage mass harvest above stubble height, without affecting the concentration of neutral detergent fibre or acid detergent fibre, thus causing dry matter and organic matter in vitro degradability as well as effective degradability of the forage grass to remain the same as those obtained in full sun.

The aim of this study was to quantify soil C sequestration, through the evaluation of the changes in C stocks, as well as the GHG fluxes (N2O and CH4) during the process of conversion of Cerrado into agricultural land in the southwestern Amazon region, comparing no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) systems. We collected samples from soils and made gas flux measurements in July 2004 (the dry season) and in January 2005 (the wet season) at six areas: Cerrado, CT cultivated with rice for 1 year (1CT) and 2 years (2CT), and NT cultivated with soybean for 1 year (1NT), 2 years (2NT) and 3 years (3NT), in each case after a 2-year period of rice under CT. Soil samples were analyzed in both seasons for total organic C and bulk density. The soil C stocks, corrected for a mass of soil equivalent to the 0-30-cm layer under Cerrado, indicated that soils under NT had generally higher C storage compared to native Cerrado and CT soils. The annual C accumulation rate in the conversion of rice under CT into soybean under NT was 0.38 Mg ha-1 year-1. Although CO2 emissions were not used in the C sequestration estimates to avoid double counting, we did include the fluxes of this gas in our discussion. In the wet season, CO2 emissions were twice as high as in the dry season and the highest N2O emissions occurred under the NT system. There were no CH4 emissions to the atmosphere (negative fluxes) and there were no significant seasonal variations. When N2O and CH4 emissions in C-equivalent were subtracted (assuming that the measurements made on 4 days were representative of the whole year), the soil C sequestration rate of the conversion of rice under CT into soybean under NT was 0.23 Mg ha-1 year-1.

Extensive peatland areas in Southeast Asia have been degraded through deforestation, drainage and fire, leading to on- and off-site environmental and socio-economic impacts of local to global significance. To address these problems, landscape-scale restoration measures are urgently required. This paper reviews and illustrates, using information from on-going trials in Kalimantan, Indonesia, the current state of knowledge pertaining to (i) land-cover dynamics of degraded peatlands, (ii) vegetation rehabilitation, (iii) restoration of hydrology, (iv) rehabilitation of carbon sequestration and storage, and (v) promotion of sustainable livelihoods for local communities. For a 4500 km2 study site in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, we show a 78% reduction in forest cover between 1973 and 2003 and demonstrate that fire, exacerbated by drainage, is the principal driver of land-use change. Progressive vegetation succession follows infrequent, low-intensity fires, but repeated and high-intensity fires result in retrogressive succession towards non-forest communities. Re-wetting the peat is an important key to vegetation restoration and protection of remaining peat carbon stocks. The effectiveness of hydrological restoration is discussed and likely impacts on greenhouse gas emissions evaluated. Initial results indicate that raised water levels have limited short-term impact on reducing CO 2 emissions, but could be critical in reducing fire risk. We conclude that successful restoration of degraded peatlands must be grounded in scientific knowledge, relevant to socio-economic circumstances, and should not proceed without the consent and co-operation of local communities. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Fire and Greenhouse gas emissions and Hydrology and Land cover change and Peatland degradation and Restoration ecology and Sustainable livelihoods and Tropical peatland and Asia and Eurasia and Indonesia and Kalimantan and Southeast Asia and carbon sequestration and deforestation and drainage and environmental impact and fire and greenhouse gas and habitat restoration and hydrology and land cover and land degradation and land use change and lowland environment and peatland and restoration ecology and socioeconomic impact and succession and sustainability and vegetation dynamics and water level,10.1007/s10021-008-9216-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-70349696652&doi=10.1007%2fs10021-008-9216-2&partnerID=40&md5=a2c2f69174b0a9e311401419c0973c5e,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 236,NA,JOUR,6,888,905,NA,SEP,1432-9840 and 1435-0629,WOS:000270339300002,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","3118, 5179"

Currently, there is lack of information about the spatial organization of native species in core forest fragments remaining between reforested fields. Biodiversity as measured by species and number of individuals was assessed in two forest reserve zones located within reforestations of Eucalyptus sp and Pinus sp in Agudos, São Paulo, Brazil. The main objective was to compare the state of biodiversity within two natural areas with contrasting disturbance levels; a second objective was to investigate recognisable patterns of species and individuals spatial distribution. A grid-like set of plots was set up for data collection over each of the two study areas. Natural species were aggregated onto two groups using height classes, inferior level (< 0.5 m) and superior level (> 1.3 m) layers. Within each natural area the number of species and individuals of the height class > 1.3 m was counted on 50 square plots of 100 m2 (10 × 10 m) whereas those of the height class < 0.5 m were counted on 250 subplots of 1 m2 (1 × 1 m). Data analysis involved both statistical and geostatistical methods. Experimental semivariograms of number of species and individuals were modelled by a nugget component plus a spherical structure with autocorrelation ranging from approximately 20 to 60 m. Cross-semivariograms could also be computed and modelled in some cases. Nugget effects of both species and individual's count for inferior level were shown to be larger for small sized plots, whereas the spatially structured component increased as the plot size increased. Individual's count showed a higher continuity at close distances than species number in the superior level (> 1.3 m), and the reverse was true for the inferior level (< 0.5 m).

The human side of the issue, highlighted with reports of negative livelihood outcomes and rights abuses by oil palm companies, has also led to controversy. Oil palm related conflicts have been widely documented in Indonesia yet uptake by farmers has also been extensive. An assessment of the livelihood impacts of oil palm development, including sources of conflict, is needed to shed light on the apparent contradiction between these reports and the evident enthusiasm of farmers to join the oil palm craze thereby informing future expansion. We assessed the impact of oil palm development on the economic wellbeing of rural farmers in Indonesia. We found that many smallholders have benefited substantially from the higher returns to land and labour afforded by oil palm but district authorities and smallholder cooperatives play key roles in the realisation of benefits. Conflicts between communities and companies have resulted almost entirely from lack of transparency, the absence of free, prior, and informed consent and unequal benefit sharing, and have been exacerbated by the absence of clear land rights. We make specific recommendations to improve the present situation and foster the establishment of smallholder friendly production regimes. Oil palm expansion in Indonesia is set to continue.

Over the last 30 years, studies and techniques for forest recovery have advanced. Establishing a self-sustainable reforested area with adequate biodiversity is the main parameter for any reforestation program. Thus, knowledge of the ecophysiological behavior of the species to be used is crucial. Our hypothesis is that certain tools are efficient in determining the ecophysiological characterization of native species within different functional groups. Filling group plants show fast growth, intense gas exchange, present mechanisms of water deficit tolerance and show high efficiency in radiation capture, so they are first planted in a reforestation area. While plants pertaining to the diversity group do not exhibit these characteristics, thus are plants after the establishment of the first group of species. To test this hypothesis, two experiments were installed using young plants of four species native to the Atlantic Forest, grown in 9-L pots. Leaf water potential, gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence and certain biochemical parameters of leaf metabolism were evaluated. In the first experiment, plants were maintained under two forms of light availability for 15 days, full light (control) and shaded (shade). The species Inga sp. and Brosimum guianensis presented the most contrasting responses on day 15, principally in the variables leaf water potential, gas exchange, leaf soluble sugar content, F′v/F′m and Fv/Fm. In the second experiment, plants were divided into two groups: a well-hydrated group (control) and one that underwent irrigation suspension for 7 days (drought); measurements were performed on day 8 of drought. Again, Inga sp. and Brosimum guianensis plants showed responses characterizing them as pertaining to distinct functional groups for the experimental parameters previously described. Thus, Inga sp. was classified as pertaining to the filling group and B. guianensis to the diversity group.

Nevertheless, very little is known about the basic socio-economic and pedological properties of cocoa agroforestry systems in the region. In the vicinity of Lore Lindu National Park (LLNP), 144 cocoa plots covering an intensification gradient were selected for an intensive 1-year cocoa management study including a subset of 48 plots for extended soil analyses. Local cocoa plots are mostly established by converting natural forest lands, and they are increasingly intensified by removal of their natural shade tree cover. Soil nutrient status is mostly sufficient but total P availability and stagnant soil water conditions limit yields. Phytosanitary and soil amelioration management are often suboptimal and may need to be improved. Marketing of cocoa beans takes place mostly via small traders from the same village. Farm gate prices account for around 70% of world prices. No price incentives exist for enhancing bean quality by better processing. Cocoa bean yield varies strongly by season. A structural intensification index integrating data on canopy closure, cocoa tree density, number of native forest trees and number of intercrops, was positively correlated with yields. Labour input also increases yield. Labour input was not correlated with the structural intensification index but expenses for material inputs and hired labour as well as biophysical parameters as rainfall and phosphor content were.

This aspect of soil organic C (SOC) dynamics under distinct cropping and management systems can be conveniently analyzed with ecosystem models such as the Century Model. In this study, Century was used to simulate SOC stocks in farm fields of the Ibirubá region of north central Rio Grande do Sul state in Southern Brazil. The region, where soils are predominantly Oxisols, was originally covered with subtropical woodlands and grasslands. SOC dynamics was simulated with a general scenario developed with historical data on soil management and cropping systems beginning with the onset of agriculture in 1900. From 1993 to 2050, two contrasting scenarios based on no-tillage soil management were established: the ""status quo"" scenario, with crops and agricultural inputs as currently practiced in the region and the ""high biomass"" scenario with increased frequency of corn in the cropping system, resulting in about 80% higher biomass addition to soils. Century simulations were in close agreement with SOC stocks measured in 2005 in the Oxisols with finer texture surface horizon originally under woodlands. However, simulations in the Oxisols with loamy surface horizon under woodlands and in the grassland soils were not as accurate. SOC stock decreased from 44% to 50% in fields originally under woodland and from 20% to 27% in fields under grasslands with the introduction of intensive annual grain crops with intensive tillage and harrowing operations. The adoption of conservation practices in the 1980s led to a stabilization of SOC stocks followed by a partial recovery of native stocks. Simulations to 2050 indicate that maintaining ""status quo"" would allow SOC stocks to recover from 81% to 86% of the native stocks under woodland and from 80% to 91% of the native stocks under grasslands. Adoption of a ""high biomass"" scenario would result in stocks from 75% to 95% of the original stocks under woodlands and from 89% to 102% in the grasslands by 2050. These simulations outcomes underline the importance of cropping system yielding higher biomass to further increase SOC content in these Oxisols. This application of the Century Model could reproduce general trends of SOC loss and recovery in the Oxisols of the Ibirubá region. Additional calibration and validation should be conducted before extensive usage of Century as a support tool for soil carbon sequestration projects in this and other regions can be recommended. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The programme will eventually provide $30 billion a year in grant and market finance to prevent carbon emissions caused by forest conversion in non-Annex 1 countries. As a consequence new carbon networks involving investment agencies, carbon traders, government departments and NGOs are forming to profit from the programme. This paper analyses the ongoing evolution of REDD from four perspectives drawn from political ecology – classic political ecology, eco-governmentality, eco-dependence, and environmental justice. I argue that both the dominant global managerialist perspective, that sees REDD as an apolitical technical and programmatic challenge, and the oppositional populist response, that sees REDD as a form of neo-liberal expansionism infringing on forest people's rights, gloss over the importance of place. Drawing from the experiences of two advanced REDD pilot projects located in the Indonesian province of Aceh, I explore the particularities of place in shaping how REDD is unfolding. Rather than rejecting, or uncritically accepting, this new form of green neo-liberalism I argue for more contextualised responses that maximise the social and environmental gains that can be made, while also highlighting the negativities involved. © 2010 Institute for Human Geography.",Aceh and Aceh and avoiding deforestation and eco-gobernabilidad and eco-governmentality and ecología política and environmental justice and justicia medioambiental and political ecology and prevención de la deforestación and REDD and REDD,10.1177/194277861000300202,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-81855176655&doi=10.1177%2f194277861000300202&partnerID=40&md5=4e4e21a2a8d68368a495aa2bc272e006,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 28,NA,JOUR,2,21,34,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,3140

In particular, little is known about the sensitivity of amphibians and reptiles to habitat disturbance in areas of very high diversity such as South-East Asia. We used a two-step approach to determine the relationship between habitat complexity and conservation value of cacao agroforestry for herpetological diversity in Sulawesi (Indonesia). Indonesia is the third largest cacao-exporting country globally and forest conversion to cacao plantations is a major threat to its biodiversity. We first sampled 43 cacao plantations six times to determine the environmental variables that best explained herpetofaunal diversity patterns using a Bayesian model selection approach. Based on these results, we experimentally manipulated leaf litter thickness (LLT), number of branch piles (LOGS) and LLT + LOGS combinations in the cacao plots. The experimental data were analysed using Bayesian hierarchical regression. The best supported correlative models incorporated LLT, LOGS, air temperature and the ratio between leaf litter and shrub cover, showing the importance of habitat heterogeneity and suggesting climate change sensitivity. The subsequent structural manipulation of these attributes changed amphibian and reptile species richness, and reptile abundance, but only addition of leaf litter did so in a biologically meaningful way, providing microhabitat resources. However, the main beneficiaries were common disturbance-tolerant reptiles. Synthesis and applications. The different results from the correlative model and the independent manipulative experiments showed how important such a combined approach is to derive adequate conservation management recommendations. Increasing leaf litter in cacao agroforestry will work best if implemented on a landscape scale to incorporate sufficient environmental variation and species life histories. This will mainly enhance the richness and abundance of disturbance-tolerant species, which still may maintain ecosystem functions such as pest removal. Particularly for rare species, native forests remain critical for herpetological richness. The direct temperature sensitivity suggests that future climate change impacts may be severe for herpetological diversity in plantation habitats and, hence, demand further research. © 2009 British Ecological Society.",Agriculture and Bayesian modelling and Climate change and Herpetofauna and Hierarchical regression and Indonesia and Land-use change and Sulawesi and Asia and Eurasia and Greater Sunda Islands and Malay Archipelago and Southeast Asia and Sulawesi and Sunda Isles and Amphibia and Reptilia and Theobroma cacao and abundance and agricultural practice and agroforestry and amphibian and anthropogenic effect and climate change and conservation planning and environmental disturbance and evergreen forest and land use change and leaf litter and life history and microhabitat and regression analysis and reptile and sensitivity analysis and species richness,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01663.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67649908300&doi=10.1111%2fj.1365-2664.2009.01663.x&partnerID=40&md5=d0c983626f94d161385604f29793290a,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 60,NA,JOUR,4,823,832,NA,AUG,0021-8901 and 1365-2664,WOS:000267706000011,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","3143, 5482"

No tillage agriculture provides several advantages to establish ""carbon friendly"" production systems. Conservation agriculture has greatly expanded over the past three decades in the North Central region of Rio Grande de Sul, the southernmost state of Brazil, with about 6 million ha of land under dryland grain crop agriculture. A shift from intensive conventional tillage to mulch tillage and then no tillage has resulted in increased SOC levels across much of the region as verified in field measurements. In this study a modeling system was constructed by coupling the interactive Century (i_Century) software running Century 4.0 and ArcGIS data layers to simulate the long-term SOC trends in the Ibirubá region, which occupies a land area of 83,500 ha. This system was capable of accounting for cropping system and management practices trends from 1900 to the present times, as well as simulating projections out to the year 2050, capturing periods of decreasing or increasing SOC trends. Simulations performed with the modeling system show that SOC stocks in Ibirubá, estimated at 5.05 Tg C before human activity, decreased to 3.71 Tg C (31%) by 1985. An estimated recovery to 3.97 Tg C by 2005 in response to adoption of SOC-enhancing practices such as conservation tillage and no tillage was observed. Simulations to 2050 with maintenance of these cropping systems and soil management showed that total C stocks could reach 4.21 Tg C, which would still be 21% less than originally present in those soils. The integration of Century with GIS was greatly expedited with the use of the i_Century interface and its readily-accessible database format.

The anthrosols, also known as the Amazonian Dark Earths or terra preta, were managed by the indigenous pre-Colombian Indians between 500 and 8,700 years before present and are characterized by unusually high cation exchange capacity, phosphorus (P), and calcium (Ca) contents, and soil carbon pools that contain a high proportion of incompletely combusted biomass as biochar or black carbon (BC). We sampled paired anthrosol and unmodified soils from four locations in the Manaus, Brazil, region that differed in their current land use and soil type. Community DNA was extracted from sampled soils and characterized by use of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism. DNA bands of interest from Bacteria and Archaea DGGE gels were cloned and sequenced. In cluster analyses of the DNA fingerprints, microbial communities from the anthrosols grouped together regardless of current land use or soil type and were distinct from those in their respective, paired adjacent soils. For the Archaea, the anthrosol communities diverged from the adjacent soils by over 90%. A greater overall richness was observed for Bacteria sequences as compared with those of the Archaea. Most of the sequences obtained were novel and matched those in databases at less than 98% similarity. Several sequences obtained only from the anthrosols grouped at 93% similarity with the Verrucomicrobia, a genus commonly found in rice paddies in the tropics. Sequences closely related to Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria sp. were recovered only from adjacent soil samples. Sequences related to Pseudomonas, Acidobacteria, and Flexibacter sp. were recovered from both anthrosols and adjacent soils. The strong similarities among the microbial communities present in the anthrosols for both the Bacteria and Archaea suggests that the microbial community composition in these soils is controlled more strongly by their historical soil management than by soil type or current land use. The anthrosols had consistently higher concentrations of incompletely combusted organic black carbon material (BC), higher soil pH, and higher concentrations of P and Ca compared to their respective adjacent soils. Such characteristics may help to explain the longevity and distinctiveness of the anthrosols in the Amazonian landscape and guide us in recreating soils with sustained high fertility in otherwise nutrient-poor soils in modern times. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Agriculture and Archaea and Bacteria and Biodiversity and Brazil and Cluster Analysis and DNA Fingerprinting and DNA, Archaeal and DNA, Bacterial and Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length and Sequence Analysis, DNA and Soil and Soil Microbiology and Acidobacteria and Archaea and Bacteria (microorganisms) and Cyanobacteria and Flexibacter and Flexibacter sp. and Proteobacteria and Pseudomonas and Verrucomicrobia and archaeal DNA and bacterial DNA and soil and agriculture and archaebacterium and article and bacterium and biodiversity and Brazil and cluster analysis and DNA fingerprinting and DNA sequence and genetics and isolation and purification and microbiology and restriction fragment length polymorphism and soil and analysis and archaeon and Bacteria and isolation and purification and soil",10.1007/s00248-010-9689-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77955432747&doi=10.1007%2fs00248-010-9689-3&partnerID=40&md5=de50404cd2b9e5fffca1e5b3e83e4871,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 206,NA,JOUR,1,192,205,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,3152

We establish a set of economic and institutional preconditions for PES to become a feasible and cost-effective conservation mechanism. We proceed with a macro-scale spatial analysis and overlay of opportunity costs, deforestation patterns, carbon services, and land tenure, in order to assess where these conditions hold. We then screen how the benefits of potential PES schemes might be distributed across different socioeconomic groups of service providers in different land tenure categories. Our economic-quantitative analysis, though sensitive to documented assumptions, suggests that under current carbon prices the economic preconditions are in place to pay for avoided deforestation in over half of threatened forests over the next decade. Unfortunately, the same optimism does not apply to institutional preconditions. Land grabbing, insecure tenure, overlapping claims, and lacking information on private tenure constitute real medium-term impediments to PES. If payments were to accrue to current landholders regardless of current tenure insecurities, large landowners who account for about 80% of all deforestation would reap the highest benefits, though per-capita benefits other tenure categories are also high. Schemes that closely align payments with opportunity costs are preferable for cost-effectiveness, and not necessarily more inequitable in outcomes. Essentially, PES systems cannot substitute command-and-control measures: the former depend on the latter for basic governance systems to secure effective rights of exclusion, which land stewards essentially need in order to become reliable service providers. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Through N(2)-fixation, many leguminous trees contribute to the N-balance of tropical wetlands and rainforests. Therefore, studies of the N(2)-fixation ability of leguminous species appear to be crucial for the better use and conservation of these resources. The global nodulation inventory in the Leguminosae family is constantly being enriched with new records, suggesting the existence of undiscovered nodulated species, especially in tropical natural ecosystems and other hot spots of biodiversity. In this respect, the nodulation of leguminous species from the Amazonian forest of Porto Trombetas (Brazil) was surveyed. Overall, 199 leguminous species from flooded and non-flooded areas, were examined for their nodulation status by combining field observations, seedling inoculations, and screening of N(2)-fixing bacterial strains from the collected nodules. The results revealed a tendency for a higher relative frequency of nodulation in the species from the flooded areas (74%) compared with those from the non-flooded areas (67%).

Soils under natural vegetation and conservation tillage systems generally have higher aggregation indices and total organic carbon (TOC) stocks in the surface layers than soils under conventional management (ploughing). From the point of view of the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), C stabilization and loss in the surface layer is relevant. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) on TOC stabilization and loss through soil aggregation in the topsoil. Soil aggregation, TOC stocks, and fluxes of CO2 of samples from a Rhodic Ferralsol under NT and CT in a long-term field experiment in Southern Brazil were measured. A natural forest site was also evaluated as reference to the management sites. Emissions of CO2 were measured in laboratory incubation experiment on bulk soil samples and on soil aggregate size fractions, previously separated by dry sieving, in intact and destroyed (crushed to <0.250 mm) state. The soil under NT had larger aggregates and larger proportion of the soil in greater aggregate size classes than CT. Total organic carbon stocks were higher under NT both in bulk soil samples and macroaggregates than under CT. Under laboratory conditions the bulk soil samples from NT showed higher emission rates of CO2 (CO2BS = 18.3 kg C ha-1 h-1) than from CT (CO2BS = 2.3 kg C ha-1 h-1) due to the overall higher TOC stocks. The TOC that was lost by CO2 emission due to the oxidation of readily decomposable macroaggregate-protected SOM in NT (ΣΔCO2 = 79.4 kg C ha-1 h-1) was, however, also higher than under CT (CT: ΣΔCO2 = 29.1 kg C ha-1 h-1). The TOC stabilized by macroaggregation in NT was also more than the TOC lost by CO2 emission from the bulk soil (ΣΔCO2-CO2BS = 61.1 kg C ha-1 h-1), and the difference between these two was higher under NT than under CT (ΣΔCO2-CO2BS = 26.8 kg C ha-1 h-1), showing that NT in fact accumulates more TOC in the soil by protecting it within the macroaggregates. The natural forest had higher TOC stock and emission rates than the tilled soils, however it also stabilized more TOC. Thus, no-tillage in its effect on carbon stabilization, is between the natural ecosystem and CT, representing a soil management system that seems to be an efficient on the way path to the recuperation of soil after conventional management systems. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Reduced-impact logging (RIL) protocols are increasingly common in the tropics and may be a viable option for sustainable forest use; however, few studies have documented faunal responses to RIL. Moreover, evaluations of abundance or diversity may not be sufficient for a comprehensive understanding of faunal responses to human activities, especially in the short-term. We assessed the effects of RIL on the temporal activity patterns of abundant bats in lowland Amazonian rain forest. More specifically, we characterized temporal patterns of activity, overlap of temporal activity, and dispersion of activity modes for seven abundant bat species and for four common bat guilds in RIL forest and in undisturbed forest in Tapajós National Forest, Pará, Brazil. Temporal activity of aerial insectivores, nectarivores, and gleaning animalivores did not change in response to RIL. In contrast, three of five species of frugivores and frugivores as a group changed their patterns of temporal activity in response to RIL. RIL had a greater effect on temporal activity of frugivores that foraged in the understorey than on frugivores that foraged in multiple forest strata. Overlap of temporal activity of frugivores was greater than expected by chance in undisturbed forest, but was random in RIL forest.

Few studies, however, analysed facilitation in systems that are highly productive and rich in species, which are thought to be theoretically unlikely to demonstrate strong effects of facilitation. Here, we investigate the importance of Eryngium horridum, a rosette species, on the maintenance of plant diversity in subtropical grasslands in southern Brazil. We evaluated facilitation in areas under two different types of management: abandonment and grazing. Plots were established in areas with and without individuals of E. horridum and all species were identified and had their cover estimated. The Relative Neighbour Effect index was calculated in order to verify the presence of competition or facilitation. Our results indicated facilitation in both abandoned and in grazed grasslands, but apparently through different mechanisms. In the first case, the plant's architecture opens the canopy and allows more light to reach small forbs in the grass matrix. In the second case, E. horridum appears to protect more palatable species from herbivores. Otherwise considered an obnoxious species, E. horridum plays an important ecological role in subtropical grasslands in southern Brazil by facilitating other species and consequently, increasing local richness.

These developments, in turn, suggest the potential for reducing biodiversity loss through the maintenance of a high percentage of forest combined with sensitive management of anthropogenic areas. We conducted a multi-taxa survey to evaluate the potential for biodiversity maintenance in an Atlantic forest landscape that presented a favorable context from a theoretical perspective (high proportion of mature forest partly surrounded by structurally complex matrices). We sampled ferns, butterflies, frogs, lizards, bats, small mammals and birds in interiors and edges of large and small mature forest remnants and two matrices (second-growth forests and shade cacao plantations), as well as trees in interiors of small and large remnants. By considering richness, abundance and composition of forest specialists and generalists, we investigated the biodiversity value of matrix habitats (comparing them with interiors of large remnants for all groups except tree), and evaluated area (for all groups) and edge effects (for all groups except trees) in mature forest remnants.

Location: Lore Lindu National Park, Sulawesi, Indonesia. Methods: Floristic inventories and stand structural analyses were conducted on 13 plots (each 0.24 ha) in four old-growth forest stands at 1050, 1400, 1800 and 2400 m a.s.l. (submontane to upper montane elevations). Tree AGB estimates were based on d.b.h., height and wood specific gravity. Phylogenetic diversity and biogeographical patterns were analysed based on tree family composition weighted by AGB. Elevational trends in AGB were compared with other Southeast Asian and Neotropical transect studies (n = 7). Results: AGB was invariant from sub- to mid-montane elevation (309-301 Mg ha-1) and increased slightly to 323 Mg ha-1 at upper montane elevation. While tree and canopy height decreased, wood specific gravity increased. Magnoliids accounted for most of the AGB at submontane elevations, while eurosids I (including Fagaceae) contributed substantially to AGB at all elevations. Phylogenetic diversity was highest at upper montane elevations, with co-dominance of tree ferns, Podocarpaceae, Trimeniaceae and asterids/euasterids II, and was lowest at lower/mid-montane elevations, where Fagaceae contributed > 50% of AGB. Biogeographical patterns showed a progression from dominant tropical families at submontane to tropical Fagaceae (Castanopsis, Lithocarpus) at lower/mid-montane, and to conifers and Australasian endemics at upper montane elevations. Cross-continental comparisons revealed an elevational AGB decrease in transects with low/no presence of Fagaceae, but relatively high AGB in montane forests with moderate to high abundance of this family. Main conclusions: AGB is determined by both changes in forest structure and shifts in species composition. In our study, these two factors traded off so that there was no net change in AGB, even though there were large changes in forest structure and composition along the elevational gradient. Southeast Asian montane rain forests dominated by Fagaceae constitute important carbon stocks.

Although traditional slash-and-burn agriculture is being practiced over many years, deforestation there is relatively small compared to other Amazon regions. Pastures are restricted to the vicinity of cities and do not spread to the small communities along the river. Inceptisols are the main soil order (>90%) in the area and have unique attributes including high Al content and high cation exchange capacity (CEC) due to the enrichment of the clay fraction with 2:1 secondary aluminosilicates. Despite its importance, few studies have focussed on this soil order when considering land use effects on the fertility of Amazon soils. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate changes in soil fertility of representative land use systems (LUSs) in the Upper Solimões region, namely: primary rainforest, old secondary forest, young secondary forest, agroforestry, pasture and agriculture. LUSs were significantly differentiated by the chemical attributes of their topsoil (0-20 cm). Secondary forests presented soil chemical attributes more similar to primary rainforest areas, while pastures exhibited the highest dissimilarity from all the other LUSs. As a whole, soil chemical changes among Inceptisols dominated LUSs showed patterns that were distinct from those reported from other Amazon soils like Oxisols and Ultisols. This is probably related to the presence of high-activity clays enriched in exchangeable aluminum that heavily influenced the soil chemical reactions over the expected importance of organic matter found in most studies conducted over Oxisol and Ultisol. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Land use change can cause either a negative or a positive effect in terms of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. However, the intensification of global warming has been confirmed, related mainly to the increase of greenhouse gas emissions from burning of fossil fuel, deforestation, and adoption of inadequate agricultural land management practices. An inadequate soil use does not only contribute to intensified greenhouse effects but also creates problems related to soil sustainability due to the degradation of soil organic matter, which negatively reflects on soil physical and chemical attributes, as well as on its biodiversity. On the other hand, best management practices that maintain or even increase soil organic matter contents can minimize the effects of global warming. Examples of such management practices are no-tillage, rehabilitation of degraded pasture, reforestation of marginal lands and elimination of the burning activity among others.

The DNA concentrations and soil microbial C and N correlated positively and significantly, suggesting that these are decisive nutrients for microbial growth and time required for microbial biomass renewal. The litter microbial biomass represented a source of C and N higher than soil microbial biomass and can be an important layer to contribute to tropical soil with low C and N availability.

In comparison, the contribution from selective logging to atmospheric CO2 emissions, and its impact on regional C dynamics, is highly uncertain. Using a new geographically based modeling approach in combination with high resolution remote sensing data from 1999 to 2002, we estimate that C emissions were 0.04-0.05 Pg C yr-1 due to selective logging from a ∼2,664,960 km2 region of the Brazilian Amazon. Selective logging was responsible for 15-19% higher carbon emissions than reported from deforestation (clear-cutting) alone. Our simulations indicated that forest carbon lost via selective logging lasts two to three decades following harvest, and that the original live biomass takes up to a century to recover, if the forests are not subsequently cleared. The two-to three-decade loss of carbon results from the biomass damaged by logging activities, including leaves, wood, and roots, estimated to be 89.1 Tg C yr-1 from 1999 to 2002 over the study region, leaving 70.0 Tg C yr-1 and 7.9 Tg C yr-1 to accumulate as coarse woody debris and soil C, respectively. While avoided deforestation is central to crediting rain forest nations for reduced carbon emissions, the extent and intensity of selective logging are also critical to determining carbon emissions in the context of Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD). We show that a combination of automated high-resolution satellite monitoring and detailed forest C modeling can yield spatially explicit estimates of harvest-related C losses and subsequent recovery in support of REDD and other international carbon market mechanisms. © 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.",Amazonia and Brazil and Debris and Deforestation and Recovery and Remote sensing and Amazon deforestation and Amazon forests and Atmospheric CO and Brazilian Amazon and C emissions and C modeling and Carbon emissions and Carbon loss and Carbon markets and Coarse woody debris and Forest degradation and High resolution and High resolution remote sensing and Modeling approach and Rain forests and Satellite monitoring and Selective logging and Spatially explicit and carbon emission and carbon flux and coarse woody debris and deforestation and emission control and emissions trading and environmental economics and incentive and international cooperation and phytomass and rainforest and remote sensing and satellite imagery and selective logging and soil carbon and Logging (forestry),10.1029/2009GB003727,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77957699265&doi=10.1029%2f2009GB003727&partnerID=40&md5=9716c5d67d2d292cc019b4a80db456e4,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 58,NA,JOUR,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,3192

However, knowledge of their effect on soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations and stocks is still limited. The study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of ICLS under two tillage and fertilization regimes on SOC and TN concentrations and stocks in the 0-30 cm soil layer, in comparison with continuous crops or pasture. The following soil management systems were studied: continuous pasture; continuous crop; 4 years' crop followed by 4 years' pasture and vice-versa. The adjacent native Cerrado area was used as a control. Under the rotation and continuous crop systems there were two levels of soil tillage (conventional and no-tillage) and fertility (maintenance and corrective fertility). The stock calculations were done using the equivalent soil mass approach. The land use systems had a significant effect on the concentrations of SOC and TN in the soil, but no effect was observed for the soil tillage and fertilizer regimes. For these two latter, some significant discrepancies appeared in the distribution of SOC and TN concentrations in the 0-30 cm layer. Carbon storage was 60.87 Mg ha-1 under Cerrado, and ranged from 52.21 Mg ha-1 under the ICLS rotation to 59.89 Mg ha-1 with continuous cropping. The decrease in SOC stocks was approximately 8.5 and 7.5 Mg ha-1, or 14 and 12%, for continuous pasture and ICLS respectively. No-tillage for 10 years after the conversion of conventional tillage to no-tillage under the continuous crop system, and 13 years of conventional tillage in continuous cropping did not result in significant changes in SOC stocks. The SOC and TN stocks in surface layers, using the equivalent soil mass approach rather than the equivalent depth, stress the differences induced by the calculation method. As soil compaction is the principal feature of variability of stocks determinations, the thickness should be avoid in these types of studies. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Twelve socio-economic areas of concern (food supply, child labour, (minimum) wages, employment, health care and education) and environmental areas of concern (soil erosion, depletion of fresh water resources, nutrient losses and soil nutrient depletion, pollution from chemicals and biodiversity) are included. Since there is no generally accepted definition of sustainability, a loose and strict set of criteria are defined. Short rotation coppice (SRC) production systems in Ukraine and South East Brazil in 2015 are taken as case studies. The results indicate that it seems feasible to produce biomass for energy purposes at reasonable cost levels and meeting strict sustainability criteria at the same time. The loose set of criteria has no impact on the costs of energy crop production, which are calculated to be 1.7 € GJ-1 in Brazil and 2.1 € GJ-1 in Ukraine. The strict set of criteria results in an increase of the costs of energy crop production by 42 % in Brazil and 14 % in Ukraine. In general, compliance with strict socio-economic criteria has a limited impact on the costs, because SRC is relatively labour extensive.

A perspective from developed landscapes is essential for understanding remnant natural ecosystems, because most species experience their surroundings at spatial scales beyond the plot level, and spillover between natural and managed ecosystems is common. Agricultural bird species have greater habitat and diet breadth than forest species. Based on a global data base, bird assemblages in tropical agroforest ecosystems were composed of disproportionately more frugivorous and nectarivorous, but fewer insectivorous bird species compared with forest. Similarly, insect predators of plant-feeding arthropods were more diverse in Ecuadorian agroforest and forest compared with rice and pasture, while, in Indonesia, bee diversity was also higher in forested habitats. Hence, diversity of insectivorous birds and insect predators as well as bee pollinators declined with agricultural transformation. In contrast, with increasing agricultural intensification, avian pollinators and seed dispersers initially increase then decrease in proportion. It is well established that the proximity of agricultural habitats to forests has a strong influence on the functional diversity of agroecosystems. Community similarity is higher among agricultural systems than in natural habitats and higher in simple than in complex landscapes for both birds and insects, so natural communities, low-intensity agriculture, and heterogeneous landscapes appear to be critical in the preservation of beta diversity. We require a better understanding of the relative role of landscape composition and the spatial configuration of landscape elements in affecting spillover of functionally important species across managed and natural habitats. This is important for data-based management of tropical human-dominated landscapes sustaining the capacity of communities to reorganize after disturbance and to ensure ecological functioning. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.",Agroforestry and Beta diversity and Biodiversity and Biological control and Global change and Parasitoids and Pollination and Predators and Seed dispersal and Spatial ecology and Spillover and Sustainability and Agriculture and Animals and Biodiversity and Birds and Ecosystem and Insects and Tropical Climate and Asia and Ecuador and Eurasia and Indonesia and South America and Southeast Asia and Apoidea and Arthropoda and Aves and Hexapoda and agricultural ecosystem and bee and biological control and bird and diet and ecosystem function and global change and landscape and niche breadth and parasitoid and pollination and pollinator and population decline and predator and seed dispersal and species diversity and sustainability and agriculture and animal and biodiversity and bird and ecosystem and insect and physiology and review and tropic climate,10.1890/07-0455.1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-42949117943&doi=10.1890%2f07-0455.1&partnerID=40&md5=e783adc58870370baf7993797ce417d8,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 331,NA,JOUR,4,944,951,NA,APR,0012-9658 and 1939-9170,WOS:000255580200009,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","3202, 5553"

This study was carried out in a 18-year long-term experiment conducted on a subtropical Acrisol in Southern Brazil to assess the potential of tillage systems [conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT)], cropping systems [oat/maize (O/M), vetch/maize (V/M) and oat + vetch/maize + cowpea (OV/MC)] and N fertilization [0 kg N ha-1 year-1 (0 N) and 180 kg N ha-1 year-1 (180 N)] for mitigating atmospheric C. For that, the soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation and the C equivalent (CE) costs of the investigated management systems were taken into account in comparison to the CT O/M 0 N used as reference system. No-till is known to produce a less oxidative environment than CT and resulted in SOC accumulation, mainly in the 0-5 cm soil layer, at rates related to the addition of crop residues, which were increased by legume cover crops and N fertilization. Considering the reference treatment, the SOC accumulation rates in the 0-20 cm layer varied from 0.09 to 0.34 Mg ha-1 year-1 in CT and from 0.19 to 0.65 Mg ha-1 year-1 in NT. However, the SOC accumulation rates peaked during the first years (5th to 9th) after the adoption of the management practices and decreased exponentially over time, indicating that conservation soil management was a short-term strategy for atmospheric C mitigation. On the other hand, when the CE costs of tillage operations were taken into account, the benefits of NT to C mitigation compared to CT were enhanced. When CE costs related to N-based fertilizers were taken into account, the increases in SOC accumulation due to N did not necessarily improve atmospheric C mitigation, although this does not diminish the agricultural and economic importance of inorganic N fertilization. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Deforestation, conversion to other land uses, especially plantations of oil palm and pulpwood trees, and recurrent fires have recently caused the release of large amounts of this carbon to the atmosphere. If these large emissions from degrading peatlands are taken into account Indonesia is one of the largest emitters of CO2 worldwide. To improve estimates of the amount of carbon stored in Indonesian peatlands we applied 3D modelling based on the combined analysis of satellite imagery (Landsat ETM+, SRTM) and 750 in situ peat thickness measurements. We demonstrate that SRTM radar data can be used to determine the extent and topography of the dome shaped surface of a selection of peatlands in Central Kalimantan, South Sumatra and West Papua. A strong correlation was obtained between the convex peat dome surface and the underlying mineral ground, which was used to calculate the peat volume and carbon store. Conservatively, we estimate that at least 55 ± 10 Gt of carbon are stored in Indonesia's peatlands. This amount is higher than previous results published because it takes into account the biconvex nature of the tropical peatlands.

Non-detriment findings based on annual export quotas should verify that current harvest rates are sustainable with respect to total commercial stocks. In order to assess this impact, a method for converting export-quality sawnwood volumes to numbers of standing trees is used to estimate the number of mahogany trees and forest area required to produce the original and revised 2007 export quotas set by Peru, correcting for systematic measurement error caused by buttresses and for stem defects caused by heart-rot (hollow bole). Based on large-scale inventory data from three forest sites in nearby south-west Brazil, the average commercial-sized (> 75 cm diameter in Peru) mahogany tree in this region would yield 6.48.5 m3 of roundwood (standing volume), which in turn would be processed or milled into 1.72.2 m3 of export-grade sawnwood. From this estimate, 61208070 commercial-sized trees would have been harvested to supply the original 2007 export quota of 13 477 m3, from a forest area of 407 300536 750 ha at landscape-scale densities reported by the Peruvian CITES Scientific Authority. To supply the revised export quota of 4983 m 3, an estimated 22602980 commercial-sized trees will be harvested from a forest area of 150 600198 450 ha. Both estimates exceed the number of trees the Peruvian Scientific Authority estimates can be sustainably harvested annually (961 144 trees > 75 cm diameter) based on preliminary inventory data. The method estimates that, since 1996, 154 000203 000 mahogany trees have been logged in Peru from a forest area of 10.213.5 million ha to supply the total reported export volume during this period (including the revised 2007 export quota) of 339 114 m3. This area corresponds to 1825% of mahogany's total natural range in Peru, or 3749% of mahogany's estimated remaining range in 2001. Without empirical knowledge of density patterns, surviving commercial stocks, and biological and technical issues linking processed lumber (sawnwood) to standing trees (roundwood), it will remain difficult to evaluate the sustainability of export quotas issued at the national level for mahogany or other tropical timber species. © 2008 Foundation for Environmental Conservation.",Amazon and Brazil and CITES Appendix II and Export quota and Non-detriment findings and Peru and Biodiversity and Ecosystems and Forestry and Hardwoods and Sustainable Forest Management and Amazonia and Peru and South America and Swietenia and Swietenia macrophylla and Biodiversity and Ecosystems and Hardwoods and Sustainable development and estimation method and evergreen forest and evergreen tree and forest inventory and international trade and survival and sustainability and tree and Sawnwood and Tropical timber and Forestry,10.1017/S0376892908004554,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-43149124405&doi=10.1017%2fS0376892908004554&partnerID=40&md5=20132cd268b2fb2c8cd6797cda0c76bd,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 12,NA,JOUR,1,26,35,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,3206

To counteract this threat in Southeast Asia, sustainable forest management (SFM) practices are becoming increasingly important. We assess the tools and guidelines that have been developed to promote SFM and the progress that has been made in Southeast Asia toward better logging practices. We specifically focus on practices relevant to biodiversity issues. Various regional or national mechanisms now inform governments and the timber industry about methods to reduce the impact of production forestry on wildlife and the forest environment. However, so many guidelines have been produced that it has become difficult to judge which ones are most relevant. In addition, most guidelines are phrased in general terms and lack specific recommendations targeted to local conditions. These might be reasons for the generally slow adoption of SFM practices in the region, with only a few countries having incorporated the guidelines into national legislation. Malaysia, Indonesia, and Laos are among the frontrunners in this process. Overall there is progress, especially in the application of certification programs, the planning and management of high conservation value forests, the regulation and control of hunting, and silvicultural management. To reduce further forest loss, there is a need to accelerate the implementation of good forest management practices. We recommend specific roles for governments, the forestry industry, and nongovernmental organizations in further promoting the implementation of SFM practices for biodiversity conservation.

This is essential in countries such as Indonesia where much of the landmass is not suitable for intensive cropping (either too steep or the soils are acidic and nutrient poor), yet population pressure and increasing food demand force many farmers to implement such practices on marginal land. These practices, combined with the lack of credit, quality seed and fertilizer have contributed to decreased soil fertility and increased deforestation and soil erosion. Previous research on agroforests suggests, however, that sustainability and profitability are not guaranteed and that the addition of fertilizer to the production system may be required. This is investigated for a hedgerow-intercropping system in the presence of carbon-sequestration payments using a bioeconomic modelling framework that incorporates the SCUAF simulation model. For the assumptions used in this study it was found that fertilizer improves the productivity and sustainability of the system; it is either optimal to grow crops (Zea mays) alone provided 225 kg ha-1 yr-1 of fertilizer is applied, or to completely convert to growing trees (Gliricidia sepium) if fertilizer is not used. This decision depends on the relative prices for crops and carbon. It was also found that there is an incentive for landholders to participate in a carbon-sink project when the previous land use has a continuously decreasing carbon stock, which is the baseline used to determine eligible carbon. Finally, compared with a more complex process model such as WaNuLCAS and data reported in the literature, the process model SCUAF consistently and reliably predicted biophysical interactions for various management regimes of tree/crop systems for use in complex economic analyses. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We compared the assemblages of braconid wasps as parasitoids of taxonomically diverse groups of insects among Imperata grasslands, young and mature plantations of Acacia mangium, young secondary forests after wildfires, and old secondary forests in the lowland of East Kalimantan. The abundance and species richness of braconids, which had declined in Imperata grasslands, somewhat increased in Acacia plantations, and also the species composition of braconids in Acacia plantations was transitional between Imperata grasslands and old secondary forests. Parasitoids of detritivores and wood borers increased markedly after plantation, while those of herbivores showed a distinct turnover of species all over the range from grasslands to old secondary forests. The plantation of A. mangium had most likely facilitated the recovery of the diversity of host forest and their parasitoids, but the recovery was just at the rudimentary stage even in mature plantations.

The Forest is present in nine Brazilian States in a region occupied by more than 20 million people, one of the poorest regions in the country. Hence, in order to decrease land uses that cause deforestation it is necessary to promote those that foster forest conservation and enhance the local economy, such as agroforestry. This study analyzed the financial viability of two agroforestry systems. It was found that the studied agroforestry systems are profitable and can be recommended as profitable and sustainable land use. The results include high NPV, IRR and low payback for both systems.

Many have shown a positive relationship, particularly in controlled experiments, but variability in results has emphasized the context-dependency of these relationships. Complementary resource use may lead to a positive relationship between diversity and these processes, but only when a diverse array of niches is available to be partitioned among species. Therefore, the slope of the diversity-function relationship may change across differing levels of heterogeneity, but empirical evaluations of this pattern are lacking. Here we examine three important functions/properties in different real world (i.e., nonexperimental) ecosystems: plant biomass in German grasslands, parasitism rates across five habitat types in coastal Ecuador, and coffee pollination in agroforestry systems in Indonesia. We use general linear and structural equation modeling to demonstrate that the effect of diversity on these processes is context dependent, such that the slope of this relationship increases in environments where limiting resources (soil nutrients, host insects, and coffee flowers, respectively) are spatially heterogeneous. These real world patterns, combined with previous experiments, suggest that biodiversity may have its greatest impact on the functioning of diverse, naturally heterogeneous ecosystems. © 2008 Tylianakis et al.",Hexapoda and article and biodiversity and biomass and coffee and ecological niche and ecosystem and Ecuador and grassland and habitat and host parasite interaction and nonhuman and parasitism and pollination and pollinator and predator and productivity and resource management,10.1371/journal.pbio.0060122,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-45149118682&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pbio.0060122&partnerID=40&md5=05b39ed78b3d5a9b9ff338c9c36cc02e,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 213,NA,JOUR,5,0947,0956,NA,MAY,1544-9173,WOS:000256850100007,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","3223, 5043"

The main challenges to implementation of the current A/R CDM mechanisms are in (1) the definition of forest and its institutional implications, (2) the projectization that is embedded in the definition of CDM, (3) non-linear baselines related to forest transitions that complicate attribution, (4) inherent lack of synergy with other development activities and (5) high transaction costs and temporary nature of credits. In possible new international regimes that aim to include all relevant changes in land-use based emissions, a more outcome-based programmatic approach may partially replace the project cycle assessments of CDM. However, there will still be a need to assess the combination of factors and policies that can be expected to enhance terrestrial carbon storage through voluntary land-use decisions, by a combination of reduced emissions and enhanced storage. Tradeoffs usually exist between local livelihoods and carbon storage, but assessment of the opportunity costs of C sequestration requires analysis at the landscape and community scale at scenario level, including local adjustment and optimization. We explored such scenarios for a number of cases in Indonesia that range from a forest margin to a degraded lands setting. FALLOW model applications were set up for 4 landscapes in Indonesia (15-98% forest cover, 1-55% grassland, 17-51 persons km-2) to test the internal consistency of the hypothesis that farmer-led development of tree-based land-use systems in response to accessible markets, legal tenure arrangements, availability of reliable technical information and local investment can convert degraded forest lands at low public cost and form an attractive alternative to project-based interventions with detailed prescriptions and planning. The calculated (non-linear) baselines for carbon stocks varied from an average trend of -0.26 to +0.23 Mg C ha-1 year-1 over a 25 year period of assessment, equivalent to a net sequestration of -0.95 to 0.84 t CO2 ha-1 year-1 The highest value for predicted additional carbon storage in the wider landscape did not coincide with the best results for local livelihoods, but in each of the case studies the results for a 'programmatic' removal of constraints to profitable smallholder tree-based production systems was more attractive than a 'prescribed' tree planting in designated project areas. These results support the design of international modalities for an outcome-based approach to enhancing carbon storage with local flexibility in implementation. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A large part of these native forests were transformed into cacao plantations in an agroforestry system known locally as cabrucas, where native trees were culled and cacao was planted under the shade of remaining trees. The present study analyzed the influence of time of implantation (age) and time of abandonment of management practices on tree species diversity of cabruca plantations to evaluate the capacity for conservation and recovery of species richness of native Atlantic Forest trees in cabrucas. Phytosociological surveys were conducted in five cabrucas with different conditions of age and state of abandonment. All trees, including hemiepiphytes and excluding the cacao plants, with a minimum stem diameter of 10 cm at breast height, were surveyed within a 3-ha sampling area in each plantation. A total of 2514 individual trees belonging to 293 species and 52 families were recorded in the five cabrucas. The Shannon diversity index varied from 3.31 to 4.22 among the cabrucas and was positively correlated with the time of abandonment (r = 0.97). The new cabrucas showed the highest values of estimated total richness (Chao) and the highest proportion of late successional species than the old ones. All areas preserved a very high proportion of native forest species while the three old cabrucas showed a higher proportion of exotic species than the two new ones. Thus the exotic species seem to replace more of the native species in the long run because of management practices and local preferences. The cabrucas presented also a high capacity for the regeneration of tree species richness after abandonment. Simple alterations in management practices could improve the recruitment of late successional species in these areas. Economic incentives may be necessary for the farmers to adopt management practices to retain native species which bring no economic returns. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",Agroforestry systems and Atlantic forest and Biodiversity conservation and Cabruca and Rustic cacao and Theobroma cacao and Atlantic Forest and Bahia and Brazil and South America and Theobroma cacao and agroforestry and biodiversity and endemism and evergreen tree and management practice and phytosociology and plantation and recruitment and species conservation and species diversity and species richness,10.1007/s10531-006-9017-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-35448988522&doi=10.1007%2fs10531-006-9017-x&partnerID=40&md5=ed15e81925e4e2db279fa91859773034,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 51,NA,JOUR,13,3681,3701,NA,DEC,0960-3115 and 1572-9710,WOS:000250301400001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","3240, 5529"

As a dominant forest-like landscape element of the cocoa region, the cabrucas play an important role in the conservation of the region's biodiversity. The purpose of this review is to provide the scientific basis for an action plan to reconcile cocoa production and biodiversity conservation in southern Bahia. The available research collectively highlights the diversity of responses of different species and biological groups to both the habitat quality of the cabrucas themselves and to the general characteristics of the landscape, such as the relative extent and spatial configuration of different vegetation types within the landscape mosaic. We identify factors that influence directly or indirectly the occurrence of native species in the cabrucas and the wider landscape of the cocoa region and develop recommendations for their conservation management. We show that the current scientific knowledge already provides a good basis for a biodiversity friendly management of the cocoa region of southern Bahia, although more work is needed to refine some management recommendations, especially on shade canopy composition and density, and verify their economic viability.

This study aimed to link basic ethnobiological research on local ecological knowledge (LEK) to the conservation of Brazilian streams, based on two case studies: original data on LEK of fishermen about freshwater fish in the Negro River, Amazon, and previously published data about LEK of farmers on the ecological relationship between forest and streams in the Macabuzinho catchment, Atlantic Forest. 2. Information was obtained from fishermen through interviews using standard questionnaires containing open-ended questions. Informants for interview were selected either following some defined criteria or applying the 'snowball' method. 3. Fishermen's LEK about the diets and habitats of 14 fish species in the Negro River provided new biological information on plant species that are eaten by fish, in addition to confirming some ecological patterns from the biological literature, such as dependence of fish on forests as food sources. 4. In the Atlantic Forest, a comparison between farmers' LEK and a rapid stream assessment in the farmers' properties indicated that farmers tended to overestimate the ecological integrity of their streams. Farmers recognized at least 11 forest attributes that correspond to the scientific concept of ecosystem services. Such information may be useful to promote or enhance dialogue among farmers, scientists and managers. 5. These results may contribute to the devising of ecosystem management measures in the Negro River, aimed to conserve both rivers and their associated floodplain forests, involving local fishermen. In the Atlantic Forest, we proposed some initiatives, such as to allow direct economic use of their forests to conciliate conflicting perceptions of farmers about ecological benefits versus economic losses from reforestation. Despite their cultural, environmental and geographical differences, the two study cases are complementary and cost-effective and promising approaches to including LEK in the design of ecological research.

Potentially, ecosystems show nonlinear responses to land-use intensification that would open management options with limited ecological losses but satisfying economic gains. However, multidisciplinary studies to quantify ecological losses and socioeconomic tradeoffs under different management options are rare. Here, we evaluate opposing land use strategies in cacao agroforestry in Sulawesi, Indonesia, by using data on species richness of nine plant and animal taxa, six related ecosystem functions, and on socioeconomic drivers of agroforestry expansion. Expansion of cacao cultivation by 230% in the last two decades was triggered not only by economic market mechanisms, but also by rarely considered cultural factors. Transformation from near-primary forest to agroforestry had little effect on overall species richness, but reduced plant biomass and carbon storage by ≈75% and species richness of forest-using species by ≈60%. In contrast, increased land use intensity in cacao agroforestry, coupled with a reduction in shade tree cover from 80% to 40%, caused only minor quantitative changes in biodiversity and maintained high levels of ecosystem functioning while doubling farmers' net income. However, unshaded systems further increased income by ≈40%, implying that current economic incentives and cultural preferences for new intensification practices put shaded systems at risk. We conclude that low-shade agroforestry provides the best available compromise between economic forces and ecological needs. Certification schemes for shade-grown crops may provide a market-based mechanism to slow down current intensification trends. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",Agricultural economics and Agroforestry management and Ecosystem goods and services and Land use change and Plant-animal interactions and Agriculture and Animals and Biodiversity and Cacao and Forestry and Income and Insects and Plant Leaves and Species Specificity and Trees and Tropical Climate and Animalia and Theobroma cacao and agroforestry and article and biodiversity and biomass and cacao and carbon storage and cultural factor and economic aspect and ecosystem and Indonesia and land use and priority journal and species richness and tropical rain forest and agriculture and animal and forestry and income and insect and physiology and plant leaf and species difference and tree and tropic climate,10.1073/pnas.0608409104,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34247633507&doi=10.1073%2fpnas.0608409104&partnerID=40&md5=1f4c1c15c999120e5af2a52a28a20a40,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 396,NA,JOUR,12,4973,4978,NA,MAR 20,0027-8424,WOS:000245256700039,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","3260, 5574"

Agroforestry systems can support high numbers of species and are therefore frequently heralded as the future for tropical biodiversity conservation. However, anthropogenic habitat modification can facilitate species invasions that may suppress native fauna. We compared the ant fauna of lower canopy trees in natural rainforest sites with that of cacao trees in agroforests in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia in order to assess the effects of agroforestry on occurrence of the Yellow Crazy Ant Anoplolepis gracilipes, a common invasive species in the area, and its effects on overall ant richness. The agroforests differed in the type of shade-tree composition, tree density, canopy cover, and distance to the village. On average, 43% of the species in agroforests also occurred in the lower canopy of nearby primary forest and the number of forest ant species that occurred on cacao trees was not related to agroforestry characteristics. However, A. gracilipes was the most common non-forest ant species, and forest ant richness decreased significantly with the presence of this species. Our results indicate that agroforestry may have promoted the occurrence of A. gracilipes, possibly because tree management in agroforests negatively affects ant species that depend on trees for nesting and foraging, whereas A. gracilipes is a generalist when it comes to nesting sites and food preference. Thus, agroforestry management that includes the thinning of tree stands can facilitate ant invasions, thereby threatening the potential of cultivated land for the conservation of tropical ant diversity. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Agriculture and Biological invasion and Competition and Formicidae and Interspecific interactions and Land use intensity and Managed land and Microclimate and Asia and Eurasia and Greater Sunda Islands and Malay Archipelago and Southeast Asia and Sulawesi and Sunda Isles and Anoplolepis gracilipes and Formicidae and Paratrechina longicornis and Theobroma cacao and agroforestry and ant and biodiversity and biological invasion and comparative study and food preference and forest canopy and generalist and human activity and interspecific competition and invasive species and land management and land use change and microclimate and species diversity and species occurrence,10.1007/s10530-008-9215-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-54849410518&doi=10.1007%2fs10530-008-9215-4&partnerID=40&md5=a4e031aacff155f6e4451cbf23a4a6bd,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 78,NA,JOUR,8,1399,1409,NA,DEC,1387-3547 and 1573-1464,WOS:000260306700021,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","3262, 5578"

The conflicting interests of nature conservation on the one hand, and the livelihood of farmers living at the forest margins, on the other, clash noticeably in so-called hotspots of biodiversity, such as the Lore Lindu region of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. Biodiversity generally decreases along a land use gradient from natural forest to agroforestry and annual crop systems. Thus, before solutions for a sustainable balance between conservation and the needs of people living at the forest margins can be sought, changing land use strategies and the factors that influence them must be analyzed. While similar studies often concentrate on economic indicators of land use change only, this chapter highlights the importance of two cultural realities, namely migration and ethnicity. We will demonstrate the great influence of these two factors on land use decisions and on the accessibility of land in the Lore Lindu region. Based on results from previous qualitative studies, we selected three upland villages, which represent a continuum that leads, in terms of migration history, from a pre-transition village, to a transitional village, to a post-transition village. We used quantitative and qualitative methods for our analysis. The results show a general land use change in the region, ranging from a strategy that places food first (e.g., rice) to one that places cash first, especially by the cultivation of cacao. This change cannot be observed to the same extent in the study region as a whole. It varies from village to village, depending on the share of households belonging to the Bugis migrants. Bugis as an ethnic group and as migrants have an enormous effect on the land use decisions of local ethnic groups in their respective villages. Strong ethnic networks among Bugis migrants play an important role not only with respect to their village preferences, but also with respect to the transfer of knowledge regarding agricultural management. A lack of interaction between local and migrant ethnic groups results in differences in the efficiency of cacao cultivation. While the Bugis migrants mainly buy their agricultural land from local farmers or, depending on the village’s migration history, from other Bugis households, members of the autochthonous ethnic group usually clear the primary forest. The findings of the present study reveal that an analysis of migration and ethnicity is a crucial precondition to finding sustainable solutions for ensuring that the margins of the rainforest in the Lore Lindu region remain stable. This chapter will emphasize that, in addition to economic considerations, an analysis of the cultural forces that influence land use changes cannot be neglected. © 2007, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",access to land and Central Sulawesi and cultural orientation system and ethnicity and Indonesia and land use change and migration and Agricultural robots and Biodiversity and Conservation and Cultivation and Economics and Forestry and Knowledge management and Rural areas and Agricultural management and Economic considerations and Economic indicators and Land-use decisions and Land-use strategies and Quantitative and qualitative methods and Sustainable solution and Transfer of knowledge and Land use,10.1007/978-3-540-30290-2_20,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108448272&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-540-30290-2_20&partnerID=40&md5=26642f5d4b1590a641b300e847af2943,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 15,NA,CHAP,NA,415,434,NA,NA,1863-5520 and 1863-5539 and 978-3-540-30289-6,WOS:000248525000020,NA,"Tscharntke, T and Leuschner, C and Zeller, M and Guhardja, E and Bidin, A",International Symposium on Stability of Tropical Rainforest Margins,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","3278, 4970"

We assessed the influence of agroforest woodlots on bird distribution and diversity in the Atlantic forest region (SE Brazil), and also tested which categories of species can use different types of connection elements, and whether this use is influenced by the distance to large forest patches. We studied two fragmented landscapes, with and without stepping stones linking large fragments, and one forested landscape. Using a point count, a bird survey was undertaken in the fragmented landscapes in five different elements: large remnants (>400 ha), agroforest woodlots (0.4-1.1 ha), small patches (0.5-7 ha), riparian corridor, and pasture areas (the main matrix). Generalist and open-area species were commonly observed in the agroforest system or other connection elements, whereas only a few forest species were present in these connections. For the latter species, the distance of woodlots to large patches was essential to determine their richness and abundance. Based on our results and data from literature, we suggest that there is an optimal relationship between the permeability of the matrix and the efficiency of stepping stones, which occurs at intermediate degrees of matrix resistance, and is species-dependent. Because the presence of agroforest system favors a higher richness of generalist species, they appeared to be more advantageous for conservation than the monoculture system; for this reason, they should be considered as a management alternative, particularly when the matrix permeability requirement is met. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Agroforest system and Biodiversity and Connectivity and Conservation and Fragmentation and Landscape ecology and Landscape management and Atlantic Forest and Brazil and South America and Aves and abundance and agroforestry and biodiversity and bird and connectivity and habitat fragmentation and landscape ecology and monoculture and population distribution and species diversity and species richness,10.1007/s10531-008-9329-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-46649095847&doi=10.1007%2fs10531-008-9329-0&partnerID=40&md5=353a5cc3ac0808856d6a86a81cacdf09,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 131,NA,JOUR,8,1907,1922,NA,JUL,0960-3115 and 1572-9710,WOS:000257367300008,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","3283, 5595"

International political and economical interests, following the Kyoto Protocol, require estimates of this carbon sequestration. The carbon stock of two rubber tree plantations (Hevea brasiliensis (Willd.) Muell.-Arg.) was assessed in two contrasting climatic areas: western region in Ghana (WG; 2-14-year-old) and Mato Grosso (MG; 14-25-year-old) in Brazil. Trees (76 in WG and 210 in MG) spanning a range of stand ages, clone types and planting layouts were felled and partitioned into log, live lignified branches of selected diameter (large, medium and fine), dead branches, non-lignified fine branches, leaves, taproot and lateral roots. Allometric relationships (log-transformed power functions) based on trunk circumference at a height of 170 cm (C170) were used to predict the tree foliage, aboveground, belowground and total carbon content (kg C tree-1) (r2 = 0.86-0.99). The way in which carbon content varied as a function of C170 depended both on components and sites. Sampling plots (25 in WG and 34 in MG) were established in stands of varying ages, clones and planting layouts, to quantify carbon pools. The tree carbon stocks (t C ha-1) estimated from the allometric relationships for total tree were fitted as a function of stand age using a non-linear sigmoid curve of Gompertz (total tree r2 = 0.841 and 0.854 in WG and MG, respectively). Predicted tree carbon stock for 14-year-old stands was 83% higher in WG (76.3 t C ha-1) than in MG (41.7 t C ha-1), which was partially explained by a difference in tree height growth between the two locations resulting from the contrasting sites. In addition to tree components, the carbon stocks associated with dead wood on the ground, understorey vegetation, litter layer, fine roots (0-60 cm), soil organic carbon (0-60 cm) and charcoal (0-60 cm) were assessed using linear mixed models to evaluate the influence of clone, site, planting layout and age. Only age appeared to have a significant effect for some pools. For 14-year-old stands, the contribution of the soil organic carbon pool (0-60 cm) ranged between 39 and 69% of the total carbon stock, which amounted to 135 and 153 t C ha-1, in WG and MG, respectively. The cumulated contribution of all remaining soil and ground pools (dead wood on the ground, understorey vegetation, litter layer, fine roots and charcoal) was about 5% in both sites.

Yet institutional mechanisms are still lacking to transform the value of the standing forest into the foundation of an economy based on maintaining rather than destroying this ecosystem. Forest management for commodities such as timber and non-timber forest products faces severe limitations and inherent contradictions unless income is supplemented based on environmental services. Amazon forest is threatened by deforestation, logging, forest fires and climate change. Measures to avoid deforestation include repression through command and control, creation of protected areas, and reformulation of infrastructure decisions and development policies. An economy primarily based on the value of environmental services is essential for long-term maintenance of the forest. Much progress has been made in the decades since I first proposed such a transition, but many issues also remain unresolved.

The poor winter pasture management associated to the use of soybean monoculture in the summer may be restrictive for the incorporation of plant residues into the soil and reduce soil organic carbon stocks. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the increase of winter pasture grazing frequencies and summer crop systems on the soil organic C stock. The experiment was carried out for four years under no-tillage and the experiment had a randomized block design and a 3 x 3 bifactorial arrangement with four replications. Factor A consisted of three grazing intervals in the winter: No grazing (NG), Grazing every 28 days (G28) and Grazing every 14 days (G14); and factor B consisted of three summer-cropping systems: Soybean monoculture (Mon-S), Corn monoculture (Mon-C) and annual soybean-corn rotation (Rot-S/C). The addition of C to the soil through plant residues and the soil organic C stock were quantified by the methodologies of equivalent soil layer and equivalent soil mass. The increase of the grazing frequencies reduced the C input by winter forages from 5.3 Mg ha-1 in treatment NG, to 1.7 and 1.3 Mg ha-1 in the treatments G28 and G14, respectively. Corn as summer crop resulted in the highest C input to the soil with a mean of 6.0 Mg ha-1, while the soybean input was only 2.2 Mg ha-1. The soil organic C stock calculated by the equivalent soil layer method was overestimated in the treatments G14 and G28 and underestimated in treatment NG as compared to results obtained by the soil mass equivalent method, which was used to compare the management systems. The organic C stock in the layers 0-0.025, 0.025-0.05 and 0.05-0.10 m had a linear relationship with the annual C supply through plants (winter pastures + summer crops), requiring an additional 4.48 Mg ha-1 year-1 to maintain the original organic C stock in the 0-0.10 m layer. The lower C supply through plant residues in the G14 treatment resulted in an estimated net C emission to the atmosphere (0.05 to 0.27 Mg ha-1 year-1), while the soil in treatment NG acted as an atmospheric C sink (0.19 to 0.30 Mg ha-1 year-1). In treatment G28, the soil performance as source or sink of atmospheric C was dependent on the summer crop type; A soil net C emission was verified under Mon-S (0.04 Mg ha-1 year-1) and a net C retention under Mon- C (0.15 Mg ha-1 year-1) and Rot-S/C (0.11 Mg ha-1 year-1).

We analyzed the dynamics of vegetation types along 44 years, at Assis Ecological Station, one of the rare conservation units protecting the cerrado biome in the southeastern São Paulo State, Brazil, with the aim of characterizing and quantifying those changes in space and time. Protected against human pressures since a long time, field observations have shown an upgrade of local cerrado physiognomies, through a successional process whose structural climax can be a forest physiognomy, with a continuous arboreal stratum. The dynamics of the vegetation types was analyzed by using aerial photographs (1962, 1984 and 1994), Quick Bird satellite images (2006) and field surveys. During this 44 years period, field physiognomies were reduced from 23% to less than 1% of the total area studied. In the other extreme, woodland savanna increased from 53% to 91% of the area. Changes did not happen at the same rhythm across the area, and that is apparently correlated to microclimate and edaphyc differences. We believe that field and savannic physiognomies initially existing were mostly maintained due to heavy human pressures, constraining the secondary succession towards an edapho-climatic climax of greater biomass.

Consequently, changes in soil management may alter SOC content. No-tillage (NT) practices are potential ways to increase SOC. We studied the SOC from agricultural soils in the Cerrados in Central Brazil. We compared two different tillage systems: conservation agriculture with no-tillage under cover crops (NT) and disc tillage (DT) for 5 years in a context of rainfed rice production. The soil is a dark red Oxisol with high clay content (about 40%). The objectives of the study were: (i) to evaluate the short-term (5 years) impact of tillage systems on SOC stocks in an Oxisol and (ii) to better understand the dynamics of SOC in different fractions of this soil. We first studied the initial situation in 1998, and compared it to the 2003 situation. NT with cover crop (Crotalaria) was found to increase the storage of C in the topsoil layer (0-10 cm) compared to DT. The difference observed for the 0-10 cm layer under NT in comparison with DT represented C enrichment under no-tillage amounting to 0.35 Mg C ha-1 year-1 and corresponding to less than 10% of cover crops residues returned to the soil. A particle-size fractionation of soil organic matter (SOM) showed that differences in total SOC between NT and DT mainly affected the 0-2 μm fraction and, to a smaller extent the 2-20 μm fraction. This specific enrichment of SOC in the silt and clay fraction was attributed to (i) the storage of a water soluble C in the field and (ii) the effect of soil biota and especially fauna activity. The mean residence time of carbon associated with the fine fractions being rather long, it might be assumed that the preferential storage in fine fractions resulted in a long-term carbon storage.

The future of Amazonian indigenous reserves is of strategic importance for the fate of biodiversity in the region. We examined the legislation governing resource use on indigenous lands and summarize the history of the Kayapo people's consolidation of their >100,000 km2 territory. Like many Amazonian indigenous peoples, the Kayapo have halted the expansion of the agricultural frontier on their lands but allow selective logging and gold mining. Prospects for long-term conservation and sustainability in these lands depend on indigenous peoples' understandings of their resource base and on available economic alternatives. Although forest conservation is not guaranteed by either tenure security or indigenous knowledge, indigenous societies' relatively egalitarian common-property resource management regimes - along with adequate incentives and long-term partnerships with conservation organizations - can achieve this result. Successful initiatives include Conservation International's long-term project with the A'ukre Kayapo village and incipient large-scale territorial monitoring and control in the Kayapo territory, and the Instituto SocioAmbiental (ISA) 15-year partnership with the peoples of the Xingu Indigenous Park, with projects centered on territorial monitoring and control, education, community organization, and economic alternatives.

At the landscape level, we should maintain defined minimum areas of natural forest wherever feasible, and vigorously pursue reforestation in other areas. We should aim at soil, water, and biodiversity conservation, and multiple and sustainable use of forests. It is important that the local people accept the principles of planting native rather than exotic species, and mixed species rather than monoculture, as well as providing structural diversity to the plantation profile. In Southeast Asia and Papua New Guinea, experimental work on reforestation using indigenous tree species has already begun (Sakurai 1997; Tropical Forest Reforestation Technology Research Association 1997). In Australia, the Rainforest Cooperative Research Centre is conducting research into biodiversity values in reforestation in order to assess the patterns, causes, and consequences of biotic changes during reforestation, and to devise restoration methods within multiple-use landscapes (Catterall 2000). The data accumulating at the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites of intact forests will permit testing of the parameters to be used in sustainability models. Comprehensive baseline data are also expected from the International Biodiversity Observation Year (IBOY), which started in 2001 (DIWPA: DIVERSITAS in Western Pacific and Asia, IUBS). Conservation priorities of biodiversity hot spots have already been identified on a global basis (Myers et al. 2000). It is hoped that future reforestation will be able to incorporate regional biodiversity conservation into its program. © Springer-Verlag Tokyo 2006.

Shaded agroforestry systems can still support high levels of biodiversity, even resembling those supported by undisturbed forests, but intensively managed open agroforestry systems may cause severe losses in insect diversity. In this study we evaluate the conservation value of agroforestry systems for species richness and diversity (Simpson’s index) of four insect groups at natural forest sites and three different types of cacao-dominated agroforestry systems in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. The agroforestry systems were characterised by low, intermediate and high diversity of shade trees. Each habitat type was studied with 4 replicates, i.e. 16 study sites altogether. We compared responses of solitary bees and wasps, dung beetles and lower canopy dwelling beetles and ants. These taxa represent diverse and functionally important insect groups: solitary bees and wasps act as crop pollinators or pest predators, dung beetles as decomposers of mammalian excrements and canopy dwelling beetles and ants include abundant herbivores and predators. High percentages of forest species did not occur in agroforestry systems, but diversity and species richness in agroforests remained as high as or even higher than in the forest lower canopy. Diversity, species richness and abundance of the functionally important dung beetles and canopy ants showed strong resilience against both forest conversion and changes in agroforestry management. Diversity, species richness and abundance of solitary bees and wasps as well as canopy beetles even seemed to profit from the effects of opening the upper canopy that was related to forest conversion and changes in shade tree compositions. On the latter two groups the effects of opening the upper canopy were stronger than effects of reduced shade tree richness. Based on our results, we recommend the inclusion of agroforestry systems with a diversity of shade trees in tropical conservation plans in addition to pristine forest reserves. Furthermore, regional differences in local agroforestry management contributed to between 31% (for dung beetles) and 58% (for canopy beetles) of the total species richness, which stresses the importance of conservation policies aimed at a diversity of habitat types on a broader landscape scale. © 2007, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",agroforestry and ants and beetles and biodiversity and conservation and habitat preference and knockdown fogging and lower canopy and management and pit-fall traps and solitary bees and solitary wasps and trap nests and Biodiversity and Conservation and Ecosystems and Housing and Living systems studies and Mammals and Tropics and Agroforestry system and Conservation plans and Conservation policy and Conservation values and Regional differences and Species richness and diversities and Tropical rain forest and Undisturbed forests and Forestry,10.1007/978-3-540-30290-2_14,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060340172&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-540-30290-2_14&partnerID=40&md5=0428c2dae54d82529b2a73e1e975f2df,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 13,NA,CHAP,NA,277,294,NA,NA,1863-5520 and 1863-5539 and 978-3-540-30289-6,WOS:000248525000014,NA,"Tscharntke, T and Leuschner, C and Zeller, M and Guhardja, E and Bidin, A",International Symposium on Stability of Tropical Rainforest Margins,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","3307, 5598"

One frequently recommended instrument is to intensify farming systems in the adjacent areas, so as to decrease the need to harvest resources from national parks. This study examined this issue by analyzing the effects of different household land uses in villages near a national park on their propensity to harvest resources from the park. In the northern part of the Kerinci Seblat National Park (Sumatra Island, Indonesia) the park buffer zone is comprised largely of community or village forests and human settlements. The village forests were formerly managed as production forests and provided significant cash income to the village. They were converted into farmland, particularly to mixed-tree gardens or agroforests. Natural forest coverage has now declined to 10% of the former area within village forest land. We analyzed the characteristics of the mixed gardens and village forests, and their practical contribution to reducing farmers' dependence on the adjacent national park resources. Households with farms that were more diversified were found to have much less dependency on the national park resources. Households that farmed only wetland rice fields registered the highest value of forest products obtained from inside the park. Households that farmed only mixed gardens had an intermediate level of park resource extraction, while those that had farms composed of both components (i.e. wetland rice fields and mixed gardens) had a dramatically lower level of economic dependency on park resources than households in either of the other two categories.",Buffer zones and Community forest and Conservation and Mixed gardens and Rubber and Indonesia and agroforestry and forest garden and national park and resource management,10.1023/A:1012047602192,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0034787638&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1012047602192&partnerID=40&md5=dac768f0acccf59625ec218389aa93d0,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 57,NA,JOUR,3,171,184,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,3308

Deforestation typically leads to changes in climate, biodiversity, hydrological cycle, and soil degradation. Vegetation succession plays an important role in soil restoration through accumulation of vegetation biomass and improved soil/plant interaction. However, relationships between succession and soil properties are not well known. For example, how does vegetation succession affect nutrient accumulation? Which soil factors are important in influencing vegetation growth? What is the best way to evaluate soil fertility in the Amazon basin? This paper focuses on the interrelationships between secondary succession and soil properties. Field soil sample data and vegetation inventory data were collected in two regions of Brazilian Amazonia (Altamira and Bragantina). Soil nutrients and texture were analyzed at successional forest sites. Multiple regression models were used to identify the important soil properties affecting vegetation growth, and a soil evaluation factor (SEF) was developed for evaluating soil fertility in Alfisols, Ultisols, and Oxisols, which differ in the ways they affect vegetation growth. For example, the upper 40 cm of soil is most important for vegetation growth in Alfisols, but in Ultisols and Oxisols deeper horizons significantly influence vegetation growth rates. Accumulation of vegetation biomass increased soil fertility and improved soil physical structure in Alfisols but did not completely compensate for the nutrient losses in Ultisols and Oxisols; however, it significantly reduced the rate of nutrient loss.

Of particular concern are the transaction costs incurred in developing projects, measuring, certifying, and selling the carbon-sequestration services generated by such projects. This paper addresses these issues by reviewing the implications of transaction and abatement costs in carbon-sequestration projects. An approach to estimating abatement costs is demonstrated through four case studies of agroforestry systems located in Sumatra, Indonesia.

Because of their exceptional contribution to global biological diversity, the conservation of the Central Sulawesi (Indonesia) rainforests is a particularly important case for a successful application of such strategies. One of the obstacles to the design and implementation of economically sound conservation strategies is the lack of knowledge on the economic value of non-market benefits generated by tropical forest ecosystems and the agricultural land use systems that replace them. In this paper, we identify and quantify economically relevant preferences towards biological diversity at the rainforest margin that operate at the regional level around Lore Lindu National Park in Central Sulawesi. For economic valuation, choice experiments (CE) were used. We focused on indirect use benefits generated from different local and regional ecosystem functions. An ecosystem service approach was applied to avoid problems of respondent unfamiliarity with ecosystem functioning. One CE study covers preferences for the conservation of the endemic dwarf buffalo anoa, the preponderance of shading trees in cacao plantations, and the availability of water and of rattan. It was conducted in 12 villages across the entire project region (n=249). A second CE was conducted in three selected villages in the Kulawi subdistrict investigating preferences for protection against soil erosion, flooding and — to our knowledge, for the first time ever — for protection against uncertain future environmental threats (preferences for “ecosystem health”; n=585). The results indicate substantial economic preferences for all biodiversity and ecosystem goods and services studied. Preference variations can be explained by attitudes of and perceptions on the human-environment relation. In particular, (i) several attitudinal variables from Protection Motivation Theory explain preference heterogeneity; (ii) preferences for ecosystem health depend on stated respect for Katawua — a normative principle on harmony between humans, supreme beings, and the environment. For an optimistic resource and biodiversity protection scenario, total aggregated mean WTP in the project region is 1.6 billion IDR/yri ∼136,000 €/yr).

The diversity of shade trees varies from monospecific to highly diverse canopies, characteristic of pristine Atlantic Forest. This study evaluates the relationships between family richness of Hymenoptera-Parasitica and Chrysidoidea, and tree species richness and density, the species richness of herbaceous understorey, and the area and age of the cacao agroforestry system. We sampled 16 cacao agroforestry systems, with canopy diversity ranging from one to 22 tree species per hectare, in three seasons: summer (March), winter (August) and spring (November). Parasitoids were sampled using eight Malaise-Townes traps per site. Tree species richness and density were enumerated within 1 ha at each site, and herbaceous plant species richness was calculated in eight 1 m2 plots, within the hectare. The number of parasitoid families increased with tree species richness and density in spring and summer, but decreased in winter. Neither species richness of herbaceous plants nor area and age of the system affected parasitoid family richness. We suggest that the increase of parasitoid diversity with tree species richness and density in warmer seasons reflects increasing heterogeneity and availability of resources. The decrease in parasitoid family number with tree density in winter may be due to local impoverishment of resources, leading to parasitoid emigration to neighbouring forest remnants. This result implies that a higher diversity of shade trees will help to maintain high parasitoid levels and, in consequence, higher levels of natural enemies of cacao pests, particularly in the warmer seasons. This prediction is borne out in the experience of cacao producers. The proper management of shade tree diversity will play a vital role in maintaining the sustainability of cacao agroforestry production systems in the tropics and, concurrently, will maintain high biodiversity values in these locations. © 2004 Elsevier GmbH.

In the soil under A. mangium, the stocks of organic matter in the L and F horizons were higher, and the C/N ratio was lower, due to the high nitrogen content of the leaf material. The same was observed for the A horizon chemical properties: the C and nutrients concentrations of the soil fine fraction were higher under A. mangium. The comparison of the C and nutrient concentrations between the A11 and A12 horizons and between the aggregate fraction and fine fraction showed similar trends in both sites.

This study is the first of a series aimed at assessing the appropriateness of tree-based land-use systems as alternatives to continuous cropping and/or Imperata-fallow systems. The performance of a Gliricidia sepium woodlot, grown over 25 years and under various pruning and harvesting regimes, was assessed through modelling. The assessment was based on the system's ability to sequester and store carbon, maintain land productivity, and be financially profitable for landholders. It was found that the system was profitable under most management regimes tested. Profits were maximised by pruning and harvesting as much biomass as possible when no carbon payments were available, but this strategy decreased system productivity and profitability in the long run. Carbon-sequestration payments encouraged landholders to adopt less intensive practices since net revenues were higher with carbon payments. It was also shown that the carbon pools included in a carbon-trading scheme were sensitive to carbon-measuring costs. For example, if the annual cost of measuring soil carbon was greater than US$1.19 ha-1 it would not be economical to account for this pool in a carbon-sequestration project. © Springer 2005.",Economic analysis and Firewood and Indonesia and Simulation model and Gliricidia sepium and Imperata and agroforestry and carbon sequestration and clean development mechanism and emissions trading and soil carbon,10.1007/s10457-004-3938-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-22144498505&doi=10.1007%2fs10457-004-3938-8&partnerID=40&md5=87a377cee26661ed4665826edc26e9b0,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 15,NA,JOUR,3,237,250,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,3329

Studying this system at different levels of disturbance increases our knowledge about its stability and mechanisms of diversity changes. While most studies investigating the effects of disturbance on animal populations focus on canopy communities, the present study reviews the driving factors for soil and litter arthropod communities. In addition, results from a study along a land use gradient in Central Sulawesi (Indonesia) will be discussed. Within natural forests, litter composition, patchiness and especially litter abundance seem to be key factors driving litter arthropod diversity and densities, by creating microhabitats for many species and individuals. With increasing levels of disturbance in tropical forests, and with forest conversion into agroforestry and agricultural systems, soil/litter temperature and moisture levels become extremely important, leading to reduced densities and species richness. Changes of soil pH, a reduction of the litter habitat and increased anthropogenic disturbance via site management practices add to degradation. In the present study, litter arthropod communities were compared between three levels of forest use (none, small and large timber extraction) and two types of cacao plantations (under natural shade trees and under a polyculture of planted shade trees). The negative effects of increasing gap fraction and thus increasing temperatures accompanied by decreasing moisture levels and litter depth could be confirmed. Abundances of Collembola, Oribatida and Symphyla in litter and soil and the number of ant species in the litter declined with increasing land use intensity. In contrast, spider density and ant activity increased when natural forest sites were compared with the two types of cacao plantations. This can be explained by the shifting community structure of these two taxa, indicating that few, but abundant species of open habitats, such as Lycosidae, were replacing forest species. Surprisingly, the decline in microarthropod abundances along the land use gradient was not linearly correlated with decreasing moisture and litter depth or increasing temperature or litter quality (C-to-N ratio). Rather low microarthropod densities were already measured in little disturbed natural forest sites with small timber extraction. A similar pattern was observed for fungal abundances and root production, indicating that even small levels of disturbance influence the litter and soil system in tropical forests. On the one hand, changing microclimate, limited litter space, reduced availability of microbial resources and increased disturbance by plot maintenance inhibit higher densities of litter and soil animal populations. On the other hand, the simplified habitat structure favours populations of open habitats, especially predatory groups adapted to higher temperatures and/or lower soil moisture. It has to be investigated how a reduction of decomposers and an increase in predators could influence pest control and thus yields in these agroforestry systems. © 2007, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",ants and cacao plantations and disturbance and forest conversion and litter arthropods and litter habitat and microarthropods and moisture and rainforest and shade trees and soil fauna and spiders and temperature and Agricultural robots and Animals and Biodiversity and Ecosystems and Extraction and Land use and Moisture determination and Soil moisture and Timber and Tropics and Agricultural system and Agroforestry system and Animal populations and Anthropogenic disturbance and Community structures and Forest disturbances and Increasing temperatures and Tropical rain forest and Forestry,10.1007/978-3-540-30290-2_8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108403604&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-540-30290-2_8&partnerID=40&md5=442f630de9fbce8f0e8884917b882985,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 9,NA,CHAP,NA,147,163,NA,NA,1863-5520 and 1863-5539 and 978-3-540-30289-6,WOS:000248525000008,NA,"Tscharntke, T and Leuschner, C and Zeller, M and Guhardja, E and Bidin, A",International Symposium on Stability of Tropical Rainforest Margins,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","3334, 4559"

If the incentive provided by carbon markets is large enough, this may alter the economics of growing trees, which is often not an attractive land-use alternative due to high establishment costs and delayed revenues. In this paper, the effect of carbon payments on the economic attractiveness of growing trees is investigated for a tree-crop agroforest in Indonesia using a simulation-modelling approach. An economic model is developed to analyze the economic implications of carbon payments from the standpoint of the individual landholder. The simulation is implemented in WaNuLCAS, a model that accounts for water, nutrients, light and carbon in agroforestry systems. The value of switching from a continuous-cropping system to an agroforestry system participating in carbon trading was estimated at $109 ha-1 in present value terms. Although these results vary depending on assumptions regarding carbon prices and costs of carbon monitoring, they essentially show that the benefits of participating in markets for carbon sequestration can exceed the costs. The optimal management regime, both with and without carbon payments, was to plant 15% of the area to trees and to adopt a low firewood-harvest regime, with 75% of tree prunings being returned to the soil to restore carbon and nutrients. Approximately 22% of the economic benefits obtained by switching land use were attributed to carbon trading and the remaining 78% were attributed to improvements in land productivity. The paper ends with a brief discussion of the implications of the findings for policy and management. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Case studies were conducted in both developing and developed countries. 1. In southern Sumatra, Indonesia, 88,369 Mg-C year-1 of wood residue from a plantation forest and excess bark from a pulp mill would be converted into 15,571 Mg-C year-1 of the net carbon sink by biochar for soil improvement. The fixed carbon recovery of the system is 21.0%. 2. In a semiarid region in western Australia, the carbonization of wood residue was incorporated with multipurpose projects of a mallee eucalyptus plantation that involved the function of salinity prevention. During the project period of 35 years, the total carbon sink would reach 1,035,450 Mg-C with 14.0% by aboveground biomass, 33.1% by belowground biomass and 52.8% by biochar in soil. 3. In southern Kyushu, Japan, the study was focused on the effective use of surplus heat from a garbage incinerator for carbonizing woody materials. Sawdust of 936.0 Mg-C year-1 would be converted into the net carbon sink of 298.5 Mg-C year-1 by carbonization, with the fixed carbon recovery of the system being 31.9%. Consequently, the CFC project could encourage the creation of a carbon sink in soil.

Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is a main component of Brazilian agriculture, and enhancement of yields has been achieved under NT as a result of mitigation of environmental stresses, resulting in higher N2 fixation. However, the effects of NT on rhizobial diversity are poorly understood. This study evaluated rhizobial diversity in soils planted to common bean under NT or conventional tillage (CT) systems that were compared with natural grassland used for grazing, in the State of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil. Genetic diversity was assessed by the amplification of the DNA by PCR with specific primers (BOX-PCR) and by RFLP-PCR analyses of the 16S rDNA region. A high level of diversity was observed among strains from all three systems, such that the similarity in the clustering analysis of BOX-PCR products ranged from 36% under natural grassland to only 23% for CT strains. High polymorphism was confirmed in the RFLP-PCR analysis; forty-seven different profiles were obtained, none sharing high similarity with the profiles of reference species of common bean rhizobia. These results indicate that other tropical rhizobial species remain to be described. Genetic diversity was higher among the NT than the CT rhizobial strains, especially when the RFLP-PCR profiles were considered. Genetic diversity in the natural grassland was lower than in the cropped systems, possibly due to absence of the host plant and stubble burning in winter. Average yields in the area under NT (e.g. common bean, approximately 1500 kg ha-1) have been about 30% higher than under CT, therefore high rhizobial diversity may be a parameter indicative of superior soil quality. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Appropriate baseline data are rarely available. As part of a broader study on biodiversity and profitability, we examined the impact of different cropping methods on biodiversity (plant species richness) along a subjectively determined land-use intensity gradient in southern Sumatra, ranging from primary and secondary forest to coffee-farming systems (simple, complex, with and without shade crops) and smallholder coffee plantings, at increasing levels of intensity. We used 24 (40 × 5 m) plots to record site physical data, including soil nutrients and soil texture together with vegetation structure, all vascular plant species, and plant functional types (PFTs - readily observable, adaptive, morphological features). Biodiversity was lowest under simple, intensive, non-shaded farming systems and increased progressively through shaded and more complex agroforests to late secondary and closed-canopy forests. The most efficient single indicators of biodiversity and soil nutrient status were PFT richness and a derived measure of plant functional complexity. Vegetation structure, tree dry weight, and duration of the land-use type, to a lesser degree, were also highly correlated with biodiversity. Together with a vegetation, or V index, the close correspondence between these variables and soil nutrients suggests they are potentially useful indicators of coffee production and profitability across different farming systems. These findings provide a unique quantitative basis for a subsequent study of the nexus between biodiversity and profitability.

These systems contribute simultaneously to sustaining rural livelihoods and to the conservation of biodiversity, but their productivity is usually low. Introduction of high yielding germplasm, usually selected in monocultural plantations, is a potential way to increase productivity, but a critical requirement is that such plants can be established in a competitive multispecies environment. The establishment of clonal planting stock in the jungle rubber agroforests of Indonesia was explored through participatory on-farm research. The trial involved four farmers who grew clonal rubber trees in a total of 20 plots, constituting five replicate experimental blocks spread across four farms. Unexpectedly, vertebrate pest damage by monkeys (Presbytis melalophos nobilis) and wild pigs (Sus scrofa) was the most important influence on establishment, explaining almost 70% of the variation in rubber tree growth. The amount of labour invested in weeding was also positively correlated with rubber tree growth. Farmers generally decided to completely cut back vegetation between rows of rubber trees, including potentially valuable trees, rather than weeding within the rows and selectively pruning trees in the inter-row. Farmers thought that the inter-row vegetation would harbour vertebrate pests and compete with the clonal rubber, and they had access to fruits, firewood and other non-timber forest products from other land. Thus, contrary to expectations, when offered clonal germplasm, farmers opted to use plantation monoculture methods to protect what they considered a valuable asset, rather than maintain the traditional multispecies strategy they use with local germplasm.",Hevea brasiliensis and Pests and Secondary forest and Smallholders and Weeding and Indonesia and Hevea brasiliensis and Presbytis melalophos and Sus scrofa and Vertebrata and agroforestry and assessment method and pest damage and rubber and smallholder,10.1023/A:1013336822923,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035702046&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1013336822923&partnerID=40&md5=3888ddb2f3260a4bfde82f707908cacd,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 21,NA,CONF,2,227,237,NA,NA,0167-4366 and 1572-9680,WOS:000172858700015,NA,NA,International Symposium on Multistrata Agroforestry Systems with Perennial Crops,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","3350, 5518"

We used inventories of trees, understory plants, birds (subdivided into endemics, insectivores, frugivores/nectar feeders), butterflies (endemics, fruit feeders), and dung beetles in Sulawesi (Indonesia) to characterize a gradient from near-primary to secondary forests, agroforestry systems, and annual crops.

Although biodiversity of land-use systems showed taxonomic group- and guild-specific differences, most groups were affected in a similar way by habitat modification.

We show results of an economic evaluation of coffee bee pollination services and pest control in two distinct tropical regions: a low human-impact area in Indonesia with continuous near natural forests neighboring agroforestry and a high-impact landscape in Ecuador with almost no forest fragments left. We evaluate bee pollination services comparing forest destruction scenarios, where coffee yields depend on forests providing nesting sites and foraging habitats for bees and present three novel approaches: first, we show how net coffee revenues depend on pollination services of adjacent forests considering berry weight in addition to fruit set, thereby providing a more comprehensive evaluation. Second, we combine our findings on pollination with an assessment of pest management affecting coffee production. Third, we determine net welfare effects of land-use changes including the fact that former forestland is normally used for alternative crops. In both regions, crop revenues exceed coffee pollination values, generating incentives to convert forest margins even if owners would be compensated for pollination services. The promotion of certified “biodiversity-friendly” coffee is a feasible option to maintain shade-coffee systems for conservation purposes.

Quantitative trade-offs and complementarities were analysed between global environmental benefits and local profitability. The current trend towards simplification of the complex agro-ecosystems and inherent loss of environmental services of forests is driven by profitability. The sequence in which environmental services of forests are lost is: standing carbon stocks, biodiversity, and low or negative greenhouse gas emissions.",Agronomic sustainability and Biodiversity and Carbon stock and Emission and Greenhouse gas and Trade-off analysis and Indonesia and Jambi Province and Sumatra and agroecology and biodiversity and carbon sequestration and ecosystem service and global change and greenhouse gas and land use and sustainability,10.1111/j.1654-1103.2002.tb02067.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036621975&doi=10.1111%2fj.1654-1103.2002.tb02067.x&partnerID=40&md5=7f42b727c5a0a0ff53caa228e4cfb43c,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 53,NA,JOUR,3,429,438,NA,JUN,1100-9233,WOS:000178428000014,NA,NA,IGBP Terrestrial Transects Workshop,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","3370, 5480"

However, little information is available on the conservation value of different land uses, especially those of commercial tree plantations. We studied bird communities in native forests and in commercial plantations of an exotic (Pinus spp.) and a native (Araucaria angustifolia) tree species, through local and regional surveys in the Upper Paraná Atlantic Forest, Argentina. Bird species richness was 50% lower in plantations than in native forests, showing the negative impact of replacing the natural forest with tree plantations. Both species richness and composition were similar between Pine and Araucaria plantations (independently of the extent of the surveyed area); yet, there is a threatened species only found in Araucaria forests. Estimated bird richness in native forests was higher in the regional than in the local survey, likely reflecting habitat heterogeneity. Forest-dependent and threatened species were especially affected by the replacement of native forest; bird communities in commercial plantations were mainly composed of forest-generalist and edge species rather than forest-dependent species. Our study demonstrates that major changes in bird species richness and composition are associated with forest replacement by commercial tree plantations under the current management conditions. Many silvicultural measures could favor bird communities, such as the protection of forest remnants inside plantations and the improvement of forest belts between stands. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We used density and particle size SOM fractionations to evaluate changes in SOM for a chronosequence of eucalyptus plantations established on degraded pastures in two contrasting regions in southeastern Brazil. Declines in the content of soil C derived from the pasture (C4 photosynthetic pathway) and the accumulation of that derived from the eucalyptus (C3 photosynthetic pathway) were followed through 13C natural abundance of the SOM. The two study areas were in the Rio Doce River Valley, Minas Gerais State, namely: 1, Belo Oriente (BO, a region with lower elevation, higher mean annual temperature, lower forest productivities and dominated by clayey Typic Haplustoxs); 2, Virginópolis (VG, a region of higher elevation, higher forest productivities and dominated by clayey Rhodic Ustoxs). In the BO region the chronosequence included 0, 4.2, 13.2, 22.2, 32.0 and 34.2 years of eucalyptus cultivation and in the VG region soils were cultivated with eucalyptus for 0, 8.2, 19.2, 29.2 and 33.2 years. The accumulated cultivation time corresponds to about five rotations. In both regions the initial soil condition was represented by a site that was still under pasture. Soil samples collected at 0-10 and 10-20 cm depths were analyzed for: total organic carbon (TOC); C in the fulvic (FAF), humic (HAF) and humin (HF) fractions; C in the free (FLF) and occluded (OLF) light fractions; C associated with the heavy fractions, namely, the sand (SF), silt plus clay (S + CF) and clay (CF) fractions; and C in the microbial biomass (MB). Carbon stocks of virtually all SOM fractions were about twice as high in the VG region than in the BO region. Eucalyptus cultivation in the BO region increased C stocks in all SOM fractions, except for the MB fraction that was not altered and the SF fraction that declined with time of eucalyptus cultivation. Increases in TOC, FAF and HF organic C fractions were observed in the VG region. Mean annual accumulations across the entire cultivation period in the 0-10 cm soil layer showed virtually no difference averaging 0.22 Mg C ha-1 year-1 for the BO region and 0.23 Mg C ha-1 year-1 for the VG region. However, gains of TOC peaked by the end of the third rotation in the BO region and the second rotation in the VG region, so the TOC accumulation rate during the respective aggrading periods would correspond to 0.35 and 0.57 Mg C ha-1 year-1. There was no clear evidence that the more labile, fast cycling SOM fractions were more sensitive indicators of the impact of eucalyptus cultivation in the BO region, whereas in the VG region the FLF and OLF were more sensitive to the land use change than TOC. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Apart from its economic and social role, the cabruca system is said to be important for the conservation of Atlantic forest biodiversity. In this paper we studied tree species richness and forest structure of cabrucas to examine the demographic health of these forests and discuss their long-term survival. Data were collected in 20 farms located alongside a 30km track of the northern margin of the Rio Doce, in northern Espírito Santo. All trees ≥5cm DBH were identified and their diameter was measured in 80 plots (600m 2), totalling 4.8ha of sampled area. Recorded trees were also allocated to four different regeneration phases (pioneers, early secondary, late secondary and climax). The inventory resulted in 507 trees belonging to 105 species in 39 families. This species richness is much lower than in less disturbed forests located in the region. Pioneers and early secondary species dominate the cabruca forest in terms of number of species (56.2%), density (71.0%) and basal area (72.3%). The distribution of diameter frequency showed an imbalance in tree regeneration. Most trees in the range of 5-30cm DBH were pioneers (40.7%), or early secondary species (32.6%), while late secondary and climax trees were less frequent (10.2 and 16.5% of the sampled trees, respectively). The dominance of species of early regeneration phases was also observed for trees >30cm DBH (69.0% of pioneers or early secondary and 31.0% of late secondary or climax species). The results indicated that the cabruca forests are not only less diverse and less dense than secondary or primary forests of the region, but also, and more importantly, their natural succession and gap dynamics are being severely impaired. As a consequence, cabrucas present a structure where tree species of late successional phases are becoming increasingly rare while pioneers and early secondary species are becoming dominant. If current management practices of thinning and clearing of native trees are not improved, the long-term survival of these forests is questionable and their role in maintaining biodiversity in the long run is limited.",Agroforestry systems and Atlantic forest and Biodiversity conservation and Brazil and Cocoa tree and Theobroma cacao and Bahia and Brazil and Espirito Santo and South America and Western Hemisphere and World and Theobroma and Theobroma cacao and agroforestry and biodiversity and forest dynamics and gap dynamics and species richness and stand structure and succession,10.1007/s10531-004-2142-5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-10344240974&doi=10.1007%2fs10531-004-2142-5&partnerID=40&md5=f09012c9025f0b7a304134593819ef58,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 87,NA,JOUR,14,2679,2694,NA,DEC,0960-3115 and 1572-9710,WOS:000225468900006,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","3376, 5533"

Studies on the impact of these man-induced changes on biodiversity are of urgent conservation concern. We compared the fruit-feeding butterfly assemblage of a natural hill forest to that of a disturbed hill forest, representing a mosaic of old secondary forest and recently abandoned or active subsistence farms. Overall, species richness seemed highest in the disturbed site, but both abundance and diversity of endemic butterflies were significantly higher in the natural forest. Although the butterfly assemblage showed a clear vertical structure in the natural forest, vertical stratification was no longer pronounced at the disturbed site. Comparative studies based on diversity estimates from ground samples should consider not only the scale at which sampling is carried out and influences from nearby habitat patches in the surrounding landscape mosaic, but also possible behavioural changes in stratified species after forest modification.

A total of 51 standard 0.16 ha plots in primary forest, rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) agroforests and rubber plantations was compared for plot level diversity (average number of species per plot) and landscape level diversity (species-area curves). Average plot level species richness (11 species) was not significantly different amongst the three land use types. However at the landscape level the species-area curve for rubber agroforests (also called jungle rubber) had a significantly higher slope parameter than the curve for rubber plantations, indicating higher beta diversity in jungle rubber as compared to rubber plantations. Plot level species richness is thus not fully indicative of the (relative) richness of a land use type at the landscape scale because scaling relations differ between land use types. Terrestrial fern species can serve as indicators of disturbance or forest quality as many species show clear habitat differentiation with regard to light conditions and/or humidity. To assess forest habitat quality in rubber production systems as compared to primary forest, terrestrial pteridophyte species were grouped according to their ecological requirements into 'forest species' and 'non-forest species'. Species-area curves based on 'forest species' alone show that the understorey environment of jungle rubber supports intermediate numbers of 'forest species' and is much more forest-like than that of rubber plantations, but less than primary forest. Species richness alone, without a priori ecological knowledge of the species involved, did not provide this information. Jungle rubber systems can play a role in conservation of part of the primary rain forest species, especially in areas where the primary forest has already disappeared. In places where primary forest is gone, jungle rubber can conserve part of the primary forest species, but large areas of jungle rubber are needed. In places where primary forest is still present, priority should be given to conservation of remaining primary forest patches. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Some of the issues, which need to be addressed, include identifying the types of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation activities in LULUCF, which could be undertaken as CDM projects. Other issues involve evaluating the mitigation potential and cost effectiveness of the activities, as well as their likely socio-economic impacts and their influence on the national carbon (C) stock. Three broad categories of mitigation activities in LULUCF analyzed in this study include managing C storage, C conservation and carbon substitution. The C intensity of the activities was estimated to range from 37 to 218 Mg C per ha. The highest is in reforested land with slow growing species and the lowest in short-rotation plantations. At a real discount rate of 10%, investment costs required to implement the mitigation activities ranged from US$ 0.07 to 0.88 per Mg C, with life cycle costs ranging from US$ 0.07 to 3.87 per Mg C, and benefits ranging from US$ -0.81 to 6.57 per Mg C. Mitigation options with negative benefits are forest protection, reforestation, reduced impact logging and enhanced natural regeneration, while those with positive benefits are short rotation timber plantation, and bio-energy. Reforestation gave negative benefit since no revenue from wood as trees are left in the forest for conservation, while Reduced Impact Logging (RIL) and Enhanced Natural Regeneration (ENR) gave negative benefits because additional cost required to implement the options could not be compensated by the increase in round-hardwood yield. Other factor is that the local price of round-hardwood is very low, i.e. US$160 per m3, while FOB price is between 250-400 US$ per m3. Total area available for implementing mitigation options (planting trees) in 1997 was 31 million hectares (× 106 ha) (about 40% are critical lands, 35% grasslands and 25% unproductive lands). Total area being considered for implementing the options under baseline, government-plans and mitigation scenarios in the period 2000-2030 is 12.6, 16.3 and 23.6 × 106 ha respectively. Furthermore, total area of production forest being considered for implementing reduced impact logging and enrichment planting under the tree scenarios is 9, 26 and 16 × 106 ha respectively, and that for forest protection is 2.1, 3.7, 3.1 × 106 ha respectively. The cumulative investment for implementing all mitigation activities in the three scenarios was estimated at 595, 892 and 1026 million US$ respectively. National C stock under the baseline scenario will continuously decline through 2030, while under government-plans and mitigation scenarios the carbon stock increases. In 2030, national C stock of the government and mitigation scenarios is almost the same, 13% higher than that of baseline. However, the increase in national carbon stock in both scenarios could not offset carbon emissions due to deforestation.",Carbon (C) sink and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Comprehensive assessment of mitigation process and Deforestation and Forestation and Land Use and Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) and Mitigation and Indonesia and carbon sequestration and economic analysis and emission control and environmental economics and forestry and land use change,10.1023/A:1013387305062,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035698517&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1013387305062&partnerID=40&md5=4ea6c05dd19815c26250bca70733734f,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 25,NA,JOUR,3-4,257,290,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,3388

Three experimental plantings, with áreas ranging from 0.64 to 1.17 ha were evaluated. A successional planting model divided species into four functional groups: pioneers and early secondaries (shading species), and late secondaries and climax (shaded species). In order to evaluate the performance of the species, we evaluated survival rate and development (growth rate and diameter at the plant base - DAS) of the seedlings planted. All the early species used had a good performance, both for the survival and growth rates, especially Citharexylum myrianthus, Schinus terebinthifolius and Trema micrantha. After early species shaded the degraded site, late species grew faster, as could be observed for Calophyllum brasiliense, Copaifera langsdorffii and Guarea guidonia, suggesting the successional model is effective in accelerating Forest regeneration.

3391,Scopus,Article,"Lal, R.",2005,Soil carbon sequestration for sustaining agricultural production and improving the environment with particular reference to Brazil,"Journal of Sustainable Agriculture, JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE",26,NA,"Agricultural ecosystems generally contain less soil organic carbon (SOC) pool than their potential capacity because of the low return and high rate of mineralization of biosolids, and severe losses due to accelerated erosion and leaching. Conversion of natural to agricultural ecosystems usually causes depletion of 50 to 75 percent of the antecedent SOC pool, thereby creating a potential sink capacity of as much as 35 to 40 Mg C/ha. The depletion of SOC pool leads to decline in soil quality and resilience with attendant reduction in biomass productivity, decreased capacity to degrade and filter pollutants, increased risks of soil degradation by erosion and other processes, and increase in emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs). The magnitude of depletion of SOC pool is greater for soils of the tropics than temperate regions, and for farms which are resource-based and managed with low-input than those managed with science-based and judicious off-farm inputs. The SOC sequestration, increasing SOC pool through conversion to an appropriate land use and adoption of recommended management practices (RMPs), can reverse soil degradation trends, improve soil quality and resilience, increase biomass production and decrease emission of GHGs. A strong link exists between the labile fraction of SOC pool and soil biodiversity-the activity and species diversity of soil fauna (micro, meso and macro) and micro-organisms. Soil biodiversity is usually higher under pastures and planted fallow systems than under crops, and is likely to increase with adoption of conservation tillage and mulch farming, integrated nutrient management and manuring, mixed farming systems and integrated pest management (IPM) techniques. The gross rates of SOC sequestration through adoption of RMPs range from 400 to 800 kg/ ha/y for cool and humid regions and 100 to 200 kg/ha/y for dry and warm climates. The potential of soil C sequestration in Brazil is estimated at about 50 Tg C/y. In addition, 60 Tg C/y emitted by erosion-induced mineralization can also be avoided through effective erosion control measures. © 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

We present a pragmatic model for prioritizing target areas for rehabilitation and discuss a potential approach, combining traditional reforestation and the forest management methods of local Dayak tribes with the operations of a commercial tree plantation venture, to promote the rehabilitation of elements of the tropical lowland rainforest. We characterized the vegetation and land use in the study area and assume that rehabilitation and conservation value will be maximized by concentrating rehabilitation efforts around forest patches with high cultural and economic value to the local Dayaks. We simulated potential enlargement of these culturally important forests and built a model to calculate a rehabilitation value for each forest fragment and fragment group with easily measurable criteria of vegetation and area. The model gives priority to areas where large continuous areas of culturally important forests already exist and/or will be created. The individual culturally important forest patches and their total area in the landscape are small, but even a small potential enlargement may be enough to establish relatively large concentrations. The potential matrix area for rehabilitation is dominated by young successional woody vegetation. Forested areas, although heavily degraded, connect several culturally important forest concentrations and are the most desirable target for rehabilitation. A well-managed commercial tree plantation can enhance conditions for the protection and rehabilitation of degraded forestlands through traditional reforestation and forest management methods. © 2006 Society for Ecological Restoration International.",Degraded forestland and Fast-growing plantation and GIS and Land use and Tembawang and Traditional reforestation and Asia and Eurasia and Indonesia and Southeast Asia and West Kalimantan and forest ecosystem and forest management and land use and plantation and prioritization and reforestation and restoration ecology and vegetation,10.1111/j.1526-100X.2006.00178.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33751069065&doi=10.1111%2fj.1526-100X.2006.00178.x&partnerID=40&md5=31dce87cef4f659a1bf49409c20c59e5,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 16,NA,JOUR,4,662,673,NA,DEC,1061-2971 and 1526-100X,WOS:000242239000020,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","3394, 5344"

Therefore, the present study was set up to evaluate the biomass and diversity of earthworms in natural and reforested Araucaria plots, impacted or not by fire, and to identify the most efficient earthworm collection method. Four study areas included: native forest with Araucaria (NF); Araucaria reforestation (R); Araucaria reforestation submitted to an accidental fire (RF); and native grass pasture with native Araucaria and submitted to an intense accidental fire (NPF). Five soil samples containing the earthworm community were taken in a 0.3 ha area in each of the forest sites, close to five Araucaria trees selected at random. Three collection methods were tested: application of dilute Formol (0.5%) to the soil surface, handsorting of small (25 × 25 cm) or large (40 × 40 cm) monoliths. Five earthworm species were found: the native Glossoscolex sp.1, Glossoscolex sp.2, Glossoscolex bondari and Urobenus brasiliensis (Glossoscolecidae), and the exotic Amynthas corticis (Megascolecidae).

Seed damage, germination and seedling establishment of four tree species plus growth and survival of two transplanted tree species were monitored under factorial combinations of the following treatments: (1) pioneer vegetation (presence and absence); (2) soil fertility (addition of NPK and control). Facilitation was the main process affecting plant performance. The presence of pioneer vegetation significantly improved germination, establishment, growth and survival of most study species. Around 90% of sown seeds were damaged and the removal of pioneer vegetation significantly increased seed damage for all species studied, decreased germination in three out of four species, and decreased establishment in one species. Moreover a significantly higher seedling growth rate of Inga virescens was found after the first year of the experiment in plots where vegetation was present. The presence of vegetation significantly increased seedling survival of I. virescens by protecting seedlings from leaf loss due to winter frosts. Competition was detected by the second year when a higher growth of transplanted seedlings of the species Araucaria angustifolia occurred in plots where vegetation was present and fertilizer were applied. A lower growth rate was detected in plots where vegetation was present but fertilizer was not applied. These results indicate a balance between competition for soil nutrients and protection by neighbor vegetation. Damage of seedlings by leaf cutter ants was an important barrier for plant survival. Damage occurred in 80% of the A. angustifolia seedlings and 58% of these damaged seedlings died. The presence of neighboring vegetation tended to protect seedlings from ant damage. Although competition occurred, facilitation seems to be the main process driving early successional changes in this subtropical old field. This was mainly due to the improvement of local microclimatic conditions and protection against herbivores by neighboring vegetation. Facilitation occurred during establishment and growth phases in a subtropical area that is considered a productive, low stress environment. Our results indicate that facilitation may be more frequent in productive environments than previously thought. © Springer 2006.",Araucaria angustifolia and Forest restoration and Leaf cutter ants and Nutrient competition and Positive interactions and Seed predation and Brazil and South America and Araucaria angustifolia and Formicidae and Inga and competition (ecology) and facilitation and germination and growth rate and microclimate and seedling establishment and soil fertility and subtropical region and succession and survivorship and tree planting,10.1007/s11258-005-9093-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33745912269&doi=10.1007%2fs11258-005-9093-0&partnerID=40&md5=9495bf7c74d9d27a8c2e6899391ea85f,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 30,NA,JOUR,2,179,190,NA,NA,1385-0237,WOS:000239760600001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","3398, 5071"

Modelling of the Uncertainties in Carbon Mitigation and Related Costs of Plantation Forestry Projects,"Climatic Change, CLIMATIC CHANGE",61,NA,"Afforestation is considered an important option for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. Recently, plantation projects have been suggested for inclusion under the Clean Development Mechanism. While considered a cheap option, significant uncertainties make it difficult to determine the (net) carbon benefits and profitability of forestry projects. The current uncertainties about the regulatory framework of the CDM and the environmental and economic performance of plantation forestry could create uncertainties with respect to the additionality of such projects and thus their acceptance under the mechanism. Six plantation forestry projects that were proposed in Brazil have been used as cases to study sources of uncertainty for carbon benefits and economics for such projects. These cases vary widely in terms of productivity and products delivered. A quantitative model for calculating greenhouse gas balances and financial benefits and costs, taking a broad range of variables into account, was developed. Data from the developers of the proposed projects was used as main source material. Subsequently, scenario's were evaluated, containing different and realistic options for baseline vegetation, carbon crediting systems and CDM modalities, fluctuations in product prices, discount rates and carbon prices. The real cost of combined carbon sequestration and substitution for the case projects was below $3 per ton of carbon avoided, when based exclusively on data supplied by project developers. However, potential variations in carbon impact and costs based on scenario options were very large. Different baseline vegetation or adopting a different discount rate cause carbon credits to vary by as much as an order of magnitude. Different carbon crediting systems or fluctuations in (commodity) product prices cause variations up to 200% in carbon credits and NPV. This makes the additionality of such projects difficult to determine. Five of the six case projects seem uneligible for development under the CDM. A critical attitude towards the use of plantation projects under the CDM seems justified.",Brazil and South America and Nucleopolyhedrovirus and Costs and Gas emissions and Greenhouse effect and Vegetation and afforestation and carbon sequestration and emissions trading and greenhouse gas and mitigation and plantation and Afforestation and Plantation and Forestry,10.1023/A:1026370624352,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0345531105&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1026370624352&partnerID=40&md5=a1360c3f21bf41930e92ec073ac98a1c,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 26,NA,JOUR,1-2,123,156,NA,NOV,0165-0009,WOS:000186272100008,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","3400, 5207"

However, the impacts of logging on individual timber species has not been at all adequately investigated. Logging affects timber species by: (1) removing mature individuals that are important sources of seeds; (2) damaging seedlings and saplings (i.e future generations of canopy adults); and (3) creating conditions that favour fire by opening the canopy and leaving slash as fuel on the forest floor. In this study we summarize information on the ecological characteristics of 305 timber species in Brazilian Amazonia. We identify seven ecological parameters that are useful in evaluating a species’ ability to resist the negative impacts of logging. These characteristics are: (1) effective long-distance dispersal ability; (2) abundance of saplings in forest regeneration; (3) rapid growth; (4) ability to resprout; (5) capacity to withstand fire; (6) broad geographic distribution; and (7) high density of adults. We hypothesize thai species with characteristics opposed to these parameters and subjected to intense logging pressure will have difficulty in maintaining their populations in logging regions. We use a simple scoring system to rank species with regard to their hypothesized ability to withstand logging impacts. Among the species that are potentially susceptible to logging impacts are Euxylophora paraensis (‘Pau Amarelo’) and Swietenia macrophylla (American Mahogany). The sawn lumber from these two species goes principally to European and North American buyers, revealing a direct link between First World consumption and possible biodiversity impoverishment in the Brazilian rain-forest. These two species, and others that might experience population reductions as a result of logging, merit special study. © 1994, Foundation for Environmental Conservation.

Therefore, some native trees are often preserved or agroforestry species are interplanted when land is cleared for pasture. We evaluated soil quality changes associated with the conversion of a native thorn forest (caatinga) into silvo-pastoral systems in semiarid NE Brazil. Soil nutrients, organic matter, microbial biomass and soil enzymes under native caatinga, the canopy of two preserved native (Ziziphus joazeiro and Spondias tuberosa) and one introduced tree species (Prosopis juliflora), and under a planted pasture of Cenchrus ciliaris were compared. The two preserved tree species maintained high nutrient and organic matter contents and high biological activity levels not only relative to the grass but also relative to the native caatinga. The non-deciduous Z. joazeiro was more effective than the deciduous S. tuberosa, and enriched surface soils by 100 mg P kg-1. The complete replacement of natural caatinga with C. ciliaris pasture or a C. ciliaris-P. juliflora silvopastoral system had, after 14 years, decreased microbial biomass C and N contents, and β-glucosidase activity, but did not affect soil nutrient or organic matter status. The biological activity under the trees of the tree-grass association was greater than under grass alone, although P. juliflora did not maintain higher nutrient or organic matter levels.

Understorey and overstorey floristic composition and structure, understorey light conditions, forest floor development and soil properties were evaluated in a total of 38 78.5-m2 plots located in the reforestation area at varying distances up to 640 m from the boundary with die surrounding primary forest. Wildlife surveys focusing primarily on birds and bats were also conducted to assess the role of seed-dispersing animals in regeneration of woody forest species within the plantations and colonization by primary forest species not included in the original reforestation. Regeneration density, species richness and species diversity (Shannon-Wiener index) for woody perennial species, vines, herbs and grasses were strongly correlated with the diversity of planted tree species and structural development parameters, degree of forest floor development and soil pH. The better developed closed-canopy plots (>40% crown closure) were characterized by relatively well-developed litter (O1) and humus (O2) layers, more acidic soils being typical of the surrounding primary forests, and a more diverse herb, vine and woody perennial flora with a greater representation of primary forest species being characteristic of late secondary forests. In closed-canopy plots a total of 1.25 tree, palm and shrub species were censused (versus 34 in the more open-canopy plots), of which 75 species are known to have been introduced by natural means from the surrounding primary forest (versus 11 species in the open-canopy plots). Among the plantation plots, there was significant colonization by primary forest woody species up to 640 m away from the primary forest edge although both the abundance and the diversity of colonizing species declined with increasing distance into the plantations. Smaller-seeded primary forest woody species dispersed by mammals and birds represented a higher proportion of the colonizing species compared with the larger-seeded species. These data are consistent with the results of the wildlife surveys, which indicated that most animal seed dispersal is provided by bats, that the most common frugivorous bat and bird species in the plantations feed on small-seeded plant species and that birds and mammals that typically disperse larger-seeded tree species (such as toucans, trogons, tapirs, deer and primates) are still rare in the reforestation area.

I examined the structure and species composition of trees in 11 rubber gardens in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, using a single 0.10 ha plot per garden. Although 41 distinct morphotypes were encountered, rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) dominated the sample of 370 trees. Richness within plots varied (3-15 morphotypes), as did the predominance of rubber (24-97% of all basal area, 24-91% of all individuals). The importance of rubber within a garden was significantly negatively correlated with the number of morphotypes present. This result suggests that tree diversity may limit potential productivity of rubber gardens. Thus, small-holders may not be willing to maintain diversity at the scale of a single garden. Although species-accumulation curves indicate that substantial tree diversity may exist across all rubber holdings, diversity is likely to be lost from the system if individual owners reduce species richness in their gardens. Rubber agroforestry as currently practiced in West Kalimantan is not an ideal model for matching rural development needs with the achievement of conservation goals. Other models, such as tengkawang- and durian-based fruit gardens, do exist in Kalimantan and elsewhere, and should be evaluated for incorporation into policy and development strategies.","conservation and diversity and rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) and rural development and Indonesia, Kalimantan, West and Hevea brasiliensis and agroforestry production and agroforestry system and biodiversity and developing country and garden structure and home garden and rubber production and smallholder sector and smallholders and species diversity",10.1007/BF00129634,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029659576&doi=10.1007%2fBF00129634&partnerID=40&md5=30091b33560fc11a6da66c343fee70da,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 29,NA,JOUR,1,83,100,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,3420

Forest management in Southeast Asian tropical dipterocarp forests has been particularly biased towards maximizing immediate economic return from extensive logging. Overexploitation and other forms of uncontrolled land use within these forests have led to the situation where the remaining natural forests, most of them in Indonesia, will be liquidated within the next 10-15 years at the current rate of deforestation. In this paper we present an approach for sustainable forest management planning in which economic, environmental and social sustainability are considered simultaneously in order to define an optimal management strategy from a set of available alternatives. We carried out a case study within a rain forest logging concession in Indonesian Borneo by using a participatory planning approach involving interviews of the local people, environmental assessment and economic analyses. We used the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method for resource allocation and priority setting in order to identify an optimal strategy which yields a sustained economic output from timber production, while at the same time being environmentally and socioculturally sustainable. Despite their relatively high costs, strategies involving selective harvesting combined to complete restoration of original dipterocarp stock in logged-over areas were superior in terms of economic, environmental and social sustainability.

Concerns have also been raised about the gradual shift from traditional cacao growing systems under diverse and dense tree canopy to lower or no-shade cover, leading to further loss of direct and functional forest ecosystem values such as protective and regulatory environmental services. This paper surveys existing literature and focuses on changes to biodiversity, carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling conditions due to a transition from natural forests to traditional lower-density agroforestry and high-density hybrid monoculture cacao systems. We derive marginal effects on selected ecosystem functions expressed as a percentage unit change in corresponding ecosystem values from a natural forest baseline scenario. Data from 16 studies conducted in Africa and the Americas show a negative trend in marginal changes in above-and below-ground carbon sequestration potential for the two cacao farming systems. The extent of marginal losses in carbon storage was comparatively higher for the monoculture than cacao agroforestry system. A general trend denoting positive marginal changes has been reported for mean species richness in soil and litter and some essential chemical and physical soil properties (Calcium, Magnesium, sand and silt) of cacao agroforestry systems compared with a natural forest baseline.

Annual litter production was higher in restored plots (254.91 g.m(-2)) than in control ones (120.99 g.m(-2)) and there was no difference between rows (259.39 g.m(-2)) and clusters (250.59 g.m(-2)). There was substitution of the litter type with time, which was higher in restored than in control plots, but there was no difference between rows and clusters. Results indicated that: (1) planting seedlings facilitates litterfall recovery; (2) there is litter substitution as from the beginning of the restoration; and (3) planting seedlings in rows or clusters is equally efficient to restore litter production.

A notable family of beetles with a strict association with fungi throughout their life cycle is Ciidae. Members of this family use fungi as shelter, food, and sites for copulation and oviposition, making them true mycetobionts. The fungi associated with ciids belong to the phylum Basidiomycota and play a crucial role in nutrient cycling by degrading wood and decomposing cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Ciids contribute significantly to the degradation of these basidiomes, thereby preventing their accumulation and enhancing nutrient availability in forest ecosystems. Although interactions between Ciidae beetles and their host fungi have been relatively well-studied, research on these interactions in the neotropics remains scarce. In this study, we investigated the interactions between ciids and their host fungi in two forest remnants of the Atlantic Forest biome. Using ecological network analysis, we assessed the frequency of occurrence of ciid species and calculated key indices for describing community structure: connectance, web asymmetry, links per species, nestedness, robustness, and specialization. This allowed us to compare the structural patterns of the two Ciidaefungi networks. Our results revealed that the main host fungal species were the same in both communities, but differences in host usage by ciids were observed, reflecting the availability of fungal basidiomes. These differences led to distinct network structures. Most Ciidae species were found to be generalists, exploiting host fungi according to their availability.",NA,10.1016/j.fooweb.2024.e00374,NA,NA,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,DEC,2352-2496,WOS:001352834500001,NOV 2024,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,3552

Global environmental changes are expected to impact terrestrial ecosystems, including biocrust communities. Thus, a growing number of studies have focused on investigating the diversity of biocrust-forming organisms including cyanobacteria. Despite the increasing interest in understanding biocrust cyanobacteria, there are still several knowledge gaps, particularly in areas from South America, where studies are limited. Here, we studied the composition, abundance, and environmental drivers of cyanobacterial biocrust from two important biomes in Brazil, i.e. Caatinga and Pampa, which are subject to desertification and anthropogenic pressures, respectively. Ten samples at three sites were explored at each biome (n = 60) and cyanobacterial biocrust community composition and diversity was analyzed through morphological evaluation and Next Generation Sequencing targeting the 16S rRNA gen. Soil and climatic variables, e.g. organic matter, soil texture, nitrogen and phosphorus content, temperature, and solar irradiance, were also determined at each site. Our results showed that biocrust cyanobacteria had distinct taxonomic compositions and assemblages at each biome. Similarly, cyanobacterial composition across sites within each biome differed substantially. Soil temperature and pH were identified as the main factors explaining such biotic structures. Caatinga sites, characterized by more arid environments, presented a higher abundance of N-fixing cyanobacteria, e.g. Scytonema. In contrast, Pampa, with higher rainfall regimes, showed a larger abundance of biocrust-forming bacteria such as Microcoleus and Leptolyngbya.

The enhancement of N deposition has aroused increasing concerns about its effects on ecosystem health and function. Forest covers more than one fifth of the national land area in China and provides fundamental ecosystem services. There have been emerging experimental, observational and modelling efforts to assess the impacts of N deposition on forest ecosystems since the 2000s. Here we summarized these research progresses with a focus on the effects of N deposition on soil chemistry and N transformation, soil microorganisms and enzymes, plant physiology, biodiversity and ecosystem carbon (C) balance. Experimental results and modelling estimates generally indicate a fertilization effect of N deposition on forest growth and consequent C sequestration. However, high-level N deposition has been increasingly evidenced to cause N leaching, soil acidification, nutrient imbalance, increased N2O emissions and decreased soil CH4 uptake, which likely offset the positive effect on ecosystem C storage over time. Meanwhile, N deposition has changed both species composition and richness of plant and soil microbial communities, consequently altering C and nutrient cycling. Moreover, the effects of N deposition are likely non-linear with N doses, and thus the assessment on the threshold values for N deposition would have important implications for N emission regulation and forest management options. We conclude that elevated N deposition is altering ecosystem structure and function of China's forests, especially in the eastern and southern regions. In addition, we highlight research efforts to jointly consider multiple abiotic factors (e.g. climate warming, CO2 enrichment, drought and increase in surface ozone) and biotic factors (e.g. insect outbreaks and invasive species), when evaluating ecological impacts of N deposition in the future.",NA,10.1007/978-981-13-8514-8_9 and 10.1007/978-981-13-8514-8,NA,NA,NA,BOOK,NA,185,213,NA,NA,978-981-13-8514-8 and 978-981-13-8513-1,WOS:000558698900011,NA,"Liu, X and Du, E",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,3566

The phylum Actinobacteria plays an important role in nutrient cycling, potentially improving their availability to plants. In this study, we isolated an actinobacteria (strain 3AS4) from wheat rhizospheres of crops cultivated in the Cerrado biome. Strain 3AS4 was identified as belonging to the genus Streptomyces and had phosphorus mobilization ability, mineralizing approximately 410 mu g ml(-1) from phytate, 300 mu g ml(-1) from calcium phosphate, and 200 mu g ml(-1) from rock phosphate. The analysis of the actinobacteria crude extract by spectrometric techniques revealed the presence of gluconic and 2-ketogluconic acid, and a greenhouse experiment was carried out to evaluate its plant growth promotion activity in soybean. Soil in its natural condition (with no phosphorus addition), 40 kg ha(-1) rock phosphate from Bayovar (RP) added to soil, and triple super phosphate (SPT) added to soil were used. Significant differences in plant height were observed at 6 weeks when the plants were inoculated with the 3AS4 strain. The growth of inoculated plants in natural condition was promoted in 17% compared with the RP and SPT non-inoculated conditions, suggesting that inoculation can enable plants to grow with lower chemical P fertilizers. In the plants that were inoculated with the 3AS4 strain in the RP condition, the plant height increased by approximately 80% and the shoot:root ratio was approximately 30% higher compared to control conditions (non-inoculated plants in natural conditions). 3AS4 has P-solubilizing potential and can be exploited as an inoculant for soybean cultivation.

For comparison purposes, soil covered with natural Cerrado vegetation and forage grass (pasture) were also evaluated. After chemical characterization of the areas studied, according to Embrapa (1997) total organic carbon (TOC), bulk density (Bd) and natural delta N-15 and delta C-13 abundance were determined in soil samples, and carbon stocks calculated from TOC values. In general, the pasture area had the highest delta C-13 and delta N-15 content, the Cerrado vegetation area had the lowest values for these elements and sugarcane crops exhibited intermediary levels.

Soil organic carbon stock is the core for sustaining soil health, supporting nutrient cycling, and sequestering carbon dioxide. To find out that how much sugarcane straw can be removed from the field to produce bioenergy without changes in soil C concentrations, we investigated effects of straw removal rates (total, moderate, and no removal of sugarcane straw) on soil carbon and nitrogen fractions in an Oxisol and an Ultisol in southeastern Brazil for two years. Soil C and N fractions were affected by increased rates of straw removal at the second year. In the Oxisol, total straw removal decreased labile and microbial-C by similar to 30% and soil C stock by 20% compared to no straw removal. No removal decreased microbial-N and total N stock by similar to 15% and similar to 20%, respectively. In the Ultisol, no straw removal resulted in increases in C stock by >10% and labile and microbial-C by similar to 20% related to total straw removal. Total straw removal showed more microbial-N (similar to 10%) and total-N stock (similar to 25%) compared to no straw removal. The moderate straw removal intensity (i.e., 8 to 10 Mg ha(-1) of straw) may control the straw-C release to soil by straw decomposition. This study suggests that excessive straw removal rates should be avoided, preventing SOM depletion and consequently, soil health degradation.

We conducted a two-year experiment to assess the effects of two diversification practices-vetch-oat cover cropping and cucumber-snow pea intercropping-on nitrogen (N) cycling and productivity across a farm management gradient. The field experiment spanned 14 farms in southern Brazil with different long-term management histories, ranging from conventional tobacco to agroecological mixed crop-livestock systems. Along this gradient, farm soils with longer histories of agroecological management had higher soil organic carbon, potentially mineralizable carbon, and extractable phosphorus, captured by a principal component reflecting ""biological soil fertility. "" We found that benefits of diversification practices for soil N cycling and productivity were ecologically relevant across the farm gradient within the two-year span of our experiment, with the greatest overall performance on agroecological farms. First, vetch-oat cover crops doubled mean N inputs to soil compared to fallows across all farms. Following cover crop incorporation, N mineralization was twice as high on agroecological farms as on transitioning or conventional farms. At vegetable planting, use of cover crop mixtures explained 67% of the variation in soil N availability, after accounting for the effects of background fertility. Finally, vegetable intercrops had higher productivity than monocrops across farms and years (mean LER=1.19), with stronger overyielding in the second year (mean LER=1.27). On a subset of farms, low soil pH constrained the performance of both diversification practices, reducing vetch N-2 fixation and vegetable intercrop yield (Land Equivalent Ratio, LER). While prior research has emphasized facilitation between diversified crops in lower fertility soils, our results suggest that diversification's advantages for nutrient cycling and productivity are robust to varied soil conditions and accrue over the course of transitions to agroecological management.",NA,10.1016/j.agee.2022.107925,NA,NA,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,JUL 1,0167-8809 and 1873-2305,WOS:000791946900002,MAR 2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,3595

The objective of this study was to verify the possible chemical and structural alterations in fulvic and humic acids of a Luvisol in areas adopting agroforestry, traditional intensive cultivation and native forest in a long-term experiment conducted in the semi-arid region of Ceara State, Brazil. The study was conducted in an experimental area of the National Goat Research Center (Embrapa) in Sobral, CE. The following treatments were evaluated: agrosilvopasture (AGP), silvopasture (SILV), intensive cultivation under fallow (ICF), and areas with native forest (NF). Soil fulvic and humic acids fractions were extracted from the 0-6 and 6-12 cm layers and characterized by elemental composition, thermogravimetry and infrared spectroscopy analyses. The elemental composition analysis of humic acids confirmed the data found for fulvic acids, showing reduction in the C, H and N levels, followed by an increase in O contents in the AGP and ICF treatments over SILV and NF. In all treatments, except to SILV in the 0-6 cm layer, the percentage of mass loss was highest (300-600 degrees C) for humic acids in the thermally most stable region. Despite the similarity between infrared spectra, soil fulvic acids in the SILV treatment extracted from 6-12 cm depth decrease the absorption bands at 1708 and 1408 cm(-1) followed by an increase in the absorption band at 1608 cm(-1) attributed to aromatic C=C groups. This behavior suggests an increase in the aromatic character of the structure. The AGP and ICF treatments, which increase the soil tilling, favored the maintenance of humic substances with a more aromatic character in the soil than SILV and NF.

We summarize published studies on effects of forest disturbance and conversion on tropical butterfly assemblages with a focus on forest species. Additionally, we use existing faunal monographs to extract information on the habitat affiliations of tropical forest butterflies. Based on these data, we quantify the importance of human-modified habitats for the conservation of tropical butterflies inhabiting forests across all major tropical regions. Although studies on effects of land use and forest conversion are biased by several methodological problems, the emerging pattern clearly indicates that (old-grown) secondary forests represent an important habitat type for maintaining a large proportion of forest butterflies in all major tropical regions. In contrast, agroforestry systems are only capable of protecting a small proportion of mostly widespread forest species tolerant against strong disturbance. Extinction risk of forest butterflies depends on the utilization of certain plant growth types, while host plant specialization alone does not have significant effects. Specifically, butterflies using trees as larval host plants are more likely to be absent in logged forest, whereas species that tend to be more abundant in logged forest are those with larvae feeding on lianas and grasses. Greater resource requirements may be one reason for a higher extinction risk of larger butterflies after forest fragmentation although not all studies found a relationship between extinction risk and body size. Butterfly species with narrow geographic ranges are particularly prone to local and global extinction. While widespread species dominate species assemblages of highly modified land-use systems and agroforests, endemic butterflies are more commonly found in old-growth forests. Our analyses covering all four major tropical regions underline the severe effects of forest modification. Land-use systems are only of minor importance for protecting forest butterfly species. Furthermore, they may only represent ecological sinks for a substantial proportion of the few forest species that are reported to occur in this habitat type.

There is ongoing debate as to whether biodiversity should be integrated on the same land (land sharing) or separated from agriculture (land sparing). Here, we present examples of land-sharing practices (agroforestry systems and multipurpose forests) and demonstrate that forest biodiversity conservation does not necessarily compromise crop yield. There is no simple trade-off between biodiversity and yield, and the complexity of crop yield-biodiversity relationships has not yet been fully investigated, at either the habitat or the landscape scale. We argue that land-sparing management has to be considered at different spatial scales. Agriculture in large-scale land sparing (intensive agriculture separated from forest remnants) generally does not benefit much from ecosystem services mediated by forest biodiversity, but small forest remnants can enhance biodiversity in large agricultural and forestry plantations. Small-scale land sparing (intensive agriculture connected to forest remnants) promotes beneficial organisms and their associated ecosystem services. In such landscapes, wild beneficial organisms, e.g. a diversity of pollinators, can enhance and stabilize crop pollination in intensively managed fields due to spillover from forests into crop fields. Functional connectivity of forest remnants (single trees, treelines, hedgerows and forest patches) in high-input agricultural landscapes can enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services, but future research needs to consider connectivity at various land-sparing scales to evaluate their conservation effectiveness. Furthermore, landscape developments minimizing possible adverse consequences of forest conservation on crop production are currently often overlooked but need to be considered in future research and landscape planning.

Here, we under-take such an analysis, focusing on the benefits of implementing Forest Law 7575, which specifies the amount of forest to be preserved along rivers. We model changes in sediment retention, nutrient retention, and carbon sequestration from a baseline scenario based on current land use that is in partial compliance with the law. We contrast this with a simulated reforestation scenario, where riparian forest cover is increased to at least a minimum level of compliance (10 m buffers) everywhere. We find that targeted riparian refor-estation-increasing national forest cover by 1.9 %-would substantially increase ecosystem services. Water quality regulation would be improved via an increase of 3.9 % in sediment retention (1.4 Mt/year), 81.4 % in nitrogen retention (0.012 Mt/year), and 85.9 % in phosphorus retention (0.0022 Mt/year). Moreover, riparian reforestation would increase the national carbon stock 1.4 % above current levels (7.0 Mt). Our analysis shows where riparian buffers are most beneficial-generally in steep, erosion-prone, and intensively fertilized land-scapes. Through a canton-level analysis comparing potential increases in sediment and nutrient retention with demographic information, we find that these benefits would flow to communities that depend on rivers for drinking water and that are otherwise vulnerable. Small increases in riparian reforestation in Costa Rica, implemented via an existing law, could confer large benefits to rivers and all who depend on them.",NA,10.1016/j.ecoser.2022.101470,NA,NA,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,OCT,2212-0416,WOS:000862222900005,SEP 2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,3831

In most cases, policymakers focus on extensively forested areas where the flows of ecosystem services between agriculture and the environment is generally characterized by massive flows of carbon and soil nutrients from forests to agriculture. In these forest margin areas the stock of primary forest is eventually exhausted and the cheap ingredients provided by nature to agriculture become increasingly scarce. At this point, policy interest generally wanes, and agriculture and the environment begin slow declines in ecosystem service exchange, often with negative consequences for rural poverty. How does one promote increased flows of ecosystem services from agricultural lands without increasing poverty when forests and soils have been depleted? Can the standard instruments, e.g., payments for ecosystem services, be effective in such situations, and if so, do the costs to society of securing these services increase? Here we focus on the flows of ecosystem services at the end of the cycle of converting primary forest to agriculture. Primary data from the Bragantina area in the southeastern Brazilian Amazon, an area cleared of primary forest decades ago, are used to characterize smallholder production systems, to describe the flows of ecosystem services into and from these systems, and to develop a bioeconomic model of smallholder agriculture capable of predicting the effects of several types of policy action on ecosystem services provided by and to agriculture, and on-farm household incomes and food self-reliance. Of particular interest is the Proambiente Pilot Program in Brazil, which uses smallholder payment schemes to induce farmers to manage land and forest resources in ways that generate more ecosystem services. Baseline results suggest that smallholder agriculture leads to a gradual loss of ecosystem services (mainly above-ground and root carbon) provided by secondary forest fallows, and that reduction in fallow age leads to reductions in plant diversity. Intensifying agricultural activities accelerates this process, but considerably increases smallholder incomes. Paying farmers for ecosystem services linked to the retention of secondary forests and the Proambiente program both increase area in forest fallow, but the latter substantially reduces farm income because of input use restrictions. In general, programs aiming to promote the production of ecosystem services should not limit farmers' choices of ways to provide them. Employment and food self-reliance issues associated with policy options for increasing on-farm stocks of carbon and plant biodiversity are also explored. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

On the other hand, forests and land-use change (LUC) account for the largest uncertainties within the global C balance. The future role of forests is even more uncertain within the context of global change. The question if forests will shift from C sinks to sources is fundamental for conservation and management. We aim to synthesize current knowledge on the role of the major forest biomes in the global C cycle. Furthermore, we evaluate management options, based on their potential to maximize greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation and other benefits from forest ecosystems. Whereas boreal and temperate forests currently act as net sinks, there is a potential for increased insect outbreaks, fires, and droughts. Pressure from infrastructure development and the demand for biomass fuels is increasing. Tropical forests account for the largest gross C sink, but face deforestation and degradation. The future role of tropical forests depends mostly on LUC dynamics. Uncertainties persist about deforestation rates and impacts from global change. It is clear, however, that changes in the C balance of tropical forests will affect atmospheric CO2 levels on a global scale. In managed temperate and boreal forests, aboveground carbon (AGC) can be maximized by optimizing rotation cycles in even-aged stands. Mixed-species stands may increase productivity and resilience to disturbances. Research is needed on the impacts of silvicultural activities on soil organic carbon (SOC). In the tropics, reforestation and deforestation avoidance are the most important GHG mitigation pathways. Lessons learnt from REDD (reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) pilot projects may help to establish GHG mitigation strategies in the future. The majority of timber harvest in the tropics is unsustainable and could be improved by extending rotation cycles, reduced impact logging, and long-term management planning. International support is needed to ensure capacity building and strong institutions, and to create incentives for global markets. The extension of planted forests is growing worldwide.

In this chapter, our focus is on the agriculture-forest landscapes of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, an island widely known for its endemic yet still poorly known flora and fauna. The rise of the region to one of the largest cacao producing areas in the world is at the core of recent land-use change and intensification processes. Covering plants (trees, rattan palms, herbs, bryophytes) and several invertebrate (ants, dung beetles, cacao insect herbivores, fruit-feeding butterflies, parasitic Hymenoptera, spiders) and vertebrate groups (amphibians, birds, murids, reptiles), we give an in-depth overview of the determinants of biodiversity in cacao landscapes, including both management and landscape-scale variables into our analyses. Results show that shaded agroforests host a rich community of species. By adopting a large-scale study design we showed that proximity of natural forest is a key predictor for species richness of plants, invertebrates and vertebrates alike. Endemics and forest specialists benefit most from indigenous shade tree cover and proximity to natural forest. Importantly, several functionally important groups such as insectivorous and seed-dispersing birds benefit from tall shade trees, shade tree diversity and proximity to forest edge, while parasitoid diversity is greatest close to natural forests.

SFM has often been regarded as a means for the salvation of the still declining tropical forests. In this chapter, I investigate under which circumstances the expectation of SFM being an option to preserve tropical forests may be true. This question is addressed in three parts, mainly based on the existing literature, but partly also through simulations. The topics addressed are: (I) the characteristics of SFM for tropical natural forests, (II) the characteristics of planted forests in the tropics, and (III) SFM embedded in a land-use model together with agricultural land-use options. The results for part I show that SFM of natural forests would basically lead to decreasing timber yield, moderately reduced carbon stocks, and only marginally disturbed biodiversity. The economic performance of SFM is relatively low and inferior compared to the economic performance of planted forests and agricultural alternatives. The planted forests, investigated in part II, promise high profitability, even in the case of some native tree species. However, simulations by means of an economically driven land-use model show that planted forests would expand their area into natural forests, if afforestation is not directed to abandoned lands and if natural forests are not preserved by means of conservation payments transferred to land users. These results lead to part III, where SFM in natural forests and afforestation of abandoned lands are considered as parts of a more comprehensive land-use portfolio, in this case designed for the example of Ecuador, considering croplands and pastures as agricultural options. The composition of the land-use portfolio is controlled by the economic yield and risk of the land-use options considered. SFM of natural forests generates little economic yield for the land users; however, because of the vast area under consideration, the necessary conservation transfers to land users may greatly be reduced if the management of natural forests is considered. The afforestation of abandoned lands also increases the profitability of the resulting land-use portfolio and sequesters additional carbon on top of that. However, the recultivation of part of the abandoned lands back to pasture turned out to be a very important option as well. It helps in producing enough food, which, and in turn, secures moderate food prices. Moderate food prices have the advantage being responsible for moderate conservation payments to compensate for the opportunity costs of the preservation of natural forests. As a result, strategies to produce enough food without additional CO2 emissions can be designed at a minimal conservation costs. The analyses show that SFM and afforestation can complement agricultural land-use portfolios. This is also shown in more detail based on a farm-level consideration. It is concluded that SFM in natural forests and planted forests is a valuable option to increase the efficiency of sustainable land-use portfolios. It is, ultimately, of utmost importance to embed these forestry options in comprehensive land-use models to avoid undue undesirable effects, which could potentially be caused by indirect land-use change.",NA,10.1007/978-3-642-54601-3_139 and 10.1007/978-3-642-54601-3,NA,NA,NA,BOOK,NA,1763,1791,NA,NA,978-3-642-54601-3 and 978-3-642-54600-6,WOS:000618640100051,NA,"Pancel, L and Kohl, M",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,4146

The maps reveal that integrating PRM and indigenous geo-referenced information can elicit past and contemporary information on (changes in) ecosystem service availability and use. The results show that by involving local communities from the beginning, the participatory ES mapping can facilitate social learning, provide the foundation for the creation of social capital, and equip the community with sufficient spatial information to improve local mangrove management.

The case of a Brazilian megalopolis,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,685,NA,"While the role of land-use conversion on water quality is reasonably understood, its role on water quantity is controversial. Climate change is also expected to impact water availability. Here we explore the interplay of hydrology, land-use change and climate change in one of the most populous urban areas in the world. We examined the potential of forests to buffer the negative impacts of land-use and climate changes on water-related ecosystem services in Tiete Basin, Brazil, which supplies water to the Sao Paulo megalopolis. We modelled six hydrological parameters using the WaterWorld Policy Support System, simulating the current baseline and six future scenarios (with different land-use and climate changes). Our results corroborate the general trend that increased forest cover improves water quality. Our modelling also predicts that increased forest cover increases water quantity in the southern part of the basin. The effects of climate change are observed mainly in urban areas, with a reduction in water quality. Because urban areas are not eligible for reforestation, they cannot benefit from its buffering effect on climate change. The increase in water availability is the greatest benefit of reforestation as a strategy to improve water-related ecosystem services in the region. Reforestation, however, will not suffice to restore all hydrological parameters in the basin, and additional sustainable agricultural practices are needed to mitigate impacts on water quality.

The first step is restoring the quality of the Technosol for plant establishment. This study evaluated the effects of pit size on the chemical properties of Technosol and the performance of selected tree species. MethodsThree different pit sizes were tested: Small Pit or Control (CTR), Medium Pit (MP), and Large Pit (LP) in an area degraded by kaolin mining. Four tree species were used for each pit size. After 24 months of planting, the chemical properties of Technosol, survival, periodic annual increment (PAI) for total height (PAIHt) and diameter at soil height (PAIDSH), canopy area (CA), and aboveground biomass (AGB) were evaluated. ResultsThe study found no significant differences in the chemical properties of Technosol across pit sizes (CTR, MP and LP). Survival rates were consistently high for all treatments. MP and LP provided the best increases in PAIHt of Tapirira guianensis. Average CA values ranged from 0.41 +/- 0.19 to 1.82 +/- 0.31 m2 between species, and LP provided the highest average CA for Terminalia argentea.

One of the concerns is that the drainage required for cultivating oil palm in peatlands leads to soil subsidence, potentially increasing future flood risks. This study analyzes the hydrological and economic effects of oil palm production in a peat landscape in Central Kalimantan. We examine two land use scenarios, one involving conversion of the complete landscape including a large peat area to oil palm plantations, and another involving mixed land use including oil palm plantations, jelutung ( jungle rubber; (Dyera spp.) plantations, and natural forest. The hydrological effect was analyzed through flood risk modeling using a high-resolution digital elevation model. For the economic analysis, we analyzed four ecosystem services: oil palm production, jelutung production, carbon sequestration, and orangutan habitat. This study shows that after 100 years, in the oil palm scenario, about 67% of peat in the study area will be subject to regular flooding. The flood-prone area will be unsuitable for oil palm and other crops requiring drained soils. The oil palm scenario is the most profitable only in the short term and when the externalities of oil palm production, i.e., the costs of CO2 emissions, are not considered. In the examined scenarios, the social costs of carbon emissions exceed the private benefits from oil palm plantations in peat. Depending upon the local hydrology, income from jelutung, which can sustainably be grown in undrained conditions and does not lead to soil subsidence, outweighs that from oil palm after several decades. These findings illustrate the trade-offs faced at present in Indonesian peatland management and point to economic advantages of an approach that involves expansion of oil palm on mineral lands while conserving natural peat forests and using degraded peat for crops that do not require drainage.",NA,10.5751/ES-08490-210252,NA,NA,NA,JOUR,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,1708-3087,WOS:000380049100039,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,4241

To consider the actual PES, we have to check a number of factors, such as: transaction costs and opportunity, the effects of permanence, leakage and additionality; which this paper sought to apply by analyzing six PES programs aiming the conservation of water resources in Southern Brazil. The observed patterns were: the difficulty in dealing with transaction costs and opportunity as well as the effect caused by the lack of permanence.

When PAs succeed in deterring economic activities that degrade forests, the impacts include more forest yet less economic gain. These economic opportunity costs of conservation lead actors with economic interests to resist new PAs, driving their sites away from profitable market centers and towards areas featuring lower opportunity costs. Further, after PAs are created, economic actors may want PA downgrading, downsizing, and degazettement (collectively PADDD). We examine reductions in PAs' spatial extent - downsizings (partial erasures) and degazettements (complete erasures) - that presumably reduce protection. Using data for the entire Brazilian Amazon from PADDDtracker.org, our empirical analyses explore whether size reductions from 2006 to 2015 resulted from bargaining between development and conservation. We find that the risks of PA size reductions are raised by: lower travel costs (as implied by distances to roads and cities), which affect economic gains and enforcement; greater PA size, which affects enforcement; and more prior internal deforestation, which lowers the impacts of size reductions.

However, the real-world situation of protected areas reveals a range of problems. This study seeks to identify the diverse ways of thinking among relevant actors in order to address these issues. In the present work, characteristics of the global perspective of managers are contrasted with findings from a field study in the forest biosphere reserve Lore Lindu, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. In this context, the differences between the villagers' point of view regarding the implementation of sustainable-development activities in the buffer zones and the managers' perspective on the sustainability of human uses in the same areas are highlighted. This paper follows two complementary approaches, combining quantitative and qualitative research tools when examining the respective positions of both managers and villagers. Quantitative analysis of a global survey among biosphere reserve managers revealed that human uses in the buffer zones are generally considered to be sustainable (mean value for evaluation of 6.4 on a scale from 1 to 10). Besides a significant negative correlation (-0.3) between number of residents in the buffer zone and accordance to sustainability of human uses, no meaningful relation was computed either in respect to country income or tropical forest regions. Because of this lack of conclusive data, we zoomed in on the local level and included the villagers' perspective. Factors influencing the implementation of sustainable-development activities in the buffer zone were the central issue of the field study. A completely different perception was found in Lore Lindu. The villagers expressed the opinion that basic management activities such as nonexistence of boundary demarcation and lack of law enforcement are the most crucial factors in regard to how sustainable-development activities are implemented. Further barriers are insufficient awareness of forest conservation needs among groups of villagers and the ever-increasing number of immigrants. Furthermore, the results of this study point to the high relevance of a mediator in the communication process between the management body and local people. Clearly formulated rules and laws and abidance by enforcement of the law seem to play a major role in buffer-zone management. Moreover, the different ethnic groups have to be taken into account by the park management in communication processes.

However, implementing REDD+ in a populated landscape requires information on local costs and acceptability of changed practices. To supply such information, many studies have adopted approaches that explore the opportunity cost of maintaining land as forest rather than converting it to agricultural uses. These approaches typically assume that the costs to the smallholder are borne exclusively through the loss or gain of the production values associated with specific categories of land use. However, evaluating the value of land to smallholders in incomplete and messy institutional and economic contexts entails other considerations, such as varying portfolios of land holdings, tenure arrangements, restricted access to capital, and unreliable food markets. We suggest that contingent valuation (CV) methods may provide a more complete reflection of the viability of REDD+ in multiple-use landscapes than do opportunity cost approaches. The CV approach eliminates the need to assume a homogenous smallholder, and instead assumes heterogeneity around social, economic and institutional contexts. We apply this approach in a southern rural Cameroonian context, through the lens of a hypothetical REDD+ contract.

Using an age sequence of even-aged, 6- to 20-yr-old stands of A. koa, we evaluated stand characteristics, N accumulation, and rates of N fixation. Average diameter at breast height (dbh) and height increased linearly during the first 20 yr of tree growth, while stem density, dbh increment. and leaf area index declined. An experimental thinning in the 9-yr-old stand more than doubled dbh increment, suggesting that high tree densities could constrain tree growth. In contrast. N fertilization did not affect dbh increment. Nodule biomass was more than an order of magnitude less in the 20-yr-old stand than in the 6-yr-old stand, which corresponded to a similar decline in estimated input of N via fixation. Neither thinning nor N fertilization affected nodule biomass, but measurements of foliar and root phosphorus (P) suggest that a decline in P availability over time may have contributed to the decline in N fixation. In these stands, large amounts of decomposing litter remaining from stand establishment may have provided much of the N that accumulated in koa biomass. In more degraded sites.

We assessed the direct and indirect impacts of farmers' management practices on plant diversity, soil quality and crop productivity in coffee and pasture fields belonging to different types of farms: agroecological, conventional, and large-scale. The study was carried out in twelve farms in the Zona da Mata, Brazil. For each of the total of 24 fields (twelve pastures and twelve coffee) we recorded 41 variables associated with management practices, indicators of plant diversity (taxonomical, structural and functional diversity) and soil quality (biological, chemical and physical properties). The direct and indirect effects of management on plant diversity, soil quality and in the case of coffee, crop productivity, were assessed using structural equation models. In the case of pastures, we found that increased plant diversity due to agroecological management resulted in higher soil quality, probably due to higher soil litter cover and plant structural heterogeneity. Yet, practices presented in the agroecological farms also had a direct negative effect on soil quality, which indicates that increased plant diversity in pastures needs to be combined with other agroecological management practices than currently adopted. In the case of coffee, we show that despite the higher weeding intensity and higher use of external inputs in large-scale and conventional coffee farming systems, these practices did not result in increased soil quality or coffee productivity as compared to agroecological systems. In contrast, agroecological coffee management was associated with increased plant diversity, which, in turn, was positively associated with soil microbial biomass carbon. Our results highlight a causal pathway of agroecological management leading to increased plant diversity and, in turn, maintenance or increase in soil quality. While no causal link between agroecological coffee management and coffee productivity could be demonstrated, the biodiversity-mediated pathway resulted in similar coffee productivity in agroecological farms as compared to conventionally managed farms, which relied on pesticides and higher inputs of chemical fertilizers.

Aboveground net primary productivity was extremely high in all stands. The monocots did not contribute significantly to the productivity of the Hyeronima polycultures, which was 4.5-8.4 g.m(-2).d(-1) between 18 and 36 mo.

The leaf area and density of fine roots in the Cedrela and Cordia polycultures were also significantly increased by the presence of the monocots, reaching or surpassing the levels found in the Hyeronima stands. The high productivity of Hyeronima, coupled with poor growth of its interplanted monocots, indicated that Hyeronima was able to achieve nearly complete use of resources. Ecosystem productivity and resource capture were increased when the monocots were grown with the other two tree species, and this occurred because of the inability of the tree species to completely utilize available resources, which provided an opportunity for the monocots to flourish in the understory. Monocot productivity in the Cedrela stands was additive to that of the trees, indicating complementary resource use between the monocots and this tree species. In the case of Cordia, tree productivity was slowed by the monocots, but this decline was more than compensated for by the high productivity of the associated monocots. Whether in natural forests or human-constructed agroforestry systems, the presence of dominant species that do not fully exploit all available resources allows the coexistence of other species and creates the potential for complementary resource use.

While species dependent on undisturbed natural habitat are most affected by conversion to agriculture, even populations of disturbance-tolerant species can be endangered in landscapes dominated by high-input mono-cultural cropping systems. This has raised the question of how, and at what cost, a diversity of species can be conserved in such habitats. Focusing on birds of smallholder oil palm-dominated landscapes, we investigated the relationship between the ecological and economic outcomes of remnant or planted trees in smallholder oil palm plantations. The study comprised a household and a field component. We gathered plot specific data on yields, revenue and inputs from 120 households owning productive oil palm plantations in the Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia. Bird diversity and abundance as well as vegetation structure was assessed on the same oil palm plots. We tested the effects of a set of economic and ecological variables on measures of bird diversity, bird abundance, oil palm yield, and total revenue. Our results show that a gain in bird diversity and bird abundance conditional on increases in number of trees comes along with a loss in revenue for farmers indicating that there is a win lose relationship between ecological and economic functions. However, since the relationship is non-linear, costs for bird species gain or gain in bird abundance change depending on the number of trees within an oil palm plantation: in a relatively extensively managed oil palm plantation (high number of trees, low oil palm yields), a further increase in the number of bird species or individuals leads to a relatively high loss in total revenue, whereas in an intensively managed oil palm plantation the same increase in number of bird species results in a smaller loss in revenue. An increase in bird abundance can be fostered at smaller costs when compared to the costs for increasing biodiversity. This suggests that there is room for tree-based enrichment of intensively managed oil palm plantations, where a relatively high increase in bird species richness or bird abundance could be achieved at relatively low cost.

We measured vegetation and soil fertility in a 4-year-old restoration area in Central Brazil, which was subsequently hit by a lightning fire. The restoration area was originally utilized as pasture, dominated by invasive grasses. Over the restoration period, native fast-growing grasses replaced the invasive species.

We modeled the relationships between emissions and biophysical conditions, logging practices, and forest policies and then used these models to estimate potential emission reductions from full implementation of RIL-C practices. We applied the method in 8 forest management enterprises (FMEs; i.e., concessions) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), 9 in Gabon, and 6 in the Republic of Congo (RoC). Committed logging emissions expressed per cubic meter of timber harvested (to control for differences in logging intensities) ranged from 0.63 Mg C m(-3) in a FME in RoC to 4.8 Mg C m(-3) in a FME in Gabon, with an overall average of 2.1 Mg C m(-3). Logging emissions were dominated by damage caused by road and log landing construction (i.e., hauling; 50%) and felling (43%; includes carbon in extracted logs). Total emissions represented only about 9% of unlogged forest biomass carbon stocks. Average emissions were highest in Gabon (2.65 Mg C m(-3)) followed by DRC (1.84 Mg C m(-3)) and RoC (1.54 Mg C m(-3)). Emissions from concessions certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC, N = 6) and those that were not certified (N = 17) did not differ. Nearly half (51%) of logging emissions could be avoided without reducing timber yields if all best examples of RIL-C logging practices observed were applied in the same FME. At the country level, if all FMEs were to utilize these practices, emissions reductions would be 34% in RoC, 45% in DRC, and 62% in Gabon.

In this narrative review, we highlight one such system, Voisin Rational Grazing (VRG). VRG is a regenerative livestock farming system proposed by French scientist Andre Voisin in the 1950s and further developed in Brazil in the 1970s. VRG has been applied in many countries with vastly different ecosystems. Like other regenerative systems, VRG provides a range of ecosystem services, including negative net carbon emission, reduced soil erosion, and increased biodiversity. Because VRG is also focused on animal performance, farmers applying VRG are more resilient against the adversities confronting farmers practicing more conventional farming systems. VRG requires a paradigm shift from the farmers and thus its uptake may be hindered if there is not enough support within the community. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of VRG, along with its benefits and constraints. Current livestock practices do not meet current real-world social and environmental requirements, pushing farmers away from rural areas and only sustaining high productivity through the overuse of fossil fuels, causing numerous environmental side effects. In this narrative review, we explore how the Voisin Rational Grazing (VRG) system responds to this problem. VRG is an agroecological system based on four principles that maximise pasture growth and ruminant intake, while, at the same time, maintaining system sustainability. It applies a wide range of regenerative agricultural practices, such as the use of multispecies swards combined with agroforestry. Planning allows grazing to take place when pastures reach their optimal resting period, thus promoting vigorous pasture regrowth. Moreover, paddocks are designed in a way that allow animals to have free access to water and shade, improving overall animal welfare. In combination, these practices result in increased soil C uptake and soil health, boost water retention, and protect water quality. VRG may be used to provide ecosystem services that mitigate some of the current global challenges and create opportunities for farmers to apply greener practices and become more resilient. It can be said that VRG practitioners are part of the initiatives that are rethinking modern livestock agriculture. Its main challenges, however, arise from social constraints. More specifically, local incentives and initiatives that encourage farmers to take an interest in the ecological processes involved in livestock farming are still lacking.

Eucalyptus plantations significantly decreased plant richness, soil pH, and soil temperature. Microbial biomass, soil basal respiration and enzyme activities were negatively affected by grassland afforestation, which may indicate an effect on decomposition, soil fertility, and carbon stock. At a regional scale, grassland afforestation diminished the richness, and at a local scale changed the taxonomic and functional composition of Collembola communities. An environmental filtering mechanism is suggested triggering trait turnover from open (grassland) to a closed canopy habitat (tree plantation).

4851,NA,NA,"Lorenz, K and Lal, R",2018,Carbon Sequestration in Cropland Soils,CARBON SEQUESTRATION IN AGRICULTURAL ECOSYSTEMS,NA,NA,"Humans began to cultivate land thousands of years ago, for growing crops after clearing the previous vegetation cover and plowing the soil. The soil disturbance altered, in particular, soil C dynamics which has recently been exacerbated by the increase in crop intensification (i.e., fertilization, irrigation, liming, mechanization). This has resulted in major losses of terrestrial carbon (C); i.e., global emissions by the expansion of agriculture for croplands were estimated at 98.4 Pg C for the period 1850-2015. Cropland management can alter soil inorganic carbon (SIC) stocks which, in arid and semiarid climates, can be similar to or more than the amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock. However, whether a specific practice leads to a net sequestration of SIC in cropland soils needs additional research. Otherwise, the conversion of land to cropland in temperate regions may release up to 36% of the SOC stock to 27 cm depth, and up to 30% of the SOC stock to 48 cm depth in tropical regions. In 2000, about 12% of Earth's ice-free land surface or 15 million km(2) was used for croplands. Climate, geology, and land and crop management practices control the magnitude of the cropland SOC stock. A major fraction (25-70%) of the carbon dioxide (CO2) fixed during crop photosynthesis by gross primary production (GPP) is respired autotrophically (R-a) back to the atmosphere. Estimates of global cropland GPP vary between 8.2 and 20.0 Pg C yr(-1) (1 Pg = 10(15) g). The remaining net primary production (NPP = GPP - Ra) is the main C input into cropland soils. Cropland NPP includes the production of biomass in foliage, shoots and roots, weed and seed production, root exudation, the carbon (C) transfer to microorganisms that are symbiotically associated with roots, and the volatile organic carbon (VOC) emissions that are lost from leaves to the atmosphere. However, not all components of cropland NPP have yet been measured in a single study. NPP enters soil by rhizodeposition and decomposition of plant litter, but the major fraction is heterotrophically converted back to CO2 by soil respiration and some is lost as methane (CH4). Aside decomposition, C losses from croplands soils occur also by fire, erosion, leaching, and harvest. Thus, a small amount of fixed C remains in cropland soils and accumulates as SOC due to a combination of short- and long-term stabilization processes. Stabilization processes include physical protection of organic matter (OM) against decomposers and their enzymes, stabilization by organo-mineral complexes and organo-metal interactions, and some as biochemically recalcitrant black carbon (BC). Soil aggregation, in particular, may be the most important stabilization process in the surface layers of cropland soils. Site-specific factors including climate, physicochemical characteristics, soil and vegetation management determine the balance between C input and losses. Cropland soils can be recarbonized through the adoption of recommended management practices (RMPs) such as conservation tillage, residue mulching and use of cover crops, practices which all contribute to SOC accumulation and sequestration by an additional transfer of C from the atmosphere to the soil. Translating science of cropland soil management into a global restorative program is a high priority for feeding the world, mitigating climate change and improving the environment.",NA,10.1007/978-3-319-92318-5_3 and 10.1007/978-3-319-92318-5,NA,NA,NA,BOOK,NA,137,173,NA,NA,978-3-319-92318-5 and 978-3-319-92317-8,WOS:000717140100004,NA,NA,NA,"Lorenz, K and Lal, R",NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,4851

We develop a spatially-explicit discrete choice experiment in which households register their preferences for channel widening, park space, forest conservation, and a monthly fee to fund the rehabilitation.

These estimates are based on households within the catchment, but we find that demand did not seem to decay with distance so the upper bound on total WTP could be substantially higher. We also find that household income level has a strong effect on marginal WTP for forest conservation, minimal effect on marginal WTP for park space, and that location along the river influenced WTP for park space and channel widening. This provides further evidence that there is substantial demand for river rehabilitation in developing world cities, and that choice experiments can provide information relevant to land use planning.

In managing the natural resources, Adat and religious values are fundamental principles. Based on these values, the traditional practices to protect and utilize nature are Rimbo Larangan (prohibited forest) and Lubuak Larangan (prohibited river). Additionally, Parak (agroforestry), Tanah Ulayat (communal land for agriculture), and Alek Banda (harvest ceremony) are the collective management of natural resources related to agriculture.

Incentive-based conservation policies, such as payments for environmental services (PES), are seen as promising approaches to reduce deforestation. Yet, arguably the adoption of upscaled PES programs has remained slow, and when implemented their design often diverges from the principles laid out in the theory-based PES literature. In this article, we concentrate on some political economy forces that could help explaining the gap between PES theory and practice, with respect to policy adoption, including opportunities and challenges in this process. Public policy theories grasp the adoption determinants of three large, government-led incentive programs for forest conservation in the Amazon, in Peru, Ecuador, and Brazil. We use Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework to analyze decision-making regarding program initiation, including key stakeholder interviews, to understand policy choices. We find that environmental concerns are not always the prime motives for PES programs, as political and institutional contexts limit environmental policy-makers' actions. Yet, policy choice processes become less constrained when environmental issues are closer to a government's priorities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The morphometric results indicated that the watershed has a significant flood tendency, and the land use map demonstrated that 29.55 % of the soil has some permeability. Nevertheless, this permeability currently varies according to soil management and cover. The grass area presented the highest compaction rates, the riparian forest a medium rate, and Corujas Garden the lowest rate. The garden also has green infrastructures and good management practices, which have led to the appearance and perpetuation of diffuse springs.

In this study, we attempted to elucidate the relationship between income generation and biodiversity by studying 83 bamboo-tree gardens that varied in species composition and degree of commercialization. We conducted a survey of the vegetation and interviewed the owners or managers of each plot. We identified 42 planned and utilized species and 19 associated non-use species. Eight vegetation groups were identified by two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN), each of which varied in individual densities of different utilization species types, Simpson's diversity index, management intensities, and potential annual gross income. The group with the highest potential income generation was dominated by clove trees (Syzygium aromaticum); however, this group also had a lower level of diversity and higher levels of management intensity than the other groups, but all of the pairwise groups were not significantly different. About 60% of the villagers used at least some fuelwood as a domestic energy source, and almost all of them collected fuelwood from bamboo-tree gardens regardless of ownership. There were no significant differences in density of potential fuelwood species among the vegetation groups. There were significant positive correlations between income and most management activities. The regression model between gross income and Simpson's diversity index with the best fit was a unimodal curve, which strongly suggests that maximum diversity can be conserved at an intermediate level of income. Nevertheless, this intermediate level of gross income is probably not adequate as the primary source of income for garden owners, although some gardens had the potential to achieve higher income levels with no decline in diversity.

The crop, however, is mainly cultivated on forest-derived soils and is a major cause of land-use change. Termites are an important biological component of tropical ecosystems providing numerous ecosystem services. Previous studies have indicated that termites are sensitive to forest disturbance and decrease in richness and abundance across land-use intensification gradients, with consequences for the essential services that they provide. Native shade trees are often used to improve cocoa cultivation and may reduce the detrimental effects of land-use change on some aspects of biodiversity. The aim of this study was therefore to explore how termites respond to land-use change along a shade-tree gradient in Kakum National Park and surrounding cocoa farms in Ghana (from forest at 80% tree cover to cocoa with no shade cover, to the extreme of cultivated arable crop land). It was predicted that termite richness and abundance would decrease with decreasing shade cover, and with increasing distance from the forest edge. Thirty-four species from 29 genera were sampled, with Ancistrotermes crucifer being found in all the locations (47% of all encounters). Species richness and abundance differed marginally across the land-use gradient, as well as the distance from the forest edge; however, species richness did not show any significance with distance. All the same, termite communities were robust to the disturbance. Our findings suggest that though site influenced species richness and abundance, cocoa trees can play a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity and environmental quality in an agricultural landscape by providing a habitat for forest species that are not found in pastures or farm fields.

The study area with the total of 1120 ha was situated in Jambi province in the lowlands of Sumatra. In 2016, the year of our assessment, 83% of the area was covered by oil palm monocultures including industrial and smallholder plantations; other land-use types included rubber plantations and secondary forests. An earlier land-use classification suggests that oil palm cultivation began before 1990 on 41% of the area.

In the entire study region, we detected 10.1 scattered trees/ha. In areas where oil palm plantations were established before 1990, the tree density was 67% lower than in the area where oil palm was introduced later. The median tree crown diameter was 4.5 m, which corresponds to an estimated diameter at breast height of 12 cm; thus, most trees were small-statured.

The assessment will consider criteria focused on type of and access to resources, impacts on labour and translation of soil knowledge that offer tangible benefits to farmers. To achieve this, a systematic literature review focused on the main coffee-producing countries in the Asia-Pacific region, namely, Vietnam, Indonesia, India, Thailand, China, Malaysia and the Philippines. Following eligibility criteria, a total of 74 peer-reviewed articles were sourced from both Scopus and Web of Science databases, covering the period 2000-2024. Key soil management practices identified included agroforestry (through intercropping or shading), nutrient management and soil erosion control. Overall, the studies emphasized the critical impact of these practices on soil health, with many assessing the soil quality to evaluate sustainability. Based on the criteria outlined, practices that target intercropping with nutrient-enhancing legumes and strategic pruning can further enhance yields and improve soil health. Such practices already integrate well into many coffee systems, as intercropping with legume trees or crops is commonly used to improve soil fertility and provide shade, while strategic pruning is a standard practice to optimize plant productivity, manage pests and diseases and regulate the coffee microclimate.

This study estimates deforestation from gold mining and analyses the regeneration of abandoned mining areas in the Suriname Amazon. Fieldwork in December 1998 included observations and ecological measurements, as well as qualitative interviews with local miners about mining history and technology. Vegetation cover of abandoned mining sites of different ages was compared with that in old-growth forest. By present estimates, gold miners clear 48-96 km(2) of old-growth forest in Suriname annually. Based on different assumptions about changes in technology and the amount of mining that takes place on previously mined sites, cumulative deforestation is expected to reach 750-2280 km(2) by 2010. Furthermore, the analysis of abandoned mining sites suggests that forest recovery following mining is slow and qualitatively inferior compared to regeneration following other land uses. Unlike areas in nearby old-growth forest, large parts of mined areas remain bare ground, grass, and standing water. The area deforested by mining may seem relatively small, but given the slow forest recovery and the concentration of mining in selected areas, small-scale gold mining is. expected to reduce local forest cover and ecosystem services in regions where mining takes place.",NA,10.1017/S0376892901000121,NA,NA,NA,JOUR,2,117,126,NA,JUN,0376-8929 and 1469-4387,WOS:000170219200004,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,4927

We show that deforestation decisions are strategic complements. The econometric results differ according to the type of protected area. It is shown that: i) integral protected areas and indigenous lands allow for reducing deforestation; ii) sustainable use areas do not help to reduce deforestation; and iii) the spillover effects generated by integral protected areas and indigenous lands lead a reduction in deforestation in their vicinity. A 10% increase in the surface area of integral protected areas (indigenous lands) allows an estimated 9.32 sq. km (10.08 sq. km) of avoided deforestation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The concession areas, timber production and employment have been decreasing over time. To concern on these matter and to improve management, a research was conducted for six years (2008-2013) and resulted in recommendations to implement the Multi-System of Silviculture (MSS) systems. Two products were generated in MSS; criteria and indicator to guide the selection of appropriate silvicultural system and supersilvik, a model to develop the best business plans. This paper evaluates and strengthens the recommendations through the simulation of MSS products in PT. Sarmiento Parakantja Timber (Sarpatim), Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Various data variables were used, such as thematic maps of forest areas, data of stand, materials, equipments, labors, finances and incomes. Data were processed in a variety of formulations which were connected to each other in model systems to produce a variety of outcomes, such as production, finance, employment and tax contributions. Results offer four options to improve PT. Sarpatim performance, one of which is the best choice. Compared to the former business model under limited silvicultural systems, MSS projected an increase in the use of land, timber production and employment by 151-753%. Implementing MSS will provide a better and healthier finance for company with an increase of NPV up to 193%; as well as for government tax revenues with an increase up to 308%. This MSS case study strongly suggests using the new theory that the management of production forests is a land and plant-based enterprises, which should put the land as the major capital and silvicultural aspects as the driving engine for production.

A better understanding of the interactions of livestock with the environment to fundament alternatives to mitigate impacts of beef production comes up against the scarcity of studies on the environmental impact of livestock systems that include estimates of biodiversity and the availability of specific indicators. In this work, we provide elements to support the proposition of sustainable practices, looking at cow-calf production in different Brazilian biomes to estimate their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land use (LU) amidst diverse levels of biodiversity conservation. GHG emissions and LU were analyzed using the life cycle assessment (LCA) method.

However, the conservation of these areas depends on the management of their surroundings to promote landscape connectivity. In agricultural landscapes, the preservation of native vegetation in rural properties is one of the main strategies to promote the connectivity of the protected area. Forest certifications that require compliance with environmental laws can work as an important instrument to maintain native vegetation in forest plantation areas. In Brazil, most commercial plantations consist of exotic species, predominantly eucalyptus, pine, and teak. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the land-use/land-cover (LULC) and the landscape connectivity changes in the surrounding area of a protected area between 1986 and 2019 and understand if commercial forest plantations have contributed to maintaining native vegetation on private lands. For this, we evaluated LULC in 1986, 2008 and 2019, focusing on the application of the so-called New Forest Act (NFA). We compared LULC change with agricultural land suitability to check for trends. The landscape connectivity and the importance of the surrounding native vegetation fragments were verified based on the Graph Theory. Property boundaries were extracted from a land tenure model based on the Rural Environmental Registry. To verify the perception of landowners and planted forest industries, we sent a questionnaire with open and closed questions. Our results showed that pasture was the main LULC in the area but has decreased giving space to native vegetation regeneration and mostly to forest plantation and soybean expansion. Pasture with lower agricultural suitability is converted to forest plantation and native vegetation, while pasture with higher agricultural suitability becomes soybean crops. At the rural property level, forest plantations presented the largest area and the largest native vegetation cover compared to other agricultural sectors but still presented a significant riparian vegetation deficit, according to the NFA. Forest fragmentation has increased over the years, even with the increase in native vegetation in 2019 compared to 2008. Regarding the landowner's perception, farmers and industries have demonstrated knowledge and intent to comply with the NFA, but most do not know the Capa similar to o Bonito Nacional Forest (CBNF).

We separate regions and time periods that differ in their deforestation and political pressures and document considerable variation in PA strategies across regions, time periods and types. The siting of PAs varies across regions. For example, all else being equal, PAs in the arc of deforestation are relatively far from non-forest, while in other states they are relatively near.

The country intends to submit agricultural emissions reductions as part of this target, with livestock production identified as offering significant abatement potential. Focusing on the Cerrado core (central Brazilian savannah), this paper investigates the cost-effectiveness of this potential, Which involves some consideration of both the private and social costs and benefits (e.g. including avoided deforestation) arising from specific mitigation measures that may form part of Brazil's definition of Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Measures (NAMAs). The analysis used an optimisation model to define abatement costs. A baseline projection suggests that beef production in the region will emit 2.6 Gt CO(2)e (CO2 equivalent) from 2010 to 2030, corresponding to 9% of national emissions (including energy, transport, waste, livestock and agriculture). By implementing negative-cost measures identified in a marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) by 2030, the 2.6 Gt CO(2)e could be reduced by around 24%. Pasture restoration, involving avoided deforestation, offers the largest contribution to these results. As the Brazilian Cerrado is seen as a model for transforming other global savannahs, the results offer a significant contribution by identifying alternatives for increasing productivity while minimizing national and global external costs.

In 2007 the conference of parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change called upon parties and international organizations to promote REDD through investments in capacity building and demonstration activities. This prompted many new actors to become involved in REDD activities at a variety of locations and scales. A global survey of REDD activities was undertaken in 2009 to enable better understanding of the intensity and geographic distribution of these activities. Existing compilations, literature review, web-based sources, face-to-face and telephone interviews, and e-mail questionnaires were used to compile data for the inventory. Inter alia, data were collected on the location of activities and official and unofficial factors influencing location choices. Inventory data were combined with secondary data to estimate a statistical count model (Poisson) of factors affecting the number of REDD activities undertaken in the 64 developing countries that experienced significant emissions from deforestation. The results show that there were at least 79 REDD readiness activities and 100 REDD demonstration activities as of October 2009. Of these, the largest shares of REDD readiness and demonstration activities were implemented in Indonesia (7 and 15 respectively) and Brazil (4 and 13 respectively), countries widely agreed to have the greatest potential for reducing forest-based emissions. The statistical results found no national characteristic to have a statistically-significant effect on the number of REDD readiness activities, but five national characteristics to have significant effects on the number of REDD demonstration projects. Baseline CO2 emissions, forest carbon stock, number of threatened species, quality of governance, and region all had significant effects. The results reveal the importance of biodiversity and good governance, and the relative unimportance of human need and opportunity cost of land.

We applied a matching method to assess the extent to which deforestation has decreased and village well-being has improved as a result of Indonesia's community forestry scheme, Hutan Desa (Village Forest). We assessed five dimensions of well-being: basic (living conditions), physical (access to health and education), financial (income support), social (security and equity) and environmental (natural hazard prevention). We found that Hutan Desa was associated with reduced deforestation and poverty. 'Win-win' outcomes were found in 51% of cases, comprising (a) positive outcomes for both forests and poverty, (b) a positive outcome for one aspect and a negligible outcome for the other, or (c) a positive outcome for poverty in areas where natural forest had already been lacking prior to Hutan Desa tenure. Benefits to forests and people systematically differed depending on land-use zones, reflecting subtle interactions between anthropogenic pressures and community livelihood characteristics. In Watershed Protection Zones, which are dominated by subsistence-based forest livelihoods, community forestry provided mild conservation benefits, but resulted in the greatest improvements in well-being through improved land tenure. In Limited Production Zones, community forestry provided modest benefits for both conservation and well-being because restrictions on timber harvest due to Hutan Desa designation reduced the financial well-being of logging communities. The greatest conservation benefits were experienced in Permanent or Convertible Production Zones, but well-being improvements were minimal. Here, living conditions and environmental well-being were reduced due to pressure to intensify agricultural production under increased land scarcity in these predominantly cash crop-oriented communities.

This analysis was supported by data from interviews with policy actors in both countries in two points of time, 2011/12 and 2015/16. The findings highlight the challenges for implementation of both REDD+ and GG as individual policy programmes, and the dilution of the REDD+ agenda and decision makers' confusion about a GG strategy when these narratives are joined and translated by decision makers. Actors still perceive development and environmental objectives as a zero-sum struggle, favouring a development narrative that might lead to neither REDD+ nor green policy action. We conclude that REDD+ and GG can go hand in hand, if there is action to tackle deforestation and degradation.",NA,10.1505/146554817822407385,NA,NA,NA,JOUR,NA,56,68,NA,NA,1465-5489 and 2053-7778,WOS:000427716200005,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,5053

Many species rely on mangrove habitats; thus, their conversion to aquaculture farms has led to noticeable losses in commodities such as wild fish stocks. This study aimed to assess the influence of aquaculture and restoration projects on the ecosystem's ability to provide resources. We collected data on mangrove vegetation (i.e., biomass, richness, and abundance), soil nutrients (i.e., organic carbon, aluminium, and nitrogen), crab abundance, and fishing pressure at six sites. We set up 15 plots at each site and collected data between May and July 2023. Via generalised linear mixed models, we found that the abundance and richness of crabs was significantly higher in aquaculture plots than in non-aquaculture plots. Aquaculture plots had higher topsoil aluminium, higher topsoil and subsoil nitrogen, and lower topsoil carbon than non-aquaculture sites. Restored sites had less nitrogen in the topsoil than unmanaged sites. The biomass did not change between aquaculture, restored, and unmanaged plots. We found a negative correlation between crab abundance and richness and mangrove diameter at breast height (DBH), suggesting that the species of crabs present preferred areas with propagules for feeding (e.g., Grapsidae crabs). The content of nitrogen in the subsoil was positively correlated with mangrove richness, diversity, and height, suggesting the importance of nitrogen availability for mangrove growth. The content of aluminium in the subsoil was negatively correlated with the content of organic carbon in both the topsoil and subsoil, suggesting the detrimental effect of aluminium on the carbon cycle. Fishing practices were observed at all sites during the data collection period.

However, the extent to which these activities capture CO2 with associated climate mitigation impacts are poorly known, especially in geographies where data on biomass growth of restored forests are limited or do not exist. To fill this gap, we developed biomass accumulation rates for a set of FLR activities (natural regeneration, planted forests and woodlots, agroforestry, and mangrove restoration) across the globe and global CO2 removal rates with corresponding confidence intervals, grouped by FLR activity and region/climate. Results: Planted forests and woodlots were found to have the highest CO2 removal rates, ranging from 4.5 to 40.7 t CO2 h(-1) year(-1) during the first 20 years of growth. Mangrove tree restoration was the second most efficient FLR at removing CO2, with growth rates up to 23.1 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) the first 20 years post restoration. Natural regeneration removal rates were 9.1-18.8 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) during the first 20 years of forest regeneration, followed by agroforestry, the FLR category with the lowest and regionally broad removal rates (10.8-15.6 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1)). Biomass growth data was most abundant and widely distributed across the world for planted forests and natural regeneration, representing 45% and 32% of all the data points assessed, respectively. Agroforestry studies, were only found in Africa, Asia, and the Latin America and Caribbean regions. Conclusion: This study represents the most comprehensive review of published literature on tree growth and CO2 removals to date, which we operationalized by constructing removal rates for specific FLR activities across the globe.

The present study aims to evaluate whether the dominance and the maintenance of the forest in the early stages of succession has been facilitated by the structure of the local seed bank within an urban fragment of Atlantic forest in Brazil. We also evaluated the forest regeneration potential of the soil seed bank under a bamboo-dominated area and a control area. A total of 5181 (units) seeds were germinated, corresponding to 81 plant species in 31 families. Miconia cf cinnanomifolia was the most abundant species in the seed bank for both forests (72.6% in control and 43.9% in bamboo-dominant). Despite the low diversity and evenness found in both areas, the seed bank in the bamboo-dominated area had higher species richness and diversity, and a heterogeneous floristic composition of shrub and tree species when compared to the control area.

In every treatment and in a reference forest (R-forest), 8 years after the initial seedling planting, three types of indicators were assessed: structural (horizontal vegetation structure, density of natural regeneration, and soil cover), compositional (species diversity, ecological groups, and dispersal syndromes), and functional (chemical properties of Technosols and dry matter and nutrients from the litter stock). The most representative species in all treatments were Croton matourensis and Vismia guianensis, both coming from the natural regeneration and common in early successional stages.

The overall objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of protected areas to prevent the advance of the conversion of natural areas in the core region of the Brazil's Cerrado Biome, taking into account the influence of the restriction degree, governmental sphere, time since the establishment of the protected area units, and the size of the area on the performance of protected areas. The evaluation was conducted using matching methods and took into account the following two fundamental issues: control of statistical biases caused by the influence of covariates on the likelihood of anthropogenic conversion and the non-randomness of the allocation of protected areas throughout the territory (spatial correlation effect) and the control of statistical bias caused by the influence of auto-correlation and leakage effect. Using a sample design that is not based on ways to control these biases may result in outcomes that underestimate or overestimate the effectiveness of those units. The matching method accounted for a bias reduction in 94-99% of the estimation of the average effect of protected areas on anthropogenic conversion and allowed us to obtain results with a reduced influence of the auto-correlation and leakage effects.

We contrasted a series of small forest remnants (391ha) to old-growth stands located in the largest (ca 3500ha) and best preserved forest remnant in northeastern Brazil and found that tree seedling assemblages inhabiting forest fragments exhibited reduced species richness (up to 50%) at different spatial scales in comparison to seedling assemblages in mature forest and adult assemblages in both fragments and mature forest stands. Moreover, ordination analyses clearly segregated fragment seedling assemblages in taxonomic/functional terms and segregation correlated to the richness of pioneer species. Seedlings of pioneer species and those bearing medium-sized seeds (0.61.5cm) increased in fragments, whereas large-seeded species (1.53.0cm) were reduced by more than a half. Such a multiple-scale replacement of the old-growth flora by pioneers was also confirmed by an indicator species analysis and the resulting pioneer indicator species.

However, this process can be hampered in open areas without trees in the landscape.

Our objective was to evaluate the effect of the distance of artificial perches in relation to a forest fragment on the diversity and composition of seed rain in an agricultural fallow area, including alien invasive plant species. We also aimed to record and characterize the bird species that potentially act as seed dispersers. Thus, we used artificial perches at three different distances from a forest fragment (5, 25, and 50 m). Four seed traps were arranged under the perches at each distance, and four control seed traps were interspersed with these and distanced at 7.5 m. Furthermore, we placed four seed traps inside the forest fragment at 5 m from the edge. We also carried out 80 h of focal observation of the avifauna that used artificial perches. A total of 24 655 seeds were sampled across all treatments. There was a significant difference in seed abundance and richness between artificial perches, control seed traps, and forest seed traps. Seed deposition increased with distance from the forest fragment (50, 25, and 5 m). An ordination procedure indicated the formation of three plant seed communities, with the forest community being most distinct. The invasive exotic species Pittosporum undulatum (Australian cheesewood) was the third most abundant in the seed rain. We observed 24 bird species from 12 families using artificial perches. The Tyrannidae family was the most represented. We showed that artificial perches are efficient structures for attracting birds, increasing the richness and abundance of seed species. Artificial perches at 25 and 50 m were more efficient possibly due to the provision of greater visibility for birds. Therefore, artificial perches are efficient in increasing seed rain in the fallow area but should be used with caution in landscapes with the presence of alien species.

In South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, early ornamental introductions and small forestry plantations did not lead to large-scale invasions, while subsequent large plantations were followed with a lag of about 20-30 years by troublesome invasions. Large-scale conifer plantation forestry in South America began about 50-80 years later than in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, while reports of invasions in South America lagged behind those in the latter nations by a century. Impacts of invading non-native conifers outside South America are varied and include replacement of grassland and shrubland by conifer forest, alteration of fire and hydrological regimes, modification of soil nutrients, and changes in aboveground and belowground biotic communities. Several of these effects have already been detected in various parts of South America undergoing conifer invasion. The sheer amount of area planted in conifers is already very large in Chile and growing rapidly in Argentina and Brazil. This mass of reproductive trees, in turn, produces an enormous propagule pressure that may accelerate ongoing invasions and spark new ones at an increasing rate. Regulations to control conifer invasions, including measures to mitigate spread, were belatedly implemented in New Zealand and South Africa, as well as in certain Australian states, inspired by observations on invasions in those nations. Regulations in South America are weaker and piecemeal, but the existing research base on conifer invasions elsewhere could be useful in fashioning effective regulations in South America.

Evidences from a Meta-analysis,LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT,27,NA,"Ecological restoration has become an important technique for mitigating the human impacts on natural vegetation. Planting seedlings is the most common approach to regain lost forest cover. However, these activities require a large economic investment. Direct seeding is considered a cheaper and easier alternative technique, in which tree seeds are introduced directly on the site rather than transplanting seedlings from nurseries. To evaluate the effectiveness of direct seeding, we conducted a comprehensive search of the literature using restoration', direct seeding' and sowing' as keywords, and we performed a meta-analysis using 30 papers and 89 species. We used two different measures of restoration success: seed germination probability and success probability (the chance that a seed germinates and survives until the end of the experiment). In general, restoration attempts using direct-seeding techniques were relatively unsuccessful. On average, seed germination and success probability were 0239 and 0114, respectively, and were not affected by climate, species successional group or the application of pre-germinative treatments. Germination and success probability increased with seed size, and the use of physical protections resulted in a nearly twofold increase in germination probability, but this effect faded by the end of the experiments. Because of the low rate of seedling success, we suggest the use of direct seeding as a complementary technique to reduce restoration costs, particularly for species with large seeds and known high germination rates, but our results do not support direct seeding as a substitute for seedling planting.

One possible solution to this dilemma is organic agriculture, which is expected to enhance biodiversity on the farmland. However, organic products often require larger areas. This study demonstrates how we can quantify and compare the direct land use impacts on biodiversity of organic and conventional food products such as milk. This study assessed direct land use impacts of 1 l of milk leaving the farm gate. Inventory data on land occupation were extracted from a life cycle assessment study of 15 farms in southern Sweden. Direct land use change data were derived from the FAO statistical database. Spatially differentiated characterization factors of occupation (CFOcc) and transformation (CFTrans) were calculated based on the relative difference of plant species richness on agricultural land compared to a (semi) natural regional reference. Data on plant species richness and regeneration times of ecosystems (for calculating transformation impacts) were derived from a literature review. To account for differences in biodiversity value between regions, a weighting system based on absolute species richness, vulnerability and irreplaceability was applied. Organic milk had a lower direct land use impact than conventional milk, although it required about double the area. Occupation impacts dominated the results and were much smaller for organic than conventional milk, as CFOcc of organic land uses were considerably smaller. For transformation impacts, differences between the two farming practices were even more pronounced. The highest impacts were caused by soymeal in concentrate feeds (conventional milk) due to large-scale deforestation in its country of cultivation (i.e. Brazil and Argentina). However, lack of reliable data posed a challenge in the assessment of transformation impacts. Overall, results were highly sensitive to differences in land occupation area between farms, the CFOcc and assumptions concerning transformed area. Sensitivity and robustness of results were tested and are discussed. Although organic milk required about twice as much land as conventional, it still had lower direct land use impacts on biodiversity. This highlights the importance of assessing land use impacts not only based on area but also considering the actual impacts on biodiversity. The presented approach allows to quantify and compare hot- and coldspots in the agricultural stage of milk production and could potentially also be applied to other agricultural products.

The first step is to recover the soil quality for plant reestablishment. In this study was evaluated the effect of different organic fertilizers, supplementary to chemical fertilizers, on the physical and chemical attributes of a minesoil after kaolin mining in the Eastern Amazon, Brazil. Nine trenches measuring 1 m x 40 m and 1 m in depth were opened in a reconstructed area after kaolin mining. They were 6 m apart from each other and filled with topsoil from areas destined for new mine pits. Then 40 cm x 40 cm x 40 cm pits were opened along the trenches. They were 1.5 m apart from each other within each trench, and 400 g pit-1 of simple superphosphate, 130 g pit-1 of urea and 130 g pit-1 of potassium chloride were applied in five treatments: three treatments along the trenches, in the planting rows with; i) addition of topsoil; ii) sawdust; iii) cattle manure, and two treatments between the planting rows; iv) sawdust; and v) without sawdust. Two hundred and fifty seedlings of six heliophilous tree species were planted, being randomly distributed.

In elucidating the ultimately rejected strategies for addressing international drivers now hidden in neat negotiation outcomes, this article opens a space for considering how the scheme could move beyond a predominant focus on local forest users. Second, targeted forest users are likely to be governed by a combination of neoliberal and disciplinary technologies. REDD+ will seek to 'improve' their conduct through a three-staged process involving education, self-reflection and rewards for carbon sequestration. An alternative governmentality associated with local forest users' claims to decide on REDD+ implementation and governance, on the other hand, met with resistance and ultimately received no protection in the adopted REDD+ safeguards.

Located in Klias Peninsula, southwestern Sabah, Malaysia there lies a pristine peat swamp forest area. This type of ecosystem plays a significant role in global climate regulation. Despite its importance, the peat swamp forest is threatened and highly degraded, due to the increasing demand for agricultural expansion. This is where we monitored deforestation and land cover change between 1985 and 2013. Temporal changes were determined by means of supervised classification, using the maximum likelihood classification rule to observe changes in the area. Post-classification change detection techniques were applied in order to understand the change in forest coverage in the Klias Peninsula and inside the protected area boundaries. The overall accuracy for the Klias Peninsula and the protected area were more than 88% (+/- 4% margin of error) and 95% (+/- 2% margin of error), respectively. Based on these findings, it appears that more than half of the forest area in Klias Peninsula disappeared from 142,713 ha (+/- 6818 margin of error) to 73,403 ha (+/- 6796 margin of error) between 1985 and 2013.

Although methods to measure the effects of reforestation abound, these methods often fail to track and communicate the complexities of reforestation interventions. This paper uses intensity analysis to analyze the effects of reforestation intervention in Brazil's Rio Doce water basin. In particular, this paper uses intensity analysis to study the effects of reforestation on three land cover categories in Brazil's Rio Doce water basin. The illustrative approach analyzes the temporal difference of forest in three land cover maps at time points 1998, 2008, and 2015 from the Rio Doce water basin, Brazil, where each map has four land cover categories: forest formation, pasture, mosaic of agriculture and pasture, and urban infrastructure. Interval level intensity indicates that change is faster during the second time interval (1998-2008). The results from the categorical level intensity show that the forest formation and the mosaic of agriculture and pasture are active gainers during both time intervals, while pasture is an active loser. Forest formation targets the mosaic of agriculture and pasture more intensively at the interval level during the first time interval. Forest formation gains the most from a mosaic of agriculture and pasture while at the same time targeting the mosaic of agriculture and pasture during the second time interval. The mosaic of agriculture and pasture gains the most from both forest formation and pasture during both time intervals but targets pasture. The results for the second time interval show that the reforestation process in the Rio Doce water basin, Brazil, only forced the farmers to move to other forest covers in the vicinity. This process constitutes exchange, which accounts for more than half of the change during the second time interval, and thus contributes 0 to the net change of forest.",NA,10.3389/frsen.2022.873341,NA,NA,NA,JOUR,NA,NA,NA,NA,JUN 17,2673-6187,WOS:001063460900001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,5208

The study presents a generalisable method that enables energy modellers to characterise agricultural technologies within an energy system modelling framework. Different mechanisation processes were characterised to simulate intensification/extensification transitions in the sector and its wider implications in the energy and land use system aiming at providing reliable non-energy outputs similarly to those found in dedicated land use models. Additionally, a forest growth model has been integrated to explore the role of reforestation alongside decarbonisation measures in the energy system in achieving carbon mitigation pathways.

The dynamic nature of the problem of looking for the optimal set of coppice rotations for Eucalyptus plantations obliges managers to use the dynamic programming technique. In order to evaluate the economic loss occasioned when optimal rotations are not considered, two plantations are shown, one with Eucalyptus urophylla S.T.

To systematically review previous literature on CBFM, this research uses the PRISMA method. It finds that communities are often able to manage forest areas sustainably through sociocultural systems that combine management customs and culture. Empowerment through CBFM policy therefore promises to promote community subsistence, equity, and security regarding forest management. However, granting total resource rights to communities can result in land conversion unless managerial safeguards are in place. Many studies find that the clarity of land boundaries, the consistency of regulation, and the partiality of land governance drive CBFM program success.

This paper investigates the impacts of rattan harvesting on tree and understorey vegetation structure, species richness and diversity. Tree and understorey vegetation characteristics and soil and topographic variables were recorded in forest plots. Interviews with rattan harvesters recorded information on harvesting techniques and locations. The relationships between tree and understorey vegetation characteristics and soils, topography and rattan harvesting techniques were assessed with the multivariate ordination technique of Redundancy Analysis (RDA). Analysis of the relationships with rattan harvesting proximity and forest designation zone used Multivariate Analyses of Covariance (MANCOVA). Tree species richness and diversity are primarily affected by slope gradient and altitude, while tree size is affected mainly by soil chemical factors. Only a small part of the variation in tree structure measures can be attributed to the impacts of rattan cane harvesting. Stronger adverse effects on understorey vegetation density, including tree saplings and seedlings, were found. This is thought to be a case of rattan harvesting exacerbating the effects of competition between rattan plants and other understorey vegetation. Longer term monitoring of forest characteristics could provide stronger understanding of the impacts. However, rattan harvesting appears to have little effect on forest structure and diversity in Lambusango Forest, suggesting that relatively small scale NTFP extraction does not necessarily conflict with forest conservation.

In the present study, six different biochar doses (control, 5 t ha(-1), 10 t ha(-1), 15 t ha(-1), 25 t ha(-1) and 40 t ha(-1)) were applied to amoderately acidic silty loam soil from Rasuwa, Nepal and the effects on soil physicochemical properties and maize and mustard yield over three years (i.e., six cropping seasons), were investigated. Biochar addition did not show significant effects on maize and mustard grain yield in the first year, however significant positive effects (p < 0.01) were observed during the second and third years. During the second year, maize grain yield significantly increased by 50%, 47% and 93% and mustard grain yield by 96%, 128% and 134% at 15 t ha(-1), 25 t ha(-1) and 40 t ha-1 of biochar respectively. A similar significant increase in yield of both crops was observed in the third year. Yields for both maize and mustard correlated significantly (p < 0.001) with plant available P, K+, pH, total OC%, CEC, base saturation, and increased as a function of biochar addition. On the basis of the measured crop yields for the various biochar doses, a cost-benefit analysis was carried out, and gross margin was calculated to optimize biochar dose for local farming practice. Total costs included financial cost (farm input, labor and biochar production cost), health cost and methane emission cost during biochar production. Health costs were a minor factor (< 2% of total biochar preparation cost), whereas methane emission costs were significant (up to 30% of biochar cost, depending on the C price). Total income comprised sale of crops and carbon sequestration credits. The cost-benefit analysis showed that the optimal biochar application dose was 15 t ha(-1) for all C price scenarios, increasing gross margin by 21% and 53%, respectively, for 0 and 42 US$ per ton CO2 price scenarios. In the current situation, only the 0 US$ price scenario is realistic for rural farmers in Nepal, but this still gives benefits of biochar amendment, which are capped at a 15 t ha(-1) biochar addition.

Here, we ask how rotational and continuous grazing influences the composition, diversity, and biomass production of natural grasslands in southern Brazil. Location The study was conducted at four cattle farms within the south Brazilian grassland region (Campos Sulinos), in the upper area of the Camaqua river basin of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Methods On each farm, grassland that had previously been subjected to continuous grazing (freely grazed by cattle) was divided into two experimental units; one managed by rotational grazing and the other maintained under continuous grazing. In each experimental unit, 14 permanent plots were monitored over six years for species composition and species biomass. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models to evaluate the effects of grazing management strategies on composition dissimilarity, diversity indices, and plant biomass. Results Grasslands under a rotational grazing regime changed steadily over the period of evaluation. Total biomass and species distribution patterns greatly differed from those in plots subjected to continuous grazing, leading to changes in species richness, dominance, and composition, as well as to an increase in overall plant biomass. Conclusions Community changes during the six-year study period as a consequence of the distinct grazing treatments were evident. Grasslands under rotational grazing management benefitted from less selective grazing, enabling a more uniform growth of species within the communities, which in turn were richer at the end of the six-year experiment. In contrast, the proportion of grazing-resistant species or less-consumed species was higher under continuous grazing, where foraging by cattle appears to be more selective. Rotational grazing thus not only leads to higher species richness and diversity, but also to higher primary and, in consequence, secondary productivity.",NA,10.1111/avsc.12432,NA,NA,NA,JOUR,2,326,335,NA,APR,1402-2001 and 1654-109X,WOS:000466383400012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,5265

Currently, the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) is threatened by the absence of a consistent fire policy. Most protected areas in Brazil still apply total fire suppression policies, instead of a more integrated fire management approach. Faced with the challenge of reconciling biodiversity conservation goals with rural livelihoods, scientists, policymakers and managers around the world have discussed potential solutions for managing fire in protected areas aimed at the sustainability of these ecosystems. Based on international experiences, an Integrated Fire Management Pilot Program was recently implemented in three Brazilian protected areas, while an adaptive and integrated approach has progressively raised the interest of other park managers. Initially, goals and actions have focused on protecting fire-sensitive vegetation and reducing the extent of areas burned, particularly at the end of the dry season. To achieve this, managers are making use of patch mosaic burning techniques to create mosaics of burnt and unburnt areas that purportedly decrease the probability of large wildfires and hence increase fire interval in fire-sensitive areas. However, despite advances in fire management policies in Brazilian savannas, an adaptive approach requires a continuous assessment of managed ecosystems, through which managers and ecologists can obtain knowledge about the responses of species and natural communities. Without a clear definition of appropriate ecological parameters, it is not possible to be sure if management actions or fire regime thresholds are actually delivering benefits for sustainable long-term biodiversity conservation. In this study, we use the example of the Canastra National Park (CNP) - Southeastern Brazil, to illustrate how widely employed suppression policies can result in inappropriate fire regimes and how these results have encouraged current changes in fire management perspectives.",NA,10.14195/978-989-26-16-506_66,NA,NA,NA,CPAPER,NA,598,606,NA,NA,978-989-26-16-506,WOS:000604444600066,NA,"Viegas, DX",8th International Conference on Forest Fire Research,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,5276

In this paper we present the land cover and industrial plantation distribution in the peatlands of Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo in 2015 and analyse their changes since 1990. We create the 2015 maps by visual interpretation of 30 m resolution Landsat data and combine them with fully comparable and completed land cover maps of 1990 and 2007 (Miettinen and Liew, 2010). Our results reveal continued peatland deforestation and conversion into managed land cover types. In 2015, 29% (4.6 Mha) of the peatlands in the study area remain covered by peat swamp forest (vs. 41% or 6.4 Mha in 2007 and 76% or 11.9 Mha in 1990). Managed land cover types (industrial plantations and smallholder dominated areas) cover 50% (7.8 Mha) of all peatlands (vs. 33% 5.2 Mha in 2007 and 11% 1.7 Mha in 1990). Industrial plantations have nearly doubled their extent since 2007 (2.3 Mha; 15%) and cover 4.3 Mha (27%) of peatlands in 2015. The majority of these are oil palm plantations (73%; 3.1 Mha) while nearly all of the rest (26%; 1.1 Mha) are pulp wood plantations. We hope that the maps presented in this paper will enable improved evaluation of the magnitude of various regional to global level environmental effects of peatland conversion and that they will help decision makers to define sustainable peatland management policies for insular Southeast Asian peatlands.

I focus my attention on the impacts of mangrove reforestation policies on women, who harvest shellfish. My research, conducted over 35 years on coastal mangroves in Africa and Madagascar, provides me with examples. Through a long-term approach to the perception of mangroves and the changing modes of policies, I highlight the weight of imperialism and neo-liberalism and analyze types of environmental injustice against mangrove harvesters, particularly the women, who are the most directly concerned by the preservation of their heritage and are rarely recognized as stakeholders in environmental policies that are defined internationally and implemented at national and local levels. They are not informed (or are deliberately kept unware) of new devices such as REDD+. They have lost their rights of access to the reforested mangrove areas.

The experiment was laid out in a split-plot design where the main plot (SMS) were arranged in randomised blocks and the cropping systems (sub-plot treatments) were randomised within the main plots. This study assessed the effects of the SMS; i.e. two CA systems [no-tillage (NT) and reduced tillage] and two conventional tillage (CT) systems (disk ploughing + disk harrowing annually, and mouldboard ploughing + disk harrowing annually). Key results The NT system was the most sustainable due to improvements in soil organic carbon concentration. After liming, CT systems were more effective than CA systems in decreasing Al3+ toxicity and increasing soil pH and Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations at deeper soil layers. The NT system had a considerable advantage over other SMS, due to a greater average wheat yield (18%). Conclusions The SMS evaluated in this study modified chemical properties when compared with the native forest area. The NT system was the least detrimental to soil organic carbon, an important indicator of soil quality.

We sampled a burned pine plantation (Burned Plantation); a former plantation that was harvested and burned (Harvested & Burned); an unburned former plantation that was harvested, planted with native trees, and treated with herbicide to control invasive grasses (Native Tree Planting); and two old-growth savannas which served as reference communities. Our results confirm that herbaceous plant communities on post-afforestation sites are very different from old-growth savannas. Among post-afforestation sites, Harvested & Burned herbaceous communities were modestly more similar in composition to old-growth savannas, had slightly higher richness of savanna plants (3.8 species per 50-m(2)), and supported the greatest cover of native herbaceous plants (56%).

Here, we aimed to assess changes in SOC, and related soil properties, after conversion of native rainforest to plantations of five tree species, with rotation cycles varying from 7 to 30 years, on the Mantiqueira Range, Minas Gerais, Brazil. We measured SOC contents and stocks (0.00-0.40 m layer) under a native montane rainforest (control) and plantations of Eucalyptus, Pinus, Cunninghamia, Cupressus and Araucaria, all planted in 3 x 3 m spacing, at an altitude of ca. 1,300 m, marked by humid and cool climate, where SOC contents are naturally high.

We analyzed data by analysis of variance and ordination techniques, considering compositional parameters and life forms, and indicator species analysis. Important Findings Species richness and vegetation cover were higher in reference grassland than in resprout areas but did not differ from post-eucalyptus areas. Exotic species cover was significantly higher in areas with afforestation history. In terms of total composition, natural grasslands differed significantly from areas with past plantation use.

We evaluated the difference in abundance, family and species richness, and species composition of ground spiders in the soybean and pasture environments, and the effect of grazing intensity on the spider community under a soybean-pasture rotation. We hypothesized that pastures would have higher spider species richness and a distinct species composition and that the increase in grazing intensity would reduce spider abundance and species richness. We conducted an experiment in an integrated annual crop-livestock system under a soybean-pasture rotation in southern Brazil that was managed for 14 years by alternating Glycine max for summer grain production and Avena strigosa + Lolium multiflorum for beef cattle grazing during the winter.

Our aim in this study was to evaluate soil C dynamics under sugarcane cultivation as influenced by the use of conservation management, using measurements from four different management systems and land use histories, i.e. conventional management with preharvest burning, no burning with residue retention and two systems without burning plus additional organic amendments. Field sites also differed in terms of soil texture. We compared field measurements of soil C stocks, C-13 and microbial biomass with simulated results from the Century ecosystem model for each of the sites and management histories. We also did long-term simulations of the management treatments and sites to approximate steady-state SOC levels, to explore potential management-induced differences in SOC stocks and interactions with soil texture. The model accurately represented treatment and site differences for total SOC stocks, in which SOC stocks were strongly affected by both rates of organic matter input to soil and soil clay content. However, the model tended to underestimate the relative contribution of sugarcane-derived C to total SOC for sites with high residue and external organic matter amendments. Measured microbial biomass C across the sites was closely aligned with relative amounts of organic matter input but did not appear to be strongly affected by soil texture, whereas the model predicted that both texture and organic matter input rate would impact microbial biomass C. Long-term simulations of the conservation management alternatives suggested that SOC stocks could be maintained at or above levels in the original native CerradAo vegetation, whereas conventional practices using residue burning would result in a reduction of SOC to ca. 60% of native levels.

Yet, functional redundancy has only been inferred by indirect evidence or measured by methods that may not be the most appropriate. Here, we apply an existing method to measure functional redundancy, which is the fraction of species diversity not expressed by functional diversity, to assess whether functional redundancy affects community resilience after disturbance. Location Subtropical grassland, south Brazil (30 degrees 0546S, 51 degrees 4037W). Method: Species traits and community composition were assessed in quadrats before grazing and after community recovery. Grazing intensity (G) was measured in each quadrat. We used traits linked to grazing intensity to define functional redundancy (FR) as the difference of Gini-Simpson index of species diversity (D) and Rao's quadratic entropy (Q). Also, with the same traits, we defined community functional stability (S) as the similarity between trait-based community composition before grazing and 47 and 180 d after grazing ending. Using path analysis we assessed different postulated causal models linking functional diversity (Q), functional redundancy (FR), grazing intensity (G) and community-weightedmean traits to community stability (S) under grazing. Results: Path analysis revealed the most valid causal model FR -> S <- G, with a significant positive path coefficient for FR -> S and a marginally significant negative one for S <- G. Since FR and G were independent in their covariation and in their effects on S, the model discriminated community resistance to grazing (the effect of G on S) from community resilience after grazing caused by functional redundancy (indicated by the effect of FR on S). Conclusion: We show that expressing functional redundancymathematically is a useful tool for testing causal models linking diversity to community stability.

Yet, leakage remains both loosely conceptualized and poorly understood as a phenomenon in policy making. To fill this gap and broaden the leakage research agenda, we conduct a state-of-the-art review of scientific assessments on leakage (particularly on land use) and combine it with conceptual and analytical frameworks from the environmental governance literature. We then propose a rigorous definition of leakage, discuss frequently overlooked political dimensions, and develop a typology of leakage pathways. Our analysis of leakage through a governance lens yields five core insights: (1) Leakage is not simply a mechanistic phenomenon, but a complex governance issue involving questions of institutional fit, interactions, and political agency. (2) Although the land use literature traditionally focuses on leakage through markets or activity displacement, a governance lens shows that it also occurs through information, motivation, or institutional channels. (3) As policy-makers may act strategically, the unintentionally of leakage should not be assumed but rather become an object of research. (4) A phenomenon not initially regarded as leakage can come to be framed as such through the action of 'problem brokers' and changes in policy fields.

We sampled birds in riparian forests and in eucalyptus plantations at two stages of development using the point count method. We partitioned beta-diversity into nestedness and turnover components to detect the strength of local extinction and colonization processes, respectively, in determining variation in composition among native forests and intermediate and old-aged plantations considering all birds together and only forest-specialist birds.

In P17, N2O emission was still low, but CH4 consumption diminished sixfold, possibly because of the predominance of methanotrophy, favoured by the highest WFPS (similar to 80%) and lowest macroporosity that together with low mineral N concentration also did not favour the formation of N2O. In P32, the improved soil mineral N, macroporosity and intermediate WFPS ( similar to 60%) increased CH4 consumption and also N2O emission, in an environment supposedly favourable to methanotrophy and also to N2O production.

Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the native plant community of Cerrado, using some techniques to enhance species natural regeneration three years after pine trees removal in areas where plantations existed since 1966. Before treatments application, surveys of the herbaceous and woody community were conducted, followed by the treatment application (fire and the removal of needles) as a management intervention. Moreover, we established control plots, with no intervention. Four and 30 months after treatment application, the herbaceous and woody vegetation, as well as the dead biomass and bare soil components were monitored to observe their regeneration. The pine removal contributed to species development and both techniques contributed to soil exposition, opening space for colonization and species to resprout.

The goal of this study was to analyze how urban afforestation is associated with sociodemographic factors to understand the distribution of trees (and their benefits) among different social segments in the city of Macap & aacute;, in the extreme Northeastern Amazon. We conducted a floristic inventory in 217 blocks belonging to 32 neighborhoods, and classified species according to origin (exotic or native) and fruit use (fruit-bearing or non-fruit-bearing). Additionally, we selected 12 variables to represent sociodemographic gradients among neighborhoods. We reduced the dimensionality of floristic and sociodemographic data using ordination techniques, and used their first axes to represent gradients of species composition and sociodemographic factors. The effect of sociodemographic gradients on tree abundance, species richness and composition was tested using generalized linear models. The results indicate that most urban trees are exotic, non-fruit-bearing, and of medium size (10-30 cm in diameter). Older neighborhoods with higher human population age and income showed higher tree abundance and higher species richness. The species composition was related to the gradient of human population density, proportion of old people, income, and household occupancy. Large non-fruit trees were more frequent in neighborhoods with low population density. Exotic trees were more frequent in older neighborhoods with older people and high income, and large fruit trees showed higher abundance in neighborhoods with low household occupancy rates.

We argue that sustainable intensification of pasturelands in Brazil is a viable way to increase agricultural output while simultaneously sparing land for nature. Since environmental degradation is often associated with low-yield extensive systems in Brazil, it is possible to obtain higher yields, while reversing degradation, by adopting practices like rotational grazing, incorporation of legumes and integrated crop-livestock-forestry systems.

During winter, Italian ryegrass cover crops were grazed by sheep: grazing management treatments included two stocking methods (continuous and rotational) and two forage allowances (10 and 20 kg of herbage dry matter available per 100 kg animal live weight). During summer, the crop rotation treatments involved either soybean-maize or soybean-soybean in succession with winter-grazed cover crops. The treatments were part of a factorial randomized complete block design. Treatment effects were evaluated on the weed seedbank and emerged weed flora populations during winter-grazed cover crop and summer crop growth as well as during the harvest phase. The current results demonstrate that crop rotation and grazing management exhibited interactive effects on the determination of weed outcomes in an ICLS. However, overall, compared with moderate forage allowance, high forage allowance during the winter-grazed cover crop caused lower emerged weed flora in subsequent crops (20% reduction during crop growth and 90% reduction at crop harvest) and 48% reduction in seedbank size. High forage allowance promoted more residue from winter-grazed cover crop biomass, which remained during the summer crop phases and probably resulted in a physical barrier to weed emergence.",NA,10.1017/S0021859618000813,NA,NA,NA,JOUR,6,810,820,NA,AUG,0021-8596 and 1469-5146,WOS:000449485300008,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,5400

Regardless of the predominant resource source (autochthonous or allochthonous), greater availability of light and nutrients favors the development and, later, grazing (top-down factor) of the biofilm, with reflections on the trophic structure of these ecosystems. The increase in primary productivity in lotic ecosystems may reflect the fractionation of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) by the algal cells contained in the biofilm. A global meta-analysis showed that an increase in primary productivity leads to enrichment of the carbon isotope ratios of biofilm. The objective of this study was to evaluate how top-down (grazing) and bottom-up (light and nutrient) factors act on the biofilm and whether algal biomass determines the isotopic fractionation of delta C-13 in headwaters of Central Brazil. The density of grazing macroinvertebrates was controlled with electric pulses. Electrified (excluding grazers) and non-electrified grids were implemented in open and shaded areas in each stream. The biofilm ash-free dry mass (AFDM) doubled in nutrient-enriched streams. The effect of grazing on the biomass of the biofilm was significant for the nutrient-enriched streams, with a 50% reduction in the AFDM. Additionally, shading influenced chlorophyll-a even in pristine streams, as the concentration increased approximately ten-fold under open canopy conditions. There was a significant negative relationship between chlorophyll-a concentrations and delta C-13 values. Our study provides evidence that biofilm biomass increases as a result of changes in bottom-up controls.

An experiment was conducted to ascertain which management techniques (coppicing, pollarding or crown-thinning) permit the highest survival of trees and optimal timber production. Four much-utilised tree species: Croton sonderianus, Mimosa ophthalmocentra, Mimosa tenuiflora and Poincianella pyramidalis (syn. Caesalpinia pyramidalis) were studied at two sites in Pernambuco State. The impact of each harvesting regime was evaluated over a six-year period, with additional variables including wet-season versus dry-season harvesting, and three-year versus six-year harvesting cycles. The best performing tree species varied between sites, with M. tenuiflora providing the highest yields with all treatments at Sertania and M. tenuiflora and Poincianella pyramidalis at Serra Talhada. The optimal management regime did not vary between species. Crown-thinned trees produced limited regrowth with the lowest mortality rates, and when ultimately coppiced growth appeared to have been stimulated. Pollarding was intermediate and coppicing was the poorest management strategy. Trees which were harvested twice, in both 2005 and 2008, had much lower overall production than those which had only been harvested once in 2008. The highest yields were obtained from crown-thinned trees which were coppiced in 2005 or 2008. Management decisions must consider local environmental conditions in the selection of the tree species used to produce fuelwood, however, the optimal management strategy for high production and low mortality is consistently low impact, infrequent crown thinning. There was considerable difference in the findings between the study sites (e.g. in the distribution of statistically significant results), and also in the impacts of treatments on mortality between the four species.

We estimated the current range and population size of the species at Baluran National Park, which supports Java's last known population, and used species distribution modeling to evaluate potential suitability of currently unoccupied areas across the park to identify priorities for management intervention. We estimate that the Black-winged Myna population numbers 179 individuals (95% CI: 111-288; density: 14.3 +/- 3.5 individuals km(2)) and that its current range is 12.3 km'. Our model indicated that some 72 km(2) of the park (30% of total area) has potentially suitable habitat for the species, and we infer that the principal cause for the disparity between its current and potential range is trapping, compounded by savanna loss and degradation due to illegal domestic cattle grazing and the spread of invasive thorny acacia (Vachellia nilotica). The partial clearance of acacia in recent years appears to have assisted a modest population recovery by the myna. Its further population growth and range expansion in Baluran will depend on effective management of illegal poaching, further clearance of acacia, and easing domestic cattle grazing pressure on areas of savanna, particularly through engagement with communities living inside the park.

We assessed bird communities over 1228 plots from 21 sites in the highly populated island of Java, Indonesia. We found that commercial coffee polycultures (i.e., fields comprised of coffee plants, other crops and/or fruit trees, and diverse shade trees) could sustain similar levels of bird abundance, diversity, and richness than coffee systems under natural forests and community managed forests. Commercial coffee polyculture fields host higher bird abundance, diversity, and richness than sun-exposed coffee fields, fields with other crops or fruit trees, and tree farms. We provide evidence that complex commercial agroforestry systems can host similar levels of biodiversity to agroforestry systems under natural forest. Deforestation in the tropics is mainly driven by the need to expand agriculture and forestry land. Tropical cropland has also undergone a process of intensification, particularly evident in regions that are the main exporters of deforestation-driven commodities. Around 25 million people in the world depend on coffee production, which has a profound contribution to global biodiversity loss through agricultural extensification and intensification. Nevertheless, coffee agroforestry systems have been postulated to serve as an alternative refuge for biodiversity across different regions. We aim to compare bird abundance, diversity, and richness in commercial polyculture coffee systems (i.e., the highest degree of habitat complexity that can be achieved in coffee fields after deforestation) with other coffee agroforestry systems and human modified habitats in Java, Indonesia. We collected data in 21 sites (1228 points) on Java from February to August 2021 using the point sampling method. Via generalised additive models, we tested whether the abundance, diversity, and richness of birds were different between different human modified habitats including other potential predictors such as elevation, distance to protected areas, shade tree richness, and plant diversity. Using the non-metric multidimensional scaling, we tested whether there was a difference in terms of the composition of foraging guilds between habitats. Commercial polyculture coffee fields can sustain levels of bird abundance, diversity, and richness comparable to agroforestry systems under natural forest, and higher than sun coffee and shaded monoculture coffee, and of other human modified habitats such as crop/fruit fields and tree farms. Coffee agroforestry systems have a higher proportion of nectarivores, insectivores, and frugivores than other systems that can sustain high diversity and richness of birds such as paddy fields that mainly have granivores and carnivores. Complex polycultures can represent an avenue for the future of sustainable agriculture in conditions where deforestation rates are high and in crops such as coffee, which maintain high yield in the presence of diverse shade.",NA,10.3390/biology11020310,NA,NA,NA,JOUR,2,NA,NA,NA,FEB,2079-7737,WOS:000764483800001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,5417

This agroforestry system has three strata formed by forest and fruit trees and species of multiple uses. During 3 years (2011-2013), leaf litter was sampled monthly to account for litterfall and quarterly to account for litter accumulation. The rates of litter decomposition were estimated using the ratio produced-to-accumulated litter, and the correlation between litter fall and rainfall was calculated. Precipitation data were provided by the water and climate agency of Pernambuco (APAC). Soil samples (0-15 cm) were also taken quarterly, simultaneously with the litter accumulation samples, and soil microbial respiration was assessed using the capture, by a KOH solution, of the evolved CO2. The annual production of leaf litter was stable in the 3 years of study in this agroforestry system, and the monthly input of litter to the soil was influenced by rainfall, being higher in the dry seasons.

This study attempts to analyse the ways in which the selected cases of the forest-related Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and forest-focused Montreal Process (MP) regional regimes may have synergetic overlaps or disparity in their institutional design and forest policy development. For this, we combined IR's 'rational institutional design' theory and a policy analysis approach. Using a qualitative data approach, we analyzed key structure-related historical regime documents (e.g., charters) issued since the inception of both regimes, and their latest forest policy initiatives for the periods 2016-2025 (Strategic Plan of Action for ASEAN Cooperation on Forestry) and 2009-2015 (Conceptual Framework for the Montreal Process Strategic Action Plan) with all relevant policy documents since the adoption of current policies. Based on that, we pose the empirical questions of how both regimes illustrate governance structure (i.e., institutional design), and on the other hand how to explain regime forest policies coherently and consistently in terms of their high versus low degree of formality. The results show that institutional design is highly explanatory based on treaty and non-treaty regime formation as well as forest-related/focused regime formation with the synergistic sustainable forest management (SFM) issue that embraces deforestation and forest degradation, biodiversity, timber certification, and greenhouse gas emission. Additionally, the results suggest that the policy goals adopted by both regimes are coherent and consistent based on the full set of policy elements.

Tropical peat swamp forests (TPSFs) are characterized in part by small-scale variations in topography ('hummocks' and 'hollows') that create distinct microhabitats and thus may contribute to niche diversification among TPSF tree species. Using tree elevations calibrated to daily peat water levels collected using a data logger and a permutation test, we evaluated topographical microhabitat preferences for 21 tree species in a relatively undisturbed TPSF in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, to determine whether these species show preferential association with hummocks or hollows and to quantify the prevalence of microhabitat specialization among them. Only one species, Tetractomia tetrandrum, emerged as a hollow specialist, with no hummock specialists among the species tested. The remaining 20 species, including Psydrax dicoccos, which had the lowest mean observed elevation, and Maasia hypoleuca, which had the highest mean observed elevation, showed no clear microtopographic preference. This suggests that many TPSF species may be resilient to the natural hydrologic variations that occur in relatively intact peat swamp forests.

South America generates the most scientific research on the topic in the region. We conducted a comprehensive review and analysis of knowledge production for South American agroforestry that includes livestock grazing, known as agrosilvopastoralism (AS), examining how different sociopolitical factors such as sources of funding, institutional priorities, and international cooperation can bias the direction and objectives of scientific research. We assessed the major attributes of scientific publications on the topic (25 articles per country: overall n = 210) and the potential factors underlying the processes of research and development in the region. The tree component was the most studied, while the livestock component received less attention. Studies were mainly focused on the production of goods and services (monetary or nonmonetary approaches), except in Brazil, where conservation was the major study objective. Stakeholders were involved in more than half of the studies (60%), and they were mostly ranchers and local producers. More than half (70%) of the studies offered recommendations based on their results, and such recommendations were mostly concerned with the management of agrosilvopastoral system components. In general, studies were led just as often by local as foreign first authors and coauthored by more than three people as part of interinstitutional working groups. Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Chile had more frequent cooperation among institutions and countries but mainly used their own funding. In contrast, Bolivia. Ecuador, and Peru had almost 100% of their studies supported by foreign countries (North America and Europe). Countries with greater internal funding of research generated more long-term studies. Besides this, two clear trends were detected: 1) conservation and social aspects were mainly supported by sources from external countries led by foreign principal investigators, and 2) production issues were supported from sources within countries and supported high levels of cooperation among institutions.

However, in both regards they are generally inferior to forests. Therefore, the impact of agroforestry practices on landscape C stocks and biodiversity needs to be analyzed both in terms of the interactions between agroforestry and forest, which may be positive or negative, and in terms of the conservation of C and biodiversity in the farming systems themselves. This paper argues that in forest frontier situations, the most important characteristic of land use systems in terms of C and biodiversity conservation is to be ""land-sparing"" (i.e. minimizing forest conversion), which requires a certain level of intensification. In land use mosaics, on the other hand, where natural habitat has already been reduced to small fragments, land use practices should also be biodiversity-friendly and have high levels of C storage to complement those in natural vegetation. Agroforestry has a role to play in both situations by making land use more sustainable and by making inhabited reserves ecologically and economically more viable. The paper presents three case studies where different sets of incentives are used to provide communities with the means to conserve C and biodiversity on their land and adjacent forest. In the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, Mexico, C trading is combined with shade coffee (Coffea sp.) production to conserve and increase tree cover on farm land in biosphere reserves. In North Sumatra, Indonesia, coffee-growing communities receive technical and marketing support and assistance with legalizing their land tenure situation as incentives to stop forest conversion for coffee, with a prospect of adding C trading later. In the central Brazilian Amazon, communities reforest their land in an extractive reserve and offer reforestation credits on a local market while laying the basis for a more tree-based reserve economy. In all three cases, the bundling of various forms of incentives is meant to increase the resilience of the respective approach to market and policy changes. Approaches like these would benefit from a better integration of agricultural and forest policies.",NA,10.1007/978-94-007-1630-8_10 and 10.1007/978-94-007-1630-8,NA,NA,NA,CHAP,NA,179,200,NA,NA,1875-1199 and 978-94-007-1629-2,WOS:000307316800011,NA,"Kumar, BM and Nair, PKR",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,5472

We analyze 208 cocoa producers' variables from 2015 using both measured and self-reported data.

This low value points to the increased infestation of cocoa pod borer and the failure of the Gemas government program. Increasing efficiency could lead to a win-win-win situation: higher cocoa production from fewer hectares, and with more native rainforest plants co-existing with cocoa on those hectares.

In any natural environment, different light intensity regimes vary considerably along the day. Such phenomenon requires a high level of plasticity, resistance, and resilience from plants.

A set of 96 throughfall gauges was systematically distributed underneath canopies of cacao only, and underneath canopies of cacao plus emergent trees (cacao plus trees). From an earlier study we knew that stemflow can safely be estimated with less than 1% of gross precipitation (Pg). Median throughfall tended to be lower in gauges underneath cacao plus trees than under cacao only (p <= 0.1), and the estimated rainfall interception loss was 4% and 16% of Pg in cacao only and cacao plus trees plots, respectively. This difference was most likely caused by a tree-induced enhancement of the canopy water storage capacity and an increase in canopy roughness. Underneath the canopy of emergent trees (cacao plus trees), throughfall exceeded gross precipitation east of the tree stems (113%) and was significantly lower (p <= 0.05) west and north of the tree stems (67-77% of Pg). Significant effects of trees on throughfall did not extend beyond their canopy area. We assume that wind-driven rain was stripped out east of the stems causing an increase in throughfall, while rain-shadow effects led to a decrease in throughfall west and north of the tree stems. Thus, at our study site emergent trees tended to reduce rain water input, and produced clear spatial patterns in throughfall distribution. A reduced water availability may lead to reduced cacao bean yields in times of water scarcity but a more complete assessment of the hydrological function of shade trees in agroforestry systems may also reveal positive influences of shade trees on cacao trees. Such an advanced analysis of hydrological functions still remains to be done. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

One frequently recommended instrument is to intensify farming systems in the adjacent areas, so as to decrease the need to harvest resources from national parks. This study examined this issue by analyzing the effects of different household land uses in villages near a national park on their propensity to harvest resources from the park. In the northern part of the Kerinci Seblat National Park (Sumatra Island, Indonesia) the park buffer zone is comprised largely of community or village forests and human settlements. The village forests were formerly managed as production forests and provided significant cash income to the village. They were converted into farmland, particularly to mixed-tree gardens or agroforests. Natural forest coverage has now declined to 10% of the former area within village forest land. We analyzed the characteristics of the mixed gardens and village forests, and their practical contribution to reducing farmers' dependence on the adjacent national park resources. Households with farms that were more diversified were found to have much less dependency on the national park resources. Households that farmed only wetland rice fields registered the highest value of forest products obtained from inside the park. Households that farmed only mixed gardens had an intermediate level of park resource extraction, while those that had farms composed of both components (i.e. wetland rice fields and mixed gardens) had a dramatically lower level of economic dependency on park resources than households in either of the other two categories.",NA,10.1023/A:1012047602192,NA,NA,NA,JOUR,3,171,184,NA,NA,0167-4366 and 1572-9680,WOS:000170961200001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,5517

Pollination of crops depends on local agricultural management and the quality of adjacent habitats. Lowland coffee Coffea canephora, is an important tropical cash crop. Fruit set depends on cross-pollination by bees, so inadequate pollination leads to reduced yield. In this study we analyse the relationship between bee pollinators, fruit set in coffee, and the local and regional agroforestry systems to identify the optimal conditions for pollinators. 2. We analysed the abundance and species composition of coffee flower-visiting bees in 15 agroforestry systems differing in distance to forest (important for wood-nesting species), light intensity (important for ground-nesting species), blossom cover of coffee and noncoffee-flowering plants, and species richness of flowering plants (as pollen and nectar resources) in Central Sulawesi (Indonesia). We examined which factors were most important for optimal pollination success. We carried out bagged and open pollination experiments in each agroforestry system, to measure the pollination efficiency of 15 bee species. 3. The number of social bee species decreased with distance to forest, whereas the number of solitary bee species increased with light intensity (less shade) and greater quantities of blossoms. 4. Fruit set of open pollinated flowers (as opposed to manually cross-pollinated flowers) increased with the diversity and abundance of flower-visiting bees. In the agroforestry systems studied, a bee community of 20 species or more led to a higher fruit set (95%) than a species-poor bee community of six species (70% fruit set). 5. Pollination activity by members of the species-rich solitary bee assemblage led to higher levels of fruit set than that arising from pollination activity by members of the more abundant social bee assemblage. 6. Synthesis and applications. A species-rich and abundant bee assemblage will facilitate high pollination success in lowland coffee. This will increase fruit set and coffee yield. Farmers can encourage different species of bees through simple management measures such as growing coffee in shade beneath a variety of trees; by pruning trees to increase levels of sunlight and numbers of flowering herbs; and by increasing the availability of nesting sites for solitary bees. Weed control and the use of herbicides should be kept to a minimum so that a diverse nectar and pollen resource is available to bees throughout the year. Natural forests and forest fragments should be preserved in the vicinity of coffee agroforestry systems (< 500 m) so that forest-nesting social bees can travel easily to the coffee fields to pollinate the flowers.",NA,10.1046/j.1365-2664.2003.00847.x,NA,NA,NA,JOUR,5,837,845,NA,OCT,0021-8901 and 1365-2664,WOS:000185552400007,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,5523

We draw on ecological modernization theory and international political economy arguments to examine the sources of an environmental Kuznets curve (or EKC) that produces an inverted U-shaped rate of deforestation relative to economic development. Method. We use ordinary least squares regression with White's ( 1978) correction Cor possible heteroskedasticity to examine the rate of deforestation (1980-1995) in less developed countries. Results. Net of controls for initial forest stock and the quality of deforestation estimates, we find strong evidence for an EKC driven by (1) agglomeration effects linked to the level of urbanization, (2) rural-to-urban migration that partially offsets rural population pressure, (3) the growth of services-dominated urban economies, and (4) strong democratic states. We Find little evidence that foreign debt or export dependence influence the deforestation rate. Conclusions. Although deforestation continues to pose pressing and potentially irreversible environmental risks, there is evidence of self-corrective ecological and modernization processes inherent in development that act to mitigate these risks. Deforestation is a pressing environmental problem involving permanent loss of species, soil degradation, impact on global climate change, and long-term resource depletion. Of the approximately 3.4 billion hectares of forest land that existed around the globe in 1980, approximately 5 percent had been cleared by 1995 (FAO, 1997). Although some decline in the rate of deforestation has been detected in the 1990s (with rapid deforestation in some regions being offset by uneven decreases in Brazil and reforestation in some developed nations), there is no guarantee of abatement in the near future (World Resources Institute, 2000). Given the inextricable links between forest cover and biodiversity, soil quality, and atmospheric replenish-ment, understanding the causes and consequences of deforestation must be central to both natural and social environmental science. Of the various forms of environmental degradation, deforestation holds a special appeal because (1) the felling of trees is spatially fixed and therefore more amenable to study, (2) deforestation is unambiguously due to human activities, and (3) the loss of forest cover is uniquely intertwined with nearly all other forms of environmental degradation. This article extends and improves on prior cross-national analyses of deforestation. Whereas most past studies have been empirical and descriptive, more recent investigations have been more theoretical, emphasizing modernization processes, demographic pressures, and dependency/world systems constraints (e.g., Rock, 1996; Rudel and Roper, 1997; Ehrhardt-Martinez, 1998, 1999). As a part of this theorizing, the existence and implications of an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) have garnered increasing attention. Given that the actual meaning of this curvilinear relationship between development and deforestation depends heavily on the intervening mechanisms linking the two, the purpose of this investigation is first to establish the existence of an EKC for deforestation and then to examine various competing explanations for this pattern.",NA,10.1111/1540-6237.00080,NA,NA,NA,JOUR,1,226,243,NA,MAR,0038-4941 and 1540-6237,WOS:000173943500015,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,5532

Humans have had a profound influence on forests virtually everywhere they both are found. Thus 'natural' defined as 'without human influence' is a hypothetical construct, though one that has assumed mythological value among many conservationists. Biodiversity is a forest value that does not carry a market price. It is the foundation, however, upon which productive systems depend. The relationship between agroforestry and the wild biodiversity contained in more natural forests is a complicated one, depending on the composition of the agroforestry system itself and the way it is managed. Complex forest gardens are more supportive of biodiversity than monocrop systems, shade coffee more than sun coffee, and systems using native plants tend to be more biologically diverse. Nonnative plants, especially potentially invasive alien species, threaten biodiversity and need to be avoided. The relationship between forests, agroforestry and wild biodiversity can be made most productive through applying adaptive management approaches that incorporate ongoing research and monitoring in order to feed information back into the management system. Maintaining diversity in approaches to management of agroforestry systems will provide humanity with the widest range of options for adapting to changing conditions.

Forest policies that limit land use options may be able to halt forest change, if strongly enforced, but concurrently may also reduce livestock carrying capacity. This study explored the use of the spatially explicit FALLOW model, with a new livestock module, to assess the impact of land use zoning strategies, in combination with access to fodder harvesting, on welfare, fodder availability and landscape carbon stocks in the Upper Konto catchment, Indonesia. The existing land zoning in Upper Konto catchment is in name 'land-sparing' but de facto combined with 'land sharing' approach with access to cut and carry fodder sources in watershed protection areas. Scenario analysis revealed that the existing land zoning approach is the most promising in terms of balancing fodder availability, farmers' welfare (total profits gained from production in the landscape minus products consumed by people living in the area) and ecosystem functions (with above-ground carbon stocks as indicator). A pure land sparing approach with agricultural intensification indicates increase in farmers' welfare but with a higher decrease (in percentage) of landscape above-ground carbon stocks. Hence, careful integration of livestock systems into zoned conservation areas can achieve multiple goals including enhancing peoples' livelihoods and protecting environmental services.

Conversion of rainforest into agricultural land affects multiple facets of tropical plant diversity. While the effects of tropical land use change and intensification on species diversity are comparatively well studied, the effects on phylogenetic diversity (PD) and structure of plant communities are largely unknown. Furthermore, it is not clear how the loss of native species and addition of alien species collectively affect PD and structure. 2. We investigated the PD and structure of understorey plants; a diverse and ecologically important, yet poorly studied group. We studied four prominent land use systems (tropical lowland rainforest, jungle rubber agroforest, rubber plantations, and oil palm plantations) in the lowlands of Sumatra (Indonesia), a region experiencing dramatic land use changes. 3. Across the four systems, we investigated differences in four metrics of phylogenetic community structure (PD, mean pairwise distance, mean nearest taxon distance, and their abundance-weighted variants). Our analyses were based on a comprehensive vegetation survey consisting of 32 plots, 1,197 species of vascular plants, and 146,599 plant individuals. 4. Our results showed that forest conversion into agricultural systems leads to a pronounced loss of PD. Furthermore, the standardized effect size of mean pairwise distance indicated a gradual change from clustered to overdispersed phylogenetic community structure with increasing land use intensity from forest over jungle rubber to the monoculture plantations. In most land use systems, the presence or absence of alien plant species did not affect phylogenetic structure.

However, traditional methods have been limited to canopy ants, and not assessed the role of ants on and below ground. Recent advances have enabled whole-ecosystem ant suppression in large plots, but large-scale experiments are not always feasible. Here, we develop a small-scale, whole-ecosystem suppression method. We compare techniques for monitoring suppression experiments, and assess whether habitat complexity in oil palm influences our method's effectiveness. We conducted ant suppression experiments in oil palm agroforestry in Sumatra, Indonesia. We used targeted poison baits, a physical barrier and canopy isolation to suppress ants in 4 m radius arenas around single palms. We sequentially tested three suppression methods that increased in intensity over 18 months. We sampled ant abundance before and after suppression by fogging, using pitfall traps and extracting soil monoliths. We also monitored ants throughout the experiment by baiting. We tested the soil for residual poison and monitored other invertebrates (Araneae, Coleoptera, Orthoptera and Chilopoda) to test for cross-contamination. Plots were established under four oil palm management treatments that varied in their habitat complexity: reduced, intermediate and high understorey complexity treatments in mature plantation, and a recently replanted plantation. Post-treatment ant abundance was 92% lower in suppression than control plots. Only the most intensive suppression method, which ran for the final 9 months, worked. Baiting rarely reflected the other monitoring methods. The treatment negatively affected Orthoptera, but not other taxa. There was no residual poison in the soil. Coleoptera abundance increased in suppression plots post-treatment, potentially due to reduced competition with ants. Our findings were consistent across management treatments. We developed a whole-ecosystem method for suppressing ants on a small scale in oil palm plantations. Our method represents a significant advance; previous reductions in ant abundance have not exceeded 38%. We provide the first example of ants being experimentally suppressed belowground.

To examine the potential interactions between landscapes and bird assemblages, we employed generalized linear models (GLM). Taxonomic diversity showed no correlation with any landscape metrics. On the other hand, variation in the three metrics of functional diversity was related to landscape heterogeneity.

We highlight the negative impact of landscape homogenization on the ecological functions performed by birds in vineyards, while finding no significant effect on species diversity. These findings can provide valuable support for the formulation of public policies aimed at striking a balance between agricultural production and biodiversity conservation.Abstract in Portuguese is available with online material. A conversao global de terras em agroecossistemas resultou em declinio na biodiversidade de aves, e a analise da diversidade funcional e uma ferramenta importante para detectar mudancas nas funcoes ecologicas desempenhadas por aves nesses ambientes. Este artigo tem como objetivos investigar as respostas da diversidade taxonomica e funcional de aves a heterogeneidade da paisagem e a cobertura florestal nativa (Mata Atlantica) em vinhedos neotropicais. Para isso, amostramos 19 paisagens de vinhedos no sudeste do Brasil. Essas paisagens cobriam um gradiente de cobertura florestal e heterogeneidade resultante de diferentes usos da terra. Para avaliar a diversidade de aves, consideramos tanto a diversidade taxonomica quanto a diversidade funcional (ou seja, riqueza funcional, uniformidade funcional e divergencia funcional). Para examinar as interacoes potenciais entre as paisagens e as assembleias de aves, empregamos modelos lineares generalizados (GLM). A diversidade taxonomica nao mostrou correlacao com nenhuma metrica da paisagem. Por outro lado, a variacao nas tres metricas da diversidade funcional foi relacionada a heterogeneidade da paisagem. No entanto, em paisagens heterogeneas, essas comunidades podem ser estruturadas por processos de similaridade limitante. Destacamos o impacto negativo da homogeneizacao da paisagem nas funcoes ecologicas desempenhadas por aves em vinhedos, porem nao encontramos efeito significativo na diversidade de especies. Esses resultados podem fornecer um arcabouco valioso para a formulacao de politicas publicas voltadas para encontrar um equilibrio entre producao agricola e conservacao da biodiversidade.

The effect of agroforestry management on small mammal diversity,BIOTROPICA,52,NA,"Agroforestry systems play fundamental roles for wildlife conservation, but are prone to disturbances from management practices aiming at increasing local productivity. This work investigates the small mammal assemblages present in cacao agroforests, which differ in shade tree density. We tested the prediction that higher tree density increases shade level, analyzed how some environmental variables important for small mammals (vegetation complexity, tree basal area, and invertebrate biomass) vary across the shade level gradient, and how the assemblages respond to these variations. We also tested the effect of the environmental variables on the abundance of the three most common species: Rhipidomys mastacalis, Hylaeamys seuanezi, and Marmosa murina. We captured 651 individuals belonging to 18 species. A positive relationship was observed between an abundance of non-forest specialists and tree basal area, while species diversity within this group showed positive association with vegetation complexity. Assemblage structure (described by a matrix of species abundance per site) was not affected by our environmental variables, but R. mastacalis was more abundant in sites with lower vegetation complexity. Higher shade levels in cacao agroforest tended to occur in sites with greater tree basal area, which was not a good predictor of small mammal diversity. This suggests that environmental management to reduce shade with the purpose of increasing cacao productivity is not necessarily negative for small mammal conservation. Species diversity was favored by structurally complex systems, a possible response to greater niche diversity. in Portuguese is available with online material.",NA,10.1111/btp.12750,NA,NA,NA,JOUR,3,470,479,NA,MAY,0006-3606 and 1744-7429,WOS:000535126400010,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,5589

The decline in these agroecosystems due to land-use changes poses as a major threat to Atlantic Forest biodiversity conservation. Therefore, efficient agricultural extension actions towards the maintenance of these agroforestry systems are paramount. This research evaluated the process of construction and sharing of knowledge in agricultural extension practices toward agroecological management of the Cabruca in three agrarian reform settlements, and the challenges for the persistence of Cabruca in this region. We interviewed seven farmers and three extension agents from the Cabruca Institute. The study showed that most of the proposed practices adopted by farmers were already part of the traditional Cabruca management. The main limitations for the adoption of new practices were that they required increased labor, which is scarce and expensive. In fact, exodus and aging of the rural population remain major threats for long-term sustainability and persistence of Cabruca agroecosystems. Other limitations for organic management include the absence of differentiated price and marketing channels for organic cocoa and other products for the Cabruca social biodiversity. Although the process of construction and sharing of knowledge was participatory, overall community participation in the process was low.

We investigate the effects of household and road proximity, and of dog population size in the surroundings on the invasion of cacao agroforest by dogs, and evaluate if dogs raised in the vicinity are more likely to invade agroforests than dogs of unknown origin. The study was conducted in a landscape dominated by agroforests, within the cacao growing region of Southern Bahia, Brazil. Dogs were recorded by cameratraps in 15 agroforest sites, and we identified dogs inhabiting the vicinity of each sampled agroforest site by visiting all households up to 800 m from sampling sites. We obtained 115 photographic records of 47 individuals, and identified 213 dogs inhabiting the site surroundings. The number of individuals and frequency of visit of dogs tend to be higher in agroforests located nearer a household, but were not associated with the distance to the nearest road or the dog population size in the surroundings. The frequency of visits in agroforests did not differ between dogs residing in the surroundings and dogs of unknown origin. Our results indicate that the surroundings are not the main source of dogs invading agroforests, most likely because dogs perform long-distance movements in association to humans. Strategies to reduce the impacts of dogs on wildlife will gain from studies on movement ecology and should include practices to restrict dogs' home range.

Although coffee cultivation exists in the State of Amazonas, there is no information regarding the behavior of this species population in this region of Brazil. Since the Amazon region is a favorable environment for H. hampei, the present study aimed to investigate this insect population in the following cultivation systems implanted in the municipality of Humaita, Southern Amazonas: i) coffee in native forest (CNF), ii) coffee intercropped with cupuacu and acai (native Brazilian fruits) (CCA) and iii) coffee in monoculture (MC). Also, the climatic and phenological parameters of the plant were used in relation with the population dynamics of the insect. For that, ten baited traps were installed in each field for the monthly sampling of the H. hampei population from July/2018 to June/2019. The highest population abundance of the insect was observed during the coffee flowering season, mainly in monoculture crops, when compared to the other intercropped fields. The total mean value of the insect population observed in the three environments evaluated was highest in August/2018, with a recorded value of 1749. The increase in rainfall indexes occurred simultaneously with a decrease in the insect population; this coincides with the end of the flowering season (October/2018, 161.8 mm) and the beginning of grain formation (November/2018, 234.8 mm). The lowest abundance of the insect observed in the coffee fields in native forest, with an abundance of 83 (CNF), indicates that the local biodiversity disfavors the population size of the pest in the environment. These results suggest that phenological phases of conilon coffee and the influence of climatic conditions can result in changes in the population dynamics of the H. hampei.

Collembola are among the most abundant arthropods inhabiting the belowground system sensitively responding to changes in vegetation and soil conditions. However, most studies on the response of Collembola to land-use change were conducted in temperate ecosystems and focused on shifts in community composition or morphological traits, while parameters more closely linked to ecosystem functioning, such as trophic niches, received little attention. Here, we used stable isotope analysis (C-13 and N-15) to investigate changes in the trophic structure and use of food resources by Collembola in Jambi province (Sumatra, Indonesia), a region that experienced strong deforestation in the last decades. Isotopic values of Collembola from 32 sites representing four land-use systems were analyzed (rainforest, rubber agroforest, rubber (Hevea brasiliansis) and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) monoculture plantations). Across Collembola species Delta C-13 values were highest in rainforest suggesting more pronounced processing of litter resources by microorganisms and consumption of these microorganisms by Collembola in this system. Lower Delta C-13 values, but high Delta C-13 variation in Collembola in oil palm plantations indicated that Collembola shifted towards herbivory and used more variable resources in this system. Small range in Delta N-15 values in Collembola species in monoculture plantations in comparison to rainforest indicated that conversion of rainforest into plantations is associated with simplification in the trophic structure of Collembola communities. This was further confirmed by generally lower isotopic niche differentiation among species in plantations. Across the studied ecosystems, atmobiotic species (Symphypleona and Paronellidae) occupied the lowest, whereas euedaphic Collembola species occupied the highest trophic position, resembling patterns in temperate forests. Some species of Paronellidae in rainforest and jungle rubber had Delta N-15 values below those of leaf litter suggesting algivory (Salina sp.1, Callyntrura sp.1 and Lepidonella sp.1), while a dominant species, Pseudosinella sp.1, had the highest Delta N-15 values in most of the land-use systems suggesting that this species at least in part lives as predator or scavenger.

Recent studies have suggested that maximizing functional diversity (FD, the distribution of species with different functional traits in the niche space) may lead to agroecosystems with greater multifunctionality due to niche complementarity. Therefore, scientists are now advocating the use of a trait-based approach to develop multifunctional sustainable agroecosystems. In order to assess the effects of crop FD on key agroecosystem functions and to consider trade-offs and synergies among them, we established, in late 2016, permanent experimental field plots of successional agroforestry systems (SAFS), in humid subtropical Southern Brazil. The experiment represents a gradient of plant functional trait diversity (designed FD based on leaf nitrogen concentration), while maintaining crop species richness constant across all treatments. Our hypothesis is that the observed FD of crops (hereafter, crop FD) drives multiple agroecosystem functions. We determined the observed FD by quantifying traits of crops and weeds (maximum plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area) and performed two data collections (March and September 2017) at the end of the summer and winter crops respectively. We used structural equation modelling to test a hypothetical causal model to explain how crop FD affects three functions: weed suppression, soil protection (soil cover by either crops or weeds) and crop yield. Our results support the hypothesis that high crop FD drives agroecosystem processes and contributes to the provision of multiple ecosystem functions. We found that with greater crop FD in SAFS, crop plants occupied a large niche space, thereby increasing the total photosynthetic light intercepted in the agroecosystem, that in turn, increased crop yield. Additionally, greater FD increased soil protection by crops and decreased weed cover. This greater FD also reduced the FD of the weed community. Synthesis and applications. Crop mixtures based on complementary plant traits can increase the multifunctionality of agroecosystems through their sustainable use.

At the same time, in many or most tropical countries there is need for intensification of agricultural production to increase yields and incomes, and this usually requires higher external inputs that may cause additional greenhouse gas emissions. Here we investigate if production methods that have a beneficial effect on the climate (are climate-friendly) are compatible with increased inputs and yields for traditional, shaded cocoa (Theobroma cacao) production systems (locally known as cabrucas) in southern Bahia, Brazil. We use two easily measurable and manageable dimensions of climate friendliness, namely the carbon (C) stocks in the large trees and the C footprint as related to on-farm agrochemical and fuel use. Through interviews and field inventories in 26 cabruca farms representing a range of production practices and intensities, we identify the combinations of management practices, yields, C stocks and C footprints typically found in the region. We find that yield levels up to the highest encountered yield of 585 kg ha(-1), or twice the current regional average of 285 kg ha(-1), are compatible with an aboveground C stock in the large shade trees (> 30 cm diameter at breast height) of up to 65 Mg ha(-1) and up to 55 % shade. Higher C stocks and shade levels are generally associated with yields below the regional average. Input-related C emissions increased non-linearly with increasing yield, but even the highest encountered yields were compatible with low (< 0.25 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) of cocoa) to medium (< 0.5 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) of cocoa) input-related emission levels. Cocoa yields responded positively to increased fertilizer applications, provided that other factors, including shade levels, were not limiting. Consequently, the highest input-related emissions (> 1 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) of cocoa) were related to large fertilizer applications that did not proportionately increase yields. We conclude that doubling the cocoa output from southern Bahia, where cabrucas are the predominant form of growing cocoa, is compatible with climate-friendly production practices, measured by local standards. We suggest that the presented methodology can be used to identify opportunities for climate-friendly intensification of tree crops more generally, thereby increasing the contribution of commodity production to global climate change mitigation.",NA,10.1007/s11027-014-9570-7,NA,NA,NA,JOUR,1,67,80,NA,JAN,1381-2386 and 1573-1596,WOS:000366370700004,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,5607

Tree growth data, including age and diameter at breast height (DBH), were obtained from historical inventories and current field measurements, and a negative exponential growth model was applied to predict the optimal harvest age for the species. Concurrently, soil samples were collected from each site and analyzed for pH, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K, Na), cation exchange capacity, base saturation, and were summarized using a Tropical Soil Quality Index (TSQI). The results revealed a clear fertility gradient among the sites: Lambir exhibited the highest TSQI and nutrient levels, which corresponded with a lower predicted harvest age (75.4 years), while Gerenai, with lower soil fertility, had a higher predicted harvest age (85.0 years); Mujong-Melinau displayed intermediate values. Significant negative correlations were observed between TSQI, available phosphorus, and total organic carbon with the predicted harvest age, indicating that improved soil fertility accelerates tree growth.

Subsequent to the 1997 Kyoto protocol, there was a consensus among environmental and natural scientists that increasing green cover is the only realistic way to reduce carbon dioxide emission due to anthropogenic interferences. Reduction of emission through deforestation and degradation (REDD) emerged as a prime agenda to be adopted through Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). In 2007, the UNFCCC COP 13 held at Bali, Indonesia appreciated the conservation strategies of developing countries like India, China, Thailand, etc., and recommended adding Enhanced Carbon storage and came up with the concept of REDD+. In its unique conservation efforts to protect the forests, India strengthened its legal framework and has also undertaken several field conservation measures. It has shown an increase in the forest cover despite massive human and cattle population. It is imperative to measure the carbon stock (both biomass and soil carbon) in the forest in order to estimate the enhanced carbon stock. The enhanced carbon stock in the forest is helpful in compensating the emission reduction activities of India as envisaged in INDC (Intended Nationally Determined Contribution). Eastern Ghats of Tamil Nadu (Javadi hill) in India are taken in the present study and the status of the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) classification are taken up for analysis using sampling techniques and Geospatial technology. The LANDSAT data was analyzed to assess the NDVI and the soil samples were analyzed to estimate the SOC using CN analyzer. All the gridded point samplings were interpolated spatially by Kriging tools. The variations in the NDVI and SOC are spatially estimated for the whole area and the low SOC coupled with low green cover are identified, and precise forest degradation was estimated in the study.

This ecosystem must be protected through conservation so that its function can be maintained. Conservation of peatland ecosystems means that emissions of very large amounts of carbon can be minimized. Conservation of peat areas in several places is increasingly important because it tends to decrease peat lands. Peatland conservation in Indonesia is regulated in Presidential Decree No. 32 of 1990 concerning protected areas. Protection of peat areas is intended to control the hydrology of the area, which functions as a water store and prevents flooding, as well as protecting the unique ecosystems in the area concerned.Peatlands have hydrological, biogeochemical, biodiversity protection and forest product production functions. Peat is also useful for preventing drought, flooding and mixing saltwater for irrigation in agricultural areas. But the benefits are lost because the peatlands are burning. Therefore, peatlands must avoid fires through the empowerment-based ecosystem conservation.The community empowerment approach becomes a strategic choice because in its implementation process it has optimized community participation, trying to improve the community’s ability to analyse conditions and the potential and problems that occur around peatlands. The empowerment approach also can formulate priority program options that are relevant to program objectives including fire control and environmental preservation. Conservation of peat land ecosystems based on empowerment means carrying out a conservation process by involving the community for the purpose of aid effectiveness, increasing the potential of the community, and increasing community contributions towards a sense of ownership and a sense of responsibility towards the sustainability of the program. Fire disasters in some parts of Indonesia are still a serious threat, as well as peatland shrinkage. The current study seeks to find evidence and solutions through descriptive qualitative studies in the provinces of East Kalimantan, North Sumatra and Aceh.

To restore environmental functions, mining companies are required to carry out mine reclamation. Environmental management that needs to be carried out after reclamation activities are monitoring and evaluating the success of reclamation, especially flora and fauna diversity, such as vegetation, avifauna and mammals. The purposes of this study were: 1) to identify and measure the biodiversity of terrestrial flora, 2) to identify and measure the biodiversity of avifauna and mammal species, 3) to determine the conservation status of flora and fauna in the reclamation area, and 4) to compare the biodiversity of flora and fauna in the reclamation area and secondary natural forest. The studies were carried out in 3 reclamation areas (year of plantation: 2006, 2007 and 2008), and secondary forests nearby as comparison. Line plot sampling was used in the vegetation studies. Both direct observation and catching up with mist net were taken in the avifauna and mammal evaluation. In addition, footprint identification was used in mammal investigation. The results showed that the Shannon-Wiener index (H') of reclamation 2007 and 2008 (H' = 3.04) for sapling stage was higher than secondary forests (H' = 2.56). Generally, vegetation in the reclamation area was dominated by the family of Euphorbiaceae (9 species), Rubiaceae (6 species), and Leguminosae (5 species). Among of them, 8 species were included in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list and 1 species was included in Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendices II. Species of birds found in the reclamation area were about 59 species which were dominated by open area bird species and shrubs. The number of mammals found was 15 species, with six of them being protected species, 1 threatened species and 3 vulnerable species according to IUCN. Enrichment planting of long-life or local native species is necessary to be conducted in order to increase the diversity of flora and fauna. An increase in the variation of local plants species will correlate with the arrival of herbivorous fauna species and phytophagous insects. The arrival of the first-level consumer fauna will spur the presence of the next-level consumer fauna that are both carnivorous and omnivorous. The greater types of fauna that come can bring plant seeds from other sources and grow naturally in the reclamation area.

T e y involve positive and negative points of view. Criticisms mostly relate to alleged environmental aspects of soil and depletion of water resources, reduction of biodiversity and, in some cases, rural exodus and impoverishment of communities surrounding large eucalyptus plantations. Both sides have arguments that are being better understood by each other thanks to science, communication and practical examples. T i s article deals with decision-making processes of private social investment projects, having as theoretical basis Sustainable Development, Corporate Social Responsibility, Private Social Investment and Stakeholder Engagement. A case study was conducted on an industrial eucalyptus-reforestation company with industrial purposes, present in 21 cities in the state of Bahia, Brazil. From this, it was possible to evaluate the level of engagement that the company intends to have with the communities in its area of infuence and to engage them in their decision-making processes regarding private social investment projects. Indeed, the results do not show discrepancy between the perceptions of both sides. However, they point out improvements should be made in projects with communities.

In these pulpwood production farms, a major forestry restoration project is underway for Permanent Preservation Areas, which have peculiarities that may favor or hinder restoration. In this compilation, in order to search for alternatives for the restoration of these Permanent Preservation Areas, the planting of seedlings of native species in nuclei is implemented and evaluated as an alternative technique to traditional reforestation with total area plantation. Suitable techniques for forest restoration in mined areas are also explored, with the goal of attaining environmental sustainability for the bauxite mining in the region. Thus, by monitoring of mined and restored areas, 146 native species of the Atlantic Forest were found, 61 in the planting of seedlings, 97 in the inventories for evaluation of these plantings and 92 in natural regeneration. The authors set out to elucidate the underlying processes modeled by diversity and community composition with respect to aboveground biomass during succession in an Amazon forest in order to devise better passive restoration plans. 45 20m × 50m (1000 m2) plots were sampled across three sites in secondary forests, having different stand ages after shifting cultivation, and an old-growth forest located in the Northern Amazon forest, Venezuela. One study discusses how, due to the environmental heterogeneity conditions, active restoration measures are fundamental in degraded areas where natural regeneration is limited, mainly due to the absence of fragments in the landscape. Finally, it is emphasized that passive restoration is playing an important role in the ecosystem services recovery at local-scale. In the penultimate study, the authors compare the floristic composition and structure of the natural regeneration stratum of a 23-year-old restored forest with an adjacent dense ombrophilous forest. For this purpose, 60 plots with dimensions of 3×3 m (9m) were equally and systematically distributed in these two areas. All shrub-tree individuals with height =30 cm and circumference at breast height <15 cm in these plots were included and their heights and diameter at ground level were measured. Lastly, the dynamics of soil use and coverage in a region under the influence of mining activities are explored.

Our conceptual tool is designed to support policy makers to manage five selected soil functions and demands: productivity, water availability, nutrients, carbon sequestration, biodiversity. We applied it to Amazon's Agricultural frontier - the Upper Xingu River Basin, state of Mato Grosso, Brazil – one of the most rapidly changing regions in the basin. In this study we implemented an interdisciplinary, GIS-based, multi-model approach to understand how land use change due to agricultural expansion and intensification is affecting soil functions at the Amazon's Arc of Deforestation. Encompassing two large Brazilian Biomes, the tropical rain forest and the Cerrado (Brazilian Savannas), the study area of ~170.000km2 has undergone extensive changes in land use and land cover since the late 1970s. In only 40 years, the basin has already lost 30% of its natural vegetation, which was replaced mainly by pastures for cattle ranching. Since the early 2000s, a new cycle has started and currently the Upper Xingu River Basin is undergoing an increased agriculture intensification process (e.g., double cropping) to produce corn and soy bean for the international market. According to stakeholders, the main limiting factor for agriculture is infrastructure and absence of government. The lack of support affects markets and international trading with high costs for stocking and distribution of soy bean products. As proxies for soil indicator for supply we used a 2015 land use map derived from remote sensing data. Demand was expressed as annual productivity (kg/ha/y) from census data spatialized by land use type. Evapotranspiration was used as the proxy for water availability and water yield for demands. For a biodiversity indicator we used Indigenous Land and Conservation Units as suppliers and Legal Reserve and Permanent Protection Areas as demand (legal instruments). Nutrient Cycling supply was mapped based on a base saturation of 0-30 cm of almost 400 soil profiles and demand was mapped using average fertilizer application (NPK) spatialized by land use. Carbon storage and sequestration were derived from field measurements spatialized by land use and demands were generated using field carbon sequestration measurements and policy (Zero illegal deforestation target). Our results show that this approach can be applied to a range of landscapes and is a useful tool for decision making and policy implementation and support. © 2020 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In these pulpwood production farms, a major forestry restoration project is underway for Permanent Preservation Areas (PPAs), which have peculiarities that may favor or hinder restoration. A positive factor for the restoration is the proximity of forest remnants in certain PPAs, which favors the tree species' natural regeneration. On the other hand, in many other PPAs, the introduction of cattle and horses represents an impact factor as these animals generate damage and a high mortality of planted and regenerated seedlings. In order to search for alternatives for the restoration of these PPAs, the planting of seedlings of native species in nuclei was implemented and evaluated, an alternative technique to traditional reforestation with total area plantation. Native tree species with the potential to resist physical damage and herbivory by cattle and horses were identified, which were planted in seedling nuclei. Seedling nuclei fenced as an alternative, to avoid damages by cattle and horses was also adopted. The two techniques - using seedling nuclei of resistant species and fenced nuclei - were evaluated in field experiments. The fenced seedling nuclei reduced drastically the mortality or damages in the plants caused by trampling, breaking or herbivory. The use of resistant tree species and fenced seedling nuclei are effective nucleation techniques in areas where cattle and horses are introduced, are both very promising techniques to be adopted on a large-scale in the restoration of PPAs in Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil. © 2020 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

However, a threat to mangrove biodiversity due to mangrove wood cutting for firewood and house materials, and especially conversion into aquaculture ponds still occurs. The objective of this study is to assess the biodiversity of mangrove vegetation for the sustainability of ecotourism in West Sulawesi Indonesia. The mangroves of Bebanga village, West Sulawesi province represent an ecotourism area that has not been subject to studies about biodiversity for their sustainability. This ecotourism area provides tourist attractions such as mangrove tracking, mangrove learning and rehabilitation, fishing, bird watching, spots for pre-wedding and selfie photoshoot, culinary, and gazebo with an ocean view for relaxation of tourists. We implemented a line transect method for mangrove vegetation survey and used vegetation analysis equations to calculate mangrove density, frequency, coverage and Important Value Index (IVI). In addition, we have used the Shannon-Wiener index for assessing mangrove diversity. Seven species were found namely Avicennia marina, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Rhizophora mucronata, Rhizophora stylosa, Sonneratia alba, Sonneratia caseolaris, and Xylocarpus granatum. However, mangrove area was dominated by R. mucronata and most mangroves in sapling growth level. In addition, relative density, frequency and coverage of mangroves at all regeneration were below 56% and found at moderate diversity. These findings suggest the biodiversity of mangrove vegetation has decreased and it will become a potential threat for tourist attractions and tourism business.

Additionally, it generates many crop residues which are still underutilized in Brazil [2]. As an example, Brazil produces about 12 million tons of rice, 1.8 million tons of coconut, and 600 million tons of sugarcane per year, of which, about 21%, 57%, and 27%, respectively, become agricultural residues. Together with residual forest biomass, such as pruning, twigs, and sawdust, these types of biomass can be converted into biomass derived products, among them biochar, that can have several environmental applications. Biochar can be produced from plant-based raw materials through the slow pyrolysis process, and it has been argued that it can be used to improve soil fertility [3], benefit soil microorganisms [4], store CO2 [5] and act as an adsorbent for water filtration and air cleaning [6], among several other cascading uses [7]. The conversion of agricultural residues into biochar through pyrolysis process is a more efficient way of breaking down the organic components (e.g., lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose) of biomass when compared to biochemical decomposition. In this sense, pyrolysis can convert residual biomass into a product, the biochar, with a range of applications. Despite Brazil being a major producer of wood charcoal, there are only a few studies available on biochar production, characterization, and application. Thus, the data on the valorization of Brazilian agro-residues into biochar is still scarce. In this work, the conversion of three Brazilian crop residues into biochar, i.e., rice husk, coconut shell, and sugarcane bagasse, via slow pyrolysis is analyzed. Some preliminary data of biochar yield under distinct pyrolysis conditions are presented, together with an analysis of biochar characteristics in the cascading uses in environmental applications. © 2019 ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.",Agriculture residues and Biochar and Nutrient cycling and Slow pyrolysis and Agricultural wastes and Biodiversity and Cellulose and Charcoal and Crops and Greenhouse gases and Pyrolysis and Soils and Water pollution and Agriculture residues and Biochar and Crop residue and Environmental applications and Nutrients cycling and Pyrolysis process and Slow pyrolysis and Soil and water and Valorisation and Value chains and Biomass,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071062664&partnerID=40&md5=728fc681d84aa13fc320c24b9d612097,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,CONF,NA,1824,1831,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2312

2527,Scopus,Conference paper,"Wilms, T. and Van Der Goot, F. and Debrot, A.O.",2017,"Building with nature-an integrated approach for coastal zone solutions using natural, socio-economic and institutional processes",Australasian Coasts and Ports 2017 Conference,NA,NA,"This paper presents Building with Nature as a viable alternative to the traditional engineering approach, making the services that nature provides an integral part of the design of hydraulic infrastructure, thereby creating benefits for nature and society. In it we describe the necessary steps with which to implement a Building with Nature approach. Our case study in Demak, Central Java, Indonesia is used for examples to illustrate this approach and the lessons learnt on benefits and challenges. The location in Demak concerns a tropical muddy mangrove coast. During the last decades, in several areas the coastline has retreated hundreds of meters up to several kilometres, while in other parts of the project area the threat of erosion and flooding by the sea and decline of aquaculture productivity continue to worsen. In 2015, a pilot project to restore the natural coastal mangrove forest was started. The first step was to establish a good understanding of the complex natural and local socio-economic environments. Based on this system understanding, we then chose for non-traditional solutions using temporary permeable structures made from local material to create wave-sheltered areas that stimulate the settlement of sediment and create a habitat favourable to mangrove recolonisation. Once the mangrove forest is fully-grown it will provide protection against waves. It will also provide other ecosystem services like food provisioning, tourism, nursery habitat for fishery production and CO2-storage. A long-term sustainable solution requires the integration of these technical measures into the local socio-economic and governmental context. To support a smooth transition towards sustainable practices, local communities are simultaneously trained in sustainable methods to improve the productivity of their aquaculture ponds. This is done using ""coastal field schools"" as modelled from the ""farmer field school"" methodology developed by the FAO in 1989 for rural development. The approach is embedded in the village regulations. Sustainability in this rural area is created by closely linking safety and livelihood. The key lessons learnt from this project are that a combination of a thorough understanding of the biophysical, socio-economic and governmental system and early stakeholder involvement results in higher vital benefits, reduces costs and provides the setting for sustainable design solutions. It requires a learning and adaptive planning cycle from all participants as this approach exemplifies a ""learning by doing"" approach. © Australasian Coasts and Ports 2017 Conference.

One litterfall collector of 0.25 m2 was placed in the center of each of the 15 noncontiguous 100 m2 plots to sample litterfall monthly. Litter was sorted into leaves and non-foliar fractions, branches, reproductive organs and others; oven dried and weighed in precision scales. We calculated total annual litter production by fractions. Annual litterfall was high (8.4 Mg ha-1 yr-1) and similar to that of primary and secondary riparian forests in studies conducted elsewhere. Non-foliar fractions represented 35.7% of the litterfall and showed that not all planted species are reproducing yet. The results indicated that both avifauna and insects are contributing to functional diversity. The largest input of litterfall occurred in July and August, which are the driest months. Thus, litter production has been influenced by hydric seasonality, and also by edge effects, once the forest is narrow (< 50 m) and can be considered itself as an “edge”. Litterfall was a useful indicator, showing that forest was productive and the litter fall was contributing to the nutrient cycle. Non-foliar fractions indicated the recovery of ecological functions in the forest, suggesting that litterfall can be used as indicator of restoration of ecological services. © International Society for Tropical Ecology.",Ecological restoration and Litterfall non-foliar fractions and Riparian zone and Brazil and Hexapoda and avifauna and functional group and litterfall and nutrient cycling and restoration ecology and riparian forest and riparian zone and seasonality,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84949294113&partnerID=40&md5=9fe95f190d86c7845f0d64e994bab1d4,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 16,NA,JOUR,2,355,360,NA,MAY,0564-3295 and 2661-8982,WOS:000370210700020,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown, unknown","2620, 3528"

The objective of this work was to estimate genetic parameters and compare genetic gains by multi-effects index in a breeding population of E. grandis. Progeny tests were established using open-pollinated seeds from ten provenances ranging from 153 to 160 progenies established in a completely randomized block design in four sites of São Paulo State (Anhembi, Avaré, Itararé e Pratânia). At 24 months of age the traits diameter at breast height (DBH), height (ALT) and volume (VOL) were measured. The individual site analyses indicated significant genetic differences among progenies, height genetic variability and the mean progeny heritability (> 0.70). For joint analyses of sites, significant differences in genotype x environmental interaction effects were detected, showing differences of performance of the progenies in different sites. The Itararé site gave high genetic gains, effective size and genetic diversity.

It may influence ecosystem services delivery especially to areas under conservation agreements (such as those targeting reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation). This study compares the land-use decisions of men and women, and assesses the implications of their decisions on provisioning of ecosystem services in the context of the Minangkabau ethnic group in central Sumatra, Indonesia. This is the largest matrilineal society in the world and men and women farmers have their own management decisions with regards to their land. In this paper, we explored how men and women differ in terms of land-use perspectives and ecosystem services' preferences and how these differences affect the land-use pattern and delivery ecosystem services. Due to its complexities, we combined sex-disaggregated surveys and role-playing games to parameterize the gender-specific agent decision making; and simulated the agent-based model (i.e., Land Use DynAmic Simulator or LUDAS) to explore the effect of the disparities between men and women in land-use decision making. In this paper, we present the key factors that make the two different based on the abovementioned methods. The simulations showed gender specific trends of land-use change; a majority of men preferred tree-based system (such as rubber agroforestry), whereas a majority of women preferred food and cash-based crops. Thus, women-dominated landscapes emitted more carbon than men-dominated landscapes. On the other hand, provision of ecosystem services is affected by gender specific roles, which often been misrepresented in many land-use change models. © 2020 Proceedings - 21st International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2015.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the contribution of silting-up mitigation to funding the environmental recovery of riparian areas found in sugarcane farms. The city selected for study is Arealva, located in the Central-West region of São Paulo State, Southeast of Brazil. Spatial dynamic models were conceived to simulate past land cover/land use changes (2005-2010) and future landscape scenarios (2010-2020) in the study area. The main observed changes that took place from 2005 to 2010 were: sugarcane expansion (6,012.71ha (49.68%)), mostly extending over grazing lands, and deforestation (3,107.16ha (22.33%)), predominantly converted into pastures. Three sets of scenarios were defined: i) stationary scenarios, in which the transition rates observed in former years were held constant (business as usual); ii) nonstationary scenarios with a partial recovery of environmentally protected areas along riversides (70% by 2015), and; iii) non-stationary scenarios with a full recovery of environmentally protected areas along riversides (100% by 2015). The regarded impacts are dependent on the estimated amount of lost soil, assessed by means of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE). We also estimated the sediment accumulation rate in order to calculate siltation. The envisaged scenarios for environmental recovery can reduce environmental impacts up to 16% (US$41,479.29 to US$56,789.40) yearly. The riparian and alike vulnerable areas (prone to erosion and silting-up) can be recovered through a financing mechanism, relying either on water use charging or even on a taxation strategy implicitly considering the payment for ecosystem services. The silting mitigation would approximately contribute with US$13.83 to US$18.94 ha-1.year-1. In this way, sugarcane farms would have a financial incentive to restore and maintain the environmentally protected areas within their domain, reducing the environmental impacts related to silting-up processes. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

They may be impacted by oil and gas activities, either directly or indirectly. Restoring them is therefore of prime importance. In the Mahakam Delta (East Kalimantan, Indonesia), oil and gas exploration and production have been conducted for more than 40 years. This industry has operated in a quasi-pristine area barely affected by human activities until the mid 80's. Toward the late 1980's and until 2000, the delta was subject to massive and rapid development of shrimp farming and by 2001, 85% of the delta mangroves were destroyed and most of it replaced by ponds used for aquaculture. By the end of 1990's, shrimp farm productivity in the delta decreased due to a lack of nutrients in ponds and the occurrence of shrimp diseases. Numerous ponds were abandoned in the delta. This economic situation generated social instabilities that could threaten the oil and gas industry in the region. Therefore, in order to better protect mangroves and optimize restoration of damaged areas, Total E&P Indonesie embarked on a mangrove restoration initiative of the Mahakam Delta aimed at understanding and contributing to the restoration processes through both natural recolonization and planting techniques. The general methodology implemented has been to i) describe the land cover using satellite imagery, interpreting aerial photos, conducting field work, and establishing GIS maps, ii) inventory the fauna and flora (including mangroves, birds, mammals, reptiles), iii) monitoring the naturally re-colonized areas, replanted areas and original forest in selected areas. Results show that natural recolonization of a mangrove area can be very quick under certain conditions (subject to availability of seeds and easy access of seeds to the area to be recolonized). But in areas where seeds cannot easily move, or where seed supply is scarce, replanting remains the best option. Social aspects have also to be taken into account given that replanting can promote the local commitment to sustainable environmental conservation.

The cover mapping was carried out by means of Landsat 5 satellite images from a TM sensor. Processes of segmentation were used for the generation of vectors with homogeneous characteristics and classification was made through visual interpretation. Two classes of successional stage of secondary vegetation: initial and intermediate/advanced were considered, as well as a reforestation class. The quantification of carbon stocks was made by the indirect method, applying reference values from the literature. There was an increase around 22.93% of forest cover in the basin throughout the period of 10 years.

2977,Scopus,Article,"Rennaud, J.-P. and Ruitenbeek, J. and Tennigkeit, T.",2012,"Challenges of community-forestry based carbon projects: Process, participation, performance",Field Actions Science Report,7,NA,"This paper addresses the challenges in community-based management of carbon projects in developing countries. It is based on four years of experience in identifying, developing, implementing, and monitoring mangrove restoration and agroforestry projects in upland and coastal areas of India, Indonesia, and Senegal. While many of the challenges are common to any typical grass-roots development project, we focus on aspects that are more directly related to carbon sequestration activities. To address all of these challenges, the paper proposes some measures that we believe help make implementation and monitoring easier for practitioners in this realm. Our thematic focus of ""process"", ""participation"" and ""performance"" underscores three key areas we believe merit greater attention in these projects. The process elements are important because of specialized knowledge that is often not familiar to communities such as the process of identifying suitable planting sites and arrangements, and suitable implementation arrangements given stakeholder needs requires significant upfront commitment from all involved. The challenges related to process are highlighted through reference to methodology selection, and the implications it has for site selection through to implementation. The second theme - participation - addresses the peculiar stakeholder interests, interactions and arrangements that arise at all stages of the project. A challenge is meeting all stakeholder expectations and constraints through recognizing that people have different motivations and interests; as examples, active engagement is necessary to find acceptable terms for implementation, revenue sharing, and risk sharing. Again, peculiarities of the carbon market - such as carbon property rights - often create uncertainty that must be handled delicately in such circumstances. The final theme - performance - relates to an ongoing need to accommodate a complex array of monitoring, auditing, validation and quality control requirements over a range of multiple objectives. The challenge in this realm is to implement high-scale projects that are economically viable, but which will stretch the capacity of local community-based systems considering compliance requirements with regards to implementation and carbon accounting standards. Hence the interests and requirements of different stakeholders may not be fully aligned. As an example, many carbon projects now have multiple objectives - carbon, biodiversity, and community welfare - but there are few received protocols for addressing these concurrently. An important insight through all of these dimensions is that no single concept of ""community"" can be universally applied: the connections among stakeholders and others are never as clear as one assumes them to be. © Author(s) 2012.",Agroforestry and Carbon methodology and High scale implementation and Mangrove and Monitoring,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84880583365&partnerID=40&md5=3cc4be974005ede188563e332b3a1894,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 2,NA,JOUR,SPL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,2977
2995,Scopus,Book chapter,"De Andrade-Neto, V.F. and Meurer, Y.S.R.",2013,Toxoplasma gondii: The role of chickens in the transmission of toxoplasmosis to humans,"Toxoplasma Gondii: Prevalence in Humans and Animals, Genetic Structure and Role in Disease Distribution",NA,NA,"Toxoplasmosis is an anthropozoonosis caused by the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), an obligate intracellular parasite belonging to the phylum Apicomplexa, Sporozoea Class, Coccidia Sub-class, Eucoccidiida Order, Eimeriina Sub-order, Sarcocystidae Family and Toxoplasmatinae Sub-Family (Levine et al., 1988). It is a protozoan capable of infecting nucleated cells from a wide variety of mammals and birds as well as primary cell cultures of fish and insects (Mineo; Kasper, 1994). It presents a cosmopolitan geographic distribution, with high rates of infection in humans. It is estimated that one third of the world population has already been exposed to the T. gondii (Montoya, Liesenfeld, 2004). The first description of the species was carried out by Alfonso Splendore (1909 apud Cox, 2002) in Brazil in 1908, who reported the presence of the protozoan parasitizing laboratory rabbits. In that same year, the French parasitologists Charles Nicolle and Louis Hebert Manceaux (1908 apud Cox, 2002) isolated it in an African rodent (Ctenodactylus gondii), at the Pasteur Institute of Tunisia. Originally denominated Leishmania gondii, by its similarity with the protozoan of the genus Leishmania, the adequacy of its nomenclature only occurred in the following year. The life cycle of the T. gondii was only elucidated more than 50 years after the first report of its discovery (Evans, 1992). In the late 1960s, the analysis of cat fecal material made it possible to discover an evolutive type of protozoan, which was capable of inducing infection in other mammals and birds by its ingestion. Its coccidial cycle was elucidated in the 1970s, when the sexual stages of T. gondii were found in small intestine of cats (Frenkel et al. 1970; Dubey; Beattie, 1988). Although the protozoan T. gondii is considered the only valid species in its genus, three clonal genetic lineages were initially recognized. These are known as Type I, Type II and Type III, and they are predominant in Western Europe and the United States (Howe, Sibley, 1995; Howe et al., 1997). However, surveys on samples of this parasite from other regions of the world, such as South American localities, have revealed other genotypes, differing from the archetypes mentioned above (Soares et al., 2011; Clementino Andrade et al., 2013). When several markers were applied against Brazilian strains, a highly reticulated phylogenetic structure was identified, which suggests that recombination plays an important role in strain diversification in South America (Pena et al., 2008). Currently, it is known that its life cycle is divided between feline and non-feline infections, which are correlated with sexual and asexual replication, respectively (Black; Boothroyd, 2000). Definitive hosts are members of the family Felidae, for example domestic cats (Jackson; Hutchison, 1989; Dubey, 1986; 1993; Frenkel, 2000). Asexual stages of toxoplasma-like parasites were first observed at the turn of the century in tissues of non-felines, for example birds and mammals (Dubey; Beattie, 1988). They are probably all warm-blooded animals including most livestock, and humans. In intermediate hosts, T. gondii undergoes two phases of asexual development. In the first phase, tachyzoites (or endozoites) multiply rapidly by repeated endodyogeny in many different types of host cells. Tachyzoites of the last generation initiate the second phase of development which results in the formation of tissue cysts. Within the tissue cyst, bradyzoites (or cystozoites) multiply slowly by endodyogeny. Tissue cysts have a high affinity for neural and muscular tissues (Ferguson, Hutchison; 1987). They are located predominantly in the central nervous system (CNS), the eye as well as skeletal and cardiac muscles. Unsporulated oocysts are released into the intestinal lumen and passed into the environment with the faeces. Sporogony occurs outside the host and leads to the development of infectious oocysts which contain two sporocysts, each containing four sporozoites (Dubey; Beattie, 1988; Frenkel, 2000). Several studies have been carried out on the asexual stages of T. gondii, in particular on the tachyzoite, while much fewer studies have considered the sexual stages or their infectious product, i.e. the sporozoites within the oocyst. It is noteworthy that cats and wild felids are essential to the persistence of T. gondii in hosts such as grazing animals (e.g. sheep, deer and, more recently, chickens) because they serve as the sole source of the infectious oocysts that contaminate the environment. Environmental contamination by T. gondii oocysts is a concern from both public health and biodiversity perspectives. Surface run-off containing feline feces containing T. gondii oocysts enters in multiple ecosystems (Dubey, 1986; Jackson, Hutchison; 1989). Currently ingesting undercooked meat also provides an important avenue for T. gondii infection through the ingestion of viable tissue cysts (Dubey et al, 1998a). Undercooked pork is another common risk factor for T. gondii exposure; beef is not believed to be a major player, however, mammals and avians raw meat was found to be a risk factor in several epidemiological studies in developed and underdeveloped countries (Fayer et al., 2004). Even as other important risk factors in evidence are for infection include not washing kitchen knives after they have been used to cut raw meat, fruits, and vegetables, as well as infrequent hand washing (Jones et al, 2009). In general, the infection by the T. gondii has a higher prevalence in tropical or subtropical most climate zones, which favors the viability of oocysts in the environment (Tenter et al., 2000). The prevalence of reagents for anti-T. gondii antibodies increases with age and it varies depending on the cultural patterns of the population, its hygiene, food and urban and rural provenance (Amendoeira, 2003; Santos et al., 2012). The prevalence of the disease in children is relatively low, increasing with age and the time of exposure to risk factors throughout life (Kompalic-Cristo et al., 2005). In Brazil, the official statistics from the Ministry of Health indicate toxoplasmosis as responsible for 90 deaths annually. However, there is a lack of data on morbidity and mortality caused by this parasite, so this data is formed by sub-estimated numbers. Toxoplasma Gondii strain involved in the infection and host's immune status, the disease may cause severe illness in human beings and several other classes of animals (Dubey, Bettie, 1988; Cavalcante et al, 2006b). Over the last decades, toxoplasmosis has stimulated the interest of many researchers, mainly by public health relevance and by pervasive affected systems in the hosts, either as an opportunistic disease in immunocompromised patients and pregnant women, or as adaptative disease in immunocompetent animals where reproductive and neural systems is most affected (Tenter et al., 2000). Millions of people worldwide have a serological prevalence of between 15% and 85% in different regions of the planet (Kompalic-Cristo et al.; 2005). In the United States, the prevalence of seropositivity ranges from 10% to 30%, approximately 14% in the reproductive age. In Norway, for example, the positivity in serologic tests is only 10.9%. On the other hand, the prevalence is 28% in Denmark and it reaches 36.7% in Austria. In Malaysia, a recent study found a rate of prevalence of 49%, reaching rates of up to 70% in France, especially in Paris (Porto et al.; 2008). In Brazil, it is estimated that 70% of the population will manifest clinical signs of toxoplasmosis at some point in life. Surveys conducted in pregnant women have shown high seropositivity rates, ranging from 40% to 80% (Porto et al.; 2008). The frequency of seropositive pregnant women for IgG anti-Toxoplasma varies widely among regions, from 28.1% to 70.9% in the South, 70.7% to 98.8% in the Midwest, 50.1% to 90.0% in the Southeast and 66.4% to 72.7% in the Northern Region of the country. In the Northeast, information about the frequency of infections in pregnant women, capable of perinatal transmission, is scarce; in the Sergipe State there was a prevalence rate of 69% in a study performed with 9.550 pregnant women, in Salvador city (BA) the rate was of 69.3%, 71.5% in Ceará, 74.7% in Recife (PE), in João Pessoa (PB) it was observed a rate of 91% of prevalence in a study performed with 55 pregnant women, 86.2% in Alagoas, 66.38% in São Luis (MA) and in Natal (RN) Barbosa et al (2009) observed a rate of prevalence of 66% in a study comprising 190 pregnant women. In the North of Country, in Belém (PA), a rate of 73% was obtained in a study conducted with 531 pregnant women, a rate of 76.2% in Amapá and reaching levels above 70% in Amazonas city. In the Southeast, in the capital city of the state of São Paulo the prevalence rate of 67.7% was observed in a study comprising 481 pregnant women and, in Rio de Janeiro, 77.1%; 73.5% in Espírito Santo and 51.6% in Uberlândia (MG). In the South region, in the capital city of Rio Grande do Sul, a prevalence rate of 61.1% (Reis et al., 2006) was obtained by evaluating 10.468 pregnant women and the rate of 49.2% in Paraná. In the central region of the country, in Goiania, the prevalence rate has remained stable over the past 23 years.

Also, a previous evaluation of the areas to be planted is essential to a successful establishment of forests with native or exotic species. The aim of this review is to explore the current information on the total aboveground biomass, nutrient content and the benefit of symbiosis in some native woody species and exotic Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil.The methodology for native and exotic plant species used for agroforestry is illustrated. The Eucalyptus species presentedanaboveground wood biomass (AWB) of 26.9 to 44.4 Mg ha-1, and the aboveground wood volume varied for 42.8 to 75.9 m3ha-1. The biomass of the stem wood, leaves, branches, and stem bark accounted for 64-66%, 16-19%, 15-17%, and 0.2-0.6% of the total biomass, respectively. The wood localized in superior parts of the trunk presented a higher concentration of P and bark containing significant amounts of nutrients. On the other hand, the native species evaluated, presented a higher total aboveground biomass when inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and Rhizobium bacteria. Leguminous trees showed greater height and diameter growth, as well as, higher dry matter and nutrient concentration when inoculated. The AWB varied for 0.48 to 0.76 Mg ha-1 for Anadenanthera peregrina.The agroforestry trees exhibited mycorrhizal mycotrophy. The potential of agroforestry as a carbon sequestration strategy (carbon storage potential in its multiple plant species and soil) as well as its applicability in agricultural lands and in reforestation must be more exploited. Research directions that are needed to increase understanding of mycorrhizal associations in tropical cropping systems and to increase mycorrhizal benefit are indicated. The benefits and problems encountered are discussed in this chapter, in order to highlight the need for a continual study of the forestry species. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Payments for environmental services (PES) have been proposed as compensation mechanisms to revert potential negative impacts of land uses and management practices. The practical application of PES must be based on an adequate understanding and evaluation of the services provided by each land use system and corresponding management strategies. The concept of functional biodiversity of land uses, including agroforestry, emphasizes system dynamics and its implications on overall system functioning and long-term sustainability. In this study, functional biodiversity was used as an environmental services surrogate. A user-adaptable protocol was developed for its assessment based on multicriteria and multivariate analysis, as well as on stakeholder participation. The protocol combines ecological, productive, and operational proxies to describe functional biodiversity. Without neglecting the farmers' productive priorities, this protocol seeks to identify management decisions and interventions that optimize the maintenance and encouragement of functional biodiversity. The protocol was tested in a case-study: the Tomé-AÇú agroforestry systems in the Brazilian Amazon. Three groups of farmers were differentiated, based on the time of settlement, property size, technological know-how, level of organization, and market access. The study revealed that the factors exerting most influence on functional biodiversity were farmers' technical background, their capacity to adapt, their decision-making regarding environmentally friendly options, and the pursuit of financial profitability. However, these decisions might sometimes imply a detrimental trade-off, such as decreases in biodiversity indices, and the generation of byproducts. The proposed protocol may provide a platform to support the assessment of environmental services, and eventually it can be used to optimize complex decisions on part of the farmers; nevertheless, further testing seems necessary before a broader application. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

3034,Scopus,Book chapter,NA,2010,"Statement of David J. Hayes, senior fellow, world wildlife fund, before the senate committee on foreign relations, subcommittee on international development and foreign assistance, economic affairs and international environmental protection*",Deforestation and Climate Change,NA,NA,"WWF is encouraged by the promising first steps that the internationalcommunity is taking to address global deforestation and degradation as part ofthe United Nations' framework convention on climate change, as evidenced inthe recent Conference of the Parties in Bali, Indonesia, and in discussionsleading towards Copenhagen, when a new treaty is expected to be completed.WWF also is encouraged that S. 2191, America's Climate Security Act,introduced by Senators Lieberman and Warner, which would establish a U.S.-based program to constrain greenhouse gas emissions, also includes aninternational forestry title which recognizes that the U.S. must play an activerole in ""reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation"" or ""REDD,""working in tandem with affected nations and the entire internationalcommunity.The attention on deforestation is both appropriate and necessary, given thefact that the on-going loss of forestry resources accounts for approximately20% of all greenhouse gas emissions, world-wide. Simply put, we cannotmake progress in battling climate change unless we reduce the alarming rate ofdeforestation that is occurring on an on-going basis in a number of developingnations.Unlike conventional sources of greenhouse emissions, however,deforestation and forest degradation present multi-faceted challenges that areparticularly difficult to tackle. Sustainable progress will only be made byaddressing the complex root causes of deforestation and forest degradation.This will require the cooperation of the governments who are losing theirforestry resources; the cooperation of the U.S. and other developed nationswhose trade practices are influencing how forestry resources are being used(and/or abused); and, importantly, the active participation of indigenouspeople and others who are most impacted by land use choices made in theirhome lands.WWF believes that international climate change discussions and U.S.legislation should focus, first, on promoting economic models that address theroot causes of deforestation and degradation and which involve thecoordinated effort of the international community. Economic initiatives thatencourage trade in sustainable forestry resources and products, and whichpenalize forest degradation and the loss of valuable forest resources, forexample, must be actively promoted. The development of international carbonmarkets that will recognize and reward the financial value of maintainingtropical forests and reducing rates of deforestation also should be the subjectof active consideration. To lay the groundwork for developing such a market, asignificant investment must be made in building local capacity to measure andmonitor the carbon stocks in developing countries' forestry resources.In this regard, WWF supports the Lieberman-Warner bill's establishmentof an Emission Allowance Account ""for use in carrying out forest carbonactivities in countries other than the United States."" Such an allocation wouldgenerate funding needed to help local citizens and institutions develop andproliferate the technologies and methodologies that will reliably measure andtrack the carbon content of forests and forest products, and to undertake thetraining needed to generate and validate the data used for this purpose. Asdiscussed further below, these are essential prerequisites of any effort toestablish a credible and viable carbon market in those countries.As a corollary, WWF also supports the Lieberman-Warner bill's generalexpression of interest in developing and promoting a carbon market that couldgenerate financial support for protecting forests. WWF believes that the U.S.should proceed deliberately in this area, however, in close cooperation withthe international community. A carbon market that effectively generatesfinancial incentives to reduce tropical deforestation should not be presumed tooperate in the same way as today's voluntary market for carbon offsets fromforests, or the Kyoto Protocol's project-based Clean Development Mechanism.A different approach will be needed if credit is to be given to avoidingdeforestation and to the on-going conservation of forestry resources.A deliberate approach also is needed due to the significant concerns thathave been raised about the environmental integrity of some offset projects thathave been developed under existing frameworks. Similar concerns will applyto forest-based credits. Indeed, forestry credits are likely to generate specialscrutiny, given the large number of credits that potentially could be generatedfrom avoided deforestation projects and the special challenges of quantifyingand verifying emissions reductions from improved forestry practices,particularly with regard to ""leakage,"" ""permanence"" and ""additionality,"" asdiscussed below. In addition, a carbon market that credits forestry-based""offsets"" must not enable industrialized nations to avoid investments in theirown emissions reductions.Despite these challenges, WWF is optimistic that the U.S., working withthe international community, can identify and implement a comprehensiveprogram that tackles the root causes of deforestation. This effort can and mustinclude the development of financial mechanisms that will sustainably protectforestry resources and complement commitments by developed countries toreduce their greenhouse gas emissions. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Among the soil microbiota, plant symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) associating with terrestrial and also with some aquatic plants have become the target of productive studies in agriculture, agroforestry, restoration of degraded lands and with endangered vegetal species. AMF are affected by disturbances in the ecosystems, like global change, pollution, fertilization, among others. AM fungi belong to Glomeromycota phylum, and form symbiotic associations with most plant species (80%). The presence and activity of AMF can be measured through different methodologies, both in the soil or in plants, indicating their biomass, activity, diversity and their interaction with plants. The need for an increased use of the AMF potential to counter the challenges of ecosystem restoration and food production is nowadays acknowledged. The purpose of this chapter is to provide evidence for researchers and decision-makers of the significant links between healthy ecosystems and human well-being, based on different case studies throughout the world. Relevant findings are emphasized, such as current information on the occurrence of symbioses in ecosystems, based on the results of research on cultivated and forested sites in Argentina and Brazil. AMF diversity is illustrated, and research directions necessary to gain further understanding of microbial associations for the wise management of ecosystem services are pointed out. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

However limited germplasm and narrow genetic base were major impediments in its wider adaptations. Of late, introduction of several new improved germplasm including newly identified species, cultivars and bred materials from Australia, Colombia, Brazil and Ethiopia and their evaluation at selected centers under different agro-climatic conditions improved the existing scenario as many lines including S. scabra RRR as well as newly introduced species S. seabrana has shown great promise for diverse agro-climatic zones. Because of concerted efforts which was largely generated from the recently concluded Austrialian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) stylo project and background study during the period of early eighties Stylosanthes has been considered as the most important tropical legume which not only improve the soil fertility but also provide nutritive forage. Two species namely S. hamata and S. scabra largely contribute to the supply of forages for cattle, buffalo, goats and sheep. As a nitrogen fixing legume, the plant helps replenish soil nutrients when used in ley farming, mixed and inter-cropping systems. The scenario has largely changed due to the better performance of newly introduced S. seabrana species which possessed high seedling vigour, high nutritional parameters and better adaptation under rainfed situations in heavy clay and cracking soil types. It provides good foliage and being erect and low sticky in nature showed compatibility for mixed cropping. Results also demonstrated reasonable yield in first year by all four major species which ultimately geared up in second year of growth. This was stable in S. hamata and S. viscosa for another two years whereas other two species namely S. scabra and S. seabrana indicated enhanced yield in consecutive years. © Triveni Enterprises.",Agro-climatic condition and Diversity and DNA markers and Forage and Rain-fed environment and Stylosanthes species and Africa and Australasia and Australia and Brazil and Colombia and East Africa and Ethiopia and South America and Sub-Saharan Africa and Bos and Capra hircus and Ovis aries and Stylosanthes and Stylosanthes guianensis and Stylosanthes hamata and Stylosanthes scabra and Stylosanthes seabrana and Stylosanthes viscosa and climate conditions and cultivar and forage and genetic marker and germplasm and habitat quality and legume and rainfed agriculture and species diversity and adaptation and Australia and biodiversity and Brazil and buffalo and cattle and clay and climate and Colombia and cropping system and cultivar and Ethiopia and farming system and forage and goat and harvest and India and legume and nitrogen fixation and nonhuman and nutrient and review and sheep and soil fertility and species habitat and Stylosanthes and Stylosanthes gamata and Stylosanthes scabra,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67749145415&partnerID=40&md5=868addf007a92dd830b763f807665172,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 24,NA,JOUR,4,471,478,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,3227

Models were built with Ba'aka people in the Congo Basin, Punans and other Dayak groups in East Kalimantan, Indonesia and rural communities in Ghana. Recently, the program began developing landscape partnerships and modeling initiatives with Papuans in the West Papua province of Indonesia. The models facilitated discussion and negotiation between Indigenous peoples and representatives of conservationist groups, resource extraction companies and government officials and allowed exploration of different scenarios for both conservation and development interventions. The models failed to produce empirical evidence to support claims made by conservation organisations of the positive livelihood impacts of their conservation programmes. In all cases the material benefits to local Indigenous people of activities such as mineral extraction, logging, agro-industrial developments etc. greatly exceed the often hypothetical benefits postulated from the small-scale local development activities of conservation organisations. The modelling exercises also provoked debates and awareness of the broader dimensions of livelihoods as perceived by Indigenous peoples. Health care, education, infrastructure and employment consistently emerged as the highest priorities for Indigenous communities in all the study sites. Including Indigenous people in the process of participatory modelling, alongside other stakeholders such as government officials, conservation NGOs, and scientists is important in confronting the challenge of making trade-offs between human well-being and nature. Biodiversity conservation will only succeed in the long term if it is based upon approaches that fully recognize and address the inevitable trade-offs between the development needs of local people and the maintenance of areas of intact nature. Forest conservation programmes still do not give enough attention to the legitimate needs of people living within and dependent on the forests. It is all too easy to lay blame on developers, corrupt government officials, and other parties for forest destruction.

It focuses on the different actors, organisations and projects concerned with extractive reserves in Rondonia in western Amazonia, Brazil. Extractive reserves are supported by a wide range of different actors and agencies, within a rapidly evolving institutional context. Extractive reserves are widely seen as a means of integrating forest conservation and local socio-economic development. As such, they have gained the support to the international environmental movement, multilateral and state development organisations, and grassroots community and producer organisations. These institutions represent a vast array of diverse interest which range from conservation of biodiversity, economic and social cohesion, and regional and national development. Extractive reserves are promoted as a means to achieve each of these objectives. However these ends are not necessarily complementary or compatible, and the integration of conservation and development is by no means easy to achieve. Whilst the various actors and institutions claim mutual and complementary interest, they form shifting alliances and coalitions in order to further their interests. This paper maps these institutions and interests and describes how alliances have been formed and broken, and how this has contributed to the currently observed implementation of extractive reserves. It analyses how the evolving institutions have been able to forward sustainable development in Amazonia and who benefits from alliances and coalitions. The paper argues that extractive reserves are constrained by the dissonance or misfit in discourses and underlying worldviews, reflected by the aims and objectives of the institutions which promote, oppose and lose or benefit from their implementation. This misfit is overcome, in part, by alliances formed between the different institutions, and in part by the creation of new institutions and projects.","Brazil, Rondonia State and Rondonia and environmental management and extraction and institutional framework and political discourse and resource development and sustainable development",NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031772917&partnerID=40&md5=70654cc8a89a6e2886f7478e11136c8a,Export Date: 25 April 2025; Cited By: 0,NA,JOUR,GEC 98-15,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,3447

Effects of short rotation natural fallow on diversity of plant species and population of soil microbes in Aponmu, Ondo State, Nigeria. Bush fallowing is a common farming system in the humid zone of West and Central Africa. However, population pressures have resulted in shortened fallow periods with consequent effects on soil nutrients and biodiversity. To assess the effect of the shortened fallow period on plant species diversity, data were collected in a primary forest (forest reserve) and an adjoining 5-year-old bush fallow in Aponmu, Ondo State, Nigeria. Four plots of 25 x 25 m each were sampled from the forest reserve and one each from four abandoned fallow lands around the forest reserve. All trees with diameter at breast height greater than or equal to 5 cm were identified. A total of 0.25 ha of bush fallow and 0.25 ha of primary forest were surveyed.

Soils play a major role in the global carbon (C) cycle and CO2 dynamics; thus, management of soil carbon appears essential and more and more inevitable. The capacity of natural and managed agroecosystems to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in a manner that is not immediately re-emitted into the atmosphere is known as carbon sequestration: carbon dioxide is absorbed by vegetation through photosynthesis and stored as carbon in biomass and soils, and released through autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration. Forests, croplands and grasslands can store large amounts of carbon in soils for relatively long periods. Soils are the larger terrestrial pool of organic carbon. Moreover, soil carbon sequestration is beneficial for soil quality, both over the short term and long term, and can be achieved through land management practices adapted to the specific site characteristics. The ability of soils to sequester carbon depends on climate, soil type, vegetation cover and land management practices. According to the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the total technical greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation potential of agriculture (considering all gases and sources) is estimated to be in the range 4.5-6 Gt CO2-equivalent year-1 by 2030. Estimates indicate that many of these options are of relatively low cost and generate significant co-benefits in the form of improved agricultural production systems, resilience and other ecosystem services. Moreover, many of the technical options are readily available and could be deployed immediately. About 90% of this potential can be achieved by soil C sequestration through cropland management, grazing land management, restoration of organic soils and degraded lands, and water management in rainfed and irrigated croplands. In most cases, such management practices include the management of organic residues produced on site or coming from outside the field or the farm. It has been estimated that the global world production of residues in the agriculture sector is about 3.8 Pg C and, to date, the use of this resource has not been optimized; a large part is still being burned. Over the past two decades, other practices have been tested and are still controversial, such as biochar or chipped ramial wood application in cultivated fields. Biochar is a stabile carbon amendment, produced from pyrolysis of biomass, which may increase biomass productivity as well as sequester C from the source biomass. The scientific validation of these practices is still incomplete. Full participation of the agricultural sector in GHG mitigation still faces some challenges and barriers related to measurement, monitoring and reporting requirements in C offset markets. Further improvements are needed in methodologies and approaches that would help project designers and policy makers to integrate significant mitigation effects in agriculture development projects.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,CPAPER,NA,119,131,NA,NA,978-1-78064-532-2,WOS:000355310900009,NA,"Banwart, SA and Noellemeyer, E and Milne, E",Benefits of Soil Carbon Workshop,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,4953

5151,NA,NA,"Haigh, MJ",2000,Headwater control:: Despatches from the research front,ENVIRONMENTAL RECONSTRUCTION IN HEADWATER AREAS,68,NA,"Headwater Control is about integrated land management. Effective headwater management requires better information, better technologies, better management structures, change in land husbandry and direct engineering interventions. Headwater regions often waste their resources. In Jammu and Kashmir, 40% (and in South Africa and Iranian Azerbaijan 60%) of the water resource runs to waste. Azerbaijan's planners believe that 25% could be collected for agriculture. In Xinjiang, China, by contrast, over-utilisation of the headwater resources in the Tarim Basin has caused desertification and large-scale farmland abandonment downstream Better systems of water resource accounting are required. Eventually, the Lesotho Highlands Water Project may generate 25% of that nation's foreign exchange earnings. Acidification is linked to the human impact in headwaters. Previously, pH was controlled by climatic, lithologic, edaphic and biologic factors. New Japanese work stresses the role of the weathered layer beneath the soils of tropical steeplands in moderating the hydrologic impacts of forestation and acid precipitation Elsewhere, pollution plays a critical role, especially the deposition of air pollutants. Time trends of NO3- and SO42- deposition may be dwarfed by natural geographical variations within a smalt basin. However, the chief agencies are decreasingly SO42-, increasingly NO3- and more generally agricultural chemicals and other human wastes. Riverine microbial biofilms act as both sinks and sources for pollutants. In Canada, effective prevention of non-point-source pollution required a compromise between the net welfare of farmers, the wider non-farm community and the environment. Better systems of water quality management are required. The riparian zone is often counted critical. Fragmentation of both the riparian zone and its management rank among the most serious challenges for land managers. However, while restoring riparian vegetation reduces sediment loads and increases the biodiversity of affected rivers, it may not mitigate acidification. Mathematical models for predicting runoff from alpine catchments are evaluated. USDAHL with GIS, HEC-1 and RUNOFF-5 are generally satisfactory and HYRROM is useful for engineering. Empirical studies show that forests moderate hydrological and erosional processes. In Serbia, 15-years study in steep headwater basins finds that forest covers > 70%, rather than < 49%, yield smaller flood peaks and provide a more sustained flow (dry for 13.4 days/year-1 vs. 121.4 or more). In Japan's mountain headwaters, reforestation reduces water losses. Here, increased evapotranspiration is compensated by decreased deep seepage. In Alaska, tree roots prove as important as pore water pressure in regulating landsliding on steep dopes with shallow soils. Soil erosion remains a major problem. In Brazil, regional estimates of soil loss were a seventh of those due to rill and gully erosion in fields under conventional tillage. In Lithuania, soil depth declines ranging from 0.12 - 0.94 m and soil fertility declines ranging from 22% to 63% are reported. In the Himalaya soil nutrient deficiencies are widespread and agricultural inputs are inadequate to the maintenance of fertility levels. Overgrazing, forest conversion, the harvesting of wild medicinal herbs, road construction and mining cause soil degradation and permit ecological invasion by alien weed species. The situation of the headwater farmer, struggling with land degradation, contrasts with that of the padi farmer downstream, whose fields are enriched with soils and nutrients lost from the uplands. Elsewhere, sediment and agrochemical pollution causes problems downstream In Canada, conservation tillage proves best pollution control practice for both the farmers and non-farm community. In Brazil, rill and gully erosion was eliminated by the adoption of no-till agriculture. In Lithuania, returning steeper slopes to pasture reduced soil losses to zero. Cover management reduced soil losses in Algeria Small grain cultivation reduced soil losses to a half or a third of bare fallow. In Japan, stone mulches prove effective against erosion. In Yunnan, China, contour cultivation with straw mulching is more effective against erosion than contour cultivation and, in descending order, inter-cropping, no-till, polythene mulching or conventional agriculture. Soil losses are widely linked to individual aggressive rainfall events. In Nepal the two most severe storms each year commonly account for >80% of total soil loss. In the Himalaya and Sierra Nevada, overgrazing, and in Brazil, India, and China, agricultural extension, are other major causes. In Serbia, headwater depopulation reduced soil losses, Headwater Control requires improved land husbandry. The empowerment of local communities is the best route. UNCED's Chapter 13 echoes the MC belief in working with local communities to match economic land use with land capability.

The program's almost three decades of implementation saw positive impacts on the livelihood assets of local communities. CBFM has evolved to tackle global concerns as well, such as climate change and biodiversity conservation. Meanwhile, international climate change negotiations have drawn a means to provide financial incentives to reduce deforestation and forest degradation through Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in developing countries (REDD Plus). This mechanism hopes to bring ""triple benefits"", namely: emission reduction, biodiversity conservation and poverty alleviation. Given their parallel goals, CBFM sites are promising candidates for implementing REDD Plus, and the latter is expected to have important implications on the process and potential outcomes of CBFM. This paper looks into the local stakeholders' assessment of the impacts of CBFM on the livelihood assets of local communities and the potentials of REDD Plus implementation in the future. The literature is replete with examples emphasizing the importance of local stakeholder's participation in REDD Plus, yet their perception particularly on the added value it gives remained unclear. Results of the study revealed that CBFM implementation contributed largely to building the capital assets of people organization (PO) members, especially the human, social, natural and physical capitals. Full positive effects have yet to be realized though for the financial capital. PO members and the local institutions (DENR, LGU, NGO) expressed optimism, though with varied levels, on REDD Plus further enhancing the above capital assets. This optimism, however, does not translate to confidence in achieving the triple-benefits, as risks are also perceived by PO members posed by the likely creation of forest enclosures that could limit areas for livelihood activities. If realized, improved economic conditions could also encourage in-migration that would increase pressure to the forests. Caution should therefore be exercised in implementing REDD Plus to ensure that the intended goals are achieved in the context of views and aspirations of local stakeholders.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,JOUR,1,349,381,NA,JAN-JUN,0117-3375,WOS:000361410100026,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,5231

5366,NA,NA,"Tomberlin, D and Buongiorno, J",2000,"Timber plantations, international markets, and forest conservation","PORTLAND'99: PIONEERING NEW TRAILS, PROCEEDINGS",NA,NA,"This paper explores the impact of timber plantations on major forest products markets and forest conservation through 2010. Already producing an estimated 27% of the world's industrial roundwood, timber plantations have the potential to produce much more over the coming decades (Brown 1998). They have affected the global pattern of timber production and trade, as is evident from the emergence in the 1980s of Brazil, Chile, and New Zealand as major timber exporters. In addition to supplying wood, timber plantations pose important social and environmental questions. Critics of plantations cite their negative impacts on indigenous people, biodiversity, and hydrologic conditions. Others argue in defense of plantations that they can diminish harvest pressure on native forests and mitigate global warming by storing carbon. Given the poor quality of available information on the world's timber plantation resource, analysis of their future impact is necessarily tentative. This research explores this impact in two ways. First, results from a market simulation model are used to gauge the impact of increasing plantation growth rates due to increased management effort. Comparing model simulation results under two scenarios, one with plantation yields continuing at current levels and one with yields increasing at 3% per year, provides an estimate of plantations' potential impact on global timber production and trade through 2010. Results suggest that Global production of industrial roundwood rises a modest 1%, as an average timber price drop of 3% encourages more use of industrial roundwood. More abundant raw material supplies in the High Growth scenario reduce the price of manufactured goods an average of 1%. The higher growth rate on plantations is more than enough to offset increased timber harvest, resulting in a global increase in timber inventory of 1%. At the world level, higher plantation yields have little impact on total trade, the most significant difference being a 2% increase in pulpwood trade. Large increases in New Zealand's coniferous sawlog exports are offset by reductions in exports from Canada, Chile, and Western Europe. Forest products manufacturing in 2010 is slightly higher amid generally lower commodity prices, reflecting more abundant raw material supplies. In every country, timber inventory in 2010 is at least as high under the High Growth scenario as. under the Base Case. In sum, results of the High Growth scenario for 2010 project modest increases (relative to the Base Case) in timber production, lower prices of both raw wood and of manufactured products, and higher levels of timber inventory in 2010. Another means of assessing the impact of plantation production in the near future is to compare model projections of industrial roundwood production with an independent estimate of timber plantation yield in 2010. The difference between total projected industrial roundwood production and estimated plantation yield provides an estimate of harvest on native forests. At the world level, projected increases in plantation yields are insufficient to prevent progressively greater harvest of native timber. Only Indonesia, Malaysia, and Chile produce less timber from native forests in 2010 than in 1995. China, Brazil, and the United States all produce substantially more native forest timber in 2010. This simple comparison suggests that plantation timber is likely to gain a larger share of the timber market in several important Asian and Latin American countries, but the increase will be enough to reduce native forest harvest in few. Many have argued that by providing an alternative source of fiber, plantations support forest conservation. However, the distribution of conditions favorable to plantation forestry is very unequal across countries. Wood properties and log size are two important obstacles to the substitution of plantation wood for native timber. To some extent, technological change and plantation growth are working against these limitations. Environmental objections to plantation wood may also limit its substitution for wood from native forests. Sometimes plantation establishment is itself the cause of native forest clearing, though there is dispute about the extent of this practice. Even if plantations are established by forest conversion, their high productivity may obviate the need for some harvest on remaining native forests. But reducing the need for timber production on native forests does not necessarily protect those forests. The role of logging in forest degradation and conversion is complicated, but the main causes of forest destruction are agriculture and human settlements (Kaimowitz and Angelsen 1998). By reducing the timber value of native forests, plantations may make forestry less attractive relative to other land uses, adding to the incentive for conversion. The contribution of plantations to forest conservation is therefore likely to be largely a function of public policy.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,CPAPER,NA,503,504,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000089530500080,NA,NA,1999 Society-of-American-Foresters National Convention on Pioneering New Trails,SAF and SAF,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,5366

The majority of the research work has been conducted in the wet tropical Amazon region, in the semi-arid conditions of the Northeast, and under subtropical soil and climatic conditions in the Southeast or in the South. Research emphasis has been placed on interactions between the main components of AFS: tree, pasture, soil and microclimatic elements. Evaluation of animal performance in SPS generally has not been the main objective of experiments. A recent survey of research on SPS using Eucalyptus spp. in Brazil, showed that only 6.5% of the references in such articles pertained to the productive performance of sheep and beef cattle under grazing (Couto et al., 1998). In the Tropics, the native rain forest is the most important arboreal substrate, because it has to be preserved for environmental and biodiversity maintenance. Accordingly, research has focused on identification of either native or exotic timber tree/palm tree species to be used in SPS. At the present time, SPS using species of Pinus, rubber tree, mango tree, brazilian chestnut tree and coconut tree are common in this region. Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu, B. humidicola, Paspalum atratum BRA-009610, Desmodium ovalifolium CIAT-350, Pueraria phaseoloides BRA-0612 and Centrosema macrocarpum CIAT-5065 are some of the shade tolerant forage species showing promise for SPS in the Amazon region. In the Caatinga ecosystem, in the Northeast, research has shown that browsing of native shrubs associated with the utilization of Leucaena leucocephala protein bank and/or buffelgrass pasture allows substantial increases of liveweight gain or milk production by sheep, goats and dairy cows. In the Southeast region, in Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo states, SPS consist mainly in the association of Eucalyptus spp and Panicum maximum. Studies involving two-year-old eucalypt plantations showed that sheep or beef calves grazing P maximum cv. Coloniao allowed from 52 to 93% reduction of forest establishment and maintenance costs, as a result of selling animal products and reduction of grass competition by grazing. In the South, the most important exotic arboreal materials are Eucalyptus, Pinus and Acacia species, while Mimosa scabrella and Araucaria angustifolia are potential useful native trees. Species of Trifolium and annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) mixtures have been used as cool-season pastures while P. maximum cultivars and B. brizantha cv. Marandu are used as warm-season pasture grasses. Beef calf liveweight gains on SPS consistently outyielded those obtained by grazing the native pasture in full sunlight, at two locations in Rio Grande do Sul state. Although there is a reasonable amount of information on the establishment and management of SPS within each ecoclimatic brazilian region, the level of adoption of this new technology at the farm level is still considered very low.

Undergrowth species in agroforestry Toona sureni and Coffee Arabica are significantly richer in plant species (27 species vs. 14 in agroforestry P. Merkusii and C. Arabica). The results showed that the diversity undergrowth was categorized as moderate, and the evenness indices were low, ranging from 0.33 to 44. In the agroforestry system, the mean biomass of undergrowth was 1.65 tons ha(-1), and the carbon storage of undergrowth was 0.43 tons ha(-1). Meanwhile, litter biomass was 5.18 tons ha(-1) on average, with 2.5 tons ha(-1) of litter carbon storage. Both biomass and carbon storage of undergrowth and litter in agroforestry T. Sureni, and C. Arabiba vs. P. Merkusii and C. Arabica are significantly different. By applying sustainable agroforestry management in forests for special purposes, this study helps with future climate change adaptation and mitigation.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,JOUR,3,1003,1014,NA,JUL-SEP,2067-533X and 2067-8223,WOS:000880174700019,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,5489

This region is responsible for 97% of the national exportation of table grapes, including seedless grapes. Based on the fact that organic fertilization can improve soil quality, we compared the effects of conventional and organic soil management on microbial activity and mycorrhization of seedless grape crops. We measured glomerospores number, most probable number (MPN) of propagules, richness of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) species, AMF root colonization, EE-BRSP production, carbon microbial biomass (C-MB), microbial respiration, fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic activity (FDA) and metabolic coefficient (qCO(2)). The organic management led to an increase in all variables with the exception of EE-BRSP and qCO(2). Mycorrhizal colonization increased from 4.7% in conventional crops to 15.9% in organic crops. Spore number ranged from 4.1 to 12.4 per 50 g(-1) soil in both management systems. The most probable number of AMF propagules increased from 79 cm(-3) soil in the conventional system to 110 cm(-3) soil in the organic system. Microbial carbon, CO2 emission, and FDA activity were increased by 100 to 200% in the organic crop. Thirteen species of AMF were identified, the majority in the organic cultivation system. Acaulospora excavata, Entrophospora infrequens, Glomus sp.3 and Scutellospora sp. were found only in the organically managed crop. S. gregaria was found only in the conventional crop.

Regionally, over-grazing produced the replacement of herbaceous communities of grasslands and savannas for woody communities, leading to widespread shrublands. The aim of this study was to evaluate variation in diversity and composition of birds in a gradient of three types of habitats of Semi-arid Chaco: (i) Quebrachos Forest (Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco, Schinopsis lorentzii); (ii) Low shrubland, which constitutes a degraded version of the; (iii) Aibe Savanna (Elionurus muticus). The results suggest that the diversity of birds was determined by the vertical complexity of the vegetation and the degree of similarity of bird assemblages by the degree of similarity between habitat types. This led to: (i) gradual decreases in diversity of birds from the more complex (Forest) to the less complex habitat (Savanna); (ii) a unique composition of species in the Forest and the Savanna (more dissimilar habitats), where birds of closed habitats prevail in the first and open habitat species in the second and; (iii) Low shrubland, displaying greater similarity to the Forest than to the Savanna, representing a habitat unsuitable for open habitat birds.

Yet, little study about their interaction with specific land use or specific system function. With the rapid changes of landscape, biodiversity is also changes in response to human impact; due to each organism have the specific interaction with certain environment. In this research, the assessment of insect order in the different landscape types was conducted using several method of trapping to understand the specific pattern of insect which are inhabited the landscape. The objectives of this research were monitored the Insect diversity, its ecological importance to agro-forestry ecosystem, and compare it with other forest type in this area. Another objective was determined the insect characteristic as the indicator of environmental quality on each land-use system (forest, agroforestry, plantation and monoculture). Monoculture agriculture has the largest number of Lepidoptera and Hemiptera order (herbivore insect dominated) while in agro-forest system has the largest number of Diptera and coleoptera order. Protected forest, plantation forest and agro-forestry showed the similar index number which shows the similar ecological services for the insect as their habitat.

We evaluated the influence of the landscape's percentage of forest cover and shaded cocoa plantations on the community of zoochorous bromeliads in southern Bahia, Brazil. We selected two contrasting landscapes, one dominated by Atlantic tropical rainforest and the other by traditional cocoa plantations. In each landscape we sampled three forest fragments and three areas of cocoa plantation, where we conducted a survey of epiphytic bromeliads of the genera Aechmea and Hohenbergia in eight plots of 400 m(2) in each area. The number of trees differed between landscapes and habitats, and was higher in forest fragments than in shade cocoa plantations, but the number of phorophytes was similar between landscapes and habitats. Highest richness of Aechmea and Hohenbergia species was found in forest fragments in landscapes where forests are predominant. Contrary to expectations, the richness in the other areas was relatively low, and extremely low in the landscape dominated by cocoa plantations, ranging from zero to four species per fragment. Bromeliad abundance was not different among landscapes and habitats, but the shade cocoa plantations located in predominant agroforest landscape showed the higher number of stands. Moreover, the species found in the cocoa plantations were more drought-tolerant species. These results suggest that the conservation of species of these genera depends on factors such as the conservation status of each forest fragment and the microclimatic alterations in the habitats, and not only on the percentage of forest in the landscape per se.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,JOUR,1,58,75,NA,MAR,1940-0829,WOS:000351545700008,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,unknown,5536

The initial model of diffusion was based on a strict monoculture. However, intercropping with annual food crops during the immature period of rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis, are relatively well developed, including in rubber projects. On the other hand, the associations with perennial or forestry crops are rarely listed and often with little recognition from development institutions as it was the case in Indonesia during the 1990's. Such systems do exist locally, sometimes on a relatively important area such as the ""jungle rubber"" system for example. These agroforestry practices ensure a better land and tabour valorization. Permanent associations with perennial crops during mature period constitute an economic factor of stabilization and diversification of income. The complex agroforestry systems have also ecological advantages guaranteeing maintenance of a part of forest biodiversity. The lack of interest officially recognized for these associations in spite of economic and environmental advantages can be charged to the fact that such systems do not correspond to the dominating Estate and development projects rubber tree model. Many farmers innovated and developed pragmatic systems with agroforestry practices enabling them to decrease risks and to diversify their productions.

The state of poverty is characterised by severe nutritional deficiencies, absence of basic needs such as safe drinking water, sanitation, education and health, and low levels of income. The precarious survival situation of both the rural and urban poor leads to a strong human impact on the natural resources of the Amazon region. A protection of Amazonian ecosystems is only possible when strategies are elaborated which substantially improve the living conditions of the poor classes. This is the background of the programme Poverty and Environment in Amazonia (POEMA), initiated by an interdisciplinary research group of the Federal University of Pari at Belem, Brazil. In an integrated and participatory approach, POEMA elaborated activities in various sectors such as basic sanitation, health and education, agroforestry, renewable energy, processing of non-timber forest products and advisory support. Activities were started in close co-operation with several pilot communities throughout Para at municipal level. The main focus was set on basic sanitation and development of a sustainable land use system, based on agroforestry (multi-storey agriculture). Also value-adding and processing of raw materials was considered. All activities were evaluated by the participating communities and thus adapted to the local needs. Meanwhile, an infrastructure for supplying water treatment kits and processing of non-timber forest products for industrial use is established.
