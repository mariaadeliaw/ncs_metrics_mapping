TI  - Land related grievances shape tropical forest-cover in areas affected by armed-conflict
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - Armed-conflicts often occur in tropical areas considered to be of high 'conservation-value', termed as such for their biodiversity or carbon-storage functions. Despite this important overlap, few studies have assessed how forest-biomass is affected by armed-conflicts. Thus, in this paper we develop a multinomial logit model to, examine how outcomes of the interactions between carbon-storage, armed-conflict and deforestation rates are linked to social, institutional and economic factors. We use Colombia as a case study because of its protracted armed-conflict, high forest-cover, sustained deforestation rates and ongoing peace processes. Our empirical results show that the impacts of armed-conflicts on forest-cover are connected to specific socio-economical processes, such as unequal land distribution and land grabbing, which typically occurs as part of 'agricultural colonization'. Findings address a research gap by providing statistically sound evidence for associations between armed-conflicts and land-related grievances, which has rarely been demonstrated empirically. Our results also suggest that forest commons are associated with reduced armed-conflict, and simultaneously provide contributions to carbon storage and to meeting basic needs. Moreover, our forest-conflict transition models provide useful visual means to capture and relay to policymakers-the causes of forest cover-changes in a conflict-affected country. Finally, our findings imply that in dedicating their efforts to resolving land-ownership disputes, the Colombian government might uphold their international climate change commitments via reducing deforestation and hence forest based carbon emissions, while pursuing their national security objective via undermining opportunities for guerrilla groups to operate.

TI  - Contrasting patterns of local richness of seedlings, saplings, and trees may have implications for regeneration in rainforest remnants
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Remnants of lowland rain forest remain following deforestation, but the longer-term effects of fragmentation remain poorly understood, partly due to the long generation times of trees. We study rain forest trees in three size classes: seedlings (<1 cm dbh), saplings (1-5 cm dbh), and trees (>5 cm) that broadly reflect pre- and post-fragmentation communities, and we examine the impacts of fragmentation on forest regeneration in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We found that seedling richness (measured as the number of genera per plot) in fragments was about 30 percent lower than in plots in undisturbed forest, and about 20 percent lower than in an extensive tract of selectively logged forest, providing evidence of recruitment declines in fragments. Seedling richness was lowest in small, isolated, and disturbed fragments, potentially signaling an extinction debt given that these fragmentation impacts were not observed in trees. Unlike seedlings, saplings showed no declines in richness in fragments, suggesting that density dependent mortality (where rare individuals have a higher survival rate) and/or year-to-year variation in which species are recruiting could potentially compensate for the reductions in seedling richness we observed. Longer-term studies are required to determine whether sporadic or failed recruitment in small fragments will eventually translate into reduced richness of mature trees, or whether the processes that currently retain high sapling richness will continue in fragments.

TI  - India's biodiversity hotspot under anthropogenic pressure: A case study of Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
AB  - This paper presents data on the impact of biotic pressure in terms of grazing by livestock and wood cutting by humans on the plant community in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve of India. Grass, and herbaceous plant biomass, number of cattle dung piles, number of woody stems available and damaged by human activities and weed biomass were assessed at different proximity along transects radiating from village-forest boundary to forest interior to measure the ecological impact of livestock grazing and fire wood collection. The grass biomass was positively correlated to overgrazing indicating the adverse effect on natural vegetation by cattle. Woodcutting was intense along the forest boundary and significantly declined as distance increased. Similarly, weed biomass and number of thorny species declined positively with proximity from village-forest boundary and the weed biomass was significantly higher in the pastoral sites compared to residential sites. The results suggest that human impact adversely affects natural vegetation and promotes weed proliferation in forest areas adjoining human settlements in the ecologically important Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. Continued anthropogenic pressure could cause reduction in fodder availability to large herbivores like elephants, which in turn leads to an increase in human-elephant conflict.

TI  - Fertilization and seasonality influence on the photochemical performance of tree legumes in forest plantation for area recovery in the Amazon
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - N-fixing leguminous species can reach atmospheric dinitrogen gas (N-2), having an advantage under N-limited degraded environments. These N-fixers are constantly used as facilitative species. Chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChF) acknowledges how different species take up and use light energy during photosynthesis. These techniques assess stress and performance responses to photosynthesis and are used for the selection of species with potential for reforestation. Six Fabaceae species were selected for this study: three nonfixing species (Cenostigma tocantinum, Senna reticulata and Dipteryx odorata) and three N-fixing species (Clitoria fairchildiana, Inga edulis and Acacia spp.). Variations in chlorophyll fluorescence under high vs. low water and nutrient conditions were studied. Multivariate analysis was performed to detect the effects of seasonality and fertilization on dark-adapted ChF two years after the experiment was established. The correlation among ChF variables and growth, photosynthesis and foliar nutrient concentrations was evaluated. Under high water- and nutrient-availability conditions, plants exhibited an enhanced performance index on absorption basis values correlated with electron transport fluxes. Under drought and nutrient-poor conditions, most species exhibit increased energy dissipation as photoprotection. High interspecific variation was found; therefore, species-specific responses should be considered in future ChF studies. Corroborating the ability to colonize high-light environments, N-fixers showed an increased performance index correlated with electron transport and Zn and N foliar concentrations. Negative correlations were found between photosynthesis and trapped fluxes. Diameter growth was positively correlated with electron transport fluxes. Given the different responses among species, ChF is an effective technique to screen for seasonality, fertilization and species effects and should be considered for use during forest restoration. Finally, the addition of fertilization treatments may facilitate tropical forest restoration due to the importance of nutrients in physiological processes. N-fixers showed high photochemical performance and tolerance to abiotic stress in degraded areas and therefore should be included to support ecosystem biomass restoration.

TI  - People plant trees for utility more often than for biodiversity or carbon
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Tree planting is both a promising and controversial solution to climate change and biodiversity loss. However, this controversy is largely theoretical because we lack detailed information of how tree planting is proceeding onthe-ground. Here, we compiled a pantropical dataset of 174 tree planting organizations to determine the type of organizations involved in tree planting, their geographic locations and tree planting approaches. We found that the number of organizations have increased by 288% in the past 30 years, especially for-profit organizations. These organizations reported planting nearly 1.4 billion trees across 74 countries since 1961. Most frequently organizations reported establishing agroforestry systems or mixed species and single species plantations or using assisted natural regeneration, suggesting that tree planting programs are designed to support local communities as well as environmental objectives. Moreover, the most frequently reported species were commercial or utilitarian, with the top five including cacao, teak, moringa, mango and coffee. Finally, despite widespread efforts to plant more trees, there was a pronounced lack of monitoring on websites and in reports; only 18% of organizations mention monitoring at all, and only 5% mention measuring survival rate of plantings. Greater transparency and greater communication are needed between planting organizations and researchers to apply the most effective ways to restore forest cover. Further, while organizations often aimed to counter environmental problems, the use of the same sets of commercially useful species to meet economic development goals across the global indicates a need for greater coordination among organizations to avoid biotic homogenization.

TI  - Biodiversity impacts of land use simplification: a case study of dung beetles in a landscape of the Brazilian Atlantic forest
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
AB  - Unplanned and invasive use of natural resources can have irreversible implications for the environment. Appropriate strategies for adequate management could have utmost importance for the conservation of biodiversity. Environments that harbor a huge structural complexity, such as agroforestry systems, even the simplest ones, may host a high species diversity and may therefore ensure the provision of important ecological services. To examine the effect of vegetation structure loss by land use simplification on biodiversity, we evaluate dung beetle (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) diversity in different land uses, considering: Brazilian Atlantic Forest, cacao-rubber agroforestry, and rubber monoculture. We found a decreasing gradient of dung beetle diversity from forest to monoculture, as cacao-rubber agroforestry maintaining an intermediate level of dung beetle diversity that is lower than that of the native forest but significantly higher than rubber monoculture. Species composition is rather similar when comparing forest and agroforestry, whereas monoculture holds a different assemblage. Although monoculture farming is still encouraged by the agribusiness market, our results support the idea that agroforestry is a reasonable option to be considered and adapted to compensate the deleterious effects of agriculture intensification on dung beetle diversity. We suggest that such land use would be the best choice to ensure dung beetle diversity maintenance in agricultural landscapes.

TI  - The first rapid forest inventory and resource use assessment of Dashtijum Nature Reserve, Tajikistan: a mixed methods approach
T2  - ORYX
AB  - There is critical need for more information on the status of forests in Central Asia, to inform conservation management. Here we assess the status and use of the globally important, threatened walnut-fruit forests of Dashtijum Nature Reserve, Tajikistan. We use a mixed methods approach combining a semi-structured interview based socio-economic survey with statistical analysis. Thirty-three tree species were recorded, with Rosaceae the most common family. The mean basal area of the forest was 20.8 m(2)per ha and most tree species exhibited stable population structures. Resource use was prevalent throughout the community; most households harvested at least one fruit or nut species (78%), firewood (88%) and grazed livestock (85%). Most respondents noted declines in availability of fruits, nuts and firewood and reported a decrease in the overall area and quality of grazing. Statistical analysis and machine learning identified that distance to nearest settlement significantly affected forest total basal area, tree species richness and the Shannon index, a metric of diversity sensitive to rare species. Our results suggest that conservation management by the government and NGOs is partly effective but there is a need for increased enforcement of grazing restrictions, to prevent further forest degradation.

TI  - Southeast Asian biodiversity is a fifth lower in deforested versus intact forests
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Southeast Asia is highly biodiverse and currently experiences among the highest rates of tropical deforestation globally, but impacts on biodiversity are not well synthesized. We use Bayesian multi-level modeling to meta-analyse 831 pairwise comparisons of biodiversity in sites subject to land-use driven deforestation (for example, plantations or logged forest) versus undisturbed sites (control sites). After controlling for hierarchical dependencies, we show that biodiversity is a fifth lower in sites with these land-use driven deforestation (95% credible interval = 16%-28%, mean = 22%). This reduction was greater when forest losses were of high-intensity (34% reduction in biodiversity) compared to low-intensity (18% reduction), and effects were consistent across biogeographic regions and taxa. Oil-palm plantations led to the greatest reduction in biodiversity (39%, CI 27%-48%), and agroforests the least (24%, CI 10%-37%). We also find that biodiversity was reduced by 26% (CI 4%-42%) in secondary forest sites compared to undisturbed control sites, but biodiversity was the same in intermediate or mature-aged secondary forest compared to control sites (although species composition was potentially altered). Overall, our study provides a new line of evidence of the substantial detrimental impacts of land-use driven deforestation and particular types of land-use on the biodiversity of Southeast Asia.

TI  - Agroforestry orchards support greater butterfly diversity than monoculture plantations in the tropics
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Large-scale deforestation in the tropics, triggered by logging and subsequent agricultural monoculture has a significant adverse impact on biodiversity due to habitat degradation. Here, we measured the diversity of butterfly species in three agricultural landscapes, agroforestry orchards, oil palm, and rubber tree plantations. Butterfly species were counted at 127 sampling points over the course of a year using the point count method. We found that agroforestry orchards supported a greater number of butterfly species (74 species) compared to rubber tree (61 species) and oil palm plantations (54 species) which were dominated by generalist (73%) followed by forest specialists (27%). We found no significant difference of butterfly species composition between agroforestry orchards and rubber tree plantation, with both habitats associated with more butterfly species compared to oil palm plantations. This indicates butterflies were able to persist better in certain agricultural landscapes. GLMMs suggested that tree height, undergrowth coverage and height, and elevation determined butterfly diversity. Butterfly species richness was also influenced by season and landscape-level variables such as proximity to forest, mean NDVI, and habitat. Understanding the factors that contributed to butterfly species richness in an agroecosystem, stakeholders should consider management practices to improve biodiversity conservation such as ground vegetation management and retaining adjacent forest areas to enhance butterfly species richness. Furthermore, our findings suggest that agroforestry system should be considered to enhance biodiversity in agricultural landscapes.

TI  - Monitoring the rewilding of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest on tree and mammal diversity: From a biodiversity hotspot to a biodiversity hopespot
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
AB  - The implementation of rewilding initiatives is crucial for biodiversity recovery, particularly in biodiversity hotspots such as the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Long-term monitoring of rewilding initiatives is critical for assessing progress and informing management choices. This study assesses the efficiency of different reforestation practices for biodiversity recovery, including passive restoration, active reforestation with different native seedlings, and plantations of exotic species. We applied an ecosystem approach to estimate the tree and mammal diversity, collected through forest plots and camera traps. We selected differently managed areas and included the oldest forest patches as reference points for the assessment of biodiversity; a naturally disturbed montane forest in the area was included as a control category for the disturbance analysis. Moreover, we investigated the influence of ecological variables, such as biodiversity, aboveground biomass, and altitude, on rewilding processes. Our results suggest that Eucalyptus plantations, a simplified ecosystem made up of monocultures of exotic species, support lower biodiversity. On the contrary, active reforestation with different native species resulted in an ecological status comparable to naturally regrown secondary forests. We show that active reforestation can reduce the time required for rewilding. We also found a positive correlation between tree and mammal species richness. These results underscore the importance and potential of responsible restoration efforts in recovering local biodiversity, contributing to the vision of a future where the Brazilian Atlantic Forest can be acknowledged not only as a biodiversity hotspot but also as a "hopespot."

TI  - Monoculture plantations impede forest recovery: Evidence from the regeneration of lowland subtropical forest in Hong Kong
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Anthropogenic disturbance has led to widespread clearance and degradation of tropical forests, and tree planting has been promoted as an effective solution for recovery. However, trees have been overwhelmingly planted in monocultures or low-diversity mixes and this is expected to have profound, lasting impacts on forest structure, diversity, and functioning. In this study, we tested the extent to which historical vegetation transition types (VTTs) constrain forest recovery in a secondary tropical landscape in Hong Kong, South China. To do so, we overlaid vegetation types (forest, shrubland, pine plantation, grassland) identified in aerial photographs taken in 1956 and 1963 of a 20-ha plot situated in Tai Po Kau Nature Reserve, allowing us to define six historic VTTs, namely: FF (forest to forest), GP (grassland to plantation), GS (grassland to shrubland), SS (shrubland to shrubland), SF (shrubland to forest), and SP (shrubland to plantation). We compared present-day forest structure and species diversity among these VTTs, as determined from a census conducted in 2015, using incidence- and abundance-based rarefaction and extrapolation, and we assessed species' association within VTTs using a torus translation test. Our results reveal that stem density and species diversity in naturally regenerated forests were more similar to those of old-growth forest, whereas species diversity in areas occupied by pine plantations was significantly lower as compared with naturally regenerated areas. Despite 60 years of recovery, pine plantations were characterised by a significantly greater proportion of negatively associated species, and late-seral species were still predominantly confined to old-growth patches. Present-day species distribution is chiefly explained by the combined effects of topography and VTT (17.1%), with VTT alone explaining 4.4%. Our study demonstrates that VTT has a significant long-term impact on forest regeneration and community assembly and, importantly, that monocultural plantations (forest plantation) can greatly impede forest recovery. Remnant old-growth forest patches merit priority protection, and active restoration, including thinning and enhancement planting, is necessary to facilitate forest succession.

TI  - Contemporary forest restoration: A review emphasizing function
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The forest restoration challenge (globally 2 billion ha) and the prospect of changing climate with increasing frequency of extreme events argues for approaching restoration from a functional and landscape perspective. Because the practice of restoration utilizes many techniques common to silviculture, no clear line separates ordinary forestry practices from restoration. The distinction may be that extra-ordinary activities are required in the face of degraded, damaged, or destroyed ecosystems. Restoration is driven by the desire to increase sustainability of ecosystems and their services and restoration is likely to have multiple goals arising from the motivations of those involved. The process of setting restoration objectives translates vague goals into feasible, measurable targets and ultimately actions on the ground. Our objective for this review is to synthesize the science underpinning contemporary approaches to forest restoration practice. We focus on methods and present them within a coherent terminology of four restoration strategies: rehabilitation, reconstruction, reclamation, and replacement. While not a consensus terminology, these terms have a logical foundation. Rehabilitation restores desired species composition, structure, or processes to a degraded ecosystem. Reconstruction restores native plant communities on land recently in other resource uses, such as agriculture. Reclamation restores severely degraded land generally devoid of vegetation, often the result of resource extraction, such as mining. Replacement of species (or their locally-adapted genotypes) with new species (or new genotypes) is a response to climate change. Restoration methods are presented as available tools; because adding vegetation is an effective restoration technique, the discussion of methods begins with a description of available plant materials. We then discuss altering composition under different initial overstory conditions, including deployment methods depending upon whether or not an overstory is present, how much of the landscape will be restored, and the complexity of the planting design. We present some major approaches for altering structure in degraded forest stands, and describe approaches for restoration of two key ecosystem processes, fire and flooding. Although we consider stand-level designs, what we describe is mostly scalable to the landscape-level. No restoration project is undertaken in a social vacuum; even stand-level restoration occurs within a system of governance that regulates relationships among key agents. Gathering information and understanding the social dimensions of a restoration project is as necessary as understanding the biophysical dimensions. Social considerations can trump biophysical factors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Arthropod responses to the experimental isolation of Amazonian forest fragments
T2  - ZOOLOGIA
AB  - Arthropods are the most diverse and abundant group of animals found in tropical lowland forests, and in light of ongoing global change phenomena, it is essential to better understand their responses to anthropogenic disturbances. Here we present a review of arthropod responses to forest deforestation and fragmentation based on studies conducted at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP), located in central Amazonia. These studies involved a wide range of arthropod groups. All but one of the studies evaluated changes in total species number or species density in relation to fragment size, (i.e. area effects), and one-third also evaluated edge effects. Our review indicates that almost every arthropod group studied showed some kind of response to reduction in forest area, including altered abundances, species richness or composition in comparisons of different-sized fragments, fragmented and non-fragmented areas, or comparisons of forest edges and forest interiors. These responses tended to be idiosyncratic, with some groups showing predicted declines in abundance or diversity in the fragments while others show no response or even increases. However, some of the observed effects on arthropods, or on the ecological processes in which they are involved, were transient. The most likely explanation for this was the rapid development of secondary growth around fragments, which greatly increased the connectivity between fragments and the remaining forest. Although the BDFFP has provided many insights regarding the effects of forest fragmentation on arthropod assemblages, many diverse groups, such as canopy arthropods, have received scant attention. For those that have been studied, much remains to be learned regarding the long-term dynamics of these assemblages and how landscape context influences local biodiversity. The BDFFP remains an exceptional site in which to investigate how the ecological interactions in which arthropods are engaged are altered in fragmented landscapes.

TI  - Distribution of Ormosia macrocalyx in Mexico and delimitation of its occupation areas
T2  - REVISTA MEXICANA DE BIODIVERSIDAD
AB  - The geographic-ecological distribution of Ormosia macrocalyx Ducke was analyzed to delimit the occupation areas (AO) in Mexico, in order to recognize the ecological requirements of this tree species, which can contribute to the development and establishment of appropriate protection programs. All georeferenced species records were obtained from national and international herbaria as well as national forest inventories. Each record was correlated with the ecological variables from database of National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity and National Institute of Statistics and Geography and maps of the AO were drawn up. The AO were calculated and delimited by the Cartographic method by conglomerates. This species is distributed in the southern states of Mexico, occupying zones of high precipitation (>= 800 mm), at elevations lower than 1,150 m asl and mainly on Gleysol soils. It has been recorded in forest remnants in agroforestry systems and as isolated individuals. Five AO and 6 satellites were delimited, the 2 largest areas located within Tabasco and Chiapas. Due to its specialized habitat and the fragmented ecosystems in which it is found, this species can be categorized as vulnerable.

TI  - Disturbance and climate affect species richness and aboveground biomass relationship in a forest-savanna transition ecosystem
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The relationship between species richness and aboveground biomass (richness-biomass relationship) is a major facet of ecosystem functions and has stimulated debates over the past decades. However, we still lack basic knowledge on whether this relationship has consistent patterns across natural and human-impacted vegetation cover types. More importantly, the effects of disturbance and climatic conditions on species richness and aboveground biomass remain controversial. Using data from 197 0.5-ha plots established within a forest-savanna transition ecosystem, we determined three ecological vegetation covers via non-metric multidimensional scaling, obtained gridded climate data and calculated disturbance index from species succession guilds. We examined the consistency of the richness-biomass relationship across the vegetation covers using general linear models and further analysed the effects of disturbance and climatic conditions on this relationship using non-mixed and mixed linear models. We identified three vegetation cover types corresponding to Old-growth forests, Cocoa agroforests and Woodland savannas, suggesting a succession gradient from late-, mid-, and early-successions, respectively. Aboveground biomass consistently increased with species richness across the three vegetation cover types (i.e. positive relationship). Species richness interacts with climate humidity to increase aboveground biomass while interaction of species richness and disturbance rather decreases aboveground biomass consistently across the vegetation cover types. Our results provide insights into the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functions, having implications for ecosystem restoration and understanding ecological consequences of disturbance and climate change in the forest-savanna ecosystem.

TI  - Changes in floristic composition, diversity and anthropogenic perturbations in an east African tropical forest
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - We assessed changes in floristic composition, diversity and anthropogenic activities in an East African forest; Echuya Central Forest Reserve (ECFR). Using 272 permanent sample plots, comparisons between 2015 and 2021 were made. Twenty-two tree species were recorded with Macaranga capensis being the most dominant. Tree species density increased significantly from 152 stems/ha in 2015 to 306 stems/ha in 2021. Similarly, trees basal area increased significantly from 19 m(2)/ha in 2015 to 38 m(2)/ha in 2021. The bamboo stem density decreased significantly from 11,931 stems/ha in 2015 to 1807 stems/ha in 2021. Shrubs, lianas, vines and herbs' densities did not show significant differences between 2015 and 2021. Furthermore, a number of human activities significantly increased from 22 activities per hectare in 2015 to 83 per hectare in 2021. The Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) ordination shows that the human activities with the strongest impact on tree species composition and basal areas were fuelwood collection, human trails, livestock grazing and pole cutting. In conclusion, ECFR is floristically poor; secondary forest tree species are replacing the bamboo forest and human activities could be negatively affecting the ECFR flora. We recommend interventions of increasing people's livelihood incomes to decrease their dependence on forest resources.

TI  - Primary productivity and resource partitioning in model tropical ecosystems
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - The diversity of plant life forms in tropical forests affords the opportunity for assembly of plant combinations, both natural and managed, that make full use of resources and sustain high productivity. The influence of combining life forms on productivity and resource use was evaluated using three fast-growing tree species (Hyeronima alchorneoides, Cedrela odorata, and Cordia alliodora); each species was grown alone and with two perennial, large-stature, self-supporting monocots (Euterpe oleracea and Heliconia imbricata).
   Aboveground net primary productivity was extremely high in all stands. The monocots did not contribute significantly to the productivity of the Hyeronima polycultures, which was 4.5-8.4 g.m(-2).d(-1) between 18 and 36 mo. In contrast, the monocots accounted for 57% of the productivity (9.7 g.m(-2).d(-1)) of Cedrela polycultures and 67% of the productivity (6.8 g.m(-2).d(-1)) of the Cordia polycultures, by age 3 yr. The leaf area and density of fine roots in the Cedrela and Cordia polycultures were also significantly increased by the presence of the monocots, reaching or surpassing the levels found in the Hyeronima stands.
   The high productivity of Hyeronima, coupled with poor growth of its interplanted monocots, indicated that Hyeronima was able to achieve nearly complete use of resources. Ecosystem productivity and resource capture were increased when the monocots were grown with the other two tree species, and this occurred because of the inability of the tree species to completely utilize available resources, which provided an opportunity for the monocots to flourish in the understory. Monocot productivity in the Cedrela stands was additive to that of the trees, indicating complementary resource use between the monocots and this tree species. In the case of Cordia, tree productivity was slowed by the monocots, but this decline was more than compensated for by the high productivity of the associated monocots.
   Whether in natural forests or human-constructed agroforestry systems, the presence of dominant species that do not fully exploit all available resources allows the coexistence of other species and creates the potential for complementary resource use. The resource use characteristics of such species should be a key consideration in forest restoration efforts and in the design of sustainable land use systems.

TI  - Rapid colonization of a Hawaiian restoration forest by a diverse avian community
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Deforestation of tropical forests has led to widespread loss and extirpation of forest bird species around the world, including the Hawaiian Islands which have experienced a dramatic loss of forests over the last 200-800 years. Given the important role birds play in forest ecosystem functions via seed dispersal and pollination, a bird community's response to forest restoration is an important measure of the success of such conservation actions. We evaluated the bird response to reforestation at an important bird sanctuary, Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge, Hawaii Island, using 26 years of bird count data. We show that most species from within the diverse avian community increased significantly, but species colonized the restoration forest at different rates. Distance from intact forest and time since restoration were both important predictors of colonization rate, interacting such that for most species it took more time to colonize areas farther from the intact forest. In addition, both forest cover and understory diversity helped to explain bird densities, but the effect varied among species, suggesting that different habitat requirements may help drive variation in colonization rates. This article provides the first detailed evaluation of how a diverse community of birds has responded to one of the largest, ongoing reforestation projects in Hawaii.

TI  - Few functionally acquisitive big-sized trees restrict but soil nutrients promote soil organic carbon storage in temperate deciduous forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) storage plays a crucial role in mitigating global climate change while maintaining forests and sustaining environmental conditions. Recent studies have shown that plant species diversity increases SOC storage in experimental grasslands and natural forests. Here, we aim to show how an integrating tree-size and trait-based ecological approach leads to mechanistic insights into SOC storage that may be overlooked in previous studies. We hypothesized that tree functional diversity effects on SOC storage would change with tree -sized-based species' functional strategies driven by soil properties in natural temperate deciduous forests. We used the forest inventory data, site-specific measured traits and soil properties from 99 temperate deciduous forest plots in northwestern Iran. We investigated the joint effects of topographic factors, soil chemical prop-erties, and the functional attributes (multi-trait functional diversity indices and community-weighted trait mean indices) of big-sized trees (BsT; individual tree diameter = 50 cm) and remaining-sized trees (RsT) on topsoil (0-30 cm) SOC storage. The multiple linear regression models showed that SOC storage increased with increasing soil available phosphorus (r = 0.36), soil exchangeable potassium (r = 0.27 to 0.31) and soil total nitrogen (r = 0.27). In contrast, SOC storage declined with increasing the community-weighted mean of specific leaf area (r =-0.38 to-0.40). The structural equation model showed that SOC storage was directly driven by the positive effect of soil nutrients (i.e. a latent variable of soil total nitrogen and available phosphorus; r = 0.42) and the negative effect of the community-weighted mean of specific leaf area (r =-0.31). The topographic factors as well as the other several functional attributes of BsT and RsT showed non-significant direct and indirect effects on SOC storage in both types of statistical modelling. Our study suggests that the mass ratio and soil fertility rather than the niche complementarity effects along with the big-sized trees effect regulates SOC storage through the acquisitive trait identity of BsT species as compared to RsT species in temperate deciduous forests. We argue that maintaining high levels of species diversity with the most efficient trait identity across tree sizes is important for biodiversity conservation and multiple forest functions such as SOC storage which should be a priority for plantation management plans or silvicultural practices in natural forests.

TI  - Diversity, Population Structure and Distribution of Trees in Tropical Dry Forests, East Godavari District, Eastern Ghats, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Tree diversity and population structure were analysed in two dry tropical forest sites of the Eastern Ghats in East Godavari District, Andhra Pradesh. One-hectare area (4 plots of 0.25ha each) was selected in each study site for quantitative tree inventory. A total of 99 species (71 in the site 1 and 77 in site II) from 31 families were recorded. Of which the adults (>= 10 cm DBH) and juvenile (>= 3-<10cm DBH) population of tree species were greater in the site 1 (45 and 49) than site 11 (34 and 35) while saplings (<3 cm DBH) contribution showed a reverse trend (55 in site I and 72 in site II). The basal area ranged 20.6-29.4 m(2)/ha. The mean stem density was 506 stems/ha. Diameter class-wise distribution showed reverse "J" shaped curve. Leguminosae was most speciose family. Maximum species showed contagious distribution pattern in all the stages except for adult and juvenile populations in the site 1 where the maximum distribution was random. Xylia xylocarpa is a single dominant species in both the study sites which indicates that these forest sites were subjected to disturbances in the past. Population structure enlightens that the sites have a good regeneration potential. The present study reveals that the tropical dry forest sites in East Godavari region restore substantial tree diversity as similar to other parts Eastern Ghats and tropics. There is a variation in species richness, abundance, basal area and distribution pattern between the sites could be attributed to differences in topographical position of sites, soil moisture, microclimate, human activities, grazing and seasonal fires.

TI  - From eco-catastrophe to zero deforestation? Interdisciplinarities, politics, environmentalisms and reduced clearing in Amazonia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Brazil's rate of deforestation has declined by more than 70% since 2004, a dynamic unimaginable even a decade ago. Even the worst drought in more than 100 years (2010) produced a flat clearing profile from 2009-2010, an unexpected result, since dry periods usually have clearing spikes. While deforestation continues throughout the tropics (and Amazonia), and the recent change in Brazil's Forest Code has produced a modest increase in deforestation, there are significant processes that are slowing clearing and fostering woodland recovery. This paper outlines the multiplicities and interdisciplinarities of political ecologies, policies, politics scientific approaches and technologies that have moderated forest conversion and shaped Amazonia's unusual, and unusually effective development and conservation conjunctures in Brazil's post-authoritarian period. New institutional framings, ideologies, political decentralization, globalizations and an expanded arena for new social movements and civil society provided the context for this transformation. Changing environmental institutions, discourses and the relatively redistributive social pact that underpinned President Ignacio (Lula) da Silva's administration had a significant role in promoting more resilient land uses, monitoring, compliance and new markets, while regional social movements and national and international commodity boycotts affected more damaging ones. Finally, other forms of payment for environmental services, such as REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) and REDD+ are changing the value of standing forests. This paper describes how complex interdisciplinarities shaped the politics, policies and practices that slowed forest clearing. However, Amazonia's politics are extremely dynamic: destabilizing processes, violence and indifferent national leadership could still reverse this remarkable turnaround.

TI  - Forest fragmentation in China and its effect on biodiversity
T2  - BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
AB  - Land-use change is fragmenting natural ecosystems, with major consequences for biodiversity. This paper reviews fragmentation trends - historical and current - in China, the fourth largest country on Earth, and explores its consequences. Remote sensing makes it possible to track land-use change at a global scale and monitor fragmentation of dwindling natural landscapes. Yet few studies have linked fragmentation mapped remotely with impacts on biodiversity within human-modified landscapes. Recent reforestation programs have caused substantial increases in forest cover but have not stopped fragmentation, because the new forests are mostly monocultures that further fragment China's remnant old-growth lowland forests that harbour the highest levels of biodiversity. Fragmentation - and associated biodiversity declines - is unevenly distributed in China's forests, being most problematic where agricultural expansion is occurring in the southwest and northeast, serious in the densely populated eastern regions where urbanisation and transport infrastructure are modifying landscapes, but less of a problem in other regions. Analyses of temporal trends show that the drivers of forest fragmentation are shifting from mainly agricultural expansion to urbanisation and infrastructure development. Most of China's old-growth forests persist in small, isolated fragments from which many native species have disappeared, on land unsuitable for human utilisation. Fragmentation throughout China is likely to have major consequences on biodiversity conservation, but few studies have considered these large-scale processes at the national level. Our review fills this research gap and puts forward a systematic perspective relevant to China and beyond.

TI  - Scenario-modelling for the sustainable management of non-timber forest products in tropical ecosystems
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - Ecosystems degradation, and consequently biodiversity loss, has severe impacts on people around the world. The Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is one of the international initiatives that have emerged to inform policy makers and aid decisions to prevent further global biodiversity loss, focusing on the interdependence between natural systems and human culture. IPBES promotes the use of scenarios and modelling approaches as a fundamental tool to advance the understanding of the relationships between drivers of change, Nature's Contributions to People (NCP), and social systems. Local-scale case studies with a system approach demonstrating how current knowledge can be used to inform decision-making are still scarce. Here, we present a comprehensive conceptual model and a series of four scenarios under different policies for shea tree species management, as a case-study of applying systems thinking and the NCP concept to a local-scale socio-ecological system. We first characterized the central processes, NCP, drivers and pressures affecting the shea tree system, to investigate the impacts of the multiple uses of the shea tree species on the system as a whole. We then described potential policy options, developed four scenarios, and evaluated them by a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN). We predicted qualitative outcomes of the proposed scenarios: Business-as-usual (BAU), "Conservation and fair trade", "Agroforestry and fair trade" and "Industrial development". We found that the scenarios focussing on conservation, fair trade and agroforestry, can improve the conservation status of shea trees, and enhance well-being in the local communities. In this case study, we demonstrate that the development of a comprehensive conceptual model at a local scale can be a useful exercise to identify opportunities for effective policy strategies and social innovation. The shea tree case study can provide an example for modelling non-timber forest products in other regions around the world that face similar drivers and pressures. Species for which this model could be adapted include Central and South American species such as the Brazilian nut (Bertholletia excelsa), cocoa (Theobroma cacao), andiroba (Carapa guianensis), acai (Euterpe oleracea) and the wax palm (Ceroxylon quindiuense). The model and workflow applied here may thus be used to understand similar socio-ecological systems with local and international economic value across the Neotropical region.

TI  - Life after logging: post-logging recovery of a neotropical bat community
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. There is considerable debate about whether tropical forests can be managed for timber production and to conserve biodiversity. Few 'sustainable forestry' systems have been evaluated adequately in this respect. Microchiropteran bats may be model taxa for this purpose. They are an important component of mammalian diversity, play key roles in forest dynamics and are indicators of disturbance in neotropical forests.
   2. We investigated the effect of Trinidad's periodic block system (PBS) on bat species diversity and community organization. PBS is a polycyclic system of selective logging with a 30-year harvesting rotation. We captured bats in primary forest and PBS-managed forest logged 33, 31, 21, 20 and 10 years previously.
   3. Selective logging did not affect species diversity but did affect community structure. Frugivorous bats were significantly more abundant in logged forest whereas gleaning animalivores were more abundant in primary forest, suggesting that frugivores benefited and gleaning animalivores were adversely affected by logging.
   4. The bat community showed evidence of recovery. The number of years since forest disturbance was positively correlated with the abundance and number of species of gleaning animalivores and negatively correlated with the proportional abundance of the most common species. Gleaning animalivores increased in abundance with forest regeneration, whereas the community became less dominated by a single generalist frugivore.
   5. Synthesis and applications. PBS selective logging appears to be compatible with the conservation of bat diversity. This provides evidence that neotropical forests can be managed for timber production in an ecologically sustainable way and that significant biodiversity conservation efforts can occur outside national parks and nature reserves in areas set aside for sustainable development. PBS could serve as a basic blueprint for sustainable forestry in the Guianan Shield where there are forests similar in species composition to those of Trinidad. Key attributes that could be adopted by many tropical countries to manage their forests in an ecologically sustainable way are a low intensity harvest, a long rotation and multiple controls on harvesting.

TI  - Land cover changes and greenhouse gas emissions in two different soil covers in the Brazilian Caatinga
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The Caatinga biome covers an area of 844,453 km(2) and has enormous endemic biodiversity, with unique characteristics that make it an exclusive Brazilian biome. It falls within the earth's tropical zone and is one of the several important ecoregions of Brazil. This biome undergoes natural lengthy periods of drought that cause losses in crop and livestock productivity, having a severe impact on the population. Due to the vulnerability of this ecosystem to climate change, livestock has emerged as the main livelihood of the rural population, being the precursor of the replacement of native vegetation by grazing areas. This study aimed to measure GHG emissions from two different soil covers: native forest (Caatinga) and pasture in the municipality of Sao Joao, Pernambuco State, in the years 2013 and 2014. GHG measurements were taken by using static chamber techniques in both soil covers. According to a previous search, so far, this is the first study measuring GHG emissions using the static chamber in the Caatinga biome. N2O emissions ranged from -1.0 to 4.2 mg m(-2) d(-1) and -1.22 to 3.4 mg m(-2) d(-1) in the pasture and Caatinga, respectively, and they did not significantly differ from each other. Emissions were significantly higher during dry seasons. Carbon dioxide ranged from -1.1 to 14.1 and 1.2 to 15.8 g m(-2) d(-1) in the pasture and Caatinga, respectively. CO2 emissions were higher in the Caatinga in 2013, and they were significantly influenced by soil temperature, showing an inverse relation. Methane emission ranged from 6.6 to 6.8 and -6.0 to 4.8 mg m(-2) d(-1) in the pasture and Caatinga, respectively, and was significantly higher only in the Caatinga in the rainy season of 2014. Soil gas fluxes seemed to be influenced by climatic and edaphic conditions as well as by soil cover in the Caatinga biome. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - TEK and biodiversity management in agroforestry systems of different socio-ecological contexts of the Tehuacan Valley
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
AB  - Transformation of natural ecosystems into intensive agriculture is a main factor causing biodiversity loss worldwide. Agroforestry systems (AFS) may maintain biodiversity, ecosystem benefits and human wellbeing, they have therefore high potential for concealing production and conservation. However, promotion of intensive agriculture and disparagement of TEK endanger their permanence. A high diversity of AFS still exist in the world and their potentialities vary with the socio-ecological contexts. We analysed AFS in tropical, temperate, and arid environments, of the Tehuacan Valley, Mexico, to investigate how their capacity varies to conserve biodiversity and role of TEK influencing differences in those contexts. We hypothesized that biodiversity in AFS is related to that of forests types associated and the vigour of TEK and management. We conducted studies in a matrix of environments and human cultures in the Tehuacan Valley. In addition, we reviewed, systematized and compared information from other regions of Mexico and the world with comparable socio-ecological contexts in order to explore possible general patterns. Our study found from 26 % to nearly 90 % of wild plants species richness conserved in AFS, the decreasing proportion mainly associated to pressures for intensifying agricultural production and abandoning traditional techniques. Native species richness preserved in AFS is influenced by richness existing in the associated forests, but the main driver is how people preserve benefits of components and functions of ecosystems. Elements of modern agricultural production may coexist with traditional management patterns, but imposition of modern models may break possible balances. TEK influences decisions on what and how modern techniques may be advantageous for preserving biodiversity, ecosystem integrity in AFS and people's wellbeing. TEK, agroecology and other sciences may interact for maintaining and improving traditional AFS to increase biodiversity and ecosystem integrity while improving quality of life of people managing the AFS.

TI  - Woody Plant Conservation Value of Three Contrasting Forest Management Regimes in Southwest Ethiopia
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - The future of the Afromontane forest of southwest Ethiopia is highly influenced by coffee management intensity. The study was conducted to investigate the woody species conservation value of a human-modified forest in southwest Ethiopia. We assessed woody species composition, regeneration and forest stand structure across three different management regimes (i.e., natural forest, coffee forest and coffee agroforest using 189 plots of 400 m(2) (20 m x 20 m). A total of 64 species belonging to 33 families were identified and recorded across the three forest management regimes. About 83% of the recorded woody species were maintained in the coffee agroforest. The three forest types shared 61% of the recorded woody species. The coffee agroforest had maintained four strata or layers of stand structure. Nevertheless, the total abundance, density and basal area of woody species decreased from the natural forest to coffee forest and coffee agroforest. The Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM) showed significant difference between the natural forest, coffee forest and coffee agroforest (Global R-Anosim = 0.36, p < 0.001). Similar regeneration patterns were recorded under the forest management regimes. Coffee agroforests simplify the woody plant composition and stand structure of the Afromontane forest in southwest Ethiopia.

TI  - Trees outside forests as climate change mitigation champions: evaluating their carbon sequestration potential and monetary value in Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak (Haryana), India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB  - The annual average increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration is touching new heights every year. Global climate change and warming are twin outcomes of record-breaking CO2 levels. The trees outside forests (TOF) are the most promising and suitable components in the ecosystem for combating global warming via carbon (C) sequestration. Urban university campuses are the hotspot regions of TOF. We have attempted to quantify the C stock, C sequestration potential, and C credit value of dominant tree species at Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU), Rohtak. Different volumetric and biomass equations were used for biomass computation. We assessed a total of 29,442 trees (top 10) for measuring phytosociological parameters like total tree count, age, height (H), and diameter at breast height (DBH) to quantify the amount of C stored. The total C stock, C sequestration rate, and monetary value were 78.67 (Mg C ha(-1)), 19.05 (Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1)), and 23,101.59 $ year(-1), respectively. Eucalyptus globulus is the most dominant tree species on the campus and topped almost all the quantitative characteristics like total tree count (similar to 40 %), age (25 years), density (D) (55.35 trees ha(-1)), and total C stock (16.06 & PLUSMN; 9.90 Mg C ha(-1)). Tree basal area (BA), D, diversity, and H positively affected the total C stocks. When the C market becomes operational, these C credits can be traded while generating additional income for the university. The results from this study can also help calculate the total C footprint of the campus.

TI  - Genetic structure and demographic history of the endangered tree species Dysoxylum malabaricum (Meliaceae) in Western Ghats, India: implications for conservation in a biodiversity hotspot
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - The impact of fragmentation by human activities on genetic diversity of forest trees is an important concern in forest conservation, especially in tropical forests. Dysoxylum malabaricum (white cedar) is an economically important tree species, endemic to the Western Ghats, India, one of the world's eight most important biodiversity hotspots. As D.malabaricum is under pressure of disturbance and fragmentation together with overharvesting, conservation efforts are required in this species. In this study, range-wide genetic structure of twelve D.malabaricum populations was evaluated to assess the impact of human activities on genetic diversity and infer the species' evolutionary history, using both nuclear and chloroplast (cp) DNA simple sequence repeats (SSR). As genetic diversity and population structure did not differ among seedling, juvenile and adult age classes, reproductive success among the old-growth trees and long distance seed dispersal by hornbills were suggested to contribute to maintain genetic diversity. The fixation index (F-IS) was significantly correlated with latitude, with a higher level of inbreeding in the northern populations, possibly reflecting a more severe ecosystem disturbance in those populations. Both nuclear and cpSSRs revealed northern and southern genetic groups with some discordance of their distributions; however, they did not correlate with any of the two geographic gaps known as genetic barriers to animals. Approximate Bayesian computation-based inference from nuclear SSRs suggested that population divergence occurred before the last glacial maximum. Finally we discussed the implications of these results, in particular the presence of a clear pattern of historical genetic subdivision, on conservation policies.

TI  - Designing protected area networks that translate international conservation commitments into national action
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Most countries have committed to protect 17% of their terrestrial area by 2020 through Aichi Target 11 of the Convention on Biological Diversity, with a focus on protecting areas of particular importance for biodiversity. This means national-scale spatial conservation prioritisations are needed to help meet this target and guide broader conservation and land-use policy development. However, to ensure these assessments are adopted by policy makers, they mist also consider national priorities. This situation is exemplified by Guyana, a corner of Amazonia that couples high biodiversity with low economic development. In recent years activities that threaten biodiversity conservation have increased, and consequently, protected areas are evermore critical to achieving the Aichi targets. Here we undertake a cost-effective approach to protected area planning in Guyana that accounts for in-country conditions. To do this we conducted a stakeholder-led spatial conservation prioritisation based on meeting targets for 17 vegetation types and 329 vertebrate species, while minimising opportunity costs for forestry, mining, agriculture and urbanisation. Our analysis identifies 3 million ha of priority areas for conservation, helping inform government plans to double the current protected area network from 8.5 to 17%. As part of this, we also develop a new technique to prioritise engagement with local communities whose lands are identified as important to conservation. Our study both provides a scientifically robust, politically acceptable protected area expansion strategy for Guyana, and illustrates the importance of conservation planning at the country-scale to translate international commitments into national action.

TI  - Calling for landscape-level assessments of participatory forestry?s role in improving forest biophysical conditions
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Participatory forest management (PFM) has been applied to address declining tropical forest conditions. In the literature, there is a mixed evidence on PFM's role in improving forest conditions. However, most assessments ignore a relationship between household distance from PFM forests and impacts to non-PFM forests albeit being an essential aspect. Some PFM assessments show that distance matters in determining an individual's participation But, sparsely discussing the distance in relation to forest biophysical conditions in a landscape context. Drawing on the landscape approach and insights from Miombo forests of Kilwa in southern Tanzania, we illustrate the importance of studying PFM schemes in a landscape context to illuminate the relationship between household distance from PFM forests and impacts to non-PFM forests. Our study villages have forest abundances in areas between households and PFM forests. The average distance between households and PFM forests is 7.8 km. The long distances and forest abundances produce an 'outbound effect', whereby degrading and deforesting activities shift from PFM to non-PFM forests. Our analysis calls for landscape-level assessments that include forests under different governance regimes even those in unreserved landscapes - non-PFM forests. This is important for two reasons. First, for generating locally grounded contextual insights necessary for developing understandings of global forest conservation efforts from the 'ground up'. Second, for revealing correct forest conditions in the entire landscape critical in the light of ongoing national and international interests to manage trees inside and outside designated forest reserves for both carbon sequestration and landscape restoration.

TI  - Certification of acai agroforestry increases the conservation potential of the Amazonian tree flora
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - The harvesting of acai berries (palm fruits from the genus Euterpe) in Amazonia has increased over the last 20 years due to a high local and global market demand and triggered by their widely acclaimed health benefits as a 'superfood'. Although such increase represents a financial boom for local communities, unregulated extraction in Amazonia risks negative environmental effects including biodiversity loss through acai intensification and deforestation. Alternatively, the introduction of certified sustainable agroforestry production programs of acai has been strategically applied to reduce the exploitation of Amazonian forests. Local acai producers are required to follow principles of defined sustainable management practices, environmental guidelines, and social behaviors, paying specific attention to fair trade and human rights. In this study we investigate whether sustainable agroforestry and certification effectively promotes biodiversity conservation in Amazonia. To address this question, we conducted a forestry inventory in two hectares of long-term certified acai harvesting areas to gain further knowledge on the plant diversity and forest structure in acai managed forests and to understand the contribution of certification towards sustainable forest management. On average, we found that certified managed forests harbor 50% more tree species than non-certified acai groves. Trees in certified areas also have significantly higher mean basal area, meaning larger and hence older individuals are more likely to be protected. Certified harvesting sites also harbor dense populations of threatened species as classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (e.g. Virola surinamensis, classified as 'endangered'). Besides increasing the knowledge of plant diversity in acai managed areas, we present baseline information for monitoring the impact of harvesting activities in natural ecosystems in Amazonia.

TI  - Designing multifunctional landscapes for forest conservation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - A multifunctional landscape approach to forest protection has been advocated for tropical countries. Designing such landscapes necessitates that the role of different land uses in protecting forest be evaluated, along with the spatial interactions between land uses. However, such evaluations have been hindered by a lack of suitable analysis methodologies and data with fine spatial resolution over long time periods. We demonstrate the utility of a matching method with multiple categories to evaluate the role of alternative land uses in protecting forest. We also assessed the impact of land use change trajectories on the rate of deforestation. We employed data from Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) at three different time periods during 2000-2012 to illustrate our approach. Four single land uses (protected areas (PA), natural forest logging concessions (LC), timber plantation concessions (TC) and oil-palm plantation concessions (OC)) and two mixed land uses (mixed concessions and the overlap between concessions and PA) were assessed. The rate of deforestation was found to be lowest for PA, followed by LC. Deforestation rates for all land uses tended to be highest for locations that share the characteristics of areas in which TC or OC are located (e.g. degraded areas), suggesting that these areas are inherently more susceptible to deforestation due to foregone opportunities. Our approach provides important insights into how multifunctional landscapes can be designed to enhance the protection of biodiversity.

TI  - Anthropogenic activities affect forest structure and arthropod abundance in a Kenyan biodiversity hotspot
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Land-use change remains the main threat to tropical forests and their dependent fauna and flora, and degradation of existing forest remnants will further accelerate species loss. Forest degradation may result directly from human forest use or through spatial effects of land-use change. Understanding the drivers of forest degradation and its effects on biodiversity is pivotal for formulating impactful forest management and monitoring protocols, but such knowledge is lacking for many biodiversity hotspots, such as the Taita Hills in southeast Kenya. Here we first quantify effects of social factors (human activity and presence) at plot and landscape level, forest management (gazetted vs. non-gazetted) and spatial factors (fragment size and distance to forest edge) on the vegetation structure of indigenous Taita forest fragments. Next, we quantify effects of degraded vegetation structure on arthropod abundance and diversity. We show that human presence and activity at both the plot and landscape level explain variation in vegetation structure. We particularly provide evidence that despite a national ban on cutting of indigenous trees, poaching of pole-sized trees for subsistence use may be simplifying vegetation structure, with the strongest effects in edge-dominated, small forest fragments. Furthermore, we found support for a positive effect of vegetation structure on arthropod abundance, although the effect of daily maximum temperature and yearly variation was more pronounced. Maintenance of multi-layered forest vegetation in addition to reforestation maybe a key to conservation of the endangered and endemic fauna of the Taita Hills.

TI  - RadWet-L: A Novel Approach for Mapping of Inundation Dynamics of Forested Wetlands Using ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 L-Band Radar Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The ability to accurately map tropical wetland dynamics can significantly contribute to a number of areas, including food and water security, protection and enhancement of ecosystems, flood hazard management, and our understanding of natural greenhouse gas emissions. Yet currently, there is not a tractable solution for mapping tropical forested wetlands at high spatial and temporal resolutions at a regional scale. This means that we lack accurate and up-to-date information about some of the world's most significant wetlands, including the Amazon Basin. RadWet-L is an automated machine-learning classification technique for the mapping of both inundated forests and open water using ALOS ScanSAR data. We applied and validated RadWet-L for the Amazon Basin. The proposed method is computationally light and transferable across the range of landscape types in the Amazon Basin allowing, for the first time, regional inundation maps to be produced every 42 days at 50 m resolution over the period 2019-2023. Time series estimates of inundation extent from RadWet-L were significantly correlated with NASA-GFZ GRACE-FO water thickness (Pearson's r = 0.96, p < 0.01), USDA G-REALM lake hight (Pearson's r between 0.63 and 0.91, p < 0.01), and in situ river stage measurements (Pearson's r between 0.78 and 0.94, p < 0.01). Additionally, we conducted an evaluation of 11,162 points against the input ScanSAR data revealing spatial and temporal consistency in the approach (F1 score = 0.97). Serial classifications of ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 ScanSAR data by RadWet-L can provide unique insights into the spatio-temporal inundation dynamics within the Amazon Basin. Understanding these dynamics can inform policy in the sustainable use of these wetlands, as well as the impacts of inundation dynamics on biodiversity and greenhouse gas budgets.

TI  - No evidence of local deforestation leakage from protected areas establishment in Brazil's Amazon and Atlantic Forest
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Establishing Protected areas (PAs) could displace or cause 'leakage' of deforestation into adjacent areas. Such leakage would potentially offset PAs' conservation effort by jeopardizing forest conservation goals and impeding financial mechanisms such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation -REDD+. Here we investigate forest loss inside PAs' borders and whether leakage occurred following the establishment of new PAs (n = 425) within the Amazon and the Atlantic forests in Brazil between 2004 and 2017. We applied a Before -After-Control-Intervention statistical design with a matching approach to evaluate deforestation leakage from PAs' establishment using a spatial (inside and outside PAs)- temporal (before and after PA establishment) measure of deforestation rates. We also used "Random Forest " to investigate the drivers of the effect of PAs' establishment on their surrounding areas. We found that when PAs' establishment led to reducing deforestation inside their boundaries, their surrounding also experienced a reduction in deforestation ( "blockage "). Similarly, when PAs' establishment could not reduce deforestation inside their boundaries, their surroundings also experienced increased deforestation. Such a pattern was most common for Indigenous territories, especially in the deforestation arch in the Amazon. However, we did not find significant evidence for leakage as PAs' surroundings with a significant increase in deforestation were associated with PAs unable to significantly reduce deforestation within their boundaries. Therefore, "leakage " should not limit the establishment of new PAs. Instead, greater investments into reinforcement are needed for existing PAs, with high priority given to Indigenous Territories.

TI  - BIOECONOMY based on non-timber forest products for development and forest conservation - untapped potential or false hope? A systematic review for the BRAZILIAN amazon
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - The continuing destruction of the Amazonian forest, the largest remaining tropical forest ecosystem, has massive social and environmental consequences for local populations, but also for the climate, global food security and biodiversity. With some 20% of the forest already lost and the Amazon region likely approaching a tipping point, the conservation of its forests is a burning issue. High expectations are vested in the sustainable use of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) as a means to reconcile conservation and development. Accordingly, hundreds of initiatives have been launched over the decades that rely on NTFPs. With the proliferation of the bioeconomy discourse in recent years, they have received a new impetus. But are these expectations justified and backed-up by facts? Based on a systematic literature review, this article assesses the state of knowledge on NTFPs as a basis for sustainable local development in the Brazilian Amazon. The analysis reveals that while the number of studies has been growing continuously, the knowledge base is rather patchy. Coverage is limited mostly to a few NTFPs with high commercial value. The literature mostly attests positive effects of NTFP use on forest conservation and contributions to meeting socio-cultural needs of local communities. By contrast, existing studies identify limitations in terms of local income generation and suggest to combine the use of NTFPs with the commercial management for timber and the sale of environmental services. In terms of biodiversity conservation, some studies also point to risks of initiatives that emphasize income generation and stress the importance of diversifying production. It is worrying, that empirical knowledge on the effects of such combined and diversified approaches is scarce. A research agenda is crucial to support the successful promotion of NTFP-based value chains in the Brazilian Amazon. This agenda should include a comprehensive analytical framework that enables robust evaluations of past and future interventions. A better understanding of the actual impacts of such initiatives is vital as evidence for proof of concept and for deploying them at scale.

TI  - Litter and soil arthropod colonization in reforested semi-deciduous seasonal Atlantic forests
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - The recovery of soil ecological processes during the restoration of tropical forests is greatly influenced by arthropods that live in the litter and soil. However, these communities present complex dynamics, and their colonization patterns are not well understood. In this study, we examined the response patterns of litter and soil arthropods to the ecosystem regeneration process by assessing reforestation sites from two regions of Sao Paulo State, Brazil, and we compared the data obtained from these sites with data from mature forests. We assessed the arthropod communities using similarity indices and high-level taxa abundance, with the level of forest succession and the locations of the restoration areas as factors. Forest succession correlated with the species composition as communities from the reforestation sites gradually became more similar to communities from the mature forests, while their quantitative patterns were minimally related. Forest maturation positively affected the richness of the litter community and the abundance of some minor groups, such as Protura, Diplura, and Symphyla. The region influenced the species composition but did not influence the manner in which the communities changed during the maturation process. We also found a convergent soil colonization pattern as arthropod communities from different sites became more similar during forest succession. This finding is consistent with both empirical data and theoretical predictions from the specialized literature, although the subject has been poorly explored until now. We conclude that reforestation allows the colonization of soil and litter fauna in a biased manner.

TI  - Post-logging effects on nest predation and avian predator assemblages in a subtropical forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Logging represents one of the main threats to bird populations breeding in subtropical forests because the resulting changes in forest structure influence nesting sites and predator-prey interactions. Nest site selection in birds is critical to their survival and reproductive success, because site characteristics can affect predation rates. The aim of this study is to evaluate the abundance of avian nest predators and the rate of predation on artificial nests in post-logging piedmont forests from the southern Yungas. Predation rate on artificial nests was lower in logged forest when compared to unlogged forest. This result may not only be explained by the influence of both micro- and meso-site which provided greater nest concealment, but also by the decrease in density of generalist predators at logged sites. As generalist predators were associated with vegetation cover, lower coverage may be affecting predator density at logging forests. The density of nestling predators, however, was higher in logging forests and was associated with this treatment. Our study suggests that post-logging effects changes the nesting sites and reduce the predation rate on artificial nests as well as the density of nest avian predators like Plushcrested Jay (Cyanocorax chrysops).

TI  - A critical review of exploring the recent trends and technological advancements in forest biomass estimation
T2  - PLANT SCIENCE TODAY
AB  - Biomass estimation is pivotal in understanding and managing global carbon stocks, offering vital insights into climate change and environmental ecology. It serves as a critical tool for evaluating carbon sequestration potential, a natural mechanism for regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Accurate estimation of forest biomass not only aids in quantifying carbon stocks but also provides a basis for sustainable forest management, conservation efforts, and policymaking to mitigate climate change impacts. This article provides a comprehensive review of various biomass estimation methods, including ground-based measurements, remote sensing technologies, and hybrid approaches. Each method's strengths, limitations, and practical applications are critically examined, highlighting their suitability for different spatial scales and ecological contexts. Traditional methods, while precise at small scales, are often labour-intensive and limited in coverage. In contrast, remote sensing technologies such as LiDAR, RADAR, and hyperspectral imaging have revolutionized biomass estimation by enabling large-scale and high-resolution assessments. Additionally, recent advancements in machine learning, data fusion, and satellite-based monitoring systems are transforming the field, offering unprecedented accuracy and efficiency. By presenting these trends and innovations, this article provides valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, emphasizing the importance of integrating advanced technologies into biomass estimation for sustainable development and climate resilience.

TI  - Assessing the Economic Contribution of Forest Use to Rural Livelihoods in the Rubi-Tele Hunting Domain, DR Congo
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Forest utilization makes a significant economic contribution to the livelihoods of rural households, especially those living in developing countries. This study was conducted to determine the absolute and relative forest income and measure the distributional impact of forest income on economic inequalities among rural households in the Rubi-Tele Hunting Domain (RTHD), Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). Household socioeconomic data and other qualitative informations were collected using structured household-level surveys, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. The study used descriptive statistical analysis, Gini coefficient, and Lorenz curve computation. Additionally, the non-parametric alternative Kruskal-Wallis Test was also used. Findings revealed that 89.76% of the households' sample were involved in forest-based activities. The annual average income from these forest-based activities was estimated at CDF 1,219,951.58 (USD 659.08) per household, contributing 32.46% to total annual household income. Other income sources share constituted 37.09%, 10.04%, 8.30%, 7.63%, 2.41%, and 2.08% from crop, livestock keeping, business activities, fishing, and non-forest environmental activities, paid employment, and other income sources, respectively. There was a significant difference between annual household income in terms of income sources (p < 0.5). Forest income constituted the second most crucial income portfolio after crop income. Bushmeat income share was higher than other forest products income share. However, the proportion of households involved in firewood extraction was substantial (80.70%). Gini coefficient and Lorenz curve analysis proved that forest income helped reduce economic inequality among the sampled households by 11%. Therefore, reducing access to forest would significantly impact rural households' welfare and could increase income disparities. The present study provides valuable information for developing sustainable forest management policies and strategies to maintain and enhance the economic benefit of forest use without damaging biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Diversity and abundance of arbuscular-mycorrhizal fungus spores in tropical forest and pasture
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - As Neotropical forests are increasingly converted to agriculture (especially pastures), little is known about the impacts on microbial biodiversity. To assess such impacts, I compared spore abundance and diversity of arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF) in soils from lowland evergreen forests and pastures in Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Species composition, dominance-diversity curves, and Simpson's diversity indices were similar for both forest and pasture soils. Of 28 distinct fungus morphospecies, 11 produced more spores in pasture, while only 1 produced more spores in forest. According to species-accumulation curves, local AMF species richness did not significantly decline following conversion of forest to pasture. Because pastures contained a surprising abundance and diversity of AMF spores compared to native forest, a lack of mycorrhizal fungi is unlikely to limit plant succession, restoration, or reforestation in the pastures studied. At the regional scale, however, species-accumulation curves showed significantly greater gamma (G) diversity of spores in forest. In addition to these trends in diversity, species that sporulated more in pasture tended to have small spores, while the one species that sporulated more in forest had the largest spores. Similarly, only large-spored fungi (>300 mum) showed any seasonal variation in spore abundance, being more common in the wet season.

TI  - Carbon, Fossil Fuel, and Biodiversity Mitigation With Wood and Forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
AB  - Life-cycle analyses, energy analyses, and a range of utilization efficiencies were developed to determine the carbon dioxide (CO2) and fossil fuel (FF) saved by various solid wood products, wood energy, and unharvested forests. Some products proved very efficient in CO2 and FF savings, while others did not. Not considering forest regrowth after harvest or burning if not harvested, efficient products save much more CO2 than the standing forest; but wood used only for energy generally saves slightly less. Avoided emissions (using wood in place of steel and concrete) contributes the most to CO2 and FF savings compared to the product and wood energy contributions. Burning parts of the harvested logs that are not used for products creates an additional CO2 and FF savings. Using wood substitutes could save 14 to 31% of global CO2 emissions and 12 to 19% of global FF consumption by using 34 to 100% of the world's sustainable wood growth. Maximizing forest CO2 sequestration may not be compatible with biodiversity. More CO2 can be sequestered synergistically in the products or wood energy and landscape together than in the unharvested landscape. Harvesting sustainably at an optimum stand age will sequester more carbon in the combined products, wood energy, and forest than harvesting sustainably at other ages.

TI  - Tropical Rainforest and Human-Modified Landscapes Support Unique Butterfly Communities That Differ in Abundance and Diversity
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Tropical forests account for at least 50% of documented diversity, but anthropogenic activities are converting forests to agriculture and urban areas at an alarming rate, with potentially strong effects on insect abundance and diversity. However, the questions remain whether insect populations are uniformly affected by land conversion and if insect conservation can occur in agricultural margins and urban gardens. We compare butterfly populations in tropical secondary forests to those found in sugarcane and urban areas in coastal Guyana and evaluate the potential for particular butterfly communities to inhabit human-modified landscapes. Butterflies were sampled for 1 yr using fruit-baited traps in three separated geographical locations on the coast. We used nonmetric multidimensional scaling to assess differences in species assemblages and a generalized linear mixed model to evaluate abundance, species richness, evenness, and diversity. The secondary forests in all three locations supported higher butterfly abundance and diversity than other human-modified areas, although the magnitude of this effect varied by season and location. However, each land use supported its own type of butterfly community, as species composition was different across the three land uses. Sugarcane field margins and urban gardens supported populations of butterflies rarely found in our tropical secondary forest sites. Land management practices that encourage forest conservation along with butterfly-friendly activities in human settlements and agricultural areas could improve butterfly conservation. To this end, butterfly conservation in Guyana and other tropical landscapes would benefit from a shift from inadvertently to actively making the landscape attractive for butterflies.

TI  - Cryptogamic epiphytes as indicators of successional changes in megadiverse lowland rain forests of western Amazonia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - The Amazonian rain forests of Yasuni National Park, Ecuador (YNP), count among the world's forests regions with highest biodiversity, but are strongly threatened by deforestation. Cryptogams (bryophytes and lichens) are common and characteristic organisms in these forests, are sensitive to environmental changes, and are considered effective ecological indicators. The objective of this study was to explore the response of epiphytic cryptogams to forest succession in the Amazonian forests of YNP. We hypothesized that alteration of structural and micro-environmental characteristics of the forest, including reduction of canopy cover and lowering of tree species richness, lead to a reduction of species richness and changes in species composition of epiphytic cryptogams. We assessed species richness and composition of cryptogams on the bases of 442 trees in three stage of forest succession (early, intermediate, late), using generalized linear mixed models, multivariate analysis, beta diversity components and Mantel test. We registered 146 species of cryptogams, including 50 of lichens and 96 of bryophytes (39 mosses, 57 liverworts). Diversity of epiphytic cryptogams was highest in late succession forest, and lowest in early succession forest. Major changes in species richness and composition correlated with changes in canopy openness relative to the shift from early to late stages of forest succession. The results demonstrate for the first time the importance of tree species richness for cryptogamic epiphyte richness in Amazonian rain forests. Maintenance of high tree species diversity and structural heterogeneity in late succession forests can considerably contribute to the conservation of the cryptogamic epiphytes of Amazonian rain forests.

TI  - Social network ties predict land use diversity and land use change: a case study in Ghana
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB  - While it is well documented that informal social ties play a role in information exchange on land management practices, the structural features of such networks that govern individual choice on land use change remain elusive. This study aims to correlate information network structures with localized or "micro-level" land use diversification and land use change. We ask the following: (i) what is the network structure of producers who manage diverse land use types? and (ii) are network topologies and the emergence of new network ties related to land use change? This work draws on a longitudinal study with producers in the transition zone of Ghana. We use social network analysis to assess the social relationships of 40 focal producers embedded in networks of 116 producers, combined with field observation to chart land use types and size. Land use ordered across eight types, from forest and agroforests to crops and grasslands. Converting land to crop production was correlated to the addition of ties in a focal producer's network, while the diversity of land use types was correlated to the number of institutional ties as well as gender of the focal producer. We illustrate that local networks relate to land use change whereas external ties drive the introduction of new land use types. Given that the diversity of land use types may be a signature of livelihood resilience, the promotion of external, bridging ties can contribute to an increase in land use diversification. However, a strong local network is needed to implement this change.

TI  - Can local use assist in controlling invasive alien species in tropical forests? The case of Lantana camara in southern India
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Many invasive alien species (IAS) are used by local communities for a variety of subsistence and income generating purposes. This frequently poses a conflict of interest for their removal due to forest conservation and biodiversity concerns. However, if local use can simultaneously check or control specific IAS, the conflict can be avoided and both development and forest conservation perspectives accommodated in the short to medium term. We examine this for Lantana camara invasion in southern India through assessment of the demand for and impacts of harvesting on this globally problematic IAS. We interviewed local artisans regarding their knowledge and quantities of Lantana used, along with forest surveys to estimate Lantana densities and size classes in harvested and unharvested sites, and lastly we undertook controlled cutting in moist and dry deciduous forests in both the wet and dry seasons to examine rate of regrowth and mortality. Over the entire study area the abundance of Lantana far outweighed local demand, but at small scales around villages, density and size classes were significantly reduced through harvesting. The controlled cutting experiment showed marked seasonal differences, with the most severe cutting intensity resulting in significant mortality when Lantana plants were cut in the wet season, but with limited effect when cut in the dry season. We conclude that promoting local use of IAS may be a feasible approach in controlling them and thereby limiting their impacts in forests. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Recovery of soil macrofauna communities after forest clearance in Eastern Amazonia, Brazil
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - As primary forest is cleared, pastures and secondary forest occupy an increasing space in the Amazonian landscape. We evaluated the effect of forest clearing on a soil macrofauna (invertebrate) community in a smallbolder farming system of southeastern Amazonia. We sampled the soil macrofauna in 22 plots of forest, upland rice fields, pastures, and fallows of different ages. In total, we collected 10, 728 invertebrates. In cleared plots the species richness per plot of the soil macrofauna fell from 76 to 30 species per plot immediately after forest clearance, and the composition of the new community was different. Ants, termites, and spiders were most affected by the disturbance. In plots deforested several years before, the effect of forest clearance was highly dependent on the type of land use (pasture or fallow). In fallows, the community was similar to the initial state. The species richness per plot in old fallows rose to 66, and the composition was closer to the primary forests than to the other types of land use. On the contrary, in the pastures the species richness per plot remained low at 47. In fallows, all the groups showed a richness close to that in primary forest, whereas in the forest only the richness of earthworms and Coleoptera recovered. Our results show that forest clearing constitutes a major disturbance for the soil macrofauna and that the recovery potential of the soil macrofauna after 6 or 7 years is much higher in fallows than in pastures. Thus, fallows may play a crucial role in the conservation of soil macrofauna.

TI  - Combining behavioural and LiDAR data to reveal relationships between canopy structure and orangutan nest site selection in disturbed forests
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Primary tropical forests are becoming increasingly disturbed and fragmented, making it critically important to understand the conservation value of degraded forests. Many populations of even the largest and most iconic species are now found outside of primary habitats, and the long-term survival of these and many other species depends on appropriate management of degraded areas, whether protected or not. However, for conservation in degraded habitats to be successful, an adequate understanding of the minimal ecological requirements necessary for species persistence within them is required. We combined ground and helicopter nest surveys of critically endangered Bornean orangutans with high-resolution measurements of forest canopy structure from airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to understand orangutan nest site selection across multiple spatial scales in degraded forests of the Lower Kinabatangan region, Malaysian Borneo. We found orangutans to be selective when choosing nest sites, with nests more likely to be observed in canopies of tall and uniform height and closer to full canopy gaps, which was consistent across spatial scales and orangutan age and sex classes. These sites likely offer orangutans an improved vantage point and/or shelter from wind and rain. In contrast, no discernible relationships between nest site selection and canopy complexity, or nest abundance and landscape forest structure or aboveground carbon density were recorded. Our findings suggest that although orangutans do nest across a range of forest conditions, their optimum requirement for nesting strongly depends on forest patches with sufficient tall canopy of uniform height. These results serve to inform degraded forest conservation strategies across Borneo, particularly where orangutans are a focal species.

TI  - Management of Protected Areas and Its Effect on an Ecosystem Function: Removal of Prosopis flexuosa Seeds by Mammals in Argentinian Drylands
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The ecological function of animal seed dispersal depends on species interactions and can be affected by drivers such as the management interventions applied to protected areas. This study was conducted in two protected areas in the Monte Desert: a fenced reserve with grazing exclusion and absence of large native mammals (the Man and Biosphere Nacunan Reserve; FR) and an unfenced reserve with low densities of large native and domestic animals (Ischigualasto Park; UFR). The study focuses on Prosopis flexuosa seed removal by different functional mammal groups: "seed predators", "scatter-hoarders", and "opportunistic frugivores". Under both interventions, the relative contribution to seed removal by different functional mammal groups was assessed, as well as how these groups respond to habitat heterogeneity (i.e. vegetation structure) at different spatial scales. Camera traps were used to identify mammal species removing P. flexuosa seeds and to quantify seed removal; remote sensing data helped analyze habitat heterogeneity. In the FR, the major fruit removers were a seed predator (Graomys griseoflavus) and a scatter-hoarder (Microcavia asutralis). In the UFR, the main seed removers were the opportunistic frugivores (Lycalopex griseus and Dolichotis patagonum), who removed more seeds than the seed predator in the FR. The FR shows higher habitat homogeneity than the UFR, and functional groups respond differently to habitat heterogeneity at different spatial scales. In the FR, because large herbivores are locally extinct (e.g. Lama guanicoe) and domestic herbivores are excluded, important functions of large herbivores are missing, such as the maintenance of habitat heterogeneity, which provides habitats for medium-sized opportunistic frugivores with consequent improvement of quality and quantity of seed dispersal services. In the UFR, with low densities of large herbivores, probably one important ecosystem function this group performs is to increase habitat heterogeneity, allowing for the activity of medium-sized mammals who, behaving as opportunistic frugivores, did the most significant seed removal.

TI  - Impact of land-use zoning for forest protection and production on forest cover changes in Bhutan
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - Bhutan is characterized by a landscape dominated by forests. A substantial share of these forests is dedicated to nature conservation, with an extensive protected area network connected by biological corridors. Forestlands are also partly allocated to timber production, including forest management units subjected to strict regulations. We assessed the effectiveness of these various land-use zoning units to protect forest cover. We used a matching procedure to control for covariates and obtain robust estimates of the impact of each type of unit on forest cover changes during the 2000s. We also investigated subsets of the protected area network to test for effectiveness heterogeneities within this network. Our results showed that protected areas prevented 63% of the forest loss expected in forestlands under this protection status. These units also curtailed forest gain. Long-established protected areas were more effective at avoiding forest loss than recent ones, while the levels of stringency and operationality of protected areas had no differentiable impact on forest loss. We detected more forest loss in forests surrounding protected areas compared to more distant forestlands, showing a leakage effect. Biological corridors had no impact on forest loss and gain. Forest management units decreased forest loss by half. After accounting for the selection bias, this study demonstrated the effectiveness of land use zoning for forest conservation in Bhutan.

TI  - Nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment accelerates soil organic carbon loss in alpine grassland on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Anthropogenic activities have substantially increased soil nutrient availability, which in turn affects ecosystem processes and functions, especially in nutrient-limited ecosystems such as alpine grasslands. Although considerable efforts have been devoted to understanding the responses of plant productivity and community composition to nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) enrichment, the nutrient enrichment effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) and microbial functions are not well understood. A four-year field experiment was established to evaluate the influence of continuous N and P enrichment on plant growth and SOC content in an alpine grassland of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The study included four treatments: Control without addition, N addition, P addition, and N plus P addition. N addition strongly increased aboveground plant biomass and decreased species richness by promoting growth of the dominant grasses species. In contrast, N and P enrichment significantly decreased SOC, especially the recalcitrant organic C content in the surface layer (0-10 cm) by reducing the slow C pool and enlarging the active C pool. Microbial biomass and activities of C-degrading enzymes (beta-glucosidase, cellulase and polyphenol oxidase) and an N-degrading enzyme (chitinase) increased with nutrient inputs. The CO2 emissions during a 300 d incubation period were positively correlated with the cellulase and chitinase activities, while the slow C pool was negatively correlated with the cellulase and polyphenol oxidase activities. Consequently, N and P enrichment accelerated decomposition of the recalcitrant C by stimulating microbial growth and increasing enzyme activities, leading to negative impacts on soil C sequestration. Overall, the results indicate that alpine grassland soils of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau may be changing from a C sink to a C source under increasing N and P availability, and improvement of alpine grassland management through nutrient inputs should consider not only the aboveground biomass for grazing, but also the soil C sequestration and ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Shade tree diversity, carbon sequestration, and epiphyte presence in coffee agroecosystems: A decade of smallholder management in San Ramon, Nicaragua
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Coffee smallholder management practices have received attention for their potential to conserve biodiversity and sequester carbon by maintaining structural complexity, high canopy diversity, and minimal external inputs. We conducted shade tree surveys on 95 1000 m(2) research plots over a 10-year period to identify patterns of shade tree density and diversity, epiphyte presence, and carbon stocks within smallholder shade coffee systems of northern Nicaragua. We also analyzed each of these parameters with respect to management by comparing collectively-and individually-managed farms. Our results indicate that the overall shade tree density has decreased over time (F = 42.597, p < 0.001), but that diversity remained constant. Carbon stocks in coffee systems also showed a decreasing trend over time (F = 2.981, p = 0.056), most likely due to the decreasing tree densities. Epiphytic plant presence increased over time despite decreased host tree densities, suggesting either a change in management or improved habitat conditions for epiphytes. Research plots on individually-managed coffee farms generally had higher shade tree densities than those on collectively managed farms (t = 2.141, p = 0.037), but we found no differences in shade tree species richness or carbon stocks (t = 0.573, p = 0.568). We conclude that smallholder coffee farmers continue to conserve both shade tree diversity and epiphyte communities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Remote Sensing Approach to Understanding Patterns of Secondary Succession in Tropical Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Monitoring biodiversity on a global scale is a major challenge for biodiversity conservation. Field assessments commonly used to assess patterns of biodiversity and habitat condition are costly, challenging, and restricted to small spatial scales. As ecosystems face increasing anthropogenic pressures, it is important that we find ways to assess patterns of biodiversity more efficiently. Remote sensing has the potential to support understanding of landscape-level ecological processes. In this study, we considered cacao agroforests at different stages of secondary succession, and primary forest in the Northern Range of Trinidad, West Indies. We assessed changes in tree biodiversity over succession using both field data, and data derived from remote sensing. We then evaluated the strengths and limitations of each method, exploring the potential for expanding field data by using remote sensing techniques to investigate landscape-level patterns of forest condition and regeneration. Remote sensing and field data provided different insights into tree species compositional changes, and patterns of alpha- and beta-diversity. The results highlight the potential of remote sensing for detecting patterns of compositional change in forests, and for expanding on field data in order to better understand landscape-level patterns of forest diversity.

TI  - Evaluation of Forest Recovery over Time and Space Using Permanent Plots Monitored over 30 Years in a Jamaican Montane Rain Forest
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Conservation of tropical forest biodiversity increasingly depends on its recovery following severe human disturbance. Our ability to measure recovery using current similarity indices suffers from two limitations: different sized individuals are treated as equal, and the indices are proportionate (a community with twice the individuals of every species as compared with the reference community would be assessed as identical). We define an alternative recovery index for trees - the Tanner index, as the mean of the quantitative Bray-Curtis similarity indices of species composition for stem density and for basal area. We used the new index to compare the original (pre-gap) and post-gap composition of five experimental gap plots (each 90-100 m(2)) and four control plots over 24-35 years in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica. After 24-35 years, these small gaps surrounded by undisturbed forest had recovered 68% of the sum of per species stem density and 29% of the sum of per species basal area, a recovery index of 47%. Four endemic species were especially reduced in density and basal area. With the incorporation of basal area and stem density, our index reduces over-estimations of forest recovery obtained using existing similarity indices (by 24%-41%), and thus yields more accurate estimates of forest conservation status. Finally, our study indicates that the two kinds of comparisons: 1) over time between pre-gap and post-gap composition and 2) over space between gap plots and spatial controls (space-for-time substitution) yield broadly similar results, which supports the value of using space-for-time substitutions in studying forest recovery, at least in this tropical montane forest.

TI  - Forest law enforcement in the Brazilian Amazon: Costs and income effects
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - Despite recent success in reducing forest loss in the Brazilian Amazon, additional forest conservation efforts, for example, through 'Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation' (REDD+), could significantly contribute to global climate-change mitigation. Economic incentives, such as payments for environmental services could promote conservation, but deforestation often occurs on land without crucial tenure-security prerequisites. Improving the enforcement of existing regulatory disincentives thus represents an important element of Brazil's anti-deforestation action plan. However, conservation law enforcement costs and benefits have been much less studied than for conditional payments. We develop a conceptual framework and a spatially explicit model to analyze field-based regulatory enforcement in the Brazilian Amazon. We validate our model, based on historical deforestation and enforcement mission data from 2003 to 2008. By simulating the current conservation law enforcement practice, we analyze the costs of liability establishment and legal coercion for alternative conservation targets, and evaluate corresponding income impacts. Our findings suggest that spatial patterns of both deforestation and inspection costs markedly influence enforcement patterns and their income effects. Field-based enforcement is a highly cost-effective forest conservation instrument from a regulator's point of view, but comes at high opportunity costs for land users. Payments for environmental services could compensate costs, but will increase budget outlays vis-A-vis a command-and-control dominated strategy. Both legal and institutional challenges have to be overcome to make conservation payments work at a larger scale. Decision-makers may have to innovatively combine incentive and disincentive-based policy instruments in order to make tropical forest conservation both financially viable and socially compatible.

TI  - Epiphytic bromeliads as key components for maintenance of ant diversity and ant-bromeliad interactions in agroforestry system canopies
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Cocoa is produced in a wide range of land use systems, with the traditional shaded systems in Bahia (Brazil) as the most forest-like and biodiverse. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of different cocoa agroforestry systems (AFSs) in maintaining community structure and interactions between ants and epiphytic bromeliads. The study was conducted at four sites in the cocoa producing region of the southeastern of the state of Bahia, Brazil, and comprised a native forest and three different cocoa AFSs. We found a total of 103 ant species associated with epiphytic bromeliads, with 83% of the species occurring in native forest canopy bromeliads also occurring in cocoa AFSs. The Cocoa Cabruca System (CAB) and the Rustic-Planted Shade System (RPS) had ant community structural components of biodiversity similar to those found in the native forest environment. The alpha and gamma diversity of ants found in Monospecific-Shaded Cocoa Agroforestry System (MCA) associated with Erythrina spp. shade trees were significantly different from the diversity found in the other AFSs and native forest. The presence of epiphytic bromeliads, regardless of the system and scale, maintained ant diversity in agroforestry system canopies similar to that of native forest. Using metrics derived from graph theory, we found a high level of specialization regarding ant-bromeliad interactions in native West, with a gradual decrease in specialization with environmental homogenization. Agroforestry systems thus represent an important strategy for maintaining the structure of canopy-associated ant communities by enabling the establishment of numerous bromeliad species, thus contributing to the maintenance of ant diversity and services in a mosaic landscape AFSs and native forest.

TI  - The responses of leaf litter ant communities to wildfires in the Brazilian Amazon: a multi-region assessment
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Fire is frequently used as tool for land management in the Amazon, but often escapes into surrounding forests, with potentially severe impacts for forest biodiversity. We investigated the effects of single wildfires on ant communities in four geographically distinct regions of the Brazilian Amazon (Roraima, Para, Acre and Mato Grosso) where forests had burned between 8 months and 10 years before our sampling. We established 7-12 transects, 500 m each, in burned and unburned forests in each region to investigate the effects of fire on forest structure and leaf litter ant communities, which were sampled using Winkler sacks. Fire effects on forest structure were more drastic in the most recently burned forests in Acre and Mato Grosso, while the impacts of older burns in Roraima and Para were more subtle. Ant species richness was not different between burnt and unburned areas, but community composition differed between burned and control forests in all regions except Mato Grosso. At the species level, indicator species analysis showed that a limited number of species were significant indicators of unburned control forests in all regions, except Acre. Forests structure variables and leaf litter volume were all important in shaping ant communities, but their relative importance varied between regions. Our results indicate that burned forest have different ant species communities from unburned forests, and those differences are still apparent 10 years after the disturbance, highlighting the importance of effective policies for fire management in Amazon.

TI  - Crossing the threshold: Invasive grasses inhibit forest restoration on Hawaiian islands
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Forest removal for livestock grazing is a striking example of human-caused state change leading to a stable, undesirable invasive grass system that is resistant to restoration efforts. Understanding which factors lead to resilience to the alternative grass state can greatly benefit managers when planning forest restoration. We address how thresholds of grass cover and seed rain might influence forest recovery in a restoration project on HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai Island, USA. Since the 1980s, over 400,000 Acacia koa (koa) trees have been planted across degraded pasture, and invasive grasses still dominate the understory with no native woody-plant recruitment. Between this koa/grass matrix are remnant native Metrosideros polymorpha ('ohi'a) trees beneath which native woody plants naturally recruit. We tested whether there were threshold levels of native woody understory that accelerate recruitment under both tree species by monitoring seed rain at 40 trees (20 koa and 'ohi'a) with a range of native woody understory basal area (BA). We found a positive relationship between total seed rain (but not bird-dispersed seed rain) and native woody BA and a negative relationship between native woody BA and grass cover, with no indication of threshold dynamics. We also experimentally combined grass removal levels with seed rain density (six levels) of two common understory species in plots under koa (n = 9) and remnant 'ohi'a (n = 9). Few seedlings emerged when no grass was removed despite adding seeds at densities two to 75 times higher than naturally occurring. However, seedling recruitment increased two to three times once at least 50% of grass was removed. Existing survey data of naturally occurring seedlings also supported a threshold of grass cover below which seedlings were able to establish. Thus, removal of all grasses is not necessary to achieve system responses: Even moderate reductions (similar to 50%) can increase rates of native woody recruitment. The nonlinear thresholds found here highlight how incremental changes to an inhibitory factor lead to limited restoration success until a threshold is crossed. The resources needed to fully eradicate an invasive species may be unwarranted for state change, making understanding where thresholds lie of the utmost importance to prioritize resources.

TI  - Trajectories of cocoa agroforests and their drivers over time: Lessons from the Cameroonian experience
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
AB  - Since its origins, cocoa growing has gone through a series of crises and booms, with a shift in production areas at the expense of tropical forests. Nowadays, the recent sharp rise in the global demand for cocoa more than ever calls into question the future of these forest resources. Nevertheless, in contrast with the dominant technical models, often unsustainable, part of global cocoa growing is based on complex agroforestry systems which are, in many cases, very old and still managed by farmers. To better understand the genesis and the functioning of these systems over time, we analysed the evolution of 30 cocoa agroforests, most of which were several decades old, located in central Cameroon. In this region, cocoa growing has been developing since the 1930s and experienced major changes in contexts, including the severe crisis of the 1990s. By combining field observations and historical survey data, we reconstructed the impacts of these changes over time on management practices, agroforestry structures and cocoa yields. We formalized five cocoa agroforests trajectories closely linked to main phases of cocoa growing in central Cameroon, each phase leading to changes in farmers' practices. These trajectories explain the current agroforests structures, with low (1180 in. ha(-1)) or high cocoa tree densities (2190 in. ha(-1)), mean basal area per cocoa tree which ranged from 29.4 cm(2) to 92.7 cm(2), and finally cocoa yields which varied from 542.7 to 1275.7 kg ha(-1). Our results show how the management of interacting species allows a system balance that can be temporarily broken or redesigned, suggesting the resilient and flexible nature of these complex cocoa agroforests. The properties of these cocoa agroforests gradually built over time enable adaptations and their transmission during difficult times. To cope with current challenges facing global cocoa production, we recommend that these cocoa agroforests serve as a basis to promote new cocoa cropping models to better reconcile cocoa production and the preservation of forest resources.

TI  - Evaluating extinction debt in fragmented forests: the rapid recovery of a critically endangered primate
T2  - ANIMAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Fragmented tropical forests can be highly dynamic, with the spatial configuration of forest patches changing through time. Yet, the lack of longitudinal studies limits our understanding of how patch dynamics affect biodiversity, especially when there is a time lag in species extinctions (extinction debt). We assessed how temporal changes in patch size, shape complexity and isolation affect populations of the Mexican howler monkey (Alouatta palliata mexicana), hypothesizing that we would find an extinction debt in this relatively long-lived species. We assessed patch occupancy, subpopulation size and immature-to-female ratio in 39 forest patches from Los Tuxtlas, Mexico, in both 2001 and 2013. To identify time-lag responses to habitat disturbance, we related demographic attributes in 2013 to patch metrics in 2001 and 2013 and tested whether primate subpopulations were better predicted by current or historical patch characteristics. We also assessed how changes in patch metrics affected each demographic attribute between 2001 and 2013. Patch size and shape complexity increased over time, whereas isolation decreased. These positive spatial changes were accompanied by a 1.6-fold increase in mean subpopulation size over the same period. In addition, occupancy and immature-to-female ratio were similarly related to patch attributes in both years, suggesting that there is no extinction debt. Our findings are 'good news', suggesting that forest recovery over a relatively short period can promote the recovery of this Critically Endangered taxon. They also highlight the importance of preventing forest loss and promoting forest regeneration in human-modified tropical landscapes.

TI  - Ecohydrological impacts of oil palm expansion: a systematic review
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Global demand for vegetable oil and high oil palm yield have driven the rapid expansion of oil palm plantations in tropical countries. The research literature widely recognizes the effects of forest cover conversion into oil palm on biodiversity, deforestation, and carbon dynamics. However, research on the ecohydrological impacts of oil palm plantations is sparse, despite studies indicating that oil palm development may reshape land-water interactions and the availability and movement of water at different spatial and temporal scales. We address this gap by conducting a systematic literature review on oil palm development and its relation to ecohydrological processes. We found 139 relevant papers up to the year 2021, addressing different ecohydrological processes related to oil palm. We reviewed their spatiotemporal scales, geographic distribution, oil palm species and age, and the effects of land conversion from forest, cropland, and pastures. We also incorporated societal aspects regarding community perceptions of water. Our review highlights the effects of oil palm plantations on three main components of the water cycle: (i) land-atmosphere, (ii) fluvial systems, and (iii) soils and groundwater. Most studies include analyses of the Indo-Malayan and Australasian biogeographical regions (113), followed by the Neotropics (49) and the Afrotropics (15). Compared to rainforests, oil palm monocultures are warmer and drier. They have higher evapotranspiration (ET) rates, lower runoff regulation and infiltration capacity, and lower soil organic carbon (SOC). Although less often implemented, alternative oil palm management practices, including oil palm agroforestry, can help to mitigate some of these effects. Forest to oil palm conversion is the most studied land transition, while conversions from croplands, pastures, and grasslands are less studied. Overall, we identify gaps in understanding the long-term effects of management on ecohydrological processes under different land conversions, especially in the Neotropics and the Afrotropics, precluding research-informed policy to manage impacts of this expanding crop.

TI  - Forest Policy Innovation at the Subnational Scale: Insights from Acre, Brazil
T2  - CONSERVATION & SOCIETY
AB  - REDD+ is often characterised as a 'global' environmental framework implemented in tropical forests around the world. Yet studying actual cases of REDD+ can reveal complex interactions between scales, including under-recognised innovations at subnational and local scales. To understand these dynamics, this article brings together academics and policymakers to analyse the System of Incentives for Environmental Services (SISA)-a pioneering subnational policy in the Amazonian state of Acre, Brazil that includes a prominent jurisdictional REDD+ programme. While institutions, people, and ideas from outside of Acre contributed to its formulation, SISA is not a standardised local expression of a global policy. Rather, key aspects of it originated in ongoing and historical Acrean forest-use and governance. This analysis shows how innovative, place-based conservation policy can be influential, both within and beyond specific localities, in ways that challenge analyses of REDD+ that are primarily top-down. Our study of SISA also shows how topics of importance in contemporary REDD+ and forest conservation scholarship-efforts to make the living forest valuable, non-carbon social and environmental "co-benefits," and landscape- and jurisdiction-wide approaches to combating deforestation-are connected to Acrean forest governance and history. Overall, this analysis elucidates the strengths and challenges of subnational forest governance and the complex inter-scalar dynamics in REDD+ and other conservation and climate policies.

TI  - Forest Conservation with Deep Learning: A Deeper Understanding of Human Geography around the Betampona Nature Reserve, Madagascar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Documenting the impacts of climate change and human activities on tropical rainforests is imperative for protecting tropical biodiversity and for better implementation of REDD+ and UN Sustainable Development Goals. Recent advances in very high-resolution satellite sensor systems (i.e., WorldView-3), computing power, and machine learning (ML) have provided improved mapping of fine-scale changes in the tropics. However, approaches so far focused on feature extraction or the extensive tuning of ML parameters, hindering the potential of ML in forest conservation mapping by not using textural information, which is found to be powerful for many applications. Additionally, the contribution of shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands in forest cover mapping is unknown. The objectives were to develop end-to-end mapping of the tropical forest using fully convolution neural networks (FCNNs) with WorldView-3 (WV-3) imagery and to evaluate human impact on the environment using the Betampona Nature Reserve (BNR) in Madagascar as the test site. FCNN (U-Net) using spatial/textural information was implemented and compared with feature-fed pixel-based methods including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). Results show that the FCNN model outperformed other models with an accuracy of 90.9%, while SVM, RF, and DNN provided accuracies of 88.6%, 84.8%, and 86.6%, respectively. When SWIR bands were excluded from the input data, FCNN provided superior performance over other methods with a 1.87% decrease in accuracy, while the accuracies of other models-SVM, RF, and DNN-decreased by 5.42%, 3.18%, and 8.55%, respectively. Spatial-temporal analysis showed a 0.7% increase in Evergreen Forest within the BNR and a 32% increase in tree cover within residential areas likely due to forest regeneration and conservation efforts. Other effects of conservation efforts are also discussed.

TI  - Land-use change differentially affects endemic, forest and open-land butterflies in Madagascar
T2  - INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY
AB  - The conversion of tropical forests into agriculture reduces biodiversity dramatically. However, species might differ in their responses, depending on their habitat specialisation and geographic origin. In this study, we assess how butterfly assemblages differ between old-growth forests, forest fragments, forest-derived vanilla agroforests, fallow-derived vanilla agroforests, woody fallows, herbaceous fallows, and rice paddies in Madagascar. We recorded 88 butterfly species, of which 65 species are endemic to Madagascar. Land-use types with woody vegetation sustained many endemic (mean: 6.8 species) and forest butterfly species (mean: 4.8 species). Rice paddies and herbaceous fallows were richer in open-land species (mean: 7.6 species) and poorer in forest species (mean: 1.7 species) compared to other land-use types. Compared to herbaceous fallows, fallow-derived vanilla agroforests hosted more endemic (+164%) and forest (+239%) species. Richness of open-land species in forest-derived vanilla agroforests was six times higher than in forest fragments. Overall, 27% of species occurred exclusively in one land-use type and 19% of all species when old-growth forests were excluded. We found the highest number of exclusive species in forest-derived vanilla agroforests. We conclude that all studied land-use types contribute to butterfly conservation in our study region. Especially the woody vegetation in forest fragments, vanilla agroforests, and woody fallows supports a high butterfly diversity and is pivotal for maintaining a broad diversity of forest butterflies in the agricultural matrix. Our study highlights the importance of preserving the diversity of small-scale land-use types, including agroforestry, forests and fallow land in this tropical biodiversity hotspot.

TI  - Reforestation and smallholder livelihoods in the humid tropics
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Smallholder livelihoods and the restoration of tropical forests are intimately intertwined. To address the question of how reforestation affects livelihoods and how they in turn affect reforestation, a meta-synthesis was undertaken of 339 scientific publications identified from a systematic literature search. This study is focused on smallholders in the humid tropics, and uses the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework, which was developed by the UK Department for International Development as the framework for analysis. The links between reforestation and livelihoods are found to be diverse and highly interconnected. Reforestation is only one of a smallholder's activities and typically forms part of a mosaic of land uses across a landscape. Therefore, reforestation should be designed, managed and evaluated under the perspective of a diverse livelihood portfolio, and not as a single activity isolated from other portfolio components, especially under current landscape approaches. It is important for reforestation to be a complementary rather than a competitive livelihood activity. Reforestation has great potential to address poverty, and to increase smallholder socio-ecological resilience and local social equity. However, reforestation outcomes are often suboptimal. Assessing smallholder capacity and the surrounding environment prior to reforestation, and addressing limiting local capacities and conditions in a timely manner, may enhance the likelihood of optimal benefits.

TI  - Landscape forest cover and regional context shape the conservation value of shaded cocoa agroforests for bees and social wasps
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB  - ContextThe expansion of agricultural lands threatens biodiversity maintenance across the tropics. Although some agroforestry systems may be biodiversity-friendly, their conservation value likely depends on the landscape and regional contexts in which they are embedded-a poorly tested hypothesis.ObjectivesWe assessed the conservation value of shaded cocoa agroforests for bees and social wasps, and evaluated whether such value depends on the remaining forest cover at the landscape and/or regional scales.MethodsUsing a paired design, we compared alpha- (species number) and beta-diversity of each taxon between cocoa agroforests and neighbouring rainforests in 30 landscapes from three regions with different deforestation levels from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We assessed whether the species number ratio (cocoa/forest) and beta-diversity related to landscape-scale forest cover, and whether such a relationship differed among regions (interacting effect).ResultsCocoa agroforests held more bee and wasp species than forests, and beta-diversity between habitats was moderate (bees) to high (wasps). Bees' species number ratio peaked at the intermediate-deforested region, and beta-diversity decreased with increasing forest cover, indicating that both land uses shared more species in more forested landscapes, especially in the high- and intermediate-deforested regions. Yet, for social wasps, beta-diversity varied only within regions, with habitats sharing more species in the low-deforested region.ConclusionsOur findings highlight that the conservation value of shaded cocoa agroforests for bees and social wasps depends on local and regional landscape forest cover. With cocoa agroforest being highly permeable matrix which increases with higher forest cover especially for bees in high- and intermediate-deforested regions.

TI  - Riparian forest recovery following a decade of cattle exclusion in the Colombian Andes
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - To meet their large-scale forest and landscape restoration targets, countries must find ways to accommodate areas for conservation alongside agricultural production. In some pasture-dominated regions of Latin America, intensive silvopastoral systems (SPS) are being promoted to increase cattle productivity on certain lands while facilitating the removal of cattle from marginal areas for forest restoration. However, the recovery of these forests and their contribution to the overall conservation value of the landscape has not been assessed rigorously. We evaluated forest structure and composition in 20 sites in a region of the Colombian Andes where a decade ago farmers transitioned to SPS and fenced off riparian areas to enable forest recovery. We compared these restored forests to a reference model based on the remaining riparian forest across the region, all of which has been subjected to human management. We found that woody species richness was higher in restored than in reference forests, and the proportion of large-seeded, later successional, animal-dispersed species were similar in both forest types. Whereas we found a similar suite of dominant tree species in restored and reference forest, Guadua angustifolia, a native giant bamboo was more abundant in the reference forests due to human management. Total tree basal area was higher in restored forests due to a small number of very large trees likely present in the pastures at the time of site protection. These findings highlight (1) the potential for recovery of diverse forests in riparian sites despite previous grazing use and (2) the role of remnant trees in facilitating natural succession. Overall, rapid forest recovery with minimal intervention in previously fanned lands is good news for conservation in a region that still harbors significant biodiversity despite high levels of fragmentation and the influence of human management.

TI  - Restoration of Pasture to Forest in Brazil's Mata Atlantica: The Roles of Herbivory, Seedling Defenses, and Plot Design in Reforestation
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - In this study, seedling growth and herbivory were monitored during the first 4 years of plot development in a large-scale reforestation experiment in Brazil's Atlantic Rainforest (Mata Atlantica). Seedlings were planted in a factorial design testing two levels of density, three levels of diversity, and the presence or absence of pioneer species at the Reserva Natural Vale in the Brazilian state of Espirito Santo. In addition, we studied the effect of herbivory on seedling growth and the potential for plant defenses to limit herbivory. Seedling growth was higher in the low-density plantings, and seedlings attained the greatest height in the low-diversity plots, which had a higher density of fast-growing species. The inclusion of pioneer species resulted in a significant decrease in the growth of neighboring seedlings. Interactions between herbivory, plant defenses, and seedling growth were complex. In general, defenses such as saponins and leaf toughness reduced herbivory, but when herbivory was high, seedling growth was reduced. Across treatments, mean height without herbivore damage was 240.8 cm, and with 50% herbivory mean height was 101.5 cm. Overall, to limit insect damage and promote seedling success, plant defense characteristics and ecological interactions should be carefully considered in reforestation projects.

TI  - Assessment of multifaceted environmental issues and model development of an Indo-Burma hotspot region
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB  - The present article provides a multifaceted critical research review on environmental issues intimately related with the socio-economy of North East India (NE), a part of Indo-Burma hotspot. Further, the article addresses the issue of sustainable development of NE India through diverse ecological practices inextricably linked with traditional ecological knowledge (TEK). The biodiversity of NE India comprises endemic floral diversity, particularly medicinal plants of importance to pharmaceutical industry, and unique faunal diversity. Nevertheless, it is very unfortunate that this great land of biodiversity is least explored taxonomically as well as biotechnologically, probably due to geographical and political constraints. Different anthropogenic and socio-economic factors have perturbed the pristine ecology of this region, leading to environmental degradation. Also, the practice of unregulated shifting cultivation (jhooming), bamboo flowering, biological invasions and anthropogenic perturbations to biodiversity exacerbate the gloomy situation. Instead of a plethora of policies, the TEK of NE people may be integrated with modern scientific knowledge in order to conserve the environment which is the strong pillar for socio-economic sector here. The aforesaid approach can be practiced in NE India through the broad implementation and extension of agroforestry practices. Further, case studies on Apatanis, ethnomedicinal plants use by indigenous tribal groups and sacred forests are particularly relevant in the context of conservation of environmental health in totality while addressing the socioeconomic impact as well. In context with the prevailing scenarios in this region, we developed an eco-sustainable model for natural resource management through agroforestry practices in order to uplift the social as well as environmental framework.

TI  - Forest Degradation: When Is a Forest Degraded?
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - The concept of forest degradation tends to be addressed in broad terms, and existing definitions are difficult to apply in practice. These definitions are based on a reduction in the production of ecosystem goods and services, but fail to address how, when and to what degree this reductionwhich ultimately leads to degradation of a forestoccurs. Generally speaking, degradation is the result of a progressive decline in the structure, composition and functions upon which the vigor and RESILIENCE of a forest is based. A degraded forest is one whose structure, function, species composition, or productivity have been severely modified or permanently lost as a result of damaging human activities. So far, no guidelines have been developed for classification and evaluation of a degraded forest at the stand level, nor are there methodologies for assessing the degree of degradation found. The present work proposes stand-level guidelines for identification of a degraded forest according to a list of structural, compositional and regeneration criteria and characteristics. Emphasis is put on the need for local definitions of forest degradation, and identification of thresholds that determine the points where the processes of degradation finalize into degraded forests. Finally, the present work makes a call to move forwards in sustainable management in order to prevent degradation, and in implementation of restoration or rehabilitation practices in degraded forests.

TI  - Agroforestry systems conserve species-rich but modified assemblages of tropical birds and bats
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Although an increasing number of studies have shown that diverse, multi-strata agroforestry systems can contribute to the conservation of tropical biodiversity, there is still debate about how the biodiversity within agroforestry systems compares to that of intact forest and alternative land uses. In order to assess the relative importance of agroforestry systems for biodiversity conservation, we characterized bat and bird assemblages occurring in forests, two types of agroforestry systems (cacao and banana) and plantain monocultures in the indigenous reserves of Talamanca, Costa Rica. A total of 2,678 bats of 45 species were captured, and 3,056 birds of 224 species were observed. Agroforestry systems maintained bat assemblages that were as (or more) species-rich, abundant and diverse as forests, had the same basic suite of dominant species, but contained more nectarivorous bats than forests. Agroforestry systems also contained bird assemblages that were as abundant, species-rich and diverse as forests; however the species composition of these assemblages was highly modified, with fewer forest dependent species, more open area species and different dominant species. The plantain monocultures had highly modified and depauperate assemblages of both birds and bats. Across land uses, bird diversity and species richness were more closely correlated with the structural and floristic characteristics than were bats, suggesting potential taxon-specific responses to different land uses. Our results indicate that diverse cacao and banana agroforestry systems contribute to conservation efforts by serving as habitats to high numbers of bird and bat species, including some, but not all, forest-dependent species and species of known conservation concern. However, because the animal assemblages in agroforestry systems differ from those in forests, the maintenance of forests within the agricultural landscape is critical for conserving intact assemblages at the landscape level.

TI  - Species selection and plantation management in enrichment planting with native timber species in the Panama Canal watershed
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Large areas of the Panama Canal Watershed have been converted to monocultures of teak (Tectona grandis), a non-native timber species that is generally not providing hoped-for economic and ecological benefits of Forest Landscape Restoration. Enrichment planting offers a potential strategy for revitalizing these underperforming plantations through the addition of high-value, native species to the understory, but more information is needed to guide implementation and management in this region and other tropical areas. We assessed the performance of six promising native species (Byrsonima crassifolia, Dalbergia retusa, Dipteryx oleifera, Hyeronima alchorneoides, Platymiscium pinnatum, Terminalia amazonia) as an enrichment planting in teak plantations, and specifically considered how light availability, crowding pressure and annual fertilization affected seedling performance, we measured survival and growth for the first 30 months post-planting for similar to 3,000 seedlings; half received annual fertilization and half did not. We found that growth rate did not significantly affect survival among- or within-species, except for a positive relationship for D. oleifera. Overall seedling survival was high (83%), and, while species varied widely, there was not a strong effect of light, crowding or fertilization on survival. In contrast, overall growth of species was significantly affected by these factors. Across all species growth was negatively related to crowding and positively related to light availability and fertilization. There were among-species differences; while all but one species (D. oleifera) were negatively affected by crowding, only half responded positively to light availability (D. retusa, P. pinnatum, and B. crassifolia) and fertilization (D. retusa, P. pinnatum, and T. amazonia). Our findings suggest that all study species except for B. crassifolia, which suffered unacceptably high mortality, have high potential for use in enrichment planting in Panama teak plantations. Among-species differences in response to fertilization and growing environment highlight the need for continued studies to establish specific silvicultural guidelines for species in the enrichment planting context.

TI  - Cross-scale spatial variability and associations of carbon pools provide insight into regulating carbon sequestration in tropical montane rainforests
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - The spatial distribution of plant, soil, and microbial carbon pools, along with their intricate interactions, presents a great challenge for the current carbon cycle research. However, it is not clear what are the characteristics of the spatial variability of these carbon pools, particularly their cross-scale relationships. We investigated the crossscale spatial variability of microbial necromass carbon (MNC), soil organic carbon (SOC) and plant biomass (PB), as well as their correlation in a tropical montane rainforest using multifractal analysis. The results showed multifractal spatial variations of MNC, SOC, and PB, demonstrating their adherence to power-law scaling. MNC, especially low MNC, exhibited stronger spatial heterogeneity and weaker evenness compared with SOC and PB. The cross-scale correlation between MNC and SOC was stronger than their correlations at the measurement scale. Furthermore, the cross-scale spatial variability of MNC and SOC exhibited stronger and more stable correlations than those with PB. Additionally, this research suggests that when SOC and PB are both low, it is advisable for reforestations to potentiate MNC formation, whereas when both SOC and PB are high some thinning can be advisable to favour MNC formation. Thus, these results support the utilization of management measures such as reforestation or thinning as nature-based solutions to regulate carbon sequestration capacity of tropical forests by affecting the correlations among various carbon pools.

TI  - Impact of cocoa agricultural intensification on bird diversity and community composition
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - To meet the growing demand for chocolate, cocoa (Theobroma cacao) agriculture is expanding and intensifying. Although this threatens tropical forests, cocoa sustainability initiatives largely overlook biodiversity conservation. To inform these initiatives, we analyzed how cocoa agriculture affects bird diversity at farm and landscape scales with a meta-analysis of 23 studies. We extracted 214 Hedges' g* comparisons of bird diversity and 14 comparisons of community similarity between a forest baseline and 4 farming systems that cover an intensification gradient in landscapes with high and low forest cover, and we summarized 119 correlations between cocoa farm features and bird diversity. Bird diversity declined sharply in low shade cocoa. Cocoa with >30% canopy cover from diverse trees retained bird diversity similar to nearby primary or mature secondary forest but held a different community of birds. Diversity of endemic species, frugivores, and insectivores (agriculture avoiders) declined, whereas diversity of habitat generalists, migrants, nectarivores, and granivores (agriculture associates) increased. As forest decreased on the landscape, the difference in bird community composition between forest and cocoa also decreased, indicating agriculture associates replaced agriculture avoiders in forest patches. Our results emphasize the need to conserve forested landscapes (land sparing) and invest in mixed-shade agroforestry (land sharing) because each strategy benefits a diverse and distinct biological community.

TI  - Tree cover increase mitigation strategy: implications of the "replacement approach" in carbon storage of a subtropical ecosystem
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Worldwide tree cover increase (TCI) is one the most important climate change mitigation strategies, given the role of the ecosystems as carbon (C) reservoirs. Reforestation could be key to achieving TCI. However, there is still a knowledge gap about its real mitigation effects when it is applied through its replacement approach (REP-app). We evaluate the REP-app effects (replace native forest cover-NFC-by forestry plantation cover-FPC) on magnitude and direction of ecosystem C stock changes. By means of a field study, we quantified the C stock through a space-for-time substitution method, using eight paired sites (NFC/FPC) in a northern Argentinian subtropical forest (SAY). We studied C in saplings, lianas, above and belowground biomass, dead organic biomass, and soil. Through a metaanalysis, we evaluated the reliableness within the response of C sequestration (gain or loss) in international study cases and, therefore, the robustness of outcomes analyzing some main moderator variables that may influence the result. A significant effect of C loss was revealed by both, the field study (- 50%) and the metaanalysis (- 20.4%), and this response was consistent through stands of ages and species different. SAY sequestered 285 MgC ha(-1). Only 35-year-old Eucalyptus stand reached similar values, but they are reservoirs of doubtful permanence with functional attributes that could affect long-term ecosystem functioning. Given that the TCI strategy seek to achieve interconnected efforts in relation to climate, biodiversity, and sustainable development, the REP-app must not be considered a mitigation strategy in subtropical ecosystems. Global programs promoting TCI must be redirected urgently.

TI  - Primary forest loss and degradation reduces biodiversity and ecosystem functioning: A global meta-analysis using dung beetles as an indicator taxon
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Because of continuing degradation or deforestation in areas of undisturbed primary forest, there is a need to study the relative merit of strategies that mitigate their impacts on biodiversity and associated ecological functionality. Here, we provide a global synthesis of forest degradation or deforestation using 48 studies published in peer-reviewed journals that use dung beetles as indicators given their sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbance and their relevance in performing essential ecological functions in terrestrial ecosystems. We evaluated forest cover associated with undisturbed primary forest degradation (i.e. degraded primary forest) and undisturbed primary forest deforestation (i.e. secondary forest, forestry plantations and forestry restoration implementation) on species richness, total abundance, biomass, functional groups' presence and ecological functions provided by dung beetles. Additionally, we determined whether if dung beetle responses to forest disturbances were geographically dependent. We found lower diversity and a decrease in ecological functions associated with all classes of disturbance in primary forest. However, the effects were less severe in the case of forest degradation compared to complete deforestation with natural regeneration of secondary forest, development of forest plantations or active forest restoration by planting indigenous trees. The Neotropical and Oriental regions are particularly vulnerable, given the elevated rates of undisturbed primary forest deforestation and its negative impact on their assemblages' diversity and ecological functions. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that efforts for the conservation of remaining undisturbed primary forests need to be prioritized, especially in tropical latitudes. However, in regions where primary forest conservation is not feasible, logging management programs in degraded primary forest may have a potential role in reducing negative impacts for dung beetle diversity and ecological functions. Moreover, we conclude that despite the negative effect of primary forest deforestation and implementation of secondary forest, forestry plantation and forestry restoration, they can be useful for partial recovery of diversity and ecological functions performed by dung beetles in areas lacking any primary forest (undisturbed or degraded) vegetation cover.

TI  - Hidden Tenants: Microbiota of the Rhizosphere and Phyllosphere of Cordia dodecandra Trees in Mayan Forests and Homegardens
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
AB  - During domestication, the selection of cultivated plants often reduces microbiota diversity compared with their wild ancestors. Microbiota in compartments such as the phyllosphere or rhizosphere can promote fruit tree health, growth, and development. Cordia dodecandra is a deciduous tree used by Maya people for its fruit and wood, growing, to date, in remnant forest fragments and homegardens (traditional agroforestry systems) in Yucatdn. In this work, we evaluated the microbiota's alpha and beta diversity per compartment (phyllosphere and rhizosphere) and per population (forest and homegarden) in the Northeast and Southwest Yucatdn regions. Eight composite DNA samples (per compartment/population/region combination) were amplified for 16S-RNA (bacteria) and ITS1-2 (fungi) and sequenced by Illumina MiSeq. Bioinformatic analyses were performed with QIIME and phyloseq. For bacteria and fungi, from 107,947 and 128,786 assembled sequences, 618 and 1092 operating taxonomic units (OTUs) were assigned, respectively. The alpha diversity of bacteria and fungi was highly variable among samples and was similar among compartments and populations. A significant species turnover among populations and regions was observed in the rhizosphere. The core microbiota from the phyllosphere was similar among populations and regions. Forests and homegarden populations are reservoirs of the C. dodecandra phyllosphere core microbiome and significant rhizosphere biodiversity.

TI  - Decay of similarity across tropical forest communities: integrating spatial distance with soil nutrients
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Understanding the mechanisms that drive the change of biotic assemblages over space and time is the main quest of community ecology. Assessing the relative importance of dispersal and environmental species selection in a range of organismic sizes and motilities has been a fruitful strategy. A consensus for whether spatial and environmental distances operate similarly across spatial scales and taxa, however, has yet to emerge. We used censuses of four major groups of organisms (soil bacteria, fungi, ground insects, and trees) at two observation scales (1-m(2) sampling point vs. 2,500-m(2) plots) in a topographically standardized sampling design replicated in two tropical rainforests with contrasting relationships between spatial distance and nutrient availability. We modeled the decay of assemblage similarity for each taxon set and site to assess the relative contributions of spatial distance and nutrient availability distance. Then, we evaluated the potentially structuring effect of tree composition over all other taxa. The similarity of nutrient content in the litter and topsoil had a stronger and more consistent selective effect than did dispersal limitation, particularly for bacteria, fungi, and trees at the plot level. Ground insects, the only group assessed with the capacity of active dispersal, had the highest species turnover and the flattest nonsignificant distance-decay relationship, suggesting that neither dispersal limitation nor nutrient availability were fundamental drivers of their community assembly at this scale of analysis. Only the fungal communities at one of our study sites were clearly coordinated with tree composition. The spatial distance at the smallest scale was more important than nutrient selection for the bacteria, fungi, and insects. The lower initial similarity and the moderate variation in composition identified by these distance-decay models, however, suggested that the effects of stochastic sampling were important at this smaller spatial scale. Our results highlight the importance of nutrients as one of the main environmental drivers of rainforest communities irrespective of organismic or propagule size and how the overriding effect of the analytical scale influences the interpretation, leading to the perception of greater importance of dispersal limitation and ecological drift over selection associated with environmental niches at decreasing observation scales.

TI  - Multifunctional soil recovery during the restoration of Brazil's Atlantic Forest after bauxite mining
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Ecosystem restoration is a global priority, currently promoted by several ambitious commitments. Most of the research to guide restoration practices was so far put on the recovery of above-ground functions and services, although soil health is increasingly recognized as a fundamental condition to restoration success. Soil restoration is particularly needed in mining areas, in which the surface soil layers are removed and the left over, highly deprived substrate does not support vegetation recovery.
   2. Here, we evaluated the potential of active restoration to recover soil attributes after bauxite mining in the Brazil's Atlantic Forest. We specifically studied how physical, chemical and microbiological soil attributes down to 40 cm depth respond to restoration (i.e. topsoil spreading and tree planting) by comparing newly mined areas, areas undergoing restoration for similar to 7 years and conserved forests. We further explored the associations between microbiological and physico-chemical soil attributes.
   3. Restoration interventions resulted in a 10-fold increase in the soil organic matter content compared to mined areas, as well as in the recovery of P content. Restoration was also shown to be associated with the recovery of the activity and diversity of soil bacterial communities, reaching similar levels to those observed in conserved forest. Restored and conserved forests were characterized by a higher proportion of Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia. All bacterial attributes were correlated with soil physical attributes, except for microporosity, and with organic matter and cation exchange capacity.
   4. Within a few years, restoration allowed recovering crucial physical, chemical and microbiological soil attributes, reaching levels comparable to those found in conserved forests.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that intensive management can result in the fast restoration of tropical forest soils after mining, at least at small scales. Our results stress the need to consider soil recovery both as a driver and a measure of ecosystem restoration success, and support the development of more holistic monitoring protocols to be used during the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.

TI  - Use of response guilds of understory birds in threatened subtropical forest to monitor selective logging impact
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Unplanned logging is one of the greatest current threats to native forests biodiversity. About 90% of the pied-mont forest in the Southern Andean Yungas has been converted to other land-use types and the remaining forests fragments are being intensively logged without management plans. Bird species, especially understory birds, are good indicators of forest diversity and integrity. The aim of this study was to identify understory bird species associated with changes in the forest structure caused by selective logging and to explore whether it is possible to use these species as a monitoring tool. We observed that Sittasomus griseicapillus, Turdus rufiventris, Lepidocolaptes angustirostris, Casiornis rufus, Thraupis sayaca, and Tolmomyias sulphurescens were associated to unlogged sites with higher density of timber-yielding and standing dead trees. Thamnophilus caerulescens, Leptotila megalura, Synallaxis scutata, Poecilotriccus plumbeiceps, and Catharus ustulatus were favoured by logging activities and associated with understory visual obstruction. Mean cut-off abundance thresholds were 2.74 ind/ha for the avian guild associated with unlogged forest and 1.79 ind/ha for the guild associated with logged forest. Sustainable forest management schemes need to retain the understory visual obstruction at values similar to those of unlogged forest (43.75%), together with an adequate density (>= 10 ind/ha) of standing dead trees with at least 19.5 cm in DBH, and a minimum of 210 ind/ha of timber tree species. Bird species identified in this study can be used in monitoring schemes to evaluate the implementation of these guidelines.

TI  - Quantifying mammal biodiversity co-benefits in certified tropical forests
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
AB  - Aim Financial incentives to manage forests sustainably, such as certification or carbon storage payments, are assumed to have co-benefits for biodiversity conservation. This claim remains little studied for rain forest mammals, which are particularly threatened, but challenging to survey.
   Location Sabah, Malaysia, Borneo.
   Methods We used photographic data from three commercial forest reserves to show how community occupancy modelling can be used to quantify mammalian diversity conservation co-benefits of forest certification. These reserves had different management histories, and one was certified by the Forest Stewardship Council.
   Results Many threatened species occupied larger areas in the certified reserve. Species richness, estimated per 200x200-m grid cell throughout all reserves, was higher in the certified site, particularly for threatened species. The certified reserve held the highest aboveground biomass. Within reserves, aboveground biomass was not strongly correlated with patterns of mammal richness (Spearman's rho from 0.03 to 0.32); discrepancies were strongest along reserve borders.
   Main conclusions Our approach provides a flexible and standardized tool to assess biodiversity and identify winners of sustainable forestry. Inferring patterns of species richness from camera-trapping carries potential for the objective designation of high conservation value forest. Correlating species richness with aboveground biomass further allows evaluating the biodiversity co-benefits of carbon protection. These advantages make the present approach an ideal tool to overcome the difficulties to rigorously quantify biodiversity co-benefits of forest certification and carbon storage payments.

TI  - Antioxidant and photoprotective defenses in response to gradual water stress under low and high irradiance in two Malvaceae tree species used for tropical forest restoration
T2  - TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB  - Key message This study provides a mechanistic basis of the tolerance to light and water stress in two tropical tree species of the Malvaceae used for the reforestation in the tropics. G. ulmifolia is more sensitive to high irradiance than C. speciosa . Thus, C. speciosa is more appropriate for the reforestation of degraded areas with potential excess light or water deficit.
   Reforestation programs in tropics are necessary to mitigate the impacts of climate change, the preservation of biodiversity and for recovery of degraded areas. However, little is known about the abiotic stress tolerance of the major tropical tree species used in reforestation. This study was aimed at evaluating antioxidant defenses and photoprotective pigments against excess light and water deficit in Guazuma ulmifolia Lam. and Ceiba speciosa (A.St.-Hil) Ravenna. Plantlets of 6-month-old were exposed to progressive water deficit by withholding water under high and low irradiance growth conditions and then re-irrigated. G. ulmifolia leaves under high irradiance showed increased photo-oxidative damage, as indicated by a decreased Fv/Fm ratio and 5-12-fold increases in MDA levels, which correlated with a 14-fold increase in SOD activity, a 90 % decrease in POD activity and a 3-4-fold increases in hydrogen peroxide levels. Water deficit combined with high irradiance caused stronger chronic photoinhibition, indicating a synergistic effect that cannot be counterbalanced by antioxidant or photo-protective mechanisms. In contrast, to avoid photo-oxidative damage, C. speciosa enhanced SOD activity, maintained POD and CAT activities, and increased xanthophyll cycle pool size and DPS and beta-carotene accumulation. These results indicate that G. ulmifolia is more sensitive to high irradiance than C. speciosa at early stages of development. Thus, C. speciosa is more appropriate for the reforestation of degraded areas with potential excess light or water deficit. In conclusion, this study provides a mechanistic basis of the tolerance abiotic stress in two tropical trees, thereby contributing for management strategies in reforestation projects.

TI  - The cost of restoring carbon stocks in Brazil's Atlantic Forest
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Knowing which restoration approach provides the best returns on investment for accumulating carbon is essential to foster restoration planning, financing, and implementation. Here, we explored the cost-effectiveness and drivers of aboveground and soil carbon accumulation in restored forests across an agricultural landscape of Brazil's Atlantic Forest. The recovery of aboveground and soil carbon stocks, as well as the implementation and land opportunity costs, was assessed across chronosequences (10-60 years) of second-growth forests and mixed-species tree plantings and old growth, reference forest remnants. Plantations accumulated approximately 50% more aboveground carbon than second-growth forests throughout the chronosequence. When controlling for soil clay content, soil carbon stocks were higher in reference than in restored forests, but they were comparable between plantations and second-growth forests. After 60 years of stand development, recovery of total carbon stocks in both restoration approaches reached only half of the average stocks of reference forests. Total cost-effectiveness for carbon accumulation, including both implementation and land opportunity costs, was on average 60% higher for second-growth forests than for plantations (15.1 and 9.4 kgC US$(-1), respectively). Although tree plantations initially showed higher rates of carbon storage than second-growth forests, their higher implementation and land opportunity costs make them less cost-effective for carbon farming. Our results further suggest that, at current pricing levels, carbon markets alone have a limited potential to up-scale restoration efforts in Brazil's Atlantic Forest.

TI  - Interactive effects of land use history and natural disturbance on seedling dynamics in a subtropical forest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Human-impacted forests are increasing in extent due to widespread regrowth of secondary forests on abandoned lands. The degree and speed of recovery from human disturbance in these forests will determine their value in terms of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem function. In areas subject to periodic, severe natural disturbances, such as hurricanes, it has been hypothesized that human and natural disturbance may interact to either erase or preserve land use legacies. To increase understanding of how interactions between human and natural disturbance influence forest regeneration and recovery, we monitored seedlings in a human-and hurricane-impacted forest in northeastern Puerto Rico over a; 10-yr period and compared seedling composition and dynamics in areas that had experienced high-and low-intensity human disturbance during the first half of the 20th century. We found that land use history significantly affected the composition and diversity of the seedling layer and altered patterns of canopy openness and seedling dynamics following hurricane disturbance. The area that had been subject to high-intensity land use supported a higher density, but lower diversity, of species. In both land use history categories, the seedling layer was dominated by the same two species, Prestoea acuminata var. montana and Guarea guidonia. However, seedlings of secondary-successional species tended to be more abundant in the high-intensity land use area, while late-successional species were more abundant in the low-intensity area, consistent with patterns of adult tree distributions. Seedlings of secondary-forest species showed greater increases in growth and survival following hurricane disturbance compared to late-successional species, providing support for the hypothesis that hurricanes help preserve the signature of land use history. However, the increased performance of secondary-forest species occurred predominantly in the low-intensity land use area, suggesting that hurricanes act to homogenize differences in species composition between areas with differing land use histories by increasing secondary-forest species regeneration in areas that experienced little direct human disturbance. Our results suggest that, through effects on seedling dynamics, hurricanes may extend the signature of land use history beyond the average recovery time of forests not subject to intense natural disturbance events.

TI  - Does soil variation between rainforest, pasture and different reforestation pathways affect the early growth of rainforest pioneer species?
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Rainforest deforestation and subsequent reforestation not only alter above-ground vegetation, but also lead to significant changes in the physical and chemical characteristics of soil and in biochemical cycles, which in turn are likely to influence the growth of rainforest plants However, little research has directly linked soil condition to seedling growth under different forms of rainforest restoration
   This study compared the early growth of three rainforest pioneer species (Alphitonia excelsa, Gutoa semiglauca, Omalanthus nutans) among soils collected from three different reforestation pathways, and from reference sites in remnant rainforest and pasture in subtropical eastern Australia. The types of reforestation were tree-planting for ecological restoration purposes, autogenic regrowth dominated by the non-native tree species camphor laurel (Cinnamomum camphora), and management of this regrowth to encourage native regeneration Growth was measured in a shade-house, using soil from five sites in each site-type and three replicate plants of each species Fifteen physical and biochemical properties were also measured in soil from each site; five of which were related to carbon and eight to nitrogen-dynamics
   Two-factor ANOVA of the exponential growth coefficients of seedling height and diameter showed that there was no interaction between tree species and site-type, but there were significant main effects of both these factors Seedling growth rates did not differ between pasture and rainforest soils, but were around 25% lower in soils from camphor-dominated regrowth sites than in soils from treated camphor and replanted sites Seedling growth rates were correlated with two independently-varying soil properties soil pH and plant-available nitrate-nitrogen, whose inclusion as covariates in the ANOVA largely removed the significant site-type effect. These results indicate that reforestation pathways can affect seedling growth by altering the physical and biochemical properties of soil. However, the absolute magnitude of this effect was not large. (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

TI  - Canopy recovery four years after logging: a management study in a southern brazilian secondary forest
T2  - CERNE
AB  - Background: Understanding forest dynamics after logging is essential to define forest management cycles and intensities. In secondary forest, especially in the Atlantic Forest Domain, these studies are still scarce. Monitoring of the canopy structure after tree harvesting can be performed by hemispherical photographs, where canopy opening is commonly analyzed. This study evaluated changes in canopy opening four years after tree harvesting in a secondary Atlantic Rainforest in southern Brazil. We used hemispherical photographs to determine the Canopy Openness (CO), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Diffuse Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Absorbed Radiation (FAPAR(dif)) in eleven permanent plots.
   Results: We found that harvesting resulted in a momentary increase in canopy opening and light availability in the understory. Four years after harvesting, CO, LAI and FAPAR dif recovered or even exceeded the original values of the forest. We observed a significant correlation between CO and number of trees harvested with DBH > 30 cm. Weak correlations were found between these canopy related variables and the logging intensity.
   Conclusion: In conclusion, we recognized that changes of CO, LAI and FAPAR(dif) after timber harvesting presented short duration. This indicates that the applied logging intensities, 21.8 to 51.1% of the total basal area, did not exceed the resilience of the forest canopy and it's recovering four years later. However, additional studies should be carried out to observe vegetation dynamics, such as species composition, vertical structure, productivity and community stability, in order to improve management schemes of secondary stands in the Atlantic Forest.

TI  - Gender influences decisions to change land use practices in the tropical forest margins of Jambi, Indonesia
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - This study explores the role of gender as a factor in decision making about alternative land use options and in responses to new investment opportunities, which has received little attention to date. An observational study to determine the different factors affecting male and female decisions to change land use at the individual level in a forest margin landscape in Jambi (Sumatra, Indonesia) was combined with a set of role playing games (RPGs) designed to assess participant responses in a simulated social setting of women-only and men-only groups. The RPG included simulated agents offering new opportunities to convert or conserve agroforest. In the study area, rubber (Hevea braziliensis) agroforests that support high biodiversity and carbon storage are giving way to monoculture rubber and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantations. When women from both the upland and lowland villages played the RPGs, external investors proposing logging or oil palm conversion were approached very positively and the resulting land use change was more dynamic and extensive than in the equivalent men-only groups. Consequently, women outperformed men in achieving income targets. In lowland areas gender is strongly associated with land use change, while in the uplands the level of conservation awareness plays a more crucial role in the maintenance of rubber agroforests. Based on the data, and contrary to expectations and gender stereotypes, it is expected that the greater involvement of women in landscape level decision making will increase emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in the area, posing further challenges to efforts to reduce such emissions.

TI  - Strong seasonal variations in net ecosystem CO2 exchange of a tropical pasture and afforestation in Panama
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - Pasture and afforestation are land-use types of major importance in the tropics, yet, most flux tower studies have been conducted in mature tropical forests. As deforestation in the tropics is expected to continue, it is critical to improve our understanding of alternative land-use types, and the impact of interactions between land use and climate on ecosystem carbon dynamics. Thus, we measured net ecosystem CO2 fluxes of a pasture and an adjacent tropical afforestation (native tree species plantation) in Sardinilla, Panama from 2007 to 2009. The objectives of our paired site study were: (1) to assess seasonal and inter-annual variations in net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) of pasture and afforestation, (2) to identify the environmental controls of net ecosystem CO2 fluxes, and (3) to constrain eddy covariance derived total ecosystem respiration (TER) with chamber-based soil respiration (R-Soil) measurements. We observed distinct seasonal variations in NEE that were more pronounced in the pasture compared to the afforestation, reflecting changes in plant and microbial activities. The land conversion from pasture to afforestation increased the potential for carbon uptake by trees vs. grasses throughout most of the year. R-Soil contributed about 50% to TER, with only small differences between ecosystems or seasons. Radiation and soil moisture were the main environmental controls of CO2 fluxes while temperature had no effect on NEE. The pasture ecosystem was more strongly affected by soil water limitations during the dry season, probably due to the shallower root system of grasses compared to trees. Thus, it seems likely that predicted increases in precipitation variability will impact seasonal variations of CO2 fluxes in Central Panama, in particular of pasture ecosystems.

TI  - Indigenous, colonist, and government impacts on Nicaragua's Bosawas reserve
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - We studied the impacts of colonists, two groups of indigenous residents (Miskitu and Mayangna), and management by the Nicaraguan Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARENA) on the forest of the Bosawas International Biosphere Reserve. Indigenous people and colonists subsist on the natural resources of the reserve, and MARENA is responsible for protecting the area from colonization and illicit exploitation. Using geostatistical procedures and Landsat images at three different time periods, we compared per capita deforestation and boundary stabilization in areas with colonists and areas with indigenous peoples. We also examined whether the Mayangna deforested less than the Miskitu and whether the Nicaraguan government has effectively defended the Bosawas boundary against the advance of the agricultural frontier. In addition, we analyzed the current distribution of land uses within the reserve and its contiguous indigenous areas with a supervised classification of current land cover. Indigenous demarcations protected the forest successfully, whereas the Bosawas boundary itself did not inhibit colonization and consequent deforestation. Indigenous farmers deforested significantly less per capita than colonists, and the two indigenous groups in Bosawas did not differ significantly in their effects on the forest. Our results show that indigenous common-property institutions and indigenous defense of homeland have been powerful factors in protecting the forests of Bosawas and that the difficult evolution of a nested cross-scale governance system in Bosawas-under pressure from indigenous peoples-is probably the key to the forest's survival thus far.

TI  - Safeguarding Local Communities for REDD plus Implementation in Ghana
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - In this study, we primarily assess the relationship between social safeguards and the living standards of local communities in different ecological zones of Ghana, relying on data from the seventh round of the Ghana Living Standard Survey (GLSS 7) and publicly available policy documents from the Ghana Statistical Service and the Forestry Commission of Ghana, respectively. This research aims to assist policymakers and stakeholders to make informed and appropriate decisions when developing social safeguards for emission reduction projects. The GLSS 7 covers 14,009 households, comprising 59,864 individuals in 892 enumeration areas or communities across the 10 regions of Ghana, now divided into 16. The data were collected using a stratified random sampling technique. Principal component analysis was employed to develop a living condition index, after which we generated a second construct based on the number of factors affecting living conditions. The results showed that access to sharecropping, literacy, extension services, financial institutions, a mobile phone network, and markets have significant positive relationships with the living conditions of local communities in Ghana. In addition, 78% of the social safeguards described in Ghana's REDD+ strategy, Forest and Wildlife Policy, Benefits Sharing Mechanism, and Forest Plantation Development Strategy are aligned with the determinants of local communities' living conditions. The findings suggest a need to enforce the Benefit Sharing Mechanism, better forest governance, and tenancy reforms in order to prevent the overexploitation of landowners and avoid elite capture. Furthermore, farmers must be linked to financial institutions in order to obtain credits. Additionally, we must seek to provide local communities with better access to markets and mobile phone networks in a way that allows them to carry out their livelihood activities effectively and efficiently. These measures help to reduce the risk of REDD+ actions and ensure sustainability.

TI  - Uncertainty in below-ground carbon biomass for major land covers in Southeast Asia
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Owing to difficulties associated with measuring root biomass accurately in space and time, below-ground root biomass is often calculated indirectly from above-ground biomass measurements via general allometric equations. Of concern is that general equations may not provide accurate site-specific calculations for accurate carbon stock assessments. This review comparing more than 100 root-related studies conducted in SE Asia shows highly variable and uncertain below-ground woody carbon (BGC) biomass estimates for many vegetation types associated with on-going land-use changes throughout the region. Most BGC data exist for Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand; only a few studies have been conducted for Brunei, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, Timor Leste and Vietnam. While substantial data exist for a variety of forests and timber-plantations, little work has focused on key transition land-covers including rubber, oil palm, swidden fallows, agroforests, grasslands, and croplands. Mangroves (12-219 Mg C ha(-1)), peat forests (11-71 Mg C ha(-1)) and other forest types (11-74 Mg C ha(-1)) have the highest BGC values. The limited data for rubber plantations (5-32 Mg C ha(-1)), oil palm plantations (4-22 Mg C ha(-1)), swidden fallows (3-16 Mg C ha(-1)), and non-swidden agroforestry (316 Mg C ha(-1)) indicate modest differences in the amount of BGC for several land covers that are at the heart of ongoing debates regarding the human and environmental impacts of agricultural intensification. The paucity of data currently in existence for the region highlights the need for additional field investigations following accepted protocols of root biomass to facilitate efforts to improve carbon stock estimates. Government agencies, private enterprises, and development agencies could help lead the way in developing a better forest carbon database by teaming with researchers to assess total ecosystem carbon stocks prior to vegetation being removed for construction, mining, or stand rotations.

TI  - Home range and habitat use by pacas in a montane tropical forest in Bolivia
T2  - ACTA AMAZONICA
AB  - We studied the home range and habitat use of paca (Cuniculus paca) in a rural agricultural community in the Alto Beni region, in La Paz department, Bolivia, where game meat is the main source of protein for a large portion of local inhabitants. We captured and radio collared five individual paca (4 females and 1 male), which were followed for six months in 2012 to estimate home range of the individuals and assess their habitat use and selection. The total mean home range (95% Minimum Convex Polygon) was 2.26 ha (SD = 0.80), and ranged from 1.5 to 2.96 ha. The mean female home range (2.04 ha) was smaller than the male's (2.95 ha). Pacas used two (crops and fallows) of the three available habitats (secondary forest patches), and appeared to positively select crops over the other two. The importance of crops may be linked to the type of agriculture conducted in the area (i.e. mainly cacao in agroforestry systems), which may offer more food and shelter for pacas. Given that, the importance of habitats may change seasonally; this topic should be examined in future studies. Our results suggest that agroforestry systems may be important for the species since they offer a variety of food resources throughout the year.

TI  - Evaluation of anthropogenic pressure on the occupancy patterns of large mammals in the Western and Eastern Ghats
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB  - Context Habitat loss limits the dispersal of wide-ranging large mammals. It is pivotal to study the ecological and anthropogenic factors driving the habitat occupancy of large mammals for their long-term conservation and reduction of negative human-wildlife interactions.Objective To evaluate how the habitat occupancy pattern of the large mammals varies across a gradient of anthropogenic pressures.Methods We conducted ecological sign surveys across nine forest divisions including, Protected Areas (PAs) and outside PAs, along the Western and Eastern Ghats of Tamil Nadu, India. We used systematic grid-based Markovian occupancy model to study the effect of ecological and anthropogenic variables (prey abundance, habitat features, direct human disturbance and habitat fragmentation) on tiger (Panthera tigris), leopard (Panthera pardus), dhole (Cuon alpinus), elephant (Elephas maximus) and gaur (Bos gaurus) occupancy at 100 km(2) scale.Results Tiger and dhole occupancy was driven by the abundance of large and medium-sized prey. However, leopards also relied on the available small prey species and utilised fragmented forest patches. Large mammal occupancy increased in contiguous forests with water availability and decreased in landscapes with increased human disturbances and habitat fragmentation. Tiger occupancy was highly confined towards contiguous PA network while the rest of them had scattered but concentrated occupancy towards PAs.Conclusions The dependency of large mammals on contiguous forests suggests improving the quality and connectivity of forested habitats for their dispersal and reducing negative human-wildlife interactions. The low occupancy areas require urgent habitat management intervention to reduce grazing pressure and restore degraded habitats to sustain viable large mammal population at landscape-level.

TI  - Who will win where and why? An ecophysiological dissection of the competition between a tropical pasture grass and the invasive weed Bracken over an elevation range of 1000 m in the tropical Andes
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - In tropical agriculture, the vigorously growing Bracken fern causes severe problems by invading pastures and out-competing the common pasture grasses. Due to infestation by that weed, pastures are abandoned after a few years, and as a fatal consequence, the biodiversity-rich tropical forest is progressively cleared for new grazing areas. Here we present a broad physiological comparison of the two plant species that are the main competitors on the pastures in the tropical Ecuadorian Andes, the planted forage grass Setaria sphacelata and the weed Bracken (Pteridium arachnoideum). With increasing elevation, the competitive power of Bracken increases as shown by satellite data of the study region. Using data obtained from field measurements, the annual biomass production of both plant species, as a measure of their competitive strength, was modeled over an elevational gradient from 1800 to 2800 m. The model shows that with increasing elevation, biomass production of the two species shifts in favor of Bracken which, above 1800 m, is capable of outgrowing the grass. In greenhouse experiments, the effects on plant growth of the presumed key variables of the elevational gradient, temperature and UV radiation, were separately analyzed. Low temperature, as well as UV irradiation, inhibited carbon uptake of the C4-grass more than that of the C3-plant Bracken. The less temperature-sensitive photosynthesis of Bracken and its effective protection from UV radiation contribute to the success of the weed on the highland pastures. In field samples of Bracken but not of Setaria, the content of flavonoids as UV-scavengers increased with the elevation. Combining modeling with measurements in greenhouse and field allowed to explain the invasive growth of a common weed in upland pastures. The performance of Setaria decreases with elevation due to suboptimal photosynthesis at lower temperatures and the inability to adapt its cellular UV screen.

TI  - Land use land cover change detection through geospatial analysis in an Indian Biosphere Reserve
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
AB  - The present study examines the land use land cover (LULC) and change detection impacts on forest ecosystem in Achanakmaar Amarkantak Biosphere Reserve (AABR - area 626.76 km(2)) of Central India. Results revealed that there has been a change in AABR land use pattern from 2008 to 2018. The major changes include loss of 19.72 km(2) of vegetation cover in various forest types due to increasing biotic interference and over grazing, conversion of 14.77 km(2) of Dense Sal mixed forest to open mixed forest and cultivable land, and 5.0 km(2) teak plantation and Bamboo brakes to agricultural land. Despite losing many plant species due to anthropogenic pressure, the present study found that the AABR as a unique repository of plant species rich in biodiversity. Many spots of this area are invaded or replaced by exotic species which is causing the loss of ecology and diversity of this region. Based on our study Sal mixed forest reduced by 2.88% (5.23 km(2)), Dense mixed forest 4.02% (9.54 km(2)), Teak plantation 6.77% (2.61 km(2)) and Bamboo brakes reduced by 7.66% (2.34 km(2)). The study concludes that the Landsat 7 TM and Resourcesat 2A satellite images are the most suitable for studying the LULC change on forest ecosystem of AABR. We advocate that by adopting the rigorous conservation measures, especially in open & dense forest and young under-stocked teak forests can restore the vegetation density and diversity in the area. Moreover, Sal natural regeneration of vegetation would remain crucial, and invasion of exotic species over native species needs to be restored in the forest area. Such findings on major changes occurring in forest ecosystem hold tremendous implications in relation to the welfare of the resource-poor tribal communities who are greatly dependent on the natural resources available in AABR for their livelihood.

TI  - Selective logging emissions and potential emission reductions from reduced-impact logging in the Congo Basin
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - To estimate carbon emissions from selective logging in Central Africa, we employed the reduced-impact logging for carbon emissions reductions (RIL-C) protocol to quantify baseline carbon emissions from legal timber harvests by source (i.e., hauling, skidding, and felling). We modeled the relationships between emissions and biophysical conditions, logging practices, and forest policies and then used these models to estimate potential emission reductions from full implementation of RIL-C practices. We applied the method in 8 forest management enterprises (FMEs; i.e., concessions) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), 9 in Gabon, and 6 in the Republic of Congo (RoC). Committed logging emissions expressed per cubic meter of timber harvested (to control for differences in logging intensities) ranged from 0.63 Mg C m(-3) in a FME in RoC to 4.8 Mg C m(-3) in a FME in Gabon, with an overall average of 2.1 Mg C m(-3). Logging emissions were dominated by damage caused by road and log landing construction (i.e., hauling; 50%) and felling (43%; includes carbon in extracted logs). Total emissions represented only about 9% of unlogged forest biomass carbon stocks. Average emissions were highest in Gabon (2.65 Mg C m(-3)) followed by DRC (1.84 Mg C m(-3)) and RoC (1.54 Mg C m(-3)). Emissions from concessions certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC, N = 6) and those that were not certified (N = 17) did not differ. Nearly half (51%) of logging emissions could be avoided without reducing timber yields if all best examples of RIL-C logging practices observed were applied in the same FME. At the country level, if all FMEs were to utilize these practices, emissions reductions would be 34% in RoC, 45% in DRC, and 62% in Gabon. When combined with country-level logging statistics, emissions from selective logging as currently practiced in the six countries of the Congo Basin are equivalent to 40% of the region's total emissions from deforestation.

TI  - Developing Cost-Effective Field Assessments of Carbon Stocks in Human-Modified Tropical Forests
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Across the tropics, there is a growing financial investment in activities that aim to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, such as REDD+. However, most tropical countries lack on-the-ground capacity to conduct reliable and replicable assessments of forest carbon stocks, undermining their ability to secure long-term carbon finance for forest conservation programs. Clear guidance on how to reduce the monetary and time costs of field assessments of forest carbon can help tropical countries to overcome this capacity gap. Here we provide such guidance for cost-effective one-off field assessments of forest carbon stocks. We sampled a total of eight components from four different carbon pools (i.e. aboveground, dead wood, litter and soil) in 224 study plots distributed across two regions of eastern Amazon. For each component we estimated survey costs, contribution to total forest carbon stocks and sensitivity to disturbance. Sampling costs varied thirty-one-fold between the most expensive component, soil, and the least, leaf litter. Large live stems (>= 10 cm DBH), which represented only 15% of the overall sampling costs, was by far the most important component to be assessed, as it stores the largest amount of carbon and is highly sensitive to disturbance. If large stems are not taxonomically identified, costs can be reduced by a further 51%, while incurring an error in aboveground carbon estimates of only 5% in primary forests, but 31% in secondary forests. For rapid assessments, necessary to help prioritize locations for carbon-conservation activities, sampling of stems >= 20cm DBH without taxonomic identification can predict with confidence (R-2 = 0.85) whether an area is relatively carbon-rich or carbon-poor-an approach that is 74% cheaper than sampling and identifying all the stems >= 10cm DBH. We use these results to evaluate the reliability of forest carbon stock estimates provided by the IPCC and FAO when applied to human-modified forests, and to highlight areas where cost savings in carbon stock assessments could be most easily made.

TI  - Carbon Storage and Land-Use Strategies in Agricultural Landscapes across Three Continents
T2  - CURRENT BIOLOGY
AB  - The loss of carbon stocks through agricultural landuse change is a key driver of greenhouse gas emissions [1-4], and the methods used to manage agricultural landwill havemajor impacts on the global climate in the 21 st century [4-9]. It remains unresolvedwhether carbon losses would be minimized by increasing farm yields and limiting the conversion of natural habitats (''landsparing''), ormaximizingon-farmcarbonstocks, even at the costof reduced yields andtherefore greater habitat clearance (''landsharing''). In thispaper, weuse field surveys of over 11,000 trees, in-depth interviews with farmers, and existing agricultural data, to evaluate the potential impacts of these contrastingapproaches, and plausible intermediate strategies, on aboveground carbon stocks across a diverse range of agricultural and natural systems. Our analyses include agroforestry and oil palm plantations in the humid tropics of Ghana; cattle ranching in dry tropical forest in Mexico; and arable cropping in temperate wetlands and forests in Poland. Strikingly, despite the range of systems investigated, land sparing consistently had a higher potential to sustain regional above-ground carbon stocks than any other strategy. This was the case in all three regions and at all plausible levels of food production, including falls in demand. However, if agricultural production increases to meet likely future demand levels, we project large decreases in aboveground carbon stocks, regardless of land-use strategy. Our results strongly suggest that maintaining above-ground carbon stocks will depend on both limiting future food demand and minimizing agricultural expansion through linking high-yield farming with conserving or restoring natural habitats.

TI  - Evidence of Incipient Forest Transition in Southern Mexico
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Case studies of land use change have suggested that deforestation across Southern Mexico is accelerating. However, forest transition theory predicts that trajectories of change can be modified by economic factors, leading to spatial and temporal heterogeneity in rates of change that may take the form of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). This study aimed to assess the evidence regarding potential forest transition in Southern Mexico by classifying regional forest cover change using Landsat imagery from 1990 through to 2006. Patterns of forest cover change were found to be complex and nonlinear. When rates of forest loss were averaged over 342 municipalities using mixed-effects modelling the results showed a significant (p< 0.001) overall reduction of the mean rate of forest loss from 0.85% per year in the 1990-2000 period to 0.67% in the 2000-2006 period. The overall regional annual rate of deforestation has fallen from 0.33% to 0.28% from the 1990s to 2000s. A high proportion of the spatial variability in forest cover change cannot be explained statistically. However analysis using spline based general additive models detected underlying relationships between forest cover and income or population density of a form consistent with the EKC. The incipient forest transition has not, as yet, resulted in widespread reforestation. Forest recovery remains below 0.20% per year. Reforestation is mostly the result of passive processes associated with reductions in the intensity of land use. Deforestation continues to occur at high rates in some focal areas. A transition could be accelerated if there were a broader recognition among policy makers that the regional rate of forest loss has now begun to fall. The changing trajectory provides an opportunity to actively restore forest cover through stimulating afforestation and stimulating more sustainable land use practices. The results have clear implications for policy aimed at carbon sequestration through reducing deforestation and enhancing forest growth.

TI  - Does REDD plus Complement Law Enforcement? Evaluating Impacts of an Incipient Initiative in Madre de Dios, Peru
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Subnational initiatives to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation and enhance carbon stocks (REDD+) have been implemented across the tropics over the last decade. Such initiatives are often embedded within pre-existing conservation policies, such as forest law enforcement, making it challenging to disentangle attributable impacts. In this article, we analyze a new REDD+ project implemented in Brazil nut concessions in the southeastern Peruvian Amazon. Public law enforcement to verify compliance with Peru's Forest Law was already ongoing and intensified locally during our study period. Thus, we combine longitudinal data from remote sensing and household surveys of 197 concessionaires in a before-after control-intervention (BACI) study design to: a) evaluate the project's impacts during the 2012-2018 period on deforestation, forest degradation, and the participants' wellbeing and b) assess how the law-enforcing field inspections may have complemented the project effects. Our results show that the REDD+ initiative had insignificant effects on deforestation and forest degradation, but confirm the curbing effects of the field inspection measures on forest loss. The non-significance of the REDD+ effects may reflect delays in cash incentive payments to enrolled concessionaires, lack of careful alignment of benefit provision with project participants, and limited enforcement of project conditionalities. Most REDD+ participants reported a reduced subjective wellbeing, which may reflect the frustrated expectations associated with project implementation. We discuss the implications of our results and outline lessons for similar tropical forest conservation initiatives.

TI  - The importance of grain and cut-off size in shaping tree beta diversity along an elevational gradient in the northwest of Colombia
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Background Species turnover (beta-diversity) along elevational gradients is one of the most important concepts in plant ecology. However, there is a lack of consensus about the main driving mechanisms of tree beta-diversity at local scales in very diverse ecosystems (e.g., Andean mountains), as well as how the sampling effect can alter beta-diversity estimations. Recently, it has been hypothesized that patterns of change in beta-diversity at local scales along elevational gradients are driven by sampling effects stemming from differences in the size of the species pool rather than by underlying community assembly mechanisms. Thus, we aim to evaluate the relative extent to which sampling effects, such as species pool size, grain size, and tree size cut-off, determine species sorting, and thus, the variability of beta-diversity at local scales along elevational gradients in the northwest of Colombia. Results Using 15 1-ha permanent plots spread out along a 3000 m elevational gradient, we used standardized beta-deviation to assess the extent to which either sampling effects or the community assembly mechanisms determine the changes in species composition at local scales. Standardized beta-deviation was measured as the difference between the observed and null beta-diversity divided by the standard deviation of the null beta-diversity. We found that the magnitude of change in local beta-deviation along the elevational gradient was significant and dependent on the employed spatial grain size and tree size cut-off. However, beta-deviation increased with elevation in all sampling designs, which suggests that underlying community assembly mechanisms play a key role in shaping local beta-diversity along the elevational gradient. Conclusions Our findings suggest that grain size enlargement and the inclusion of trees with small diameters will improve our ability to quantify the extent to which the community assembly mechanisms shape patterns of beta-diversity along elevational gradients. Overall, we emphasize the scale-dependent nature of the assessment of beta-diversity. Likewise, we call for the need of a new generation of enlarged forest inventory plots along gradients of elevation in tropical forests that include small individuals to improve our understanding about the likely response of diversity and function to global change.

TI  - Estimating Aboveground Biomass of Two Different Forest Types in Myanmar from Sentinel-2 Data with Machine Learning and Geostatistical Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The accurate estimation of spatially explicit forest aboveground biomass (AGB) provides an essential basis for sustainable forest management and carbon sequestration accounting, especially in Myanmar, where there is a lack of data for forest conservation due to operational limitations. This study mapped the forest AGB using Sentinel-2 (S-2) images and Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) based on random forest (RF), stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) and Kriging algorithms in two forest reserves (Namhton and Yinmar) in Myanmar, and compared their performance against AGB measured by the traditional methods. Specifically, a suite of forest sample plots were deployed in the two forest reserves, and forest attributes were measured to calculate the plot-level AGB based on allometric equations. The spectral bands, vegetation indices (VIs) and textures derived from processed S-2 data and topographic parameters from SRTM were utilized to statistically link with field-based AGB by implementing random forest (RF) and stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) algorithms. Followed by an evaluation of the algorithmic performances, RF-based Kriging (RFK) models were employed to determine the spatial distribution of AGB as an improvement of accuracy against RF models. The study's results showed that textural measures produced from wavelet analysis (WA) and vegetation indices (VIs) from Sentinel-2 were the strongest predictors for evergreen forest reserve (Namhton) AGB prediction and spectral bands and vegetation indices (VIs) showed the highest sensitivity to the deciduous forest reserve (Yinmar) AGB prediction. The fitted models were RF-based ordinary Kriging (RFOK) for Namhton forest reserve and RF-based co-Kriging (RFCK) for Yinmar forest reserve because their respective R-2, whilst the RMSE values were validated as 0.47 and 24.91 AGB t/ha and 0.52 and 34.72 AGB t/ha, respectively. The proposed random forest Kriging framework provides robust AGB maps, which are essential to estimate the carbon sequestration potential in the context of REDD+. From this particular study, we suggest that the protection/disturbance status of forests affects AGB values directly in the study area; thus, community-participated or engaged forest utilization and conservation initiatives are recommended to promote sustainable forest management.

TI  - Coupled forest zoning and agricultural intervention yields conflicting outcomes for tropical forest conservation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Agricultural intensification and forest conservation are often seen as incompatible. Agricultural interventions can help boost food security for poor rural communities but in certain cases can exacerbate deforestation, known as the rebound effect. We tested whether coupling agricultural interventions with participatory forest zoning could improve food security and promote forest conservation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Simple agricultural interventions led to a >60% increase in cassava yields and a spill-over effect of improved cassava variety uptake in non-intervention zones. Household surveys conducted at the end of the 8 year project implementation period revealed that households that received agricultural interventions had more favorable attitudes toward forest zoning and conservation. The surveys also showed that farmers in the intervention domain practiced less land-intensive field and fallow management strategies compared to those practiced in the non-intervention domain. However, an 18 year time series analysis of Landsat satellite data revealed that agricultural expansion persisted in areas both with and without intervention assistance, and there is risk of a rebound effect. Approximately 70% of the tree cover loss that occurred outside of the agricultural areas was located within a 3 km buffer zone surrounding the outermost edges of the agricultural areas, which suggested that the majority of tree cover loss was caused by agricultural expansion. Within that 3 km buffer, average annual tree cover loss during the post-intervention period was higher in the intervention domain compared to the non-intervention domain (0.17% yr(-1) compared to 0.11% yr(-1) respectively, p < 0.001), suggesting risk of a rebound effect. The disconnection between household perceptions of zoning adherence and actual behavior indicates the importance of strengthening governance structures for community-based monitoring and enforcement.

TI  - Degradation of tropical forest in Hainan, China, 1991-2008: Conservation implications for Hainan Gibbon (Nomascus hainanus)
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - The Hainan gibbon (Nomascus hainanus) is one of the most endangered primates in the world, confined to mature natural forest in Hainan Island, China. We assessed changes in habitat condition on the island between 1991 and 2008, using vegetation maps generated by remote-sensing images. We defined forest suitable for gibbons based on composition, tree size and canopy cover. During the 17-year period, the area of suitable gibbon forest decreased by 540 km(2) (35%) across the whole island, and by 6.3 km(2) (7%) in the locality of the sole remaining gibbon population at Bawangling National Nature Reserve. The forest patches large enough (>1 km(2)) to support a gibbon group decreased from 754 km(2) to 316 km(2) in total area, and from 92 to 64 in number. Suitable natural forest was mainly replaced by plantations below 760 m, or degraded by logging, grazing and planting of pines above 760 m. Meanwhile, forests in former confirmed gibbon areas became more fragmented: mean area of patches decreased by 53%. We mapped the patches of natural forest in good condition which could potentially support gibbons. We recommend a freeze on further expansion of plantations between core patches at Bawangling, Jiaxi-Houmiling and Yinggeling Nature Reserves in accordance with forest protection regulations; establishment of nature reserves in currently unprotected natural forest patches elsewhere in line with the local government's nature reserve expansion policy; and active natural-forest restoration between remaining fragments at Bawangling.

TI  - Modelling Spatial and Temporal Forest Cover Change Patterns (1973-2020): A Case Study from South Western Ghats (India)
T2  - SENSORS
AB  - This study used time series remote sensing data from 1973, 1990 and 2004 to assess spatial forest cover change patterns in the Kalakad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve (KMTR), South Western Ghats (India). Analysis of forest cover changes and its causes are the most challenging areas of landscape ecology, especially due to the absence of temporal ground data and comparable space platform based data. Comparing remotely sensed data from three different sources with sensors having different spatial and spectral resolution presented a technical challenge. Quantitative change analysis over a long period provided a valuable insight into forest cover dynamics in this area. Time-series maps were combined within a geographical information system (GIS) with biotic and abiotic factors for modelling its future change. The land-cover change has been modelled using GEOMOD and predicted for year 2020 using the current disturbance scenario. Comparison of the forest change maps over the 31-year period shows that evergreen forest being degraded (16%) primarily in the form of selective logging and clear felling to raise plantations of coffee, tea and cardamom. The natural disturbances such as forest fire, wildlife grazing, invasions after clearance and soil erosion induced by anthropogenic pressure over the decades are the reasons of forest cover change in KMTR. The study demonstrates the role of remote sensing and GIS in monitoring of large-coverage of forest area continuously for a given region over time more precisely and in cost-effective manner which will be ideal for conservation planning and prioritization.

TI  - Forest biomass recovery after conventional and reduced-impact logging in Amazonian Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Growing concerns about unnecessarily destructive selective logging of tropical forests and its impacts on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions motivated this study on post-logging biomass dynamics over a 16-year period in a control plot and in plots subjected to conventional logging (CL) or reduced-impact logging (RIL) in Paragominas, Para State, Brazil. All trees >25 cm were monitored in 25.4 ha plots of each treatment, each with a subplot of 5.25 ha for trees >10 cm dbh. The commercial timber volumes in felled trees were 38.9 and 37.4 m(3) ha(-1) in the RIL and CL plots, respectively, but the extracted volumes were 38.6 and 29.7 m(3) ha(-1), respectively. Immediately after logging, plots subjected to RIL and CL lost 17% and 26% of their above-ground biomass, respectively. Over the 16 years after logging, the average annual increments in above-ground biomass (recruitment plus residual tree growth minus mortality) were 2.8 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) in the RIL plot but only 0.5 Mg ha(-1) year in the CL plot. By 16 years post-logging, the RIL plot recovered 100% of its original above-ground biomass while the CL plot recovered only 77%; over the same period, biomass in the control plot maintained 96% of its initial stock. These findings reinforce the claim that conversion from CL to RIL would represent an efficient forest-based strategy to mitigate climate change under the REDD+ and would be an important step towards sustainable forest management.

TI  - The impact of land use on the acoustic behaviour of cicadas in the Chocó lowland tropical forest of Ecuador
T2  - INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY
AB  - The biodiversity of tropical rainforests is under extreme pressure due to the expansion of agricultural land. Beyond the immediate risk of species extinction, the intensification of land use can alter species' behaviour with consequences for the entire ecosystem. In this study we investigated the impact of land use on the acoustic behaviour of cicadas in the highly biodiverse Ecuadorian Choc & oacute; region. We used passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) for the collection of audio data, from which we identified and analysed the sound activity of cicadas and the structure of daily patterns along a chronosequence of forest recovery. At landscape scale we studied the impact of a surrounding either dominated by agricultural land use or forests on the acoustic behaviour of cicadas. Cicada sound activity was significantly lower in active agriculture compared to undisturbed old-growth forest and increased along the forest recovery gradient. The diurnal pattern changed from simple in active agriculture to more complex and highly synchronized along the recovery gradient towards old-growth forests. A surrounding dominated by agricultural land use additionally reduced the sound activity of cicadas and simplified the diurnal pattern in old-growth forests. Taken together, agricultural land use at local and landscape scales affects overall activity, diurnal patterns and synchrony of vocalizing song cicadas. This is a concerning trend considering the direct link between chorusing and fitness for cicadas. However, mature restoration forests embedded in forest dominated landscape surroundings showed restored cicada song behaviours similar to those of old-growth forests, which underlines the conservation value of advanced secondary forests and the importance to support forest regeneration in the tropics.

TI  - Too rare for non-timber resource harvest? Meso-scale composition and distribution of arborescent palms in an Amazonian sustainable-use forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Arborescent palms can provide an important source of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) within tropical forest REDD+ frameworks. To identify the NTFP potential of arborescent palms, we examined mesoscale patterns of abundance and distribution within a sustainable-use protected area in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. To understand the environmental correlates of observed patterns we evaluated the effects of topography, hydrography and geographic space on the presence, density and biomass of adult arborescent palms. Adult palms were sampled in 30 (250 x 20 m) plots systematically distributed within a 25-km(2) grid. Topographic and hydrographic variables were derived from a remotely sensed digital elevation model. Spatial correlations in the explanatory and response variables were examined using Mantel tests and GLMs. To test for evidence of dispersal limitation, semi-variograms were used to examine spatial patterns in GLM residuals. Adult arborescent palms were rare occurring in only 12 of the 30 plots. In total, we recorded 118 individuals from six species (Bactris maraja, Euterpe oleracea, Iriartella setigera, Oenocarpus bacaba, Oenocarpus bataua and Oenocarpus minor). This corresponded to a mean live above-ground biomass per plot of 0.85 Mg ha(-1) (range: 0-28.1 Mg ha(-1)). Hydrographic and topographic variables suggest that environmental conditions are suitable for E. oleracea, an economically important species. The presence, biomass, and density of palms were uncorrelated with geographic distances among plots. The hydrographic model significantly explained variation in palm presence and biomass, whereas density was only explained by the topographic model. Our findings indicate that arborescent palms are currently too rare to be efficiently harvested as NTFPs in the study area. Yet, comparisons with published estimates suggest that there is significant potential for agroforestry to facilitate the commercialization of palm NTFPs for community based extractive activities.

TI  - The development of a forestry geodatabase for natural forest management plans in Costa Rica
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Forest management data is available for many tropical countries, representing a large and spatially rich source of tree level data. Over the past decade, we have collected and digitized over 1000 Costa Rican natural forest management plans, spanning 30 years and spread out over approximately 26,700 km(2) along the country's Atlantic coast, northern lowlands, and southern Pacific coast. In order to analyze this unique collection of tree inventory data we developed a system to ensure the standardization, quality control, and reliable management of the dataset. We developed a relational geodatabase, forming logical associations between and within the spatial and tabular components of the forest management data. In this study, we outline the data standardization procedures established to permit the comparison of data across time and space. Further, we describe quality checks built-into the database's functionality to identify and reduce the presence of errors. The final customized forest management geodatabase efficiently stores a large and diverse dataset through the integration of logical relations, quality checks, and flexible data access across 32 tables and over 250,000 tree records. Through the use of quality tests, the database provides a means to improve overall data integrity and illustrates the magnitude, sources, and types of errors present in the initial dataset. Finally, the value of a comprehensive database for the management of forest data is demonstrated through an exploratory analysis of standardized tree taxonomic information. With this analysis, we begin to explore the potential strengths, weaknesses, and applications of forest management data for future ecological studies (e.g. species diversity assessment). For instance, although most of the forest management data (tree inventories and censuses) is collected using common names in the field, our standardization process has allowed us to depict trends similar to those found in ecological studies (e.g. dominant species for different ecosystems). Overall, our forestry geodatabase represents the most complete record of natural forest management practices in Costa Rica to date. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Lessons learned from 25 years of operational large-scale restoration: The Sow-A-Seed project, Sabah, Borneo
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - While restoration projects globally scale-up to meet the growing demand to restore degraded ecosystems, data on the long-term benefits of restoration are still rare. Here, we describe the lessons learned from the Sow-A-Seed project in Sabah, Borneo: a long-term and large-scale restoration project launched in 1998 with the aim to rehabilitate 18,500 ha of tropical rainforest degraded by logging and forest fires. The project was built from the ground-up, including establishment of essential infrastructure and knowledge creation via trial-and-error. Three restoration techniques were used depending on the level of degradation; 1) Assisted Natural Regeneration (weeding, climber cutting and selective girdling) to promote natural regeneration of late-successional species in the least disturbed forests, and; 2) Enrichment Planting in gap-clusters in moderately disturbed forests, and; 3) Enrichment Planting in rows (i.e, line-planting) throughout heavily degraded forests with no- or few late successional tree species in the overstory. The project includes successful propagation of 92 native tree species including dipterocarps and fruit trees, and planting of over 5 million trees during the last 25 years. Long-term monitoring shows that the mortality rate of planted seedlings is -15% per year up to 3 years, but decreases to -2% between years 3-10 and 10-20. One of the largest trees, a Shorea leprosula planted in 1998, is now 74 cm in DBH and some planted trees have reached reproductive age and are contributing to natural regeneration. A range of wildlife including orangutans, elephants, hornbills and all five wildcat species in Sabah have been documented in the area. In 2015, the area was classified as a Class 1 protected forest, the highest level of conservation status in Malaysia, and removed from commercial forestry. We highlight that there is much knowledge to be gained by research dove-tailing with operational activities, and we encourage that the lessons learned from operational restoration are shared among practitioners and restoration ecologists. We present 8 key lessons learned from the Sow-a-Seed project.

TI  - Growth and drought resilience of four native tree species suitable for reforestation of Brazil's Atlantic Forest
T2  - FORESTRY
AB  - Deforestation of tropical forests has been a critical issue affecting climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation. Reforestation strives to remedy this situation, yet it is futile as long as deforestation of primary forests continues. Since deforestation is partly motivated by the demand for valuable tropical wood, reforestation should focus not only on planting native tree species, but specifically on a high diversity of native tree species with high-quality wood. However, the eco-physiological information required for growing such species is limited, and their resilience to drought events is unknown.Here, we focused on four native tropical wood tree species identified as suitable for Brazil's Atlantic Forest reforestation. Growth, carbon assimilation, water-use and xylem hydraulics were studied in seedlings of the two legume species Dalbergia nigra and Plathymenia foliolosa and the two non-legume species Cariniana legalis and Zeyheria tuberculosa. Seedlings were monitored weekly for 9 consecutive weeks, three to five weeks of which under induced drought. Growth and carbon assimilation were 25-65 per cent higher in the legume vs. non-legume species. In turn, non-legume species mostly avoided the drought by stomatal closure, producing a 50 per cent higher water-use efficiency (WUE) compared with the legume species. The average water potential at 50 per cent stomatal conductivity (?(gs50)) for legume species was -2.6 MPa, whereas for non-legume species it was -0.85 MPa. Still, each species showed a unique set of responses, indicating different growth strategies under mesic and xeric conditions. Our results indicate a divergence among legume and non-legume species, driven by a trade-off between plant productivity (carbon assimilation and growth) and plant safety (stomatal regulation and WUE). All in all, the four species of juvenile potted plants demonstrated a high capacity for recovery from drought, which supports their potential role in future reforestation under climate change.

TI  - Allometric relationships and reforestation guidelines for Maclura tinctoria, an important multi-purpose timber tree of Latin America
T2  - NEW FORESTS
AB  - As reforestation and restoration processes gain momentum across the world native tree species are being established for production, conservation and restoration purposes in agricultural landscapes. One such tree with promise is dinde [Maclura tinctoria (L.) D. Don ex Steud]; a multi-purpose, Neotropical tree species that is being widely introduced on to farms of the coffee axis region in the Latin American Andes. No formal studies have been made that examine its potential for reforestation. In this study we aim to measure and define the relationships between age, bole size (dbh), tree height, and crown size of planted dinde trees for the development of spacing guidelines at time of planting and for thinning. We also sought to identify whether tree growth is influenced by various measures of soil fertility. We studied these relationships on dinde trees planted at twelve farms in the central Andean foothills of Colombia. Our results are the first to show dinde has comparable growth to other native and exotic trees used for reforestation in Latin America. Strong relationships exist for tree age and diameter at breast height (DBH) with crown size and height. Based on these relationships we developed spacing and thinning guidelines for timber production in plantation and silvo-pastoral circumstances. Soils were generally fertile but varied between farms. Growth varied with soil primarily related to pH and calcium, and secondly to soil nitrogen and organic matter. Our results provide preliminary information for the forester and/or the farmer on expected growth and size relationships for given ages in relation to soil fertility for planted trees. As more trees are planted on a wider array of soils and providing a greater diversity of ages further studies are necessary for refining guidelines.

TI  - Conservation and development projects in the Brazilian Amazon: Lessons from the community initiative program in Rondonia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Community-based conservation and development has become the prevailing programmatic paradigm of conservation organizations and development donors over the last 20 years, spawning a myriad of integrated conservation and development projects (ICDP) around the world. Appealing for its ambitious aspiration to harmonize sustainable economic development at the local level with the conservation of legally established protected areas (e.g., parks and reserves), the ICDP approach recently has drawn criticism from conservation biologists for failing to ensure adequate protection of biodiversity. Development planners and economists have also raised questions about the financial sustainability of ICDPs in practice and the replicability of the model from highly local contexts to larger regional scales, This paper briefly reviews the central elements of the concept of integrated conservation and development and the emerging debate over its effectiveness, A description of the Community Initiative Program (CIP), a pilot program of the Rondonia Natural Resources Management project (PLANAFLORO) in the western Brazilian Amazon state of Rondonia, follows. The CIP is a significant experiment because it boldly attempted to apply the principles of ICDP to the regional scale involving numerous different communities in one program simultaneously. Based on the author's mid-term review of the CIP in 1999, the development and conservation impacts of the program are considered. While the CIP has not significantly curbed the degradation of protected areas in Rondonia as intended, the evidence suggests lower rates of deforestation in municipios (i.e. counties) with the highest concentrations of CIP projects, Although the economic development impacts are mixed, approximately 50% of the projects delivered tangible benefits to local communities. Lessons learned from the CIP are presented in the final section. Among the lessons learned from the CIP, detailed in the final section, are several that will be familiar to other ICDP evaluators: the importance of thematic coherence in initial project design, the need for explicit attention on environmental conservation objectives, deficient institutional capacity of implementing organizations, inadequate attention to women's concerns and roles in community projects, and lack of technical criteria for measuring project sustainability.

TI  - Impact of Fire on Secondary Forest Succession in a Sub-Tropical Landscape
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - In Hong Kong, as in many tropical areas, grasslands are maintained by fire on disturbed and abandoned land. However, Hong Kong's native forests are regenerating in many areas, alongside frequent burning of the hillsides, and are in different stages of structural succession to closed canopy forest patches. Understanding the major determinants of secondary succession is a vital input to forest management policies. Given the importance of forests for biodiversity conservation, watershed protection and carbon cycling. This study examines the relationship between burning regimes and structural forest succession over 42 years from 1973 to 2015, using an archive of satellite images, aerial photographs and field plot data. Overlay of a fire frequency map with maps of forest structural classes at different dates indicates the number of fires undergone by each successional class as well as the time taken to progress from one class to another under different fire regimes. Results indicate that the native sub-tropical evergreen forests, which are naturally fire intolerant, can regenerate alongside moderate burning, and once the shrub stage is reached, succession to closed forest is relatively rapid and can occur within 13 years. More than one burn, however, is more destructive, and twice-burnt areas were seen to have only one-third of the woody biomass of once-burnt plots. The most frequent fires occurred in areas where mono-cultural plantations had been destroyed by disease in the 1960s and were subsequently invaded by grasslands. These former plantation areas remained in early successional stages of grass and open shrubland by 2015. Other plantations from the 1970s and 1980s remain as plantations today and have acted as a barrier to natural forest succession, attesting to the greater effectiveness of fire control over re-afforestation measures.

TI  - Simplification of a coffee foliage-dwelling beetle community under low-shade management
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Coffee agroforests may be structurally and floristically complex and may contain a significant fraction of species from biodiverse and threatened tropical montane forest biotas; hence, understanding the dynamics of tropical forest biodiversity in coffee agroecosystems has emerged as a centrally important area of tropical conservation biology research. We conducted a morphospecies analysis on foliage-dwelling beetles collected from coffee plants on four coffee farms in southern Chiapas, Mexico, to characterize variation in the abundance, species richness, and species composition of this mega-diverse taxon in relation to coffee cultivation system, spatio-temporal variation, and predator removal. We constructed thirty-two cages to exclude birds and bats on four farms, each enclosing 7-10 coffee plants and paired with an adjacent uncaged control plot, and then collected beetles from coffee foliage with D-Vac aspirators in each plot once every 3 months for one year.
   We classified the 2662 beetles collected into 293 morphospecies, representing 42 families of beetles. Extrapolation and interpolation analyses revealed a very high level of species richness, with no plateau and only a slight leveling trend observed in our species accumulation curves. We found that low-shade systems contain equal or higher beetle abundance, lower species richness, more highly homogenized species composition, and higher abundance of coffee berry borer pests on coffee foliage than do high-shade systems. We observed no effect of flying vertebrate exclusion on the coffee foliage beetle assemblage, but did find significant variation in abundance, species richness, and species composition of coffee foliage beetles across seasons and Study sites.
   The increased beetle biodiversity of high-shade coffee cultivation systems has important implications both for the preservation of native biodiversity in coffee growing regions and for the control of agricultural pests such as the coffee berry borer.

TI  - Fragmentation and matrix contrast favor understory plants through negative cascading effects on a strong competitor palm
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Understanding the patterns and processes driving biodiversity maintenance in fragmented tropical forests is urgently needed for conservation planning, especially in species-rich forest reserves. Of particular concern are the effects that habitat modifications at the landscape scale may have on forest regeneration and ecosystem functioning: a topic that has received limited attention. Here, we assessed the effects of landscape structure (i.e., forest cover, open area matrices, forest fragmentation, and mean inter-patch isolation distance) on understory plant assemblages in the Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve, Mexico. Previous studies suggest that the demographic burst of the strong competitor palm Astrocaryum mexicanum in the core area of this reserve limits plant recruitment and imperils biodiversity conservation within this protected area. Yet, the local and landscape predictors of this palm, and its impact on tree recruitment at a regional scale are unknown. Thus, we used structural equationmodeling to assess the direct and cascading effects of landscape structure on stem and species density in the understory of 20 forest sites distributed across this biodiversity hotspot. Indirect paths included the effect of landscape structure on tree basal area (a proxy of local disturbance), and the effects of these variables on A. mexicanum. Density of A. mexicanum mainly increased with decreasing both fragmentation and open areas in the matrix (matrix contrast, hereafter), and such an increase in palm density negatively affected stem and species density in the understory. The negative direct effect of matrix contrast on stem density was overridden by the indirect positive effects (i.e., through negative cascading effects on A. mexicanum), resulting in a weak effect of matrix contrast on stem density. These findings suggest that dispersal limitation and negative edge effects in more fragmented landscapes dominated by open areas prevent the proliferation of this palm species, enhancing the diversity and abundance of understory trees. This "positive" news adds to an increasing line of evidence suggesting that fragmentation may have some positive effects on biodiversity, in this case by preventing the proliferation of species that can jeopardize biodiversity conservation within tropical reserves.

TI  - Phylogenetic age is positively correlated with sensitivity to timber harvest in bornean mammals
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - The reasons that forest vertebrates differ in their response to selective timber extraction in tropical forests remain poorly characterized. Understanding what determines response and sensitivity can indicate how forest management might yield greater conservation benefits, and help us identify which lesser-known species may be especially vulnerable. We assessed the response of 41 Bornean mammals to selective timber harvest and tested eight hypotheses regarding the correlation between those responses and a range of species characteristics. Multivariate analyses show that phylogenetic species age is a key variable determining sensitivity. Older species are less able to cope with the effects of selective timber harvest. Most of these species are endemic to insular southeast Asia, and do not occur on the Asian mainland. These species are more specialized, and appear less able to cope with habitat change. In contrast, species tolerant to logging evolved more recently. This group tends to be omnivorous or herbivorous, to use all vegetation strata, and to be regionally widespread. This finding allows the sensitivity to habitat disturbance of lesser-known species to be predicted, and therefore has important conservation implications. These new insights also help in the design of large-scale forest landscapes that combine sustainable forest management and species conservation requirements. We recognize that these functions can be compatible, but that some species still need completely protected areas for their survival.

TI  - Post-Crackdown Effectiveness of Field-Based Forest Law Enforcement in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Regulatory enforcement of forest conservation laws is often dismissed as an ineffective approach to reducing tropical forest loss. Yet, effective enforcement is often a precondition for alternative conservation measures, such as payments for environmental services, to achieve desired outcomes. Fair and efficient policies to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) will thus crucially depend on understanding the determinants and requirements of enforcement effectiveness. Among potential REDD candidate countries, Brazil is considered to possess the most advanced deforestation monitoring and enforcement infrastructure. This study explores a unique dataset of over 15 thousand point coordinates of enforcement missions in the Brazilian Amazon during 2009 and 2010, after major reductions of deforestation in the region. We study whether local deforestation patterns have been affected by field-based enforcement and to what extent these effects vary across administrative boundaries. Spatial matching and regression techniques are applied at different spatial resolutions. We find that field-based enforcement operations have not been universally effective in deterring deforestation during our observation period. Inspections have been most effective in reducing large-scale deforestation in the states of Mato Grosso and Para, where average conservation effects were 4.0 and 9.9 hectares per inspection, respectively. Despite regional and actor-specific heterogeneity in inspection effectiveness, field-based law enforcement is highly cost-effective on average and might be enhanced by closer collaboration between national and state-level authorities.

TI  - Household land management and biodiversity: Secondary succession in a forest-agriculture mosaic in southern Mexico
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - This study evaluates anthropogenic and ecological dimensions of secondary forest succession in Mexico's southern Yucatan peninsular region, a hotspot of biodiversity and tropical deforestation. Secondary succession in particular constitutes an ecologically and economically important process, driven by and strongly influencing land management and local ecosystem structure and dynamics. As agents of local land management, smallholding farmers in communal, i.e., ejido lands affect rates of forest change, biodiversity, and sustainability within and beyond their land parcels. This research uses household surveys and land parcel mapping in two ejidos located along the buffer of the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve to analyze how household socioeconomics and policy institutions drive allocations to successional forests in traditional crop fallows and in enriched fallows. Results indicate that household tenancy, livestock holdings, labor-consumer ratios, and receipts of agricultural subsidies are the strongest determinants of traditional fallow areas. Whereas the latter two factors also influence enriched successions, local agroforestry and reforestation programs were the strongest drivers of fallow enrichment. Additionally, the study conducts field vegetation sampling in a nested design within traditional and enriched fallow sites to comparatively assess biodiversity consequences of fallow management. Although enriched fallows display greater species richness in 10x10 m plots and 2x2 m quadrats, plot-scale data reveal no significant differences in Shannon-Wiener or Simpson's diversity indices. Traditional fallows display greater species heterogeneity at the quadrat scale, however, indicating a complex relationship of diversity to fallow management over time. The article discusses the implications of the social and ecological analyses for land change research and conservation policies.

TI  - Potential of dendrochronology in assessing carbon sequestration rates of Vitellaria paradoxa in southern Mali, West Africa
T2  - DENDROCHRONOLOGIA
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the applicability of dendrochronology for assessing the growth dynamics and response to climate variability and to estimate the aboveground carbon stock and carbon sequestration potential of Vitellaria paradoxa in southern Mali. Twenty stem disks were collected from three land-use types (parklands, fallows and protected areas) in Koutiala and Yanfolila districts. We cornbined a standard dendrochronological approach with biomass allometric equations to estimate the growth and carbon stocks. The results showed that V. paradoxa forms distinct growth ring boundaries but most of the disks from parklands did not successfully cross-date due to management operations like pruning. The tree-ring width showed a significant standardized coefficient of regression with rainfall (r(2) = 0.66, p < 0.001) but insignificant correlation with temperature. One-way analysis of variance showed no significant difference (p > 0.05) for C-sequestration as well as for carbon stocks in aboveground biomass for both land-use types and sites. Mean values of the amount of C-sequestered in Yanfolila were 0.112 +/- 0.0.065 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in parklands, 0.075 +/- 0.018 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in fallows and 0.064 +/- 0.028 Mg C ha-(1) yr(-1) in protected areas. In Koutiala, the values were 0.068 +/- 0.020 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in the parklands and 0.053 +/- 0.017 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in the fallows. These results clearly indicate that dendrochronology can be applied to assess growth and carbon sequestration potential of V. paradoxa. These results also suggest that climate change could affect the growth and carbon sequestration potential of V. paradoxa. Given the limited size of our sample, figures on the amount of carbon are indicative calling for applying the tested approaches to larger samples and also to other tree species in West Africa.

TI  - Assessing the effectiveness of a land zoning policy in the Dry Chaco. The Case of Santiago del Estero, Argentina
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Land use zoning has been proposed as an instrument to steer sustainable land use and reduce deforestation. Its effectiveness is a growing concern among researchers and decision makers. Nowadays, the dry forests of the Argentine Chaco are a global hotspot of deforestation, where a zoning policy has been established through the enactment of a National Forest Law. The law imposed on the provinces the obligation to define land use zones in their native forests. Ten years after the enforcement of the National Forest Law, we assessed the effectiveness of the zoning policy of Santiago del Estero, one of Argentina's provinces with higher deforestation rates. For this, we combined the provincial forest zoning with the extent of forest cover and a plot level land transformation geodatabase. The deforested area halved during the five-year period after the enactment of the law, decreasing from 910 10(3) ha in 2003-2008 (i.e. before the law) to 450 10(3) ha in 2009-2014. Most of this forest cover loss (257 10(3) ha) occurred in areas classified under categories where deforestation was forbidden. After the enactment of the Law, annual deforestation rates decreased mostly in areas that allowed deforestation, slightly decreased in areas where deforestation was forbidden and increased in areas where a certain level of deforestation was allowed, although above that level. Despite the reductions in deforestation rates, our results suggest that the zoning policy in Santiago del Estero was not effective enough, since deforestation occurred in forbidden areas and generally surpassed the level of deforestation permitted. Alternative coercive mechanisms (e.g. more severe penalties for offenders) and greater efforts to detect illegal clearings are needed to enhance the effectiveness of the Forest Law.

T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Combining protected areas with natural forest timber concessions may sustain larger forest landscapes than is possible via protected areas alone. However, the role of timber concessions in maintaining natural forest remains poorly characterized. An estimated 57% (303,525 km(2)) of Kalimantan's land area (532,100 km(2)) was covered by natural forest in 2000. About 14,212 km(2) (4.7%) had been cleared by 2010. Forests in oil palm concessions had been reduced by 5,600 km(2) (14.1%), while the figures for timber concessions are 1,336 km(2) (1.5%), and for protected forests are 1,122 km(2) (1.2%). These deforestation rates explain little about the relative performance of the different land use categories under equivalent conversion risks due to the confounding effects of location. An estimated 25% of lands allocated for timber harvesting in 2000 had their status changed to industrial plantation concessions in 2010. Based on a sample of 3,391 forest plots (161 km; 100 ha), and matching statistical analyses, 2000-2010 deforestation was on average 17.6 ha lower (95% C. I.: -22.3 ha--212.9 ha) in timber concession plots than in oil palm concession plots. When location effects were accounted for, deforestation rates in timber concessions and protected areas were not significantly different (Mean difference: 0.35 ha; 95% C. I.: -0.002 ha-0.7 ha). Natural forest timber concessions in Kalimantan had similar ability as protected areas to maintain forest cover during 2000-2010, provided the former were not reclassified to industrial plantation concessions. Our study indicates the desirability of the Government of Indonesia designating its natural forest timber concessions as protected areas under the IUCN Protected Area Category VI to protect them from reclassification.

TI  - Close-to-nature management of tropical timber plantations is economically viable and provides biodiversity benefits
T2  - FORESTRY
AB  - Reforestation of tropical forests is crucial to mitigate the climate crisis and restore ecosystems. However, past efforts have been criticized for establishing monoculture timber plantations with exotic tree species. Close-to-nature (CTN) practices aim to minimize negative forest management impacts on forests ecosystems by mimicking natural dynamics. So far, CTN management practices are rarely applied in tropical plantation forestry. This study evaluates the economic, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity potential of CTN management in tropical mixed-species plantations in Central America using a simulation-optimization approach. To our knowledge, this study is the first to assess the potential of tropical CTN-managed plantations on the basis of detailed process-based forest growth simulations. CTN practices such as selective harvesting, retention forestry, and shelterwood cutting of mixed-species stands were compared to even-aged mixtures and conventional monoculture practices. Results showed that CTN management was economically viable for certain species mixtures and management practices at an 8 % discount rate and had the potential to increase carbon storage and biodiversity in the modeled plantations. At current carbon prices, CTN-managed plantations may only become financially competitive with monocultures, if monocultures are excluded from carbon certification schemes that increasingly aim at co-producing non-carbon benefits like biodiversity conservation. If carbon prices increase, the sale of carbon credits could finance the transformation of monocultures to CTN-managed mixed-species stands. The competitiveness of CTN management could also be improved through performance-based biodiversity payments, such as the sale of biodiversity credits.

TI  - SELECTION OF SPECIES FROM NATURAL FOREST AND INDICATION OF PLANTING DENSITY FOR RECLAMATION OF DEGRADED AREAS IN THE AMAZON FOREST
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
AB  - The identification of species influencing the occurrence of other associated species is of fundamental importance for the success of forest restoration of degraded areas. The objective of this work is to present a phytosociological and socioeconomic index (IFSE), obtained by techniques of factor analysis, modeling six quantitative variables (abundance, frequency, dominance, biomass, the commercial value of timber and amount of non-timber forest products) and equal number of qualitative variables, whose dummy variable is equal to one, assumed value for those species whose higher earnings amounted to 50 % of the total for each quantitative variables analyzed. Sampling of the dense rain forest (407 ha) was composed by 80 plots of 0.25 ha (4.91 % of sampling intensity) and all individuals with diameter at 1.30 m above the ground (DBH) >= 10 cm were identified and measured. It was recorded 10,105 individuals, including 493 species covering 58 families. The species were ranked by the index proposed in three categories of priority phytosociological and socioeconomic status (high, medium and low). The appropriateness of factor analysis was determined by tests of Bartlett and KMO. The Bartlett's test evaluated the overall significance of the correlation matrix and indicated that correlations were significant at 1 % probability. The KMO test showed that the variables were correlated and the model of variance showed a very good level of fitness to the data. These results endorsed the use of factor analysis to extract factors and estimate the factor scores. The results were statistically validated for construction of the index IFSE and 25 species were selected as the priority ones (key species). And also, it was recomended the planting density for these forest species for restoration of degraded areas in Amazonia.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of plant and animal biodiversity indicators in tropical forest and agroforest habitats
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - P>1. Biodiversity data are needed for conservation and management of tropical habitats, but the high diversity of these ecosystems makes comprehensive surveys prohibitively expensive and indicator taxa reflecting the biodiversity patterns of other taxa are frequently used. Few studies have produced the necessary comprehensive data sets to assess the quality of the indicator groups, however, and only one previous study has considered the monetary costs involved in sampling them.
   2. We surveyed four plant groups (herbs, liverworts, trees, lianas) and eight animal groups (ants, canopy and dung beetles, birds, butterflies, bees, wasps and the parasitoids of the latter two) in 15 plots of 50 x 50 m2 each, representing undisturbed rainforest and two types of cacao agroforest in Sulawesi, Indonesia. We calculated three biodiversity measures (alpha and beta diversity; percentage of species indicative of habitat conditions), built simple and multiple regression models among species groups (single groups, combinations of 2-11 groups, averaged relative diversity of all 12 groups), and related these to three measures of survey cost (absolute costs and two approaches correcting for different sampling intensities).
   3. Determination coefficients (R2 values) of diversity patterns between single study groups were generally low (< 0 center dot 25), while the consideration of several study groups increased R2 values to up to 0 center dot 8 for combinations of four groups, and to almost 1 center dot 0 for combinations of 11 groups. Survey costs varied 10-fold between study groups, but their cost-effectiveness (indicator potential versus monetary cost) varied strongly depending on the biodiversity aspect taken into account (alpha or beta diversity, single or multiple groups, etc.).
   4. Synthesis and applications. We found that increasing the number of taxa resulted in best overall biodiversity indication. We thus propose that the most cost-efficient approach to general tropical biodiversity inventories is to increase taxonomic coverage by selecting taxa with the lowest survey costs.

TI  - Tree performance in a biodiversity enrichment experiment in an oil palm landscape
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Large-scale conversion of tropical forests into oil palm monocultures has led to dramatic losses of biodiversity and ecosystem functions. While ecological restoration is urgently needed in many oil palm landscapes, there is a lack of scientific knowledge of sustainable management strategies. We established experimental tree islands of varying sizes (25 m(2) to 1,600 m(2)) and diversity levels (1, 2, 3 and 6 species) in an oil palm plantation in Sumatra, Indonesia. Six native multi-purpose tree species including Archidendron pauciflorum (Jengkol), Durio zibethinus (Durian), Parkia speciosa (Petai), Shorea leprosula (Meranti), Peronema canescens (Sungkai) and Dyera polyphylla (Jelutung) were planted between living and felled oil palms. Here, we analyse the controlling factors of tree growth and survival during the first 4 years at the level of local neighbourhood and tree island. We found a significant effect of diversity levels on tree productivity, that is, basal area was higher in multi-species than in single-species tree islands. This overyielding was attributed to enhanced tree growth, while mortality had no effect. In the local neighbourhood, tree species richness had a positive effect on tree growth during the first year only, indicating that selection and dominance of well-performing species at high level of diversity are most likely driving overyielding. Trees grew better away from living oil palms, suggesting tree-palm competition. Proximity to felled oil palms increased growth especially during the first years, during which the planted trees might have benefited from the additional available space and resources. Despite positive edge effects from the conventional oil palm management in the surrounding, tree island size had an overall positive effect on tree growth. Synthesis and applications. We planted native trees in an oil palm landscape following a tree island pattern. The establishment success differed widely among the six planted species. The selection of particular species is a decisive factor to foster a positive relationship between diversity and tree growth. Planting larger tree islands (e.g. 1,600 square metres) is a better option to enhance tree growth, but tree-palm competition implies a trade-off between tree growth and palm oil production in the tree islands.

TI  - Soil Mesofauna in Differents Systems of Land Use Soil in Upper River Solimoes, AM, Brazil
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - The mesofauna has an important function in the soil and it is represented mainly by Acari Oribatida and Collembola. We report the first data on the density and diversity of the soil mesofauna in Benjamin Constant, Amazonas State, Brazil. The following systems were evaluated: primary forest, secondary forest, agroforestry system, cultivated areas and pastures. A total of 101 samples were collected 100 m apart from each other and specimens were collected by using Berlese-Tullgren method. The highest density was registered in secondary forest (29,776 specimens.m(-2)). Acari Oribatida was the dominant group (7.072 specimens.m(-2)) in the pasture, suggesting that mites show higher capacity of adaptation to disturbed environments and/or due to the presence of gregarious species. The density of Collembola (5,632 specimens.m(-2)) was higher in secondary forest. Formicidae was the dominant group (27,824 specimens.m(-2)) and its highest density occurred in the secondary forest (12,336 specimens.m-2). Seven species and ten morphospecies of Isoptera and three species of Symphyla were identified. The highest density and diversity were found in secondary forest. One supposes that the low density of mesofauna found in all of the studied systems is being influenced by soil structure and composition as well as litter volume. For SUT, the composition of taxonomic groups in the cultivated areas is similar to the one found in primary forest, while the groups found in the agroforestry system are similar to those in the pasture, which may help to decide on land use strategies.

TI  - Mixed-species allometric equations and estimation of aboveground biomass and carbon stocks in restoring degraded landscape in northern Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Accurate biomass estimation is critical to quantify the changes in biomass and carbon stocks following the restoration of degraded landscapes. However, there is lack of site-specific allometric equations for the estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB), which consequently limits our understanding of the contributions of restoration efforts in mitigating climate change. This study was conducted in northwestern Ethiopia to develop a multi-species allometric equation and investigate the spatial and temporal variation of C-stocks following the restoration of degraded landscapes. We harvested and weighed 84 trees from eleven dominant species from six grazing exclosures and adjacent communal grazing land. We observed that AGB correlates significantly with diameter at stump height D-30 (R-2 = 0.78; P<0.01), and tree height H (R-2 = 0.41, P<0.05). Our best model, which includes D-30 and H as predictors explained 82% of the variations in AGB. This model produced the lowest bias with narrow ranges of errors across different diameter classes. Estimated C-stock showed a significant positive correlation with stem density (R-2 = 0.80, P<0.01) and basal area (R-2 = 0.84, P<0.01). At the watershed level, the mean C-stock was 3.8 (+/- 0.5) MgCha(-1). Plot-level C-stocks varied between 0.1 and 13.7MgCha(-1). Estimated C-stocks in three-and seven-year-old exclosures exceeded estimated C-stock in the communal grazing land by 50%. The species that contribute most to C-stocks were Leucaena sp. (28%), Calpurnia aurea (21%), Euclea racemosa (20.9%), and Dodonaea angustifolia (15.8%). The equations developed in this study allow monitoring changes in C-stocks and C-sequestration following the implementation of restoration practices in northern Ethiopia over space and time. The estimated C-stocks can be used as a reference against which future changes in C-stocks can be compared.

TI  - Phenological trends and associated climate drivers of a tree community in lowland dipterocarp forest, Western Ghats, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
AB  - Understanding phenological responses of tropical forest plant communities is crucial for identifying climate-induced changes in ecosystem dynamics. Monitoring phenology across diverse species in natural habitats provides cost-effective insights for conserving both species and forests. We studied tree phenology in a lowland evergreen dipterocarp forest in the Western Ghats, India. About 719 tree individuals representing 95 species were monitored for their vegetative and reproductive phenology from April 2021 to September 2023. Circular statistics detected seasonality in phenological events and Generalized Linear Mixed Modelling (GLMM) identified influence of climate variables on the phenological responses of the tree community. We also assessed how the activity and intensity of phenophases vary over the study period. Our results showed that leaf flushing and flowering peaked during the dry season, with mass flowering observed in two dominant dipterocarps. Fruit production peaked before the monsoon. We also observed diversity in vegetative and reproductive phenodynamics across species groups (forest strata, sexual system, and seed size). Leaf flushing was positively correlated with maximum relative humidity and negatively correlated with maximum temperature and the number of rainy days. Flowering had negative correlations with maximum relative humidity, rainfall days, and maximum temperature but showed a positive correlation with minimum temperature. Fruiting was positively correlated with maximum temperature and negatively correlated with rainy days. This detailed phenological information provides critical knowledge on resource availability and insights into how climate and seasonal changes affect plant growth cycles thereby aiding reforestation and biodiversity conservation strategies in vulnerable forest areas.

TI  - Seed Dispersal Patterns by Large Frugivorous Mammals in a Degraded Mosaic Landscape
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Seed dispersal by Red fox (Vulpes vulpes), Stone marten (Martes foina), and Wild boar (Sus scrofa) was analyzed in an extensively degraded mosaic landscape in Sierra Nevada (SE Spain). The main objective was to determine whether seed dispersal by mammals was related to habitat degradation within a mosaic of adjacent degraded patches mixed with native forest and thereby to determine the potential role of mammals as seed dispersers in degraded landscape units. For three consecutive years, mammal feces were collected in the fruit production period, extracting all seeds of woody species found therein and analyzing their viability. Feces were collected in three different plots for each of five different landscape units: shrubland, native forest, and dense, cleared, and fenced reforestation stands. Seeds from 16 woody species (which represent more than a half of the total fleshy-fruited woody species available) were recorded, although some agrarian species are also introduced in a low percentage of the scats. Seeds showed a high viability rate for all dispersed species, irrespective of the mammal disperser. No differences in species composition appeared in the overall landscape units or in the seed density between degraded habitats. Due to the small patch size, the high viability of dispersed seeds, and the large home range of the large mammals, these three animal species act as efficient seed dispersers for a diverse assemblage of woody plant species regardless of the habitat type within this degradation framework. This fact has important consequences for the biodiversity recuperation in these degraded habitats, principally in pine plantations.

TI  - How does FSC forest certification affect the acoustically active fauna in Madre de Dios, Peru?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Despite several efforts to quantify the effectiveness of forest certification in developing sustainable use of forest resources, there is little evidence that certified forests are more effective in conserving fauna than non-certified managed forest. To evaluate the impact of forest certification on the fauna, we compared the biodiversity in reference sites (n = 23), Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified management sites (n = 24) and non-FSCmanagement sites (n = 20) in the Tahuamanu region of Peru, during the dry season of 2017. Specifically, we determined if the acoustic space used (ASU), soundscapes composition, and the bird richness and composition significantly varied among the three management types. Variation inASUwas best explained by management type and meanASUin theFSCsites was significantly greater than the reference and non-FSCsites, possibly suggesting greater richness of acoustically active species. An ordination analysis of the soundscapes showed that there was a significant difference among the three management types. There was greater dissimilarity in soundscape composition between theFSCand non-FSCsites, and greater overlap betweenFSCand reference sites. Bird identifications resulted in 11,300 detections of 226 bird species. Bird species richness and composition were not significantly different among the management types, indicating, in this context, that birds may not be the best indicators of different management strategies. The weak discrimination by the bird community is likely due to their dispersal ability, undisturbed primary forest matrix, and the occurrence of bamboo patches. The differences inASUamong the management types were most likely due to differences in acoustically active insects, which may be more sensitive to changes in microhabitat differences. Our findings correspond with the conclusions of other studies that certified forests can maintain levels of fauna biodiversity similar to those of undisturbed primary forest in the Amazon region.

TI  - Floristic diversity and stocking rate in tropical dry forest secondary vegetation used for grazing
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - The natural process of ecological regeneration in tropical regions in conjunction with local livestock management practices creates grazing environments with high floristic diversity and structural complexity. Yet, these environments are being neglected despite the opportunities and benefits for domestic herbivores. Voisin grazing (VG) is better in such highly biodiverse environments, as this management system seeks to improve forage utilization by coupling forage allowance with livestock needs for forage, using small paddocks, high stock densities over short occupation periods, and allowing plants to fully recover after grazing. Floristic diversity, biomass and stocking rate were assessed in sites having tropical dry forest secondary vegetation undergoing grazing. Six sites having extensive seasonal grazing were studied by placing 10 x 10 m(2) quadrats across sites to list woody species and nested 2 x 2 m(2) frames for listing herbaceous vegetation. The response of vegetation to Voisin grazing (VG) was evaluated in one of the six sites (split into 15 paddocks having 400-m(2) each). A total of 191 species (from all sites) including 50 potential forage species were listed. Quadrats were classified into two groups, one contained more preserved vegetation dominated by woody species, and the other a less preserved group dominated by herbaceous and shrub species. Available forage biomass across sites ranged from 1000 to 1200 kg DM ha(-1) (30-70% woody biomass), supporting low stocking rates (0.2-0.3 AU ha(-1)). In the site where VG was implemented, most of the identified species were forage (56/58). After one year of VG, the most productive paddocks (2500-3800 kg DM ha(-1)) were dominated by forbs and the least productive ones (800 2000 kg DM ha(-1)) were dominated by woody species, yielding an overall stocking rate of 1.2 AU ha(-1). Based on forage botanical composition, three groups of paddocks were identified: 1) dominated by grasses, 2) heterogeneous forage diversity, and 3) dominated by forbs and shrubs. Pastures recovered in 47-89 d during the 2017 rainy season, 50 123 d during the transition to the dry season, and 210-290 d during the 2018 dry season. Secondary vegetation provides high floristic diversity and a large number of forage plant species, but low forage yield and stocking rates. Yet, implementation of a proper grazing system such as VG gradually enhances yield and stocking rates. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Aboveground Carbon Storage and Its Links to Stand Structure, Tree Diversity and Floristic Composition in South-Eastern Tanzania
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - African savannas and dry forests represent a large, but poorly quantified store of biomass carbon and biodiversity. Improving this information is hindered by a lack of recent forest inventories, which are necessary for calibrating earth observation data and for evaluating the relationship between carbon stocks and tree diversity in the context of forest conservation (for example, REDD+). Here, we present new inventory data from south-eastern Tanzania, comprising more than 15,000 trees at 25 locations located across a gradient of aboveground woody carbon (AGC) stocks. We find that larger trees disproportionately contribute to AGC, with the largest 3.7% of individuals containing half the carbon. Tree species diversity and carbon stocks were positively related, implying a potential functional relationship between the two, and a 'win-win' scenario for conservation; however, lower biomass areas also contain diverse species assemblages meaning that carbon-oriented conservation may miss important areas of biodiversity. Despite these variations, we find that total tree abundance and biomass is skewed towards a few locally dominant species, with eight and nine species (5.7% of the total) accounting for over half the total measured trees and carbon, respectively. This finding implies that carbon production in these areas is channelled through a small number of relatively abundant species. Our results provide key insights into the structure and functioning of these heterogeneous ecosystems and indicate the need for novel strategies for future measurement and monitoring of carbon stocks and biodiversity, including the use for larger plots to capture spatial variations in large tree density and AGC stocks, and to allow the calibration of earth observation data.

TI  - Signals of forest degradation in the demography of common Asian amphibians
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Background. Lowland areas in tropical East and Southeast Asia have a long history of conversion from forestland to agricultural land, with many remaining forests being chronically degraded by wood cutting, livestock grazing, and burning. Wetland-breeding amphibians that have evolved in lowland forests in the region have adjusted to changes in habitat composition caused by humans' activities, and populations continue to persist. However, we have little understanding of the impacts of forest disturbance on these species beyond assessments of abundance and distribution, and species considered to be common and widespread have been largely neglected.
   Methods. We examined body condition and sex ratios of toads (Duttaphrynus melanostictus), predation risk in treefrogs (2 Polypedates spp.), and growth and survival of leaf litter frogs (2 Microhyla spp.) in agricultural land, degraded forest, and intact forest in two study areas, Thailand and Hong Kong.
   Results. Toad populations exhibited higher body condition and female-biased sex ratios in intact forest. Predation of treefrog embryos by flies was lower in intact and degraded forests than in agricultural land. Embryonic survival and larval growth and survival in leaf litter frogs were lower in intact forests than in agricultural land.
   Results for each study were similar between study areas. Discussion. For three of five of these common amphibian species, we documented signals of forest loss and disturbance in their populations. Although these species occur in disturbed habitats, loss of forest cover continues to degrade aspects of their population demography. We urge conservation biologists to consider that populations of species appearing to be common, widespread, and tolerant of human disturbance may be eroding over time.

TI  - Biomass and soil carbon stocks of indigenous agroforestry systems on the south-eastern Rift Valley escarpment, Ethiopia
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Biomass carbon (C) and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in three indigenous agroforestry (AF) systems (Enset [Ensete ventricosum, Musaceae], Enset-Coffee and Fruit-Coffee) practiced on the Rift Valley escarpment of Ethiopia are presented and evaluated. These unique AF systems are characterised by a high proportion and diversity of trees.
   Data were collected from six smallholdings per AF system. Above- and belowground biomass of trees (fruit and non-fruit), enset and coffee plants were calculated using allometric equations while the biomasses of herbs, litter and fine roots (< 2 cm) were determined by destructive sampling techniques. SOC stocks (0-30 and 30-60 cm) were calculated from measured C contents and bulk density values.
   Smallholding total biomass C stocks averaged 67 Mg ha(-1) with trees accounting for 39-93 %. Herbs accounted for < 4 % of aboveground biomass. Coffee accounted for 11 % and enset 9 % of total biomass C on average. SOC stocks (0-60 cm) were 109-253 Mg ha(-1) (52-91 % of total C stocks) and uncorrelated to biomass C stocks. Biomass C or SOC stocks did not significantly differ between AF systems but biomass C stocks were significantly correlated to elevation.
   The C stocks of the three studied AF systems were found to be amongst the highest reported for tropical forests and agroforestry systems. These unique AF systems are therefore well suited to REDD+ projects. However, the C stocks were more determined by individual smallholder management practice than by AF system or climate (elevation).

TI  - A trait-based plant economic framework can help increase the value of reforestation for conservation
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - While reforestation is gaining momentum to moderate climate change via carbon sequestration, there is also an opportunity to use tree planting to confront declining global biodiversity. Where tree species vary in support of diversity, selecting appropriate species for planting could increase conservation effectiveness. We used a common garden experiment in Borneo using 24 native tree species to examine how variation among tree species in their support of beetle diversity is predicted by plant traits associated with "acquisitive" and "conservative" resource acquisition strategies. We evaluate three hypotheses: (1) beetle communities show fidelity to host identity as indicated by variation in abundance and diversity among tree species, (2) the leaf economic spectrum partially explains this variation as shown by beetle preferences for plant species that are predicted by plant traits, and (3) a small number of selected tree species can capture higher beetle species richness than a random tree species community. We found high variation among tree species in supporting three highly intercorrelated metrics of beetle communities: abundance, richness, and Shannon diversity. Variation in support of beetle communities was predicted by plant traits and varied by plant functional groups; within the dipterocarp family, high beetle diversity was predicted by conservative traits such as high wood density and slow growth, and in non-dipterocarps by the acquisitive traits of high foliar K and rapid growth. Using species accumulation curves and extrapolation to twice the original sample size, we show that 48 tree species were not enough to reach asymptote levels of beetle richness. Nevertheless, species accumulation curves of the six tree species with the highest richness had steeper slopes and supported 33% higher richness than a random community of tree species. Reforestation projects concerned about conservation can benefit by identifying tree species with a disproportional capacity to support biodiversity based on plant traits.

TI  - Biodiversity Conservation in Southeast Asian Timber Concessions: a Critical Evaluation of Policy Mechanisms and Guidelines
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - Tropical deforestation is leading to a loss of economically productive timber concessions, as well as areas with important environmental or socio-cultural values. To counteract this threat in Southeast Asia, sustainable forest management (SFM) practices are becoming increasingly important. We assess the tools and guidelines that have been developed to promote SFM and the progress that has been made in Southeast Asia toward better logging practices. We specifically focus on practices relevant to biodiversity issues. Various regional or national mechanisms now inform governments and the timber industry about methods to reduce the impact of production forestry on wildlife and the forest environment. However, so many guidelines have been produced that it has become difficult to judge which ones are most relevant. In addition, most guidelines are phrased in general terms and lack specific recommendations targeted to local conditions. These might be reasons for the generally slow adoption of SFM practices in the region, with only a few countries having incorporated the guidelines into national legislation. Malaysia, Indonesia, and Laos are among the frontrunners in this process. Overall there is progress, especially in the application of certification programs, the planning and management of high conservation value forests, the regulation and control of hunting, and silvicultural management. To reduce further forest loss, there is a need to accelerate the implementation of good forest management practices. We recommend specific roles for governments, the forestry industry, and nongovernmental organizations in further promoting the implementation of SFM practices for biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Influence of Plot Size on Efficiency of Biomass Estimates in Inventories of Dry Tropical Forests Assisted by Photogrammetric Data from an Unmanned Aircraft System
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Applications of unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) to assist in forest inventories have provided promising results in biomass estimation for different forest types. Recent studies demonstrating use of different types of remotely sensed data to assist in biomass estimation have shown that accuracy and precision of estimates are influenced by the size of field sample plots used to obtain reference values for biomass. The objective of this case study was to assess the influence of sample plot size on efficiency of UAS-assisted biomass estimates in the dry tropical miombo woodlands of Malawi. The results of a design-based field sample inventory assisted by three-dimensional point clouds obtained from aerial imagery acquired with a UAS showed that the root mean square errors as well as the standard error estimates of mean biomass decreased as sample plot sizes increased. Furthermore, relative efficiency values over different sample plot sizes were above 1.0 in a design-based and model-assisted inferential framework, indicating that UAS-assisted inventories were more efficient than purely field-based inventories. The results on relative costs for UAS-assisted and pure field-based sample plot inventories revealed that there is a trade-off between inventory costs and required precision. For example, in our study if a standard error of less than approximately 3 Mg ha(-1) was targeted, then a UAS-assisted forest inventory should be applied to ensure more cost effective and precise estimates. Future studies should therefore focus on finding optimum plot sizes for particular applications, like for example in projects under the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, plus forest conservation, sustainable management of forest and enhancement of carbon stocks (REDD+) mechanism with different geographical scales.

TI  - Carbon dynamics in slash-and-burn agriculture and land use alternatives of the humid forest zone in Cameroon
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - One of the environmental consequences of slash-and-burn farming is the loss of forest system carbon which in turn contributes to atmospheric change and impacts upon global climates. International attention has become focused upon the development of alternatives to slash-and-burn agriculture to alleviate poverty, protect biodiversity and reduce climate change. Before alternative land use systems can be evaluated in terms of carbon sequestration, baseline measurements of carbon dynamics resulting from current practices are required. We have characterized the carbon stocks in six slash-and-burn chronosequences in the humid forest zone of Cameroon, Each chronosequence consisted of original forest, two year-old cropland, a cacao plantation, bush fallow, tree fallow and secondary forest. Four, nine and seventeen years, respectively, had passed since the original forest was cleared for the latter three land uses. At each of 36 site x land use combinations, tree, understorey, litter, root and soil (0-50 cm) carbon were measured in five 100 m(2) quadrates, The original forest contained 308 t C ha(-1) and lost 220 t C ha(-1) upon conversion to agriculture, The most vulnerable carbon pool was the above ground tree biomass and the most stable was soil organic matter. Carbon reaccumulated in the recovering fallows at a rate of 9.4 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) (r = 0.83). When these results were extrapolated using a geographic information system, deforestation rates in Southern Cameroon were estimated to be 1,355 km(-2) yr(-1) between 1973 and 1988 resulting in annual forest system carbon losses of 13.5 million t C. During the course of this study, three alternatives to slash-and-burn were identified: commercial cassava cultivation, improved forest conversion, and stratified agroforestry. These alternative land uses have the potential to reduce C losses over current practices by 10, 55 and 75 t C ha(-1), respectively, and also differ greatly in their potential to alleviate rural poverty, protect biodiversity and deflect additional deforestation.

TI  - Are Dung Beetles Driving Dung-Fly Abundance in Traditional Agricultural Areas in the Amazon?
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - We evaluated the effects of different land-use systems on the ability of dung beetles to control the population of detritus-feeding flies. We tested the hypotheses that intensification of land use will reduce dung beetles richness, abundance and biomass and, consequently, their dung burial ability, affecting the interaction between dung beetles and flies and reducing its effectiveness as a natural biological control. In the Brazilian Amazon we sampled dung beetles, fly larvae and adults; and recorded the rate of dung removal by dung beetles across a gradient of land-use intensity from primary forest, secondary forest, agroforestry, agriculture to pasture. Our results provide evidence that land-use intensification results in a reduction of the richness, abundance and biomass of dung beetles, and this in turn results in lower rates of dung removal in the most simplified systems. We found no significant differences in the abundance of fly larvae between the different systems of land use. However, the number of adult flies differed significantly between land-use systems, presenting higher abundance in those sites with greater intensity of use (pasture and agriculture) and a lower abundance of adult flies in forested systems (primary and secondary forests, and agroforestry). Information-theoretic model selection based on AICc revealed strong support for the influence of land-use systems, dung removal rates and dung beetle abundance, biomass and richness on adult dung-fly abundance. Our results also reveal that dung beetles are not solely responsible for fly control and that other factors linked to land use are influencing the populations of these detritus-feeding insects.

TI  - Fire effects on anurans: What we know so far?
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Fire is a powerful environmental disturbance with the ability to shape many biomes worldwide. However, global warming, land-use changes and other anthropogenic factors have strongly altered natural fire regimes worldwide. Despite the growing number of studies evaluating the effects of fire on biodiversity, little is understood about how burn affects certain groups that are particularly sensitive to climatic extremes, such as anurans. Here, we conducted a global and systematic literature review of studies assessing anurofauna responses to fire disturbances. We used Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models and theoretical information criteria to assess how fire affects anuran assemblages. We analyzed 68 studies, widely distributed in the globe, which examined the fire effects on abundance, richness and/or species behavior. In total, 191 species were considered, being Gastrophryne carolinensis and Lithobates catesbeianus the most evaluated. We reveal a lack of general anurofauna response to fire, as species and assemblages were either negatively or positively affected by burns. We observed that the fire treatments (Prescribed fire, Wildfire and without fire) and the biome where the study was conducted did not explain the variation in species abundance. Most studies were conducted in biomes classified as Temperate Forests, followed by Tropical Savannas and Tropical Forests. We highlight that future studies should consider factors associated to fire (e.g. fire treatment, fire properties), research design and species biology to explain patterns of species persistence and community structure. Although fire plays a key role in shaping several natural ecosystems, we have recently witnessed drastic changes in natural burning regimes all over the world, which imply leading to severe population reductions and even species extinctions. Given this scenario, government authorities should urgently support and invest in scientific studies that evaluate, monitor and test fire management practices in natural ecosystems and therefore establish mitigation actions to preserve the biota constantly threatened by the imbalance of this environmental disturbance.

TI  - Establishment success of Brazil nut trees in smallholder Amazon forest restoration depends on site conditions and management
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - 1. Forest landscape restoration (FLR) has gained momentum globally and guidance is needed to identify those species, sites and planting methods that increase restoration success. Incorporating native Non-Timber Forest Product (NTFP) species in FLR approaches provides an opportunity to simultaneously deliver ecological and economic benefits. The Brazil nut tree is one of the most valuable Amazonian NTFP species and could fulfil a cornerstone role in Amazon FLR. However, the factors defining establishment success within Brazil nut restoration activities remain unknown. 2. Here, we evaluate the effect of management practices, restoration site (pastures, agroforestry, secondary forest and canopy gaps in old growth forest) and environmental conditions on the establishment success (tree growth, survival and fruit production) of Brazil nut restoration projects implemented by smallholders in the Peruvian Amazon. We performed a field study at 25 restoration sites of 1-38 years in age, where we conducted measurements on 481 trees and interviewed 21 smallholders. We used mixed effect models to identify drivers of performance. 3. Twenty years after planting, diameter growth in secondary forests was 38%, 34%, and 24% higher than in canopy gaps, pastures, and agroforestry sites, respectively. Survival rate was similar for trees planted in pastures and secondary forests, but 15-20% higher there than trees planted in agroforestry sites, and 7-12% higher than in canopy gaps. Fruit production was 262% higher for reproductive trees in secondary forest sites compared to pastures, but production probability did not differ between restoration sites. These results show that secondary forests are the most suitable sites for planting Brazil nut trees. 4. In addition to restoration site effects, we also found significant effects of management practices. Survival rate increased with application of fire for clearing and weeding and economic investments and decreased with potentially inefficient herbivore protection. Fruit production was lower for trees planted further away from smallholders' homes. These results show that smallholders' management has a substantial effect on establishment success. 5. Our findings suggest a significant importance of post-planting maintenance of trees to increase success of FLR projects. Further, our study shows that evaluation of past restoration activities can guide future forest restoration in tropical landscapes.

TI  - Plant community composition and disturbance in Caspian Fagus orientalis forests: which are the main driving factors?
T2  - PHYTOCOENOLOGIA
AB  - The oriental beech forests along the southern Caspian Sea shores of Iran are characterized by high biodiversity and high ecological value. However, there is little information concerning factors governing community composition and the presence and abundance of invasive plants. In the present study we aimed to evaluate the main drivers of community composition, diversity, and establishment of invasive plants in disturbed and undisturbed Fagus orientalis communities.
   We sampled 104 vegetation releves in undisturbed and disturbed sites of the "Kheiroud Investigation Forest" in northern Iran and collected data on a large number of environmental variables concerning soil properties, light conditions, and topography. Data analysis consisted of a forward selection of significant explanatory variables followed by partial CCA analyses. Additionally, we carried out indicator species analysis of groups of releves affected by different disturbance types and analyzed effects of disturbance on species richness, diversity, and evenness using general linear models.
   CCA results showed that disturbance, soil properties, light conditions and elevation explained 22.6% of the total variation in floristic composition. Gap and gap + grazing were the most important disturbance types affecting community composition. Disturbance had significant but rather weak effects on species richness, evenness, and the Shannon index. The most obvious effect of disturbance was on species composition, as revealed by significant groups of indicator species for different disturbance types. Most of the indicator species in grazed sites were unpalatable, poisonous, and creeping species, which are avoided by cattle. Grazing led to decreased abundance of indicator species and species characteristic of old-growth Fagus forests. The most intensive disturbance type "harvesting + gap + grazing" was associated with invasion by native vascular plant species not typically found in beech forests (apophytes).

TI  - Examining diversity of terrestrial mammal communities across forest reserves in Sabah, Borneo
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Tropical forest reserves have conservation value for terrestrial mammals and are threatened by anthropogenic pressures, especially conversion to other land-use types. To assess mammalian biodiversity of forest reserves in Sabah, Borneo, we used camera trapping data to estimate species richness, beta diversity, phylogenetic and functional diversity in nine forest reserves with different management classifications and backgrounds. Multiregional multispecies occupancy models (MSOM) were used to differentiate species occupancy in the reserves, and the estimates were transformed into biodiversity metrics. We found a significant difference in mammal composition within each forest reserve, with various functional and phylogenetic clustering or dispersion levels indicated by the standard effect of mean pairwise distances (SES MPD). Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used for both the observed data and MSOM estimates, modeling numerous environmental covariates and the forest reserves as random effects, finding that the forest reserve random effects were mainly responsible for structuring the mammal communities. Deramakot Forest Reserve was found to have overall high species richness, phylogenetic and functional diversity compared to other reserves. This reserve has been particularly successful at sustainable forest management and long-term forest certification, highlighting long-term conservation gains of sustainability programs for terrestrial mammalian diversity. Conversely, several reserves showed lower diversity scores overall than IUCN presumed extant species lists, highlighting local defaunation while still retaining high profile (critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable) species. This study highlights the fragility of terrestrial mammal assemblages in forest reserves across the state and the need for mitigation, refaunation, and an integrated approach to forest management and biodiversity conservation to allow for comprehensive sustainable management programs to ensure long-term conservation.

TI  - Secondary forests as temporary carbon sinks?: The economic impact of accounting methods on reforestation projects in the tropics
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Tropical forestry is often not competitive with agricultural land uses such as pasture for cattle ranching. Additional revenues from carbon sequestration generated by the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol can change this situation. In three different zones of north-western Ecuador, minimum compensation payments for carbon sequestration were determined, which would make reforestation a feasible land-use alternative. Based on our findings that these minimum prices depend on the net benefit of the respective land-use alternatives, and on the accounting regimes for CDM sink projects, we applied the accounting rules for temporary and long-term Certified Emission Reductions (CER) to two reforestation projects: forest plantation and natural regrowth of secondary forest. A comparison of these alternatives showed that secondary forest is an attractive alternative under both accounting regimes because of its low establishment costs and relative early timber revenues. After identifying the zone most suitable for carbon sink projects, we calculated net benefits of land-use changes in the event that certain prices for emission reductions were actually paid. We found that secondary forest becomes economically attractive, if the price of permanent credits is above $4.5/tCO(2), whereas forest plantations require permanent CER prices of $7.0/tCO(2). In both cases, the results are within the price margins forecasted by various institutions for the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. The presented methodology is meant to support the decision making process on the supply side of a future CER market. Opportunity costs of land-use changes have to be analyzed carefully before deciding in favor of long binding forestry projects. Assigning temporary credits to naturally regrown secondary forests could-although excluded from CDM during the first commitment period-combine the advantages of a flexible accounting regime with the positive economic and ecological effects of this competitive land use.

TI  - Assessment of Soil Carbon Stock and Soil Quality in Different Forest Stands and Management Regimes in Terai Region of Nepal
T2  - SCIENTIFICA
AB  - Assessment of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock and soil quality for informed forest management is hindered by inadequate data across different forest stand types and management regimes. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess SOC stock and soil quality in two forest stand types, i.e., Shorea robusta (Sal) forest and Terai mixed hardwood (TMH) forest, and selected forest management regimes (leasehold forest, community forest, government-managed forest, and forest area under protected area) in Terai region of Nepal. Stratified random sampling method was adopted for soil sample collection across terai region following Forest Resource Assessment, Nepal. Altogether, 62 composite soil samples from 30 cm depth were taken from the entire Terai region which included these two forest stand types and four management regimes. Different physical (soil texture and bulk density) and chemical (pH, SOC (%), total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and available potassium) properties were analyzed to calculate SOC stock and soil quality. Our result found no significant differences in SOC stock among two forest stand types (p>0.05). Unexpectedly, leasehold forest had significantly (p<0.05) higher SOC stock than other forest management regimes. In terms of soil quality, among two forest stand types, Sal forest (0.50) was found to be superior compared with TMH forest (0.46). Similarly, community forest had superior soil quality (0.50) than government-managed forest (0.47), protected area (0.47), and leasehold forest (0.45). A longitudinal study approach is recommended to observe changes in soil properties over time due to climate change and human activities, offering valuable insights into their dynamics.

TI  - Discerning Fragmentation Dynamics of Tropical Forest and Wetland during Reforestation, Urban Sprawl, and Policy Shifts
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Despite the overall trend of worldwide deforestation over recent decades, reforestation has also been found and is expected in developing countries undergoing fast urbanization and agriculture abandonment. The consequences of reforestation on landscape patterns are seldom addressed in the literature, despite their importance in evaluating biodiversity and ecosystem functions. By analyzing long-term land cover changes in Puerto Rico, a rapidly reforested (6 to 42% during 1940-2000) and urbanized tropical island, we detected significantly different patterns of fragmentation and underlying mechanisms among forests, urban areas, and wetlands. Forest fragmentation is often associated with deforestation. However, we also found significant fragmentation during reforestation. Urban sprawl and suburb development have a dominant impact on forest fragmentation. Reforestation mostly occurs along forest edges, while significant deforestation occurs in forest interiors. The deforestation process has a much stronger impact on forest fragmentation than the reforestation process due to their different spatial configurations. In contrast, despite the strong interference of coastal urbanization, wetland aggregation has occurred due to the effective implementation of laws/ regulations for wetland protection. The peak forest fragmentation shifted toward rural areas, indicating progressively more fragmentation in forest interiors. This shift is synchronous with the accelerated urban sprawl as indicated by the accelerated shift of the peak fragmentation index of urban cover toward rural areas, i.e., 1.37% yr(-1) in 1977-1991 versus 2.17% yr(-1) in 1991-2000. Based on the expected global urbanization and the regional forest transition from deforested to reforested, the fragmented forests and aggregated wetlands in this study highlight possible forest fragmentation processes during reforestation in an assessment of biodiversity and functions and suggest effective laws/regulations in land planning to reduce future fragmentation.

TI  - Effects of nitrogen deposition on carbon sequestration in Chinese fir forest ecosystems
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Nitrogen deposition and its ecological effects on forest ecosystems have received global attention. We used the ecosystem model FORECAST to assess the effects of nitrogen deposition on carbon sequestration in Chinese fir planted forests in SE China. This topic is important as China is intensifying its reforestation efforts to increase forest carbon sequestration for combating climate change impacts, using Chinese fir as the most important plantation species. A series of scenarios including seven N deposition levels (1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 kg ha(-1) y(-1)), three management regime (rotation lengths of 15, 30 and 50 years) and two site qualities (nutrient poor and fertile sites) were defined for the simulations. Our results showed that N deposition increased carbon sequestration in Chinese fir forests, but the efficiency of the increasing effect is reduced as N deposition levels increase. When N deposition levels exceeded 20-30 kg ha(-1) y(-1), the incremental effects of N deposition on forest C pools were marginal. This suggests that N deposition levels above 20-30 kg ha(-1) y(-1) could lead to N saturation in Chinese fir forest soils. Any additional amounts of N input from deposition would likely be leached out. Total above-ground C was more sensitive to N deposition than to rotation length and site quality. It was also estimated that the contributions of N deposition to C sequestration in all Chinese fir forests in South-East China are 7.4 x 10(6) Mg Cy-1 under the current N deposition levels (5 to 10 kg ha(-1) y(-1)) and could reach up to 16 x 10(6) Mg Cy-1 if N deposition continues increasing and reaches levels of 7.5 to 15 kg N ha(-1) y(-1).

TI  - Sustainable intensification of dairy production can reduce forest disturbance in Kenyan montane forests
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Increasing demand for food and the shortage of arable land call for sustainable intensification of farming, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa where food insecurity is still a major concern. Kenya needs to intensify its dairy production to meet the increasing demand for milk. At the same time, the country has set national climate mitigation targets and has to implement land use practices that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from both agriculture and forests. This study analysed for the first time the drivers of forest disturbance and their relationship with dairy intensification across the largest montane forest of Kenya. To achieve this, a forest disturbance detection approach was applied by using Landsat time series and empirical data from forest disturbance surveys. Farm indicators and farm types derived from a household survey were used to test the effects of dairy intensification on forest disturbance for different farm neighbourhood sizes (r = 2-5 km). About 18% of the forest area was disturbed over the period 2010-2016. Livestock grazing and firewood extraction were the dominant drivers of forest disturbance at 75% of the forest disturbance spots sampled. Higher on-farm cattle stocking rates and firewood collection were associated with 1-10% increased risk of forest disturbance across farm neighbourhood sizes. In contrast, higher milk yields, increased supplementation with concentrated feeds and more farm area allocated to fodder production were associated with 1-7 % reduced risk of forest disturbance across farm neighbourhood sizes. More intensified farms had a significantly lower impact on forest disturbance than small and resource-poor farms, and large and inefficient farms. Our results show that intensification of smallholder dairy farming leads to both farm efficiency gains and reduced forest disturbance. These results can inform agriculture and forest mitigation policies which target options to reduce GHG emission intensities and the risk of carbon leakage.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variation of carbon stocks in a lowland tropical forest in West Africa
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Understanding the nature and cause of spatial and temporal variation in forest carbon is critical for implementation of climate mitigation strategies such as REDD. Such knowledge is lacking and hard to acquire in resource poor regions such as West Africa's Upper Guinea where benefits of such schemes for forest conservation could have great impact.
   We undertook a systematic and representative survey of an entire Upper Guinea forest - Gola Forest in southeast Sierra Leone - by measuring over 600 plots (0.125 ha) in order to quantify the level of spatial variation in C that might exist within a discrete forest type and relate this to historic and contemporary impacts on the forest. We modelled current C stocks and compared these with values calculated from historic surveys. Mean C content in above ground biomass was c. 160 Mg ha(-1). The southern part of the forest which was subject to heavier logging in the 1980s had a lower C content (121-144 Mg ha(-1)) compared to the less disturbed central areas (186 Mg ha(-1)). Volumes of extracted timber and distance to settlements around the forest explained 42% of the variation in C content. Elevation, slope and other metrics of human impact such as distance to roads did not explain significant additional variation. A survey from the 1950s recorded much higher carbon content than currently found in the south of the forest. This accords with evidence that commercial logging in this area was destructively high. However, old surveys from the late 1960s/early 1970s in less disturbed areas recorded lower carbon content than present. Most of the past surveys were in areas that had not yet been commercially logged so the accumulation in biomass in the last 40 years implies recovery from a much older disturbance event, or a change in environmental conditions promoting growth.
   As a typical Upper Guinean forest, our results from Gola demonstrate the long term impacts of disturbance events on carbon stocks and how these can vary greatly at small scales, highlighting the need for representative and regionally relevant empirical data to inform REDD type initiatives. Nonetheless these forests remain important for carbon sequestration and storage in the region despite this history and the parts of the forest with no recorded logging activity that increased in carbon in recent decades with levels now akin to undisturbed plots reported from elsewhere in the region demonstrate the sequestration potential these forests provide once adequately protected.

TI  - Carbon and nitrogen in a temperate agroforestry system: Using stable isotopes as a tool to understand soil dynamics
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Natural exchanges of carbon (C) between the atmosphere, the oceans, and terrestrial ecosystems are currently being modified through human activities as a result of fossil fuel burning and the conversion of tropical forests to agricultural land. These activities have led to a steady increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) over the last two Centuries. The goal of this study was to determine the potential of temperate agroforestry systems to sequester C in soil. Therefore, changes in the soil organic C (SOC) and nitrogen (N) pools were quantified and the delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotope technique was applied to assess soil C and N dynamics in a 13-year old hybrid poplar alley cropping system in Southern Canada. Results from this study showed that after 13 years of alley cropping the SOC and N pools did not differ significantly (p = 0.01) with distance from the tree row, although a trend of a larger SOC and N pool near the tree row could be observed. Soil organic C after 13 years of alley cropping, was 19 mg C g(-1) compared to 11 mg C g(-1) upon initiation of agroforestry. Soil organic C and N were not evenly distributed throughout the plow layer. The largest C and N pool occurred in the top 20 cm, which is due to the accumulation of organic material in the upper horizons as a result of no-till cultivation. The entire soil, to a 40 cm depth, showed a delta(13) C shift to that of C-3 residue. This shift reflects the greater input of residues from C3 plants such as that derived from beans, wheat, and hybrid poplar leaf litterfall. The proportion of C derived from a C-3 source ranged from 64 to 69% to a 40 cm depth. The soil delta N-15 signature of this study is similar to that of mineral soil, and reflect values characteristic of N mineralization processes. However, the entire soil shows a positive shift in delta N-15 as a result of historical additions of manure and current use of mineral fertilizers, and ongoing processes of denitrification and nitrate leaching, which leads to an enrichment of the soil.

TI  - Mammals Make Use of Cashew Plantations in a Mixed Forest-Cashew Landscape
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Heterogeneous landscapes harboring mosaics of natural habitat and agriculture are increasingly gaining conservation focus in the tropics. While research on cash crops such as coffee, rubber, and oil palm has led to an understanding of their role as supplementary habitats, such has remained limited in cashew plantations despite it being a cash crop of global significance. We conducted a study to understand the occurrence of terrestrial mammal species in a mixed forest-cashew landscape in the northern Western Ghats, India. During January to April 2016, we used trail cameras to sample a total area of 25 km(2) divided into 100 grid cells of 0.25 km(2) each. We deployed six trail cameras for a 24 h period in each grid cell and obtained photo-captures of 11 species in forests, of which nine were detected in cashew plantations, but most species showed low capture rates. For three of these species-Indian crested porcupine, sambar, and wild pig-we modeled habitat use as a function of site-specific attributes. Wild pig showed a higher probability of use of cashew than forest, while porcupine and sambar did not show any pronounced differences between the two land uses. The probability of habitat use by sambar and porcupine was positively influenced by undergrowth but not for the wild pig. Wild pig habitat use was positively related to increased proximity of human settlements and increasing distance to forests, but the pattern was unreliable for sambar and porcupine. Our preliminary study demonstrates that a subset of terrestrial mammals in the forest makes use of cashew plantations and highlights the need for further research in forest-cashew landscapes to assess conservation opportunities.

TI  - Soil Respiration in Planted and Naturally Regenerated Castanopis carelesii Forests during Three Years Post-Establishment
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Reforestation through assisted natural regeneration usually accumulates more biomass carbon than through tree planting, but its effects on soil respiration (Rs) and its components, autotrophic respiration (Ra) and heterotrophic respiration (Rh), are poorly understood despite the importance in forest carbon cycling. In this study, we clear-cut part of a 35-year-old secondary Castanopsis carelesii (C. carelesii) forest and reforested the logged land with C. carelesii via two approaches-active tree planting and assisted natural regeneration-and measured Rs, Ra, and Rh as well as soil temperature and moisture in these forests. In the first two years following reforestation, Rs, Ra and Rh rates were mostly reduced in the two young forests compared to the secondary forest, likely due to reduced photosynthate production and thus carbon substrate input associated with the clear-cut. However, the Rh:Rs ratio was significantly greater in the young plantation than in the other two forests in the first two years, suggesting a greater loss of soil organic carbon from the young plantation. In the third year, the mean Rs, Rh, and Ra rates of the young forest established via assisted natural regeneration were similar to those of the secondary forest, but significantly greater than those of the young plantation. The rates of Rs, Rh, and Ra mostly increased exponentially with increasing soil temperature in all forests, but mostly lack significant relationships with soil moisture. These findings indicate that, compared with reforestation via tree plantation, assisted natural regeneration not only reduced the loss of soil organic carbon via soil respiration, but also had a more rapid recovery of soil respiration to the level of the secondary forest. Our study highlights that, in addition to temperature, carbon substrate availability is also important in regulating soil respiration following reforestation.

TI  - Conservation status of forests and wildlife in the Eastern Ghats, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
AB  - The Eastern Ghats (EGs) comprise a chain of ancient low hills in the state of Andhra Pradesh adjoining the east coast of India. These hill ranges are well known for a rich array of tropical forests with great conservation significance which support large human populations. A series of protected areas (PAs) have been established by the government along these ranges to conserve the regional biodiversity, but their effectiveness is often questionable. In order to assess the ecological status of the forests both within and outside the PAs and to assess the impacts of ongoing forestry practices a survey was conducted along the EGs. Plant species richness, and density of shrubs and trees, were estimated along disturbance gradients (core, buffer and fringe situations) using random plots of 10-m radius for trees, and 5-m radius (nested) plots for shrubs and saplings. Indirect evidence (spoor) of domestic and wild animals was recorded within the sample plots to compare habitat use by the animals.
   Srivenkateshwara National Park in the Seshachalam Hills, Gundlabrahmeshwaram Sanctuary in Nallamalais and some parts of Srisailam-Nagarjunasagar Tiger Reserve, had the least degraded forests due to their PA status. However, collection of non-timber forest products, bamboo harvesting and livestock grazing continues in all areas irrespective of legal status. All bamboo areas have been heavily worked. It is recommended that bamboo working should be stopped in core areas of the PAs and reduced from nine to six months (October to March) in the buffer zones. Summer is a period of potential water shortage for wild animals and bamboo workers' camps near water courses may affect habitat use by these species.
   The proposed Gudem Maripakhala Sanctuary, well known for its biogeographical value and diverse nora, is seriously threatened as a result of to extensive 'podu' (slash and burn) cultivation. It is suggested that an integrated approach to biodiversity conservation and better agricultural practices, should be adopted in this area. Some of the primary and old growth forests should be identified, mapped and given immediate protection, until a scientifically-based management plan is developed.

TI  - Monitoring vegetation dynamics with open earth observation tools: the case of fire-modulated savanna to forest transitions in Central Africa
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Woody encroachment and forest progression are widespread in forest-savanna transitional areas in Central Africa. Quantifying these dynamics and understanding their drivers at relevant spatial scales has long been a challenge. Recent progress in open access imagery sources with improved spatial, spectral and temporal resolution combined with cloud computing resources, and the advent of relatively cheap solutions to deploy laser sensors in the field, have transformed this domain of study. We present a study case in the Mpem & Djim National Park (MDNP), a 1,000 km(2) protected area in the Centre region of Cameroon. Using open source algorithms in Google Earth Engine (GEE), we characterized vegetation dynamics and the fire regime based on Landsat multispectral imagery archive (1975-2020). Current species assemblages were estimated from Sentinel 2 imagery and the open source biodivMapR package, using spectral dissimilarity. Vegetation structure (aboveground biomass; AGB) was characterized using Unmanned Aerial vehicle (UAV) LiDAR scanning data sampled over the study area. Savanna vegetation, which was initially dominant in the MDNP, lost about 50% of its initial cover in <50 years in favor of forest at an average rate of ca. 0.63%.year(-1) (6 km(2).year(-1)). Species assemblage computed from spectral dissimilarity in forest vegetation followed a successional gradient consistent with forest age. AGB accumulation rate was 3.2 Mg.ha(-1).year(-1) after 42 years of forest encroachment. In savannas, two modes could be identified along the gradient of spectral species assemblage, corresponding to distinct AGB levels, where woody savannas with low fire frequency store 40% more AGB than open grassy savannas with high fire frequency. A fire occurrence every five year was found to be the fire regime threshold below which woody savannas start to dominate over grassy ones. A fire frequency below that threshold opens the way to young forest transitions. These results have implications for carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation policies. Maintaining savanna ecosystems in the region would require active management actions to limit woody encroachment and forest progression, in contradiction with global reforestation goals.

TI  - Grassland vegetation and roads have dominant influence on decadal-scale spatial-temporal patterns of fires in a species-rich protected Terai habitat in northeastern India
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - The Terai ecoregion of the Himalayan foothills is among the most fire-affected ecosystems in the Indian subcontinent. Although most of the Terai has already been lost to agriculture and urbanization, the few remaining native habitats are strictly protected due to their high biodiversity and ecological importance. The use of fires to maintain vegetation and wildlife habitat in these protected areas is an integral part of forest management. Although fires are initiated by forest managers or local people, their eventual spread and behaviour are not controlled. We hypothesize that distributions of fires are determined by several direct and indirect drivers like fuel load, fuel moisture content, presence of natural or artificial fire breaks, and climatic attributes of precipitation and temperature. Using the moderate-resolution (375m) satellite sensor-based data we studied the environmental influence on the spatial-temporal patterns of fire events over 18 years (2000-2018) in a 519 km(2) protected area in northeastern India. The park has a mosaic of vegetation formations - including dry and swampy alluvial grassland, early successional woodland, and moist tropical forest. Despite high rainfall, there is an intense dry season that renders the herbaceous vegetation susceptible to fires. Using spatial and spatial-temporal Poisson regression models in a rigorous conditional autoregressive Bayesian framework, we found that net primary productivity (a proxy of vegetation type and fuel load), distance to roads (a measure of human influence), elevation (through its influence on floods and vegetation type), and river area extent (by determining the area under vegetation) had a significant influence on the spatial distributions of fires. The climatic signal on interannual variation in fires was weak, but dry season rainfall reduced fire incidence. The disproportionate distribution of fires adjacent to roads compared to the interior, and the repeated burning of some grassland patches need to be addressed in fire management.

TI  - Can traditional selective logging secure tree regeneration in cloud forest?
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
AB  - Unplanned selective logging for charcoal and firewood is a common practice in tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF), a high priority ecosystem for biodiversity conservation at the global scale. However, limited information is available regarding the impact of such logging on forest regeneration. We evaluated the abundance and composition of tree regeneration in four TMCF sites subject to traditional selective logging in southern Mexico. At each site, we calculated a tree extraction index based on the number of stumps, logs and charcoal kilns and established six 200 m(2) plots where the abundance of adult, sapling and seedling trees were recorded and canopy cover estimated. Based on the extraction index and estimated basal area values, two sites each were classified as being of low (L) and high (H) logging intensity; the extraction index was three times lower in L (7.5 and 9.2) than in H (35 and 35) sites, while basal area was significantly higher in L than in H sites (80.2 +/- 10.2 vs. 41.9 +/- 4.96 m(2) ha(-1), respectively). No significant differences were found among sites in terms of canopy cover, diameter and density of adult trees or in the density of saplings and seedlings (0.72 individuals m(-2)). In all sites, species of intermediate shade-tolerance dominated the regeneration (76%), followed by the shade-tolerant (23%) and pioneer (1%) species. Regeneration of Quercus spp. (four species) dominated at all sites (50.5%); this is a group of particular interest to the local communities because of its utility for firewood and charcoal. The similarity in composition between adult and regenerating tree species was relatively high in all of the sites (Morisita-Horn Index L1=0.86, L2=0.64, H1=0.69 and H2=0.71). These results indicate that, under the evaluated selective logging intensities, TMCF can sustain sufficient regeneration of Quercus spp. and thus presents an opportunity for sustainable management. The legacy effects of traditional selective logging on TMCF tree regeneration are discussed.

TI  - Impacts of forest management on tree species richness and composition: Assessment of forest management regimes in Tarai landscape Nepal
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - The role of natural (non-plantation) production forests is increasingly recognized in conservation of forest biodiversity globally. Government and other forest stakeholders in Nepal are, however, still reluctant to promote active management of production forests for fear of negative impacts on forest biodiversity. Moreover, Nepal's government is converting production forests into protected areas thus restricting the area available for multiple uses. To assess the implications of forest management practices on forest biodiversity at landscape level, we compared the richness and composition of tree species among regularly harvested community forests, irregularly harvested community forests, protected area and national forests in sub-tropical forested landscape of Nepal using tree species inventory and assessment of key environmental variables. Results showed that regularly harvested community forests could be effective in supporting tree species richness and composition compared to other management regimes. Results supported the hypothesis that high forest disturbance and no disturbance do not support tree species diversity and composition. In addition, this study found that regularly managed community forests also protect ecologically important and vulnerable tree species. Some possible explanations for the better performance of these community forests could be tenure security, frequency and regularity of silvicultural operations and sensitivity of forest users to the ecological aspects of forest management. Our study reaffirmed the need for active forest management at the local level to contribute to global conservation initiatives such as sustainable forest management, reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD+) and biodiversity conservation. Better compliance with forest management plans and capacity development of local forestry stakeholders in forest management operations are suggested for managing forests outside protected areas that is, in national and community forests.

TI  - Carbon sequestration potential of tropical pasture compared with afforestation in Panama
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Tropical forest ecosystems play an important role in regulating the global climate, yet deforestation and land-use change mean that the tropical carbon sink is increasingly influenced by agroecosystems and pastures. Despite this, it is not yet fully understood how carbon cycling in the tropics responds to land-use change, particularly for pasture and afforestation. Thus, the objectives of our study were: (1) to elucidate the environmental controls and the impact of management on gross primary production (GPP), total ecosystem respiration (TER) and net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE); (2) to estimate the carbon sequestration potential of tropical pasture compared with afforestation; and (3) to compare eddy covariance-derived carbon budgets with biomass and soil inventory data. We performed comparative measurements of NEE in a tropical C-4 pasture and an adjacent afforestation with native tree species in Sardinilla (Panama) from 2007 to 2009. Pronounced seasonal variation in GPP, TER and NEE were closely related to radiation, soil moisture, and C-3 vs. C-4 plant physiology. The shallow rooting depth of grasses compared with trees resulted in a higher sensitivity of the pasture ecosystem to water limitation and seasonal drought. During 2008, substantial amounts of carbon were sequestered by the afforestation (-442 gCm(-2), negative values denote ecosystem carbon uptake), which was in agreement with biometric observations (-450 gCm(-2)). In contrast, the pasture ecosystem was a strong carbon source in 2008 and 2009 (261 gCm(-2)), associated with seasonal drought and overgrazing. In addition, soil carbon isotope data indicated rapid carbon turnover after conversion from C-4 pasture to C-3 afforestation. Our results clearly show the potential for considerable carbon sequestration of tropical afforestation and highlight the risk of carbon losses from pasture ecosystems in a seasonal tropical climate.

TI  - Conservation of Plant Diversity in Agroforestry Systems in a Biodiversity Hotspot Region of Northeast India
T2  - AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
AB  - In Assam, a north-eastern state of India, most of the traditional agroforestry systems are still practised. The plant species composition of three agroforestry systems namely homegardens tea gardens and agrisilvicultural systems, were assessed using quadrat method. A total of 516 plant species belonging to 241 genera under 91 families were recorded, which consisted of 134 trees, 143 shrubs (67 shrub species and 76 species of saplings) and 239 herbs (93 herb species, 33 climber species and 113 species of seedlings). Homegardens had the highest species richness (475 plant species) belonging to 234 genera under 90 families. This was followed by agrisilvicultural systems (101 spp., 43 genera, 29 families), and the least was in tea gardens (79 spp., 41 genera, 25 families). The highest average number of plant species per system was recorded in homegarden (108.96 +/- 5.96, range 23-207 spp.). A negative correlation was found between the agroforestry system plot size and plant species richness. Sorenson's similarity index showed a very low degree of similarity in the plant species recorded among the three selected systems. Out of 516 plant species recorded across the different agroforestry systems, 1.0% species (n = 3) were vulnerable (Aquilaria malaccensis, Saraca asoca and Santalum album), 8.9% species (n = 46) were least concerned, 1.6% species (n = 8) were data deficient and 88.6% species (n = 457) were not assessed. Only homegarden recorded all the three plant species under the vulnerable category of IUCN Red List. It can be concluded that the agroforestry systems, specially the homegardens harbour rich plant diversity and act as miniature versions of natural forests by conserving rare, threatened and data-deficient plant species. The results suggest that the agroforestry systems with some management interventions need to be promoted as conservation models in areas with high pressure on tropical forests.

TI  - Quercus wutaishanica shrub affects temperate forest community composition and soil properties under different restoration stage
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Quercus wutaishanica is the dominant tree species in the natural ecosystem restoration of temperate forests in China, and it plays an active role in maintaining ecological balance. However, little is known about how ecosystem versatility develops during the restoration of forest ecosystems dominated by Q. wutaishanica. In this study, we investigated the species composition of the Q. wutaishanica community, soil nutrients, and their functional traits at various restoration stages, and comprehensively analyzed the correlations among them. At the early stage of restoration (10 years of restoration), there were Spiraea pubescens and Syringa pubescens in Q. wutaishanica community (87% of the total species), while had a larger niche width. In the middle of restoration (30 years of restoration), shannon and evenness indices were the largest, while soil total carbon, ammonium nitrogen and chlorophyll content of Q. wutaishanica leaves were the highest; among them, soil total carbon was 15.7% higher than that in 10 years of restoration, 32.4% higher than that in 40 years of restoration, ammonium nitrogen was 71.7% higher than that in 40 years of restoration, and chlorophyll content was 217.9% higher than that in 10 years of restoration, and 51.8% higher than that in 40 years of restoration. At the later stage of restoration (40 years of restoration), Lonicera ferdinandii occupied the dominant ecological niche, and soil available nitrogen, available phosphorus content and leaf thickness were the largest; while AN was 10.9% higher than that of 10 years of restoration, 16.5% higher than that of 30 years of restoration, AP was 60.6% higher than that of 10 years of restoration, 21.6% higher than that of 30 years of restoration, leaf thickness was 22.3% higher than that of 10 years of restoration, 84.9% higher than that of 30 years of restoration. However, the restriction of various soil nutrients was reduced. Our study highlighted the effectiveness of soil resource availability in plant communities during restoration, reduced competition for light among plants, and altered species richness. Furthermore, changes in the interrelationship between plant community composition and leaf functional traits of the dominant species responded positively to community restoration. These results further deepen our understanding of forest management and restoration of forest communities. In the future, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the influence of various factors on forest community restoration.

TI  - Tree diversity effects on soil microbial biomass and respiration are context dependent across forest diversity experiments
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB  - Aim Soil microorganisms are essential for the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Although soil microbial communities and functions are linked to tree species composition and diversity, there has been no comprehensive study of the generality or context dependence of these relationships. Here, we examine tree diversity-soil microbial biomass and respiration relationships across environmental gradients using a global network of tree diversity experiments. Location Boreal, temperate, subtropical and tropical forests. Time period 2013. Major taxa studied Soil microorganisms. Methods Soil samples collected from 11 tree diversity experiments were used to measure microbial respiration, biomass and respiratory quotient using the substrate-induced respiration method. All samples were measured using the same analytical device, method and procedure to reduce measurement bias. We used linear mixed-effects models and principal components analysis (PCA) to examine the effects of tree diversity (taxonomic and phylogenetic), environmental conditions and interactions on soil microbial properties. Results Abiotic drivers, mainly soil water content, but also soil carbon and soil pH, significantly increased soil microbial biomass and respiration. High soil water content reduced the importance of other abiotic drivers. Tree diversity had no effect on the soil microbial properties, but interactions with phylogenetic diversity indicated that the effects of diversity were context dependent and stronger in drier soils. Similar results were found for soil carbon and soil pH. Main conclusions Our results indicate the importance of abiotic variables, especially soil water content, for maintaining high levels of soil microbial functions and modulating the effects of other environmental drivers. Planting tree species with diverse water-use strategies and structurally complex canopies and high leaf area might be crucial for maintaining high soil microbial biomass and respiration. Given that greater phylogenetic distance alleviated unfavourable soil water conditions, reforestation efforts that account for traits improving soil water content or select more phylogenetically distant species might assist in increasing soil microbial functions.

TI  - The impact of grazing on dung beetle diversity depends on both biogeographical and ecological context
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB  - AimWe analysed the effects of grazing on the diversity and structure of dung beetle communities to see whether the biogeographical and ecological contexts influence dung beetle responses. We hypothesized that the responses of dung beetle communities are modulated by both the ecological conditions resulting from the transformation of native vegetation into grazing areas, and the history of the species inhabiting different biogeographical provinces.
   LocationThe state of Hidalgo, in the Mexican Transition Zone, central Mexico.
   MethodsWe used a standardized hierarchical sampling procedure in three biogeographical provinces located in Hidalgo. Within each province, we identified the dominant vegetation types, and within these we identified the sites with native vegetation and those modified by grazing. The design included 800 baited pitfall traps, and allowed us to study the response of dung beetle communities with different biogeographical histories to ecological context.
   ResultsWe captured 8707 beetles belonging to 37 species and 17 genera in the subfamily Scarabaeinae. We found that grazing areas only had a negative effect on dung beetle diversity in tropical forest; conversely, in dry environments (pine-oak forest and xerophilous scrubland) diversity in grazing areas was higher than in the native vegetation sites. We did not detect a clear effect in cloud forest sites. Species turnover between the native vegetation and pastures was high locally, and low over larger spatial scales (vegetation type or biogeographical province). In all four vegetation types grazing was associated with differences in dung beetle community composition.
   Main conclusionsThe impact of grazing on dung beetle diversity is dependent to a considerable degree on the local ecological conditions and the biogeographical context that has shaped the composition of communities over time.

TI  - Even cooler insights: On the power of forests to (water the Earth and) cool the planet
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Scientific innovation is overturning conventional paradigms of forest, water, and energy cycle interactions. This has implications for our understanding of the principal causal pathways by which tree, forest, and vegetation cover (TFVC) influence local and global warming/cooling. Many identify surface albedo and carbon sequestration as the principal causal pathways by which TFVC affects global warming/cooling. Moving toward the outer latitudes, in particular, where snow cover is more important, surface albedo effects are perceived to overpower carbon sequestration. By raising surface albedo, deforestation is thus predicted to lead to surface cooling, while increasing forest cover is assumed to result in warming. Observational data, however, generally support the opposite conclusion, suggesting surface albedo is poorly understood. Most accept that surface temperatures are influenced by the interplay of surface albedo, incoming shortwave (SW) radiation, and the partitioning of the remaining, post-albedo, SW radiation into latent and sensible heat. However, the extent to which the avoidance of sensible heat formation is first and foremost mediated by the presence (absence) of water and TFVC is not well understood. TFVC both mediates the availability of water on the land surface and drives the potential for latent heat production (evapotranspiration, ET). While latent heat is more directly linked to local than global cooling/warming, it is driven by photosynthesis and carbon sequestration and powers additional cloud formation and top-of-cloud reflectivity, both of which drive global cooling. TFVC loss reduces water storage, precipitation recycling, and downwind rainfall potential, thus driving the reduction of both ET (latent heat) and cloud formation. By reducing latent heat, cloud formation, and precipitation, deforestation thus powers warming (sensible heat formation), which further diminishes TFVC growth (carbon sequestration). Large-scale tree and forest restoration could, therefore, contribute significantly to both global and surface temperature cooling through the principal causal pathways of carbon sequestration and cloud formation.
   We assess the cooling power of forest cover at both the local and global scales. Our differentiated approach based on the use of multiple diagnostic metrics suggests that surface albedo effects are typically overemphasized at the expense of top-of-cloud reflectivity. Our analysis suggests that carbon sequestration and top-of-cloud reflectivity are the principal drivers of the global cooling power of forests, while evapotranspiration moves energy from the surface into the atmosphere, thereby keeping sensible heat from forming on the land surface. While deforestation brings surface warming, wetland restoration and reforestation bring significant cooling, both at the local and the global scale.image

TI  - Natural regeneration or tree planting in a tropical forest-to-pasture damaged area: which is more efficacious for soil ecosystem recovery?
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - This study assessed whether a natural regeneration or active tree-planting reforestation strategy better restored the C and N-cycle processes and associated microbiota within soils after 18 years in a Premontane Wet Life zone site in Monteverde, Costa Rica, compared to adjacent old secondary forest and pasture soils (both >60 years). Our findings apply to small-scale restoration sites (<0.5 ha plots) commonly used in Monteverde. Both restoration strategies showed recovering soil C and N-cycle processes with similar levels of TN, NH4+, NO3-, Biomass-C, and efficiency of organic C use. Both strategies appeared to positively influence the recovery of the levels and community compositional stability of the Actinobacterial, Acidobacterial, N-fixing (N-Fixer) bacterial, ammonium-oxidizing bacterial, and complex organic C-degrading fungal communities. The main differences between the two strategies were that the tree-planted and pasture soils had similar compositions of the Actinobacterial, N-Fixer, and Fungal complex organic C degrader, while the natural regeneration and pasture soils had similar compositions of these groups and the Acidobacteria. However, the community compositions of all five microbial groups were different between restored forest and the old secondary forest soils. These results suggest that while the soil ecosystems from both reforestation strategies are recovering, after 18 years, there is still more recovery to occur. Lastly, possible indicators of post-restoration soil ecosystem enhancement included increasing constancy of critical microbial group composition, efficiency of organic C conversion to biomass, Biomass-C,NH4+, NO3-, and levels of Acidothermus, Acidobacteria subgroups 2, 3, and 5, Archaeorhizomyces, Anaeromyxobacter, Bradyrhizobium, Nitrosomonas, Flavobacterium, and Nitrospira.

TI  - Assisted Natural Regeneration in slash-and-burn agriculture: Results in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
T2  - BOIS ET FORETS DES TROPIQUES
AB  - Human impacts on natural tropical forests in Central Africa are to a large extent linked to shifting cultivation and fuelwood extraction in pen-urban areas. This is especially true around the city of Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which is why research was conducted in 2010 by the Makala Project in the city's fuelwood supply basin. The aims were to adapt and test Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR), improve slash-andburn crop systems and contribute to the enrichment of forest fallows. Prior to slashing and burning, useful trees were selected for protection. Then, during cropping, the germination and multiplication of stump shoots and root suckers from existing local forest species were promoted by selective weeding, thinning, and pruning. Monitoring of the test areas found low survival rates for old trees conserved before the land was slashed and burned, due to the difficulty of controlling the fires. This means that the technique can only be used for the edges of plots, by gradually enriching hedgerows. In contrast, stumps shoots and root suckers from natural forest species protected by AN R during agricultural weeding grew rapidly inside the plots, thus rapidly establishing woody fallows without the need for costly inputs or heavy labour. In 2014, three and a half years after slashing and burning, biodiversity and biomass in these fallows is greater than in non-ANR fallows. Better charcoal and crop productivity and a slower rate of forest transition into savannah are expected. However, social acceptance, a critical factor in the large-scale dissemination of this innovation, must be investigated in the light of potential developments in traditional and modern land tenure rights.

TI  - From natural forest to tree crops, co-domestication of forests and tree species, an overview
T2  - NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
CP  - International Symposium on Processes and Stages in the Transition from Natural Forest Ecosystems to Tree Crop Plantations
AB  - The process of domestication of tree crops has only been given limited attention. This process starts with the protection of natural forests and ends with the cultivation of domesticated tree crops. In this evolutionary process three types of human-influenced forest environments may be distinguished: (a) conserved forests, (b) modified forests, (c) transformed forests. During the process of domestication an increasing input of human energy per unit of exploited forest takes place. Accordingly three phases in the domestication of forests may be distinguished: (a) an acculturalization phase in which social measures aimed at controlling the utilization of valuable tree species or patches of forests are implemented, (b) a phase of manipulation of wild tree species in which the socially-oriented management practices are enhanced with measures aimed at enhancing the (re)productive potential of valued species, (c) a phase of cultivation of genetically modified tree crops. As a result of the co-domestication of forests and trees various types of forests and/or tree cultivation systems can be distinguished. So far more attention has been given to understanding the characteristics of the early and end phases than to the various intermediate phases represented by indigenous forest management and agroforestry systems. These are characterized by a modification of the highly diverse natural forest ecosystems to a state in which the biodiversity has been somewhat reduced, but in which a larger proportion of useful resources are present. Such systems provide interesting examples of the wide range of options for managing forest resources with varying degrees of biodiversity and productive values.

TI  - Strategies for restoring tree seedling recruitment in high conservation value tropical montane forests underplanted with cardamom
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
AB  - Question: What strategies are most appropriate for restoring tree seedling recruitment whilst avoiding the spread of invasive plant species in high conservation value tropical forests disturbed by planting a shade-demanding crop?
   Location: Knuckles Forest Reserve, Sri Lanka (7 degrees 21-7 degrees 24N, 80 degrees 45-80 degrees 48E).
   Methods: An experiment was conducted to test the effects of clipping or removal of established cardamom plants on recruitment of native tree seedlings and spread of non-native plants in a tropical montane forest with abandoned cardamom stands in the understorey. The number and composition of tree seedling emergents, the cover of herbaceous plants and the recovery of cardamom were assessed for 3yr.
   Results: Tree seedling recruitment was higher in plots from which above-ground cardamom biomass had been removed through slashing (meanSE per 5m(2); 28.9 +/- 2.70) and those where cardamom plants had been removed completely through uprooting (32.2 +/- 3.17), or when dead cardamom leaves and stems were removed with small-scale extraction of pods (22.5 +/- 2.16), than in unmanipulated control plots (16.6 +/- 1.13) over 15mo. The species composition of tree seedling emergents did not differ in response to removal of cardamom. However, the cover of herbaceous plants, including the non-native invasive Ageratina riparia, increased in response to removal of cardamom. Recovery of cardamom was higher when the plants had been slashed than when entire plants were uprooted and removed.
   Conclusion: Slashing or uprooting cardamom plants is a potential strategy for restoring tree seedling recruitment in forests with abandoned cardamom stands in the understorey, but these interventions would need to be repeated annually over many years to be successful, and they risk promoting expansion of the cover of herbaceous plants, including non-native species. Hence, this approach would be labour-intensive and costly. An alternative approach to promoting tree seedling emergence and establishment is to clear dead cardamom leaves and stems, and to encourage small-scale extraction of pods from the residual cardamom plants. Harvesting pods reduces the likelihood that the crop will be sustained in situ through natural regeneration, and supplies an income to local communities, which would enhance the social acceptability of the intervention.

TI  - Soil restoration potential with corridor replanting engineering in the monoculture rubber plantations of Southwest China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Corridor engineering is a common approach for wildlife conservation. The influence of the practice on soil properties including nutrients and organic matter, however, remains poorly investigated. In order to predicate the long-term effects of Asian elephant (Elephas maximus L.) conservation corridors (AECC) of the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) on soil properties and functional recovery, we studied the soil comprehensive accumulation ability and estimated total recovery time under two major forest types on which the corridor is built (natural secondary forest and rubber plantation) and one forest type generated by ecological replanting on existing rubber plantation in comparison with soils under primary rain forest and fallow land in Xishuangbanna, Southwest China. Soil samples were taken from five research sites and fifteen soil properties were measured.
   On a 30-year basis, soil recovery differed significantly in the three regimes. The natural secondary forest regime had the highest comprehensive accumulation of about 92% and the shortest estimated recovery time (37-40 years). In contrast, the monoculture rubber plantation, despite constant fertilizer and management input, yielded the poorest recovery result of about 75% and the longest recovery time (95-100 years). From the perspective of soil recovery, this regime appears unsustainable. However, the ecological replanting using local rain forest trees and shrubs thereby to build forest structure complexity and diversity on the monoculture rubber plantation improved comprehensive accumulation ability of about 8% (from 75% to 83%) and shortened the recovery time (40 years). The results suggest that the corridor engineering by natural secondary forest regime or by ecological replanting of monoculture rubber plantation can serve as effective regimes for soil properties recovery.

TI  - Using the CENTURY model to assess the impact of land reclamation and management practices in oasis agriculture on the dynamics of soil organic carbon in the arid region of North-western China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY
AB  - Large-scale reclamation of arid land in North-western China over the past 50 years has converted the natural desert landscape into anthropogenic oasis, particularly in the lower part of watersheds. Drastic human activities may have caused the change of soil organic carbon (SOC) in anthropogenic oasis. This study employs the CENTURY model (Version 4.0) to investigate the effects of land reclamation and management practices in oasis agriculture on the dynamic of SOC at the lower part of Sangong river watershed, a typical anthropogenic oasis reclaimed at 50 years ago. Based on field investigation, history of crop rotations, and past farm practices in study area, land management practices were divided into five categories, corresponding five periods, 0-1958, 1959-1984, 1985-1992, 1993-1998 and 1999-2008. The model successfully simulated the SOC dynamics of the top layer soil (0-20 cm) in the different periods. The state of equilibrium of total SOC and the active, slow, and passive carbon pools were built by CENTURY model in 0-1959. Over the 50 years' cultivation (1959-2008), the mean change in total SOC exhibited complex ways. SOC increased rapidly in the first 2 years (1959-1960) after shrubland reclamation, and declined slowly during the period 1961-1984 and then decreased rapidly from 1985 to 1992. Between 1993 and 1998, it remained relatively stable, and climbed rapidly again during 1999-2008. The trend in total SOC showed "N" shape, i.e., increase, decrease, then increase. Finally, total SOC is greater (8.2%) in 2008 than the original level of SOC under the natural desert shrub. The improvements of land management practices such as ploughing being replaced with no tillage, straw being crushed before returning it to soil, and reasonable application of fertilizers, played a key role in the change in total SOC. Especially, soil carbon sequestration was obviously increased since protective management practices were implemented in 1993, such as no tillage, straw returning to soil, and the balanced fertilization technique. The results were different from the conclusions that loss of soil organic carbon would happen due to reclamation and continuous farming in tropical forests, semiarid grasslands of northern China and Nigerian semiarid Savannah.

TI  - Do national strategies under the UN biodiversity and climate conventions address agricultural commodity consumption as deforestation driver?
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Forest conversion in the tropics is increasingly driven by global demand for agricultural forest-risk commodities such as soy, beef, palm oil and timber. In order to be effective, future forest conservation policies should include measures targeting both producers (the supply side) and consumers (the demand side) to address commodity driven deforestation. Whereas the UN Conventions on Biodiversity (CBD) and Climate Change (UNFCCC) do not make reference to this driving factor, here we explore whether and how recent national strategies by member states to the Conventions acknowledge the role of agricultural commodities in tropical deforestation. A text analysis of 139 Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to climate change mitigation and 132 National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) shows that the general trade-off between national development aspirations and forest conservation is commonly acknowledged. However, only few strategies link deforestation to commodity production and consumption, whereas most documents do not mention this topic. This lack of reference to a key driver of tropical deforestation limits the prospects of safeguarding tropical forests for biodiversity and climate change mitigation purposes as part of the two UN Conventions, and might jeopardise their overall effectiveness.
   These findings were complemented by a content analysis of INDCs, NBSAPs and REDD + documents from eight case countries affected by commodity-driven deforestation. We investigated whether this driver is acknowledged in the national strategies, and which policy measures are suggested to address forest loss from agricultural commodities. We found that six case countries mention agricultural commodities as deforestation driver in their REDD + documents, whereas the biodiversity and climate change strategies were silent on the topic. Policy measures targeting commodity production were suggested in four REDD + strategies, ranging from incentive payments, sustainable agricultural practices and land-use planning to demand-side approaches such as certification and the promotion of sustainable lifestyles.
   One conclusion from this exercise is that UN member states seem not to consider climate and biodiversity national plans the adequate forum to discuss detailed forest conservation approaches. We argue that in order to increase effectiveness, strategies under the UN Conventions should take commodity-driven deforestation into account, through measures that address both the producer and the consumer side.

TI  - Genetic conservation of a threatened Neotropical palm through community-management of fruits in agroforests and second-growth forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The commercial exploitation of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) has been widely promoted to achieve both conservation and economic outcomes in the management of tropical forests by local communities, but monitoring the impacts of NTFPs harvesting is still challenging. Monitoring genetic diversity is a promising approach to assess harvesting impacts and guide best practices. Here, we evaluated the value of community-managed agroforests and secondary forests for conserving genetic structure and diversity of Euterpe edulis, an endemic palm explored for fruit and palm heart production. We used SSR markers to compare genetic diversity in populations growing in protected areas, in agroforests and in second-growth forests managed for fruit production in the coastal Atlantic Forest of Brazil. In addition, we investigated the genetic diversity of seeds extracted during pulp removal, which have been used in E. edulis reintroduction programs. Overall, high levels of genetic diversity were observed for all populations (mean allelic richness = 7.06; mean expected heterozygosity = 0.787), with no significant differences in genetic diversity among agroforests, second-growth forests and protected areas. Managed forests and protected areas had low to intermediate levels of genetic differentiation (global Fixation Index = 0.085), indicating the existence of gene flow among them. Seeds extracted during fruit pulp removal had as high genetic variability as populations growing in protected areas, thus evidencing the potential of using these seeds to recover overexploited populations. Thus, community-management of NTFPs in agroforests and second growth forests may support genetic conservation of this threatened species, complementing the conservation role of protected areas.

TI  - Tree species diversity and its relationship with carbon stock in the parkland agroforestry of Northern Ethiopia
T2  - COGENT BIOLOGY
AB  - Parkland agroforestry can store carbon and conserves biodiversity. Studying the relationship between carbon stock and biodiversity is crucial in understanding the tradeoff between major benefits of the parkland agroforestry system, and way to achieve the optimum balance between them. Therefore, this study aims to estimate the biomass and SOC in community type, and explore the relationship between carbon stocks and diversity. Tree with DBH (Diameter at breast height) > 2 cm was measured and species were identified in 75 (50x100m) randomly located plots. Species richness (S), Species evenness (J), Shannon-weiner diversity index (H') and Simpson diversity index (D) of the study area were 3.02, 0.81, 0.82 and 0.46 respectively. Similarly, the mean aboveground (AGC), belowground (BGC) and soil organic (SOC) carbon were 7.9, 3.03 and 20.07 Mg C ha-1 respectively. There was a liner and weakly significant correlation between AGC and tree J in plant community 2 (r = -0.558, P < 0.05) and 3 (r = -0.451, P < 0.05), and there was a negative correlation between J (r = -0.552, P < 0.05), D (r = -0.646, P < 0.05) and H' (r = -0.643, P < 0.05) with TC (Total carbon) in plant community 2. However, there was no significant relationship between J, D and H' with TC in plant communities 1 and 3. In these parkland agroforestry systems, the relationship tree species diversity with AGC and TC appeared to be highly variable; it indicates that parkland agroforestry systems have significantly improved the vegetation and SOC. However, forest carbon enhancement cannot assure the biodiversity conservation and promotion in a parkland agroforestry system.

TI  - Contrasting trends in biodiversity of birds and trees during succession following cacao agroforest abandonment
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Understanding how transformed habitats act as reservoirs of biodiversity is a key challenge at a time when ecosystems are under unprecedented pressure. Here we compare tree and bird biodiversity in actively cultivated and abandoned cacao agroforests, and use a space for time approach to ask how this diversity has changed over 100 years of succession.
   Tree and bird communities were surveyed in cacao agroforests, secondary forests at different stages of succession and primary forests in the Northern Range of Trinidad, West Indies, to test the prediction that there are consistent temporal trends in alpha and beta-diversity across taxa.
   Temporal alpha-diversity was taxon dependent. We found that tree alpha-diversity increased with forest age. In contrast, there was no temporal trend in bird alpha-diversity. Tree and bird species richness were negatively correlated.
   Tree and bird composition varied with forest age and environmental distance. A greater proportion of native trees, and of highly forest-dependent and insectivorous birds were found in older forests.
   Our analyses show that actively cultivated and young abandoned cacao agroforests can sustain high bird alpha-diversity, despite lower levels of tree alpha-diversity. Old secondary and primary forests have unique species compositions including more sensitive and specialist species. Compositional shifts with successional stage for both trees and birds produce a patchwork of habitats that contribute to regional gamma-diversity.
   Synthesis and applications. Our research highlights the value of actively cultivated cacao agroforests and secondary forest alongside primary forests as reservoirs of biodiversity. By supporting both biodiversity and livelihoods, traditionally grown shade-cacao agroforests fall within a people and nature framework. Taken together, these results emphasise the contributions of secondary forests, which are often overlooked, to conservation.

T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
AB  - Given the mounting global concerns about mitigating climate change and curbing greenhouse gas emissions, it becomes increasingly crucial to comprehend the effects of logging techniques on biomass dynamics in tropical forests. This understanding is essential for fostering greater carbon retention and sequestration, aligning with the objectives of initiatives like REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation plus sustainable forest management and the conservation and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) and other conservation goals. In this context, this study investigated the effects of two wood harvesting methods, reduced-impact logging (RIL) and conventional logging (CL), on above-ground biomass (AGB) recovery rates 24 years after harvesting. The experimental design was based on three treatments: RIL, CL, and an unlogged control plot, situated in the municipality of Paragominas, State of Para<acute accent>, in the Eastern Amazon region of Brazil. All trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 25 cm, as well as all trees of commercial species with a DBH >= 10 cm, were monitored in a 24.5 ha plot within each treatment. Additionally, a 5.25 ha subplot within each treatment was designated for the monitoring of all trees with DBH >= 10 cm. The biomass data were generated from 11 measurements carried out from 1993 to 2017 (24-year period). Pre-logging AGB stocks were estimated at 181 Mg ha1 in the RIL plot, 187 Mg ha-1 in the CL plot, and 174 Mg ha-1 in the control plot. One year after logging, AGB decreased by 19 % under RIL and 30 % under CL, while the control forest remained unchanged. By 13 years after harvest, the RIL plot achieved 102 % AGB recovery, while the CL plot recovered 86 % of the original pre-harvest stock. Over the 24-year post-logging period, AGB stocks recovered to 128 % in the RIL plot compared to only 90 % in the CL plot, while the control forest maintained 93 % of its original stock. The average annual ABG increment rates were 3.56 Mg ha-1 year-1 after RIL and 2.33 Mg ha-1 year-1 after CL. Our findings demonstrate that implementing RIL is a more effective strategy for maintaining post-logging AGB stocks and accelerating AGB recovery rates, serving as a significant mitigation measure against climate change.

TI  - Small Landscape Elements Double Connectivity in Highly Fragmented Areas of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - The Atlantic Forest in Brazil is a biodiversity hotspot, yet its diverse ecosystems and species are becoming increasingly threatened by habitat loss and extreme habitat fragmentation. Most habitat patches of Atlantic Forest are dispersed across agricultural landscapes (e.g., grazing and cropping) in relatively small and isolated fragments (80% < 50 ha). Forest fragments < 1 ha, scattered trees in pastures, tree lines on trenches and fences, and remnant riparian forest, collectively called here Small Landscape Elements (SLEs), are very common in this context. While these SLEs make up much of the Atlantic Forests footprint, very little is known about their role or impact on the persistence and conservation of species. In this study, we investigate the role of SLEs on landscape configuration, particularly their contribution toward landscape connectivity of individual species and the genetic flow of species between larger forest fragments. We randomly selected 20 buffers of 707 hectares within a 411,670 hectare area of the Atlantic Forest that was completely covered by forest in the past located in the south of Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The forest cover randomly varied between these buffers. We used graph theory to measure landscape connectivity as the probability of connectivity for different disperser movement types between landscape knots (habitat patches). We used three estimated dispersal distances in the models: pollen disperser insect (50 m), low-mobility seed disperser bird (100 m) and high-mobility seed disperser bird (760 m). The SLEs together increased the probability of connection by roughly 50%, for all model dispersers, if compared to a theoretical baseline landscape containing no SLEs. Of all SLEs, riparian forests contribute the most toward enhancing landscape connectivity. In these highly fragmented landscapes, such as the Atlantic Forest (>70%), the position of SLEs within the landscapes was more important than their respective areas for connectivity. Although the landscapes were deeply fragmented, we showed that the presence of SLEs can increase connectivity and reduce further biodiversity loss in the Atlantic Forest.

TI  - Sustainability of Brazilian forest concessions
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - In 2006, the Brazilian Forest Service (SFB) started an ambitious program to establish forest concessions so as to provide a legal framework for long-term sustainable timber production in Amazonian forests. Forest concessions in the Brazilian Amazon currently cover only 1.6 million ha (Mha) but we estimate the area of all potential concessions as 35 Mha. This paper assessed the conditions under which the present and potential concession system can ensure an annual production of 11 Mm(3). yr(-1) to meet the estimated present timber demand. For this we used the volume dynamics with differential equations model (VDDE) calibrated for the Amazon Basin with a Bayesian framework with data from 3500 ha of forest plots monitored for as long as 30 years after selective logging. Predictions of commercial volume recovery rates vary with location.
   We tested 27 different scenarios by using combinations of initial proportion of commercial volume, logging intensity and cutting cycle length. These scenarios were then applied to the current area of concessions and to the area of all potential concessions (35 Mha). Under current logging regulations and the current concession area (mean logging intensity of 15-20 m(3).ha(-1), a harvest cycle of 35 years and an initial commercial timber volume proportion of 20%), timber production can be maintained only for a single cutting cycle (35 years). Only the scenario with a logging intensity of 10 m(3)ha(-1) every 60 years with a 90% initial proportion of commercial timber species can be considered as sustainable. Under this scenario, the maximum annual production with the present concession areas is 159,000 m(3) (157-159), or less than 2% of the present annual production of 11 Mm(3). When considering all potential concession areas (35 Mha), under current rules, the total annual production is 10 Mm(3)yr(-1) (2-17 Mm(3)yr(-1), 95% credibility interval) but is not maintained after the first logging cycle. Under the most sustainable scenario (see above) and a concession area of 35 Mha, the long-term sustainable annual production of timber reaches only 3.4 Mm(3)yr(-1). Based on these results we argue that the concession system will not be able to supply the timber demand without substantial reforms in natural forest management practices and in the wood industry sector. We argue that alternative sources of timber, including plantations linked with forest restoration initiatives, must be promoted.

TI  - Biodiversity and ecosystem function of tropical forest dung beetles under contrasting logging regimes
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - A key challenge for tropical conservation biologists is to assess how forest management practices affect biodiversity and associated ecosystem functions. Dung beetles (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) provide an ideal focal guild for such studies. We compared dung beetle assemblages and experimentally assessed rates of dung removal and seed burial in undisturbed forest, low-intensity selectively logged forest under sustainable forest management, and high-intensity logged forest, not under sustainable management in Malaysian Borneo. In total, 7923 individuals from 39 species of dung beetle were collected. There were no significant differences in abundance, biomass or diversity across sites. Species richness was significantly lower in the high-intensity logged sites. Beta diversity was low: of 35 species recorded in undisturbed forest sites, 32 were also captured in low-intensity sites and 29 in high-intensity sites. The environmental and vegetation variables measured had little influence on species composition. An average of 63-99% of dung was removed over 24 h. Mean dung and seed removal were significantly lower in the high-intensity logged sites. Dung removal rates were significantly and positively correlated with dung beetle species richness, but not with dung beetle biomass or abundance. However, the biomass of large-bodied, nocturnal dung beetles was positively correlated with dung removal. In contrast to previous studies, dung beetle biomass and abundance were not correlated with species richness, indicative of density compensation. Overall, dung beetle communities and associated ecosystem functions were robust to low-intensity but not high-intensity selective logging. These differences may be related to changes in the abundance and biomass of particular dung beetle species or guilds rather than community-wide measures of abundance and biomass, highlighting the need to move beyond simplistic biodiversity-ecosystem functioning correlations to understand the functional consequences of habitat modification in high-diversity ecosystems.

TI  - Biodiversity inventory of trees in a large-scale permanent plot of tropical evergreen forest at Varagalaiar, Anamalais, Western Ghats, India
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - A permanent plot of 30 ha (600 x 500 m(2)) was established for long-term ecological research on biodiversity and forest functioning in a tropical evergreen forest at Varagalaiar, Anamalais, Western Ghats. This paper gives the results of the first census of trees in the 30 ha plot. All trees greater than or equal to 30 cm gbh were permanently tagged with sequentially numbered aluminium tags and their girth measured. 148 tree species (in 120 genera and 49 families) were enumerated in a total sample of 13,393 individuals. Species diversity, density and dispersion patterns were determined. The mean species richness, density and basal area per hectare were 65 species, 446 stems and 36.26 m(2) respectively. The Sorensen similarity index for thirty 1-ha subplots varied from 0.7 to 0.9, indicating the homogeneity in species composition of the stand. The pronounced species hierarchy has resulted in the dominance of four species that occupy four different forest storeys: Drypetes longifolia (lower storey) Reinwardtiodendron anamallayanum (middle storey), Poeciloneuron indicum (upper storey) and Dipterocarpus indicus (emergent). The forest was dominated by Euphorbiaceae in terms of richness (18 species) and abundance of species (3788 stems), and Dipterocarpaceae based on the contribution to basal area (18.4%). Species richness and density decreased with increasing girth-class. Girth class frequency of the stand exhibited an expanding population of trees. Twenty-nine tree species, analysed for spatial dispersion at 1-ha scale, exhibited both clumped and uniform patterns, except Vateria indica which was randomly distributed in one hectare. Repeat census scheduled for subsequent years, will elucidate the behaviour of the individual species and the population dynamics of the tree flora and will be useful for forest conservation and management. It will also help to monitor human activity within this forest.

TI  - The mid-domain effect of mountainous plants is determined by community life form and family flora on the Loess Plateau of China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - The mid-domain effect (MDE) explains altitudinal patterns of species diversity of mountainous plants at different elevations. However, its application is limited by the species life form and family flora in different layers of plant communities. To verify the MDE hypothesis at the plant community level, we chose a mountain with representative characteristics of the study area in the east of the Loess Plateau, China, such as obvious elevation (from 1324 to 2745 m) and latitude (from 36 degrees 23 ' to 39 degrees 03 ') gradients and considerable vegetation types (mainly coniferous and broad-leaved forests). We measured the life forms, families, and species diversity indices of tree, shrub, and herb communities along different elevations. We determined that the family numbers of the herb and shrub communities presented unimodal patterns across an altitudinal gradient, and the highest values occurred at intermediate elevations. The importance values of dominant families in the shrub and tree communities presented unimodal patterns, but the lowest values occurred at intermediate elevations. The species diversity indices of the herb, shrub, and tree communities conformed to unimodal change patterns following an altitudinal gradient, but the greatest diversity occurred at high, low, and intermediate elevations, respectively. At higher elevations, forbs and grasses grew well, whereas sedges grew well at lower elevations. Responses of different tree life forms to the altitudinal gradient were greater for evergreen coniferous tree species than for deciduous coniferous and deciduous broad-leaved tree species. We concluded that the MDE hypothesis of species diversity for mountainous plants is influenced greatly by the community life form and family at the plant community level in a temperate semi-arid region of the Loess Plateau, China. This conclusion tested and modified the MDE hypothesis and may be valuable for fueling prediction of biodiversity models and for the comparison with similar studies in arid and semi-arid mountainous regions.

TI  - Resettlement and landscape-level conservation: Corridors, human-wildlife conflict, and forest use in Central India
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Since the origin of the protected area network, authorities have resettled people in the interest of wildlife conservation. However, the impacts of resettlement on wildlife corridors connecting increasingly insular protected areas and the interaction of resettlement with existing human-wildlife conflict (HWC) outside of protected areas remain unclear. Using Kanha National Park (KNP) in central India as a case study, we quantified impacts of 450 households (that were resettled from 2009 to 2013, surveyed in 2016) on non-protected forests at their new settlement locations, We measured forest use for cattle grazing, tendu leaf extraction (a commercial non-timber forest product) and consumption of forest foods. We also quantified HWC risks that resettled households face at their new settlement locations. We use published spatial analyses on designation of the corridor and risks of human wildlife conflict in conjunction with our data to assess post-resettlement impacts at the new settlement locations. Overall, most resettled households (330) have moved to existing villages that lie outside of wildlife corridors around KNP. They comprise < 10% of existing populations at most of their new settlement villages. Many resettled households and their non-resettled neighbors face high HWC risks due to the spatial patterns of HWC around KNP. Controlling for assets and proximity to forest, resettled households own more cattle, are less involved in tendu trade, and consume fewer forests foods than non-resettled neighbors. Model results suggest that increasing off-farm economic opportunities would reduce pressures on forest resources for both resettled and non-resettled households. Our findings, while limited to the KNP landscape, provide approaches applicable in other human-dominated places to design resettlement strategies towards landscape-level conservation goals.

TI  - Seed rain in cocoa agroforests is induced by effects of forest loss on frugivorous birds and management intensity
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Tropical forests have been intensively degraded and deforested for different anthropogenic uses, mostly associated to agricultural expansion due to increasing human demands. Therefore, an emerging number of studies has advocated on the benefits of land-sharing strategies such as agroforestry systems which conciliate biodiversity conservation with production. Yet features at both landscape and local scales could affect ecological processes and productivity within agroforests. Here, we used structural equation models to investigate the direct and indirect effects of landscape forest cover, animal seed dispersers and local vegetation variables on the seed rain structure of cocoa (Theobroma cacao) agroforests of the Brazilian Atlantic forest. We sampled seed rain for 12 consecutive months, performed bird and bat surveys and measured local structure variables related to management intensification (i.e., lower abundance and richness of adult trees and lower canopy shading indicating farm intensification) in 15 farms embedded within landscapes showing varying forest cover amount (2.3?74.9 %). Our results indicate that total and animal-dispersed seed richness in cocoa agroforests increased in more forested landscapes induced by the frugivorous bird richness, whereas the abundance of total and animaldispersed seeds was greater in more shaded farms. Contrary to expectations, the abundance of total and animal-dispersed trees negatively influenced the richness of frugivorous birds, thus indirectly affecting the richness of total and animal-dispersed seeds. Finally, we observed a weak similarity among the composition of arrived seeds and adult trees of animal-dispersed species recorded in the same sampling sites, suggesting that several seeds were actively dispersed from other localities. Our results therefore demonstrate that landscape forest amount and local management intensification play key roles in determining the seed diversity reaching cocoa agroforestry farms. We emphasize the importance of retaining native vegetation cover around the cocoa agroforestry, by either preserving the existing forest remnants or promoting restoration programs within deforested landscapes, in addition to locally ensure tree shading to boost seed arrival and enhance ecosystem functionality.

TI  - Recent forest and land-use policy changes in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo: Are they truly transformational?
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - This paper analyses the policy changes occurring in the forest and palm oil sectors of Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, through the lens of the transformational change concept. The aim is to first examine whether Sabah is transforming and, if so, to identify the determinants enabling or hindering the change. To determine if Sabah is transforming, we used two criteria: - (i) an ambitious change in the policy framework, that promotes forest conservation and sustainable use, and is moving away from business-as-usual activities; and (ii) the level of implementation of the policies that we identified as supporting transformational change. We found that Sabah very likely did intend to transform. We made this conclusion based on comparing changes in policies occurring in Sabah, and we decided if it is ambitious by primarily comparing Sabah's policies with other Malaysian states, the federal government, and internationally. We showed that: (i) Sabah decided to use voluntary international certification standards (private market instruments) like FSC and RSPO, while the other Malaysian states did not; (ii) they decided to protect more forest compared to national and international targets; and (iii) Sabah is an early mover as the state is one of the first in the world to adopt the RSPO Jurisdictional Approach. But intention needs to be followed by implementation, and this is where the state falls short. The policies in Sabah were not fully implemented because of the patronage system where the more powerful actors used their power to continue with business-as-usual activities, there is frequent political turnover in Sabah, and the state faced difficulty in meeting international standards. Our research shows that local leadership and a local transformational change coalition (civil society actively working in Sabah) mainly prompted the transformational change, although the promises of economic gains and better reputation also played a role. We conclude by emphasising the change must be made more compelling for political leaders, as part of a broader institutional structure, not only through the narrow focus on reducing deforestation but through the development of a more sustainable and equitable national economy, and that consumer countries should play a role in reducing pressures on forest by providing incentives to a state that manages its natural resources sustainably.

TI  - Modelling and quantifying tree biometric properties of dry Afromontane forests of south-central Ethiopia
T2  - TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB  - Key message Models for quantifying tree biometric properties, imperative for forest management decision-making, including height, diameter, bark thickness and volume were developed, and wood basic density was documented for dry Afromontane forests of south-central Ethiopia. Tree biometric properties such as height (ht), diameter at breast height (dbh), bark thickness (bt), volume and wood basic density (wbd) are imperative for forest management decision-making. For dry Afromontane forests in south-central Ethiopia, models for quantifying such tree properties are totally lacking. This study, therefore, aimed at developing models for ht based on dbh, for dbh based on stump height diameter (dsh), for bt based on dbh,for volume based on dbh, ht and crown width (crw), as well as documenting wbd data. Comprehensive and representative datasets were collected from Degaga-Gambo and Wondo Genet forests. The ht, dbh and bt modelling were based on 1345 sampled trees during forest inventories, while the volume modelling and wbd documentation were based on 63 destructively sampled trees from 30 species covering 87% of the total basal area in the study sites. Weighted least squares regression was applied for modelling and leave one out cross-validation was used for evaluation. The ht-dbh and dbh-dsh models performed well (pseudo-R-2 = 0.72 and 0.98), while bt-dbh performed poorer (pseudo-R-2 = 0.42). Models for the total tree, merchantable stem and branches volume were developed with different options for independent variables, where pseudo-R(2)varied from 0.74 to 0.98, with smallest values for the branches models The models may be applied to forests outside the present study sites provided that the growing conditions are carefully evaluated. The species-wise wbd was ranging from 0.426 to 0.979 g cm(-3), with the overall mean of 0.588 g cm(-3). The wbd data will be useful for building up a national wbd database and may also be included in the Global Wood Density database. The study represents a significant step towards sustainable forest management including REDD + MRV practices in the dry Afromontane forests of south-central Ethiopia.

TI  - Local and landscape characteristics shape amphibian communities across production landscapes in the Western Ghats
T2  - ECOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS AND EVIDENCE
AB  - Global tropical forests have been modified and fragmented by commodity agroforests, leading to significant alterations in ecological communities. Nevertheless, these production landscapes offer secondary habitats that support and sustain local biodiversity. In this study, we assess community level and species-specific responses of amphibians to land management in areca, coffee and rubber, three of the largest commodity agroforests in the Western Ghats. A total of 106 agroforests across a 30,000-km(2) landscape were surveyed for amphibians using a combination of visual and auditory encounter surveys. We used a Bayesian multi-species occupancy modelling framework to examine patterns of species richness, beta diversity, dominance structure and individual species occupancies. The influence of biogeographic variables such as elevation and latitude as well as microhabitat availability of streams, ponds and unpaved plantation roads was tested on amphibian species occupancy. Coffee agroforests had the highest species richness and lowest dominance when compared to areca and rubber. Beta diversity was highest in areca for within agroforest measures. Compared across agroforests, coffee had highest beta diversity with areca and rubber. Both elevation and latitude showed an overall positive association with amphibian occupancy, although species-specific responses varied considerably. Microhabitat availability was one of the strongest predictors of amphibian occupancy, with mean community response being positive with presence of water bodies and roads. Pond presence increased species richness per site by 34.7% (species-specific responses in occupancy ranged from -2.7% to 327%). Stream presence alone did not change species richness but species-specific response ranged from -59% to 273%. Presence of plantation roads also increased species richness by 21.5% (species-specific response ranged from -82% to 656%). Being unpaved with little vehicular traffic, plantation roads seem to provide additional habitats for amphibians. Presence of all three microhabitats at a site increased species richness by 75%. Our study highlights the importance of land management strategies that maintain diverse native canopy and freshwater bodies and other microhabitats in sustaining amphibian fauna. Market-driven land-use change from coffee to other agroforest types will have detrimental effects on amphibian communities and their long-term sustainability in the Western Ghats.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration in Cropland Soils
T2  - CARBON SEQUESTRATION IN AGRICULTURAL ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Humans began to cultivate land thousands of years ago, for growing crops after clearing the previous vegetation cover and plowing the soil. The soil disturbance altered, in particular, soil C dynamics which has recently been exacerbated by the increase in crop intensification (i.e., fertilization, irrigation, liming, mechanization). This has resulted in major losses of terrestrial carbon (C); i.e., global emissions by the expansion of agriculture for croplands were estimated at 98.4 Pg C for the period 1850-2015. Cropland management can alter soil inorganic carbon (SIC) stocks which, in arid and semiarid climates, can be similar to or more than the amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock. However, whether a specific practice leads to a net sequestration of SIC in cropland soils needs additional research. Otherwise, the conversion of land to cropland in temperate regions may release up to 36% of the SOC stock to 27 cm depth, and up to 30% of the SOC stock to 48 cm depth in tropical regions. In 2000, about 12% of Earth's ice-free land surface or 15 million km(2) was used for croplands. Climate, geology, and land and crop management practices control the magnitude of the cropland SOC stock. A major fraction (25-70%) of the carbon dioxide (CO2) fixed during crop photosynthesis by gross primary production (GPP) is respired autotrophically (R-a) back to the atmosphere. Estimates of global cropland GPP vary between 8.2 and 20.0 Pg C yr(-1) (1 Pg = 10(15) g). The remaining net primary production (NPP = GPP - Ra) is the main C input into cropland soils. Cropland NPP includes the production of biomass in foliage, shoots and roots, weed and seed production, root exudation, the carbon (C) transfer to microorganisms that are symbiotically associated with roots, and the volatile organic carbon (VOC) emissions that are lost from leaves to the atmosphere. However, not all components of cropland NPP have yet been measured in a single study. NPP enters soil by rhizodeposition and decomposition of plant litter, but the major fraction is heterotrophically converted back to CO2 by soil respiration and some is lost as methane (CH4). Aside decomposition, C losses from croplands soils occur also by fire, erosion, leaching, and harvest. Thus, a small amount of fixed C remains in cropland soils and accumulates as SOC due to a combination of short- and long-term stabilization processes. Stabilization processes include physical protection of organic matter (OM) against decomposers and their enzymes, stabilization by organo-mineral complexes and organo-metal interactions, and some as biochemically recalcitrant black carbon (BC). Soil aggregation, in particular, may be the most important stabilization process in the surface layers of cropland soils. Site-specific factors including climate, physicochemical characteristics, soil and vegetation management determine the balance between C input and losses. Cropland soils can be recarbonized through the adoption of recommended management practices (RMPs) such as conservation tillage, residue mulching and use of cover crops, practices which all contribute to SOC accumulation and sequestration by an additional transfer of C from the atmosphere to the soil. Translating science of cropland soil management into a global restorative program is a high priority for feeding the world, mitigating climate change and improving the environment.

TI  - Functional trait profiles and diversity of trees regenerating in disturbed tropical forests and agroforests in Indonesia
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - A main question in restoration of degraded forests and forest landscapes recovering from logging and fire is what to expect from natural regeneration through surviving propagules in the soil or seed sources and associated dispersal agents from the surrounding landscape mosaic, as alternative to tree planting. Tree diversity in sec-ondary forests may be high, but based on newcomer species of low wood density and long-distance, abiotic dispersal modes. We compiled and analyzed three pairs of case studies (totaling 815 plots and 11.8 ha) of sec-ondary forests recovering from logging, fire and conversion to agroforest in Sumatra and Kalimantan (Indonesia) on mineral soils. Data on tree species diversity, wood density frequency distribution (indicative of successional status) and dispersal modes were compared with those of less disturbed comparator forests in the same land-scapes. Relatively undisturbed lowland dipterocarp forest in Kalimantan had close to 200 species of trees (>10 cm diameter) at a 1-ha sample scale (and 450 at a 10-ha scale). After repeated fires a sample area of 2 ha was needed to reach the same species richness. Regulation-based logging had little impact on tree species richness. In rubber agroforest with low-intensity management beyond rubber planting, 50 tree species were found at a 1-ha scale and close to 100 species in 3 ha. The Kalimantan forest after repeated fires had a markedly higher fraction of low-wood-density trees (40%), but otherwise, all forests sampled were similar in overall wood density profiles. Selectively logged forest managed by a local community (village forest) and rubber agroforest in Sumatra con-tained larger fractions of heavy-wood-density trees. The majority of trees (50%-70%) had birds, bats and primates as dispersal agents in all sites. Selectively logged forests had higher fractions of autochorous species (15%) compared to other sites. Anemochorous (wind-dispersed) species, especially Macaranga lowii, were most common (20%) in lowland dipterocarp forest. Comparison between secondary forests and agroforests showed the influence of farmer selection regarding what is allowed to grow beyond the pole stage. Wood density and seed dispersal profiles can be used as degradation indicators of species assemblages across various disturbance levels and types, as they reflect the habitat quality of the surrounding landscape mosaics.

TI  - Forest conservation maximises acai palm pollination services and yield in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Agricultural expansion is one of the main drivers of global pollinator loss. Paradoxically, this occurs while agriculture is becoming increasingly dependent on biotic pollination, raising concerns about food production. Integrated Crop Pollination (ICP), the use of both wild and managed pollinators in crop fields, can help conserve pollinator diversity while ensuring effective pollination services for growers. However, given the context-dependent nature of this approach, there is an urgent need to evaluate its application across different landscapes and crops.2. We apply the ICP approach to acai palm (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) production in the eastern Brazilian Amazon to explore effects of a native stingless bee, Scaptotrigona aff. postica (Apidae: Meliponini), and landscape-level forest conservation on yield and socioeconomic outcomes for acai fruit growers. We assessed flower visitor assemblages and fruit production on 18 plantations across a landscape forest cover gradient, with bee colonies introduced on nine plantations. Field data were combined with information from semistructured interviews of growers to estimate yield and profit per hectare under different pollinator management scenarios.3. Bee colonies and forest cover enhanced flower visitor abundance on palm inflorescences, but abundance increases attributed to managed bees were associated with shifts in flower visitor evenness and diversity (species richness), due to reduced visitation of wild bees near managed colonies.4. Fruit production on inflorescences was positively related to bee abundance and bee diversity. Consequently, overall pollination performance was lower in plantations with bee colonies. This was repeated at the hectare scale, where yield and profit were associated with surrounding forest cover and not bee colonies.5. Synthesis and applications. Managed bees can increase pollinator densities and fruit production, but the increased environmental and socioeconomic risks associated with this activity means acai growers should prioritise forest conservation to safeguard pollination services and improve overall sustainability of acai production in the eastern Brazilian Amazon.

TI  - Comparing airborne and terrestrial LiDAR with ground-based inventory metrics of vegetation structural complexity in oil palm agroforests
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Vegetation structural complexity is an important component of forest ecosystems, influencing biodiversity and functioning. Due to the heterogeneous distribution of vegetation elements, structural complexity underpins ecological dynamics, species composition, microclimate, and habitat diversity. Field measurements and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, such as airborne (ALS) and terrestrial (TLS), can assess structural characteristics of forest and agroforestry systems at various spatial scales. This assessment is urgently needed for monitoring ecosystem restoration in degraded lands (e.g., in oil palm landscapes), where it is not well-known how structural measures derived from these different approaches relate to each other. Here, we compared the degree of correlation between individual and multivariate datasets of vegetation structural complexity metrics derived from ALS, TLS, and ground-based inventory approaches. The study was conducted in a 140 ha oil palm monoculture, enriched with 52 plots in the form of tree islands representing agroforestry systems of varying sizes and planted diversity levels in Sumatra, Indonesia. Our datasets comprised 25 ALS, five TLS, and nine groundbased inventory metrics. We studied correlations among metrics related to traditional stand summary, heterogeneity, and vertical and horizontal stand structure. We used principal component analysis for data dimensionality reduction, correlation analysis to quantify the strength of relationships between metrics, and Procrustes analysis to investigate the agreement between datasets. Significant correlations were found between ALS and TLS metrics for canopy density (r = 0.79) and maximum tree height (r = 0.58) and between ALS and ground-based inventory measures of stand heterogeneity and height diversity (r between 0.60 and -0.63). Further, we observed significant agreements between the ordinations of multivariate datasets (r = 0.56 for ALS - TLS; and r = 0.46 for ALS - ground-based inventory). Our findings underline the ability of ALS to capture structural complexity patterns, especially for canopy gap dynamics and vegetation height metrics, as captured by TLS, and for measures of heterogeneity and vertical structure as captured by ground-based inventories. Our study highlights the strength of each approach and underscores the potential of integrating ALS and TLS with ground-based inventories for a comprehensive characterization of vegetation structure in complex agroforestry systems, which can provide guidance for their management and support ecosystem restoration monitoring efforts.

TI  - Sapling biomass allometry and carbon content in five afforestation species on marginal farmland in semi-arid Benin
T2  - NEW FORESTS
AB  - Allometric equations are routinely used in the estimation of biomass stocks for carbon accounting within forest ecosystems. However, generic equations may not reflect the growth trajectories of afforestation species that are introduced to degraded farmland characterized by water and nutrient limitations. Using sequential measurements of the height, basal diameter, and above- and belowground biomass of juvenile trees, we developed allometric equations for five woody species (Moringa oleifera Lam., Leucaena leucocephala Lam., Jatropha curcas L., Anacardium occidentale L. and Parkia biglobosa Jacq.) subjected to a gradient of water and nutrient availability in an afforestation trial on degraded cropland in the semi-arid zone of Benin, West Africa. For three of the species studied, the allometric relationships between basal diameter and biomass components (i.e. leaves, stems and roots) were described best by a simple power-law model (R-2 > 0.93). The incorporation of species-specific height-diameter relationships and total height as additional predictors in the power-law function also produced reasonable estimates of biomass. Fifteen months after planting, roots accounted for 10-58% of the total biomass while the root-to-shoot ratio ranged between 0.16 and 0.73. The total biomass of the saplings ranged between 1.4 and 10.3 Mg ha(-1), yielding 0.6-4.3 Mg C ha(-1), far exceeding the biomass in the traditional fallow system. The rate of stem carbon sequestration measured ca. 0.62 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). Overall, the allometric equations developed in this study are generally useful for assessing the standing shoot and root biomass of the five afforestation species during the juvenile growth stage and can help in reporting and verifying carbon stocks in young forests.

TI  - Biomass and carbon storage of Eucalyptus and Acacia plantations in the Pearl River Delta, South China
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Forest plantations represent an important carbon sink. In the Pearl River Delta (PRD) in Southern China, fast-growing Eucalyptus and Acacia are favoured plantation species, but little is known regarding their efficiency with respect to biomass production, partitioning and dynamics with stand age, or the contribution made by the understory, litter and coarse woody debris (CWD) to the volume of biomass and fixed carbon. Here, a set of 21 plantations of various ages were monitored for the pattern of biomass accumulation and partitioning. A continuous biomass expansion factor (BEF) method was applied to a set of forest inventory data (FID) over the periods 1989-2003 to estimate biomass accumulation, carbon storage and its pattern of change over time. The accumulation of biomass increased with stand age, reaching, respectively, 207.45 and 189.35 t ha(-1) in mature Eucalyptus and Acacia plantations. The contribution of secondary biomass from the understory, litter layer and CWD accounted for, respectively, up to 10.2% and 20.3% of the total biomass in the two types of plantation, highlighting the significance of secondary biomass. At a similar growth stage, the ranking of the contribution to secondary biomass in the Eucalyptus plantations was litter > herbaceous plants > shrubs > CWD, while in the Acacia plantations, it was litter > CWD > shrubs > herbaceous plants. The Eucalyptus and Acacia plantations in the PRD accumulated some 2.66-7.84 Mt of biomass and sequestered 1.33-3.92 Mt of carbon. For both species, the bulk of the plantations (Eucalyptus 82.1%, Acacia 89.3%) were at the young to middle-aged stage. The Acacia plantations generated a higher biomass density than the Eucalyptus plantations. Forest management intensification and reforestation programmes, especially targeting Acacia or mixed Eucalyptus/Acacia forests, offer good potential for future carbon sequestration.

TI  - What you see is not what you get: the role of ultrasonic detectors in increasing inventory completeness in Neotropical bat assemblages
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Microchiropteran bats have the potential to be important biodiversity indicator species as they are distributed globally and are important in ecosystem functioning. Survey and monitoring protocols for bats are often ineffective as sampling techniques vary in their efficacy depending on the species involved and habitats surveyed. Acoustic sampling using bat detectors may prove an alternative or complementary technique to capture methods but is largely untested in the tropics.
   2. To compare the efficacy of bat detectors and capture methods in surveys, we used ground mist nets, sub-canopy mist nets and harp traps to sample bats while simultaneously recording the echolocation calls of insectivorous bats in a diversity of habitats in the Yucatan, Mexico. We described echolocation calls, analysed call characteristics to identify species, and compared species inventories derived from traditional capture methods with those derived from acoustic sampling.
   3. A total of 2819 bats representing 26 species and six families were captured; 83% were captured in ground nets, 13% in sub-canopy nets and 4% in harp traps. Fourteen species and five phonic types were identified based on five echolocation call characteristics. Discriminant function analysis showed a high level of correct classification of the calls (84.1%), indicating that identification of species by their echolocation calls is feasible.
   4. In all habitats, acoustic sampling and capture methods sampled significantly more species each night than capture methods alone. Capture methods failed to sample 30% of the bat fauna, and aerial insectivores were sampled only by bat detectors.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Given the importance of bats in ecosystem functioning, and their potential as indicator species, developing effective methodologies to survey and monitor bats is important for sustainable forest management and biodiversity conservation. Acoustic sampling should be used with capture methods to increase inventory completeness in bat assemblage studies, and could form part of a single standardized monitoring protocol that can be used globally in tropical forests, as this method detects aerial insectivores not sampled by capture methods.

TI  - Deforestation in Central Africa:: Estimates at regional, national and landscape levels by advanced processing of systematically-distributed Landsat extracts
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Accurate land cover change estimates are among the headline indicators set by the Convention on Biological Diversity to evaluate the progress toward its 20 10 target concerning habitat conservation. Tropical deforestation is of prime interest since it threatens the terrestrial biomes hosting the highest levels of biodiversity. Local forest change dynamics, detected over very large extents, are necessary to derive regional and national figures for multilateral environmental agreements and sustainable forest management. Current deforestation estimates in Central Africa are derived either from coarse to medium resolution imagery or from wall-to-wall coverage of limited areas. Whereas the first approach cannot detect small forest changes widely spread across a landscape, operational costs limit the mapping extent in the second approach. This research developed and implemented a new cost-effective approach to derive area estimates of land cover change by combining a systematic regional sampling scheme based on high spatial resolution imagery with object-based unsupervised classification techniques. A multi-date segmentation is obtained by grouping pixels with similar land cover change trajectories which are then classified by unsupervised procedures. The interactive part of the processing chain is therefore limited to land cover class labelling of object clusters. The combination of automated image processing and interactive labelling renders this method cost-efficient. The approach was operationally applied to the entire Congo River basin to accurately estimate deforestation at regional, national and landscape levels. The survey was composed of 10 x 10 km sampling sites systematically-distributed every 0.5 degrees over the whole forest domain of Central Africa, corresponding to a sampling rate of 3.3%. For each of the 571 sites, subsets were extracted from both Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery acquired in 1990 and 2000 respectively. Approximately 60% of the 390 cloud-free samples do not show any forest cover change. For the other 165 sites, the results are depicted by a change matrix for every sample site describing four land cover change processes: deforestation, reforestation, forest degradation and forest recovery. This unique exercise estimates the deforestation rate at 0.21% per year, while the forest degradation rate is close to 0.15% per year. However, these figures are less reliable for the coastal region where there is a lack of cloud-free imagery. The results also show that the Landscapes designated after 2000 as high priority conservation zones by the Congo Basin Forest Partnership had undergone significantly less deforestation and forest degradation between 1990 and 2000 than the rest of the Central African forest.

TI  - Litter Traits of Native and Non-Native Tropical Trees Influence Soil Carbon Dynamics in Timber Plantations in Panama
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Tropical reforestation initiatives are widely recognized as a key strategy for mitigating rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Although rapid tree growth in young secondary forests and plantations sequesters large amounts of carbon (C) in biomass, the choice of tree species for reforestation projects is crucial, as species identity and diversity affect microbial activity and soil C cycling via plant litter inputs. The decay rate of litter is largely determined by its chemical and physical properties, and trait complementarity of diverse litter mixtures can produce non-additive effects, which facilitate or delay decomposition. Furthermore, microbial communities may preferentially decompose litter from native tree species (homefield advantage). Hence, information on how different tree species influence soil carbon dynamics could inform reforestation efforts to maximize soil C storage. We established a decomposition experiment in Panama, Central America, using mesocosms and litterbags in monoculture plantations of native species (Dalbergia retusa Hemsl. and Terminalia amazonia J.F.Gmel., Exell) or teak (Tectona grandis L.f.) to assess the influence of different litter types and litter mixtures on soil C dynamics. We used reciprocal litter transplant experiments to assess the homefield advantage and litter mixtures to determine facilitative or antagonistic effects on decomposition rates and soil respiration in all plantation types. Although litter properties explained some of the variation in decomposition, the microclimate and soil properties in the plantations also played an important role. Microbial biomass C and litter decomposition were lower in Tectona than in the native plantations. We observed non-additive effects of mixtures with Tectona and Dalbergia litter on both decomposition and soil respiration, but the effect depended on plantation type. Further, there was a homefield disadvantage for soil respiration in Tectona and Terminalia plantations. Our results suggest that tree species diversity plays an important role in the resilience of tropical soils and that plantations with native tree species could help maintain key processes involved in soil carbon sequestration.

TI  - Edge effect impacts on forest structure and carbon stocks in REDD plus projects: An assessment in the Amazon using UAV-LiDAR
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Land use/land cover change (LULCC) is an ongoing process in the Brazilian Amazon, and it is a major source of emissions through the processes of deforestation and forest degradation. Identifying and monitoring deforestation and different sources of degradation is crucial for the success of forest conservation and REDD+ projects (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation). This study aims to investigate edge effects caused by land use change in REDD+ projects and understand their effect on forest structure and carbon storage potential. Here, the edge effect is not primarily caused by direct human intervention but rather by microclimatic changes induced by the agricultural conversion of adjacent areas. The study was conducted on ongoing REDD+ projects established in the Brazilian Amazon, and we relied on statistical modeling to relate forest structural characteristics (i.e., canopy height, canopy roughness, canopy openness, carbon stock, leaf area index, and understory leaf area index) along the distance gradient from the forest edge to its interior. Our findings demonstrate that edge effects extend up to a distance between 30 and 65 m, showcasing the remarkable resilience of the forests examined in this study. By comparing the area impacted by the edge effect to the forest interior, we observed a 19.6 % reduction in canopy height, 23.3 % reduction in carbon stock, 17 % reduction in leaf area index, 35.6 % increase in canopy roughness, and more than 100 % increase in canopy openness. Our results show how this source of edge effect can affect the total carbon stock of projects with different sizes. In large areas (i.e., 5000 ha), edge effect does not have a significant impact on the total carbon stock due to the small proportion of edge area, reducing 0.8 % of the total carbon stock. Nevertheless, small areas are more subjected to emission caused by edge effect, where a project with 100 ha can have a loss of 5 % in carbon stock. These results underscore the importance of promoting the widespread adoption of remote sensing techniques in REDD+ projects. This study has revealed the significant potential of LiDAR technology for monitoring local degradation in REDD+ projects. The methodology allowed for a comprehensive and detailed assessment of forest structure, offering replicable and periodic monitoring capabilities to enhance its effectiveness.

TI  - Direct and cascading effects of landscape structure on tropical forest and non-forest frugivorous birds
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Global biodiversity is increasingly threatened by land-use change, but the direct and indirect drivers of species diversity in human-modified tropical landscapes are poorly known. Forest-dependent species are expected to be particularly sensitive to changes in landscape composition (e.g., forest loss) and configuration (e.g., increase of forest edges), both directly and indirectly through cascading landscape effects on local patterns of forest structure and resource availability. In contrast, non-forest-dependent species are probably more strongly related to landscape changes than to local forest patterns, as these species are able to use resources not only from the forest, but also from other landscape elements over larger spatial scales. We tested these hypotheses using structural equation modeling. In particular, we sampled 20 landscapes (115 ha each) from the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest to assess the effect of landscape-scale forest cover and amount of forest edges on the diversity of frugivorous birds, both directly and indirectly through the effect that these landscape variables may have on vegetation complexity and fruit biomass. We separately assessed the response of forest-dependent and non-forest-dependent frugivores to infer potential mechanisms underlying bird assemblages in fragmented landscapes. The diversity of forest-dependent birds mainly decreased with the simplification of vegetation complexity in more deforested landscapes, but increased with increasing fruit biomass in more forested landscapes (indirect effects). Both patterns were significant, thus supporting a strong bottom-up control, i.e., local habitat simplification and resource scarcity in highly deforested landscapes limits the maintenance of forest-dependent birds. Conversely, but as expected, non-forest-dependent birds were more strongly and directly related to landscape-scale patterns. In particular, landscapes with higher forest edge amount showed higher bird species diversity, probably because the increasing length of ecotones and interspersion/juxtaposition of different habitat types in landscapes with more forest edges can increase resource availability and foraging efficiency of non-forest-dependent birds. As the seed dispersal services offered by forest-dependent species cannot be ecologically compensated for by the proliferation of non-forest-dependent species, preventing forest loss is imperative to maintain forest-dependent birds and forest regeneration in this vanishing biodiversity hotspot.

TI  - Trophic position determines the persistence of neotropical understory birds after forest disturbance
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Habitat loss and degradation are key drivers of the current biodiversity crisis. Most research focuses on the question of which traits allow species to persist in degraded habitats. We asked whether a species' trophic position or niche width influences the resilience of species in degraded habitats and to what extent habitat degradation affects trophic interactions between species. We used nitrogen isotope ratios (15N:14N, expressed as delta 15N value) to quantify and compare trophic positions and niche widths of understory birds inhabiting old-growth and young secondary forests in the Pacific lowlands of Costa Rica. We found that a species' trophic position rather than its trophic niche width determined its persistence in secondary forests. Species feeding at lower trophic levels in old-growth forests were less likely to persist in secondary forests than those occupying a higher trophic position in old-growth forests. This pattern is likely induced by the occurrence of relatively large-bodied habitat specialists with a flexible and high-trophic level diet in secondary forests. These habitat specialists likely caused generalist bird species to lower their trophic position relative to conspecifics in old-growth forests. Regarding trophic niche widths, species in secondary forests tend to have larger niche widths than old-growth forest species. However, as old-growth forest specialists and generalists did not differ in their niche widths, no systematic effect of trophic niche width on species persistence after forest disturbance was found. This is the first study that shows a systematic effect of trophic position on the persistence of a wide range of bird species in a disturbed forest ecosystem. It therefore provides important insights into species' responses to habitat degradation and the conservation value of secondary forests. To improve habitat quality for old-growth forest birds and facilitate avian seed dispersal, the creation of large contiguous forest patches should be prioritised when implementing reforestation measures.
   We studied whether an understory bird species' trophic position or niche width determines its persistence after forest disturbance in the Pacific lowlands of Costa Rica. Using stable isotope methodology, we found a significant effect of trophic position: Species feeding at low trophic levels in old-growth forests were less likely to persist in secondary forests. The dataset provides insights into species' responses to habitat degradation and the conservation value of the secondary forests in the study area, which are useful for planning of future conservation measures in the region.image

Dayak is a native tribe of Kalimantan that has been living for thousands of years; they use shifting cultivation to manage the communal forest lands due to Kalimantan's poor soil of minerals and nutrients, where the presence of phosphorus becomes a limiting factor for crops cultivation. In tropical forests, phosphorus mostly stored in the trees, so to remove it, the forest burning is carried out. Nutrients released into the soil can be used for upland rice (gogo) cultivation, until depleted; after that, cultivators need to open a forest, while the old land was abandoned (fallow) until it becomes forest again (for 20-25 years). The consecutive land clearing causes the formation of mosaics land with different succession ages and diverse biodiversity. This process is often combined with agroforestry systems (multicultural forest gardens), where the will-be-abandoned fields are planted with a variety of useful trees that can be integrated in forest ecosystems, especially rubber and fruits. These systems of shifting cultivation are often blamed as the main factor of forest degradation and fires, but in the last 300 years, this system has little impact on forest degradation. But, this is relatively low in productivity and subsistent, so it is not suitable for the modern agriculture which demands high productivity and measurable, mass and continuous yield, as well as related to the market. The increased population and industrial development of forestry, plantation, mining, etc. make the communal forest become narrower, so the fallow periods are shortened (5-15 years) and the lands are degraded into grasslands. In the future, shifting cultivation remains one of the Dayaks option to meet the needs of rice, but agroforestry should be developed because of its higher economic value.

TI  - Quantification and monitoring of deforestation in India over eight decades (1930-2013)
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - There is still large uncertainty over the status of global forest cover owing to the paucity of comprehensive and holistic studies related to long term forest cover change. The aim of the present work is to prepare a nation-wide multi-date forest cover database which describes and quantifies historical and recent changes in natural forests of India. This analysis facilitated the determination of the state of Indian forest cover changes over last eight decades. Here, we have mapped the total area under forest cover, evaluated the spatial tracking of changes in natural forests, estimated the rate of deforestation and afforestation, analysed the biogeographic zone wise and state wise forest cover change, existing land use in deforested area, influence of environmental factors such as terrain on deforestation and implication of different definitions of forest used by agencies reporting deforestation in India. The results indicated that forests covered an area of 869,012 km(2) in 1930 which has decreased to 625,565 km(2) in 2013, a net loss of 243,447 km(2) (28 %) in eight decades. The highest annual average forest loss was found to be 4795 km(2) during 1930-1975, 1476 km(2) during 1975-1985, 767 km(2) during 1985-1995, 356 km(2) during 1995-2005 and 209 km(2) during 2005-2013. Between 1930 and 1975, forest experienced large scale deforestation at gross annual rate of 0.77 % which has declined to 0.29 % and 0.14 % for the 1975-1985 and 1985-1995 periods respectively. Quantification of annual rate of gross deforestation for the recent period indicates 0.07 % during 1995-2005 and 0.05 % during 2005-2013. The lower rates of deforestation during recent period support effectiveness of conservation measures taken at national level. It was found that deforestation rate has decreased in many biogeographic zones by 2005, except for Andaman & Nicobar Islands and North East. The major deforestation has mostly occurred due to conversion of forests to agriculture. The construction of reservoirs contributed to 4.1 % of forest loss. The tropical forests have experienced large scale deforestation followed by subtropical forests. The findings of the study will be useful to prioritize conservation and protection of forest cover at the regional level. It shall also provide a base for future research on the impacts of deforestation on carbon flux and biodiversity.

TI  - Effects of reduced impact logging on bat biodiversity in terra firme forest of lowland Amazonia
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Timber harvest is one of the main causes of degradation of Amazonian tropical forests, where bats represent important components of biodiversity. In addition, bats may represent keystone taxa in the Neotropics, as they are primary agents of pollination and seed dispersal for many pioneer plants. We assessed the impact of low harvest (18 m(3)/ha), reduced impact logging (RIL) on population and community characteristics of phyllostomid bats in Amazonian terra firme forest of Brazil at 20-42 months post-harvest. Based on 1-03,680 net-meter-hours of netting in Tapajo's National Forest, 2341 phyllostomids were captured, representing 42 species, 25 genera, and 4 broad feeding guilds. Population-level responses of common phyllostomids to RIL were minor, with 10 of 15 species evincing no change in mean abundance. Of those taxa. responding to RIL (mean difference in number of individuals per site), three increased (Artibeus concolor [0.46 individuals], Artibeus lituratus [3.88], and Glossophaga soricina [0.71]) and two decreased (Carollia brevicauda [0.96] and Carollia perspicillata [14.04]) in abundance. Compositional (species distributions) and structural (rank distributions) aspects of bat assemblages differed between cut and control forests. More specifically, bat assemblages in cut forest had increased diversity and decreased dominance compared to control forest. Nonetheless, the proportional abundance of the five most common species, as a group, was similar in cut (86%) and control forest (88%), and frugivores dominated assemblages in both management types. Mean abundance of frugivores decreased (10.59 individuals per site) in response to RIL; however, this response was driven by decreases in C. perspicillata, the most abundant species in terra firme forest. Although RIL had only minor effects on biodiversity in the short-term, extrapolation to a long-term prospectus should be exercised with caution when applied to conservation or policy issues.

TI  - Classification of Tree Species in a Diverse African Agroforestry Landscape Using Imaging Spectroscopy and Laser Scanning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Airborne imaging spectroscopy (IS) and laser scanning (ALS) have been explored widely for tree species classification during the past decades. However, African agroforestry areas, where a few exotic tree species are dominant and many native species occur less frequently, have not yet been studied. Obtaining maps of tree species would provide useful information for the characterization of agroforestry systems and detecting invasive species. Our objective was to study tree species classification in a diverse tropical landscape using IS and ALS data at the tree crown level, with primary interest in the exotic tree species. We performed multiple analyses based on different IS and ALS feature sets, identified important features using feature selection, and evaluated the impact of combining the two data sources. Given that a high number of tree species with limited sample size (499 samples for 31 species) was expected to limit the classification accuracy, we tested different approaches to group the species based on the frequency of their occurrence and Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance. Surface reflectance at wavelengths between 400-450 nm and 750-800 nm, and height to crown width ratio, were identified as important features. Nonetheless, a selection of minimum noise fraction (MNF) transformed reflectance bands showed superior performance. Support vector machine classifier performed slightly better than the random forest classifier, but the improvement was not statistically significant for the best performing feature set. The highest F1-scores were achieved when each of the species was classified separately against a mixed group of all other species, which makes this approach suitable for invasive species detection. Our results are valuable for organizations working on biodiversity conservation and improving agroforestry practices, as we showed how the non-native Eucalyptus spp., Acacia mearnsii and Grevillea robusta (mean F1-scores 76%, 79% and 89%, respectively) trees can be mapped with good accuracy. We also found a group of six fruit bearing trees using JM distance, which was classified with mean F1-score of 65%. This was a useful finding, as these species could not be classified with acceptable accuracy individually, while they all share common economic and ecological importance.

TI  - Rush for cash crops and forest protection: Neither land sparing nor land sharing
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - In many countries with large tracts of tropical forests, there is a dual focus on enhancing forest protection and increasing commercial agriculture for economic development. Laos is a case in point for this development as the Government of Laos (GoL) has a strong commitment to economic growth, which rural farmers in part help realize through a rush for cash crop production destined to be sold in neighboring countries. Maize cultivation, for example, is rapidly expanding and grown under a contract-farming system for Vietnamese markets. At the same time, GoL attempts to increase nationwide forest cover and prepares for REDD+ (reducing deforestation and forest degradation). This paper explores how the recent boom in cash crops is impacting land use and livelihoods of local communities, as well as affecting forest conservation in Hua Meuang District of Huaphan Province in northeastern Laos. We also examine how local authorities react to these changes and navigate the contradicting policies. Furthermore, the paper analyzes to what extent the land sparing intention of land- and forest-land allocation policies are fulfilled. We found that the production of maize has rapidly expanded in Hua Meuang District since the mid-2000s as a result of high demands for maize in Vietnam and because local authorities see the crop as a way to reduce rural poverty and reduce traditional subsistence shifting cultivation practices. Communities have increased the areas that they dedicate to maize cultivation and have achieved an increase in both income and household assets. Maize has replaced upland rice cultivation as well as primary and secondary forests. Although the government policies aim to spare land for forest conservation by intensifying agriculture, the result is rapid agricultural expansion and no spared forest. Moreover, the traditional land-sharing landscapes with forest, fallows, and fields are being transformed, creating landscapes that are increasingly dominated by agriculture. This may still be in line with economic development policies, but it is at odds with forest conservation policies, REDD+ policies, and the GoL target of increasing forest cover in the country.

TI  - Growth, carbon sequestration, and management of native tree plantations in humid regions of Costa Rica
T2  - NEW FORESTS
AB  - The Costa Rican government has provided incentives for reforestation programs since 1986 and initiated a Payment for Environmental Services program in 1996. These incentives yielded native species reforestation programs throughout the country. This research aims to provide information about growth, carbon sequestration, and management of seven native tree species (Vochysia guatemalensis, Vochysia ferruginea, Hyeronima alchorneoides, Calophyllum brasiliense, Terminalia amazonia, Virola koschnyi, and Dipteryx panamensis) growing in small and medium- sized plantations in the Caribbean and Northern lowlands of Costa Rica. A total of 179 plots were evaluated in 32 farms. Overall, I found that V. guatemalensis, V. ferruginea, H. alchorneoides, and T. amazonia were the species with the fastest diameter, total height, and volume growth; and T. amazonia and D. panamensis sequestered more carbon. Moreover, I found that the plantations that had been thinned before this assessment had the best growth. The results of the present research enhance the criteria elaborated in previous research findings to improve species choices for reforestation and silvicultural management in Costa Rica and in other regions with similar ecological features. Furthermore, they support the concept that tropical plantations can serve diverse economic, social, and ecological functions that may ultimately help reduce atmospheric CO2 accumulation.

TI  - An assessment of carbon stock for various land use system in Aravally mountains, Western India
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation in developing countries is of the central importance in efforts to combat climate change. A study was conducted to measure carbon stocks in various land-use systems including forms and reliably estimates the impact of land use on carbon (C) stocks in the forest of Rajasthan, western India (23 degrees 3'-30 degrees 12'N longitude and 69 degrees 30'-78 degrees 17'E). 22.8% of India is forested and 0.04% is the deforestation rate of India. In Indian forest sector of western India of Aravally mountain range covered large area of deciduous forest and it's very helpful in carbon sequestration at global level. The carbon stocks of forest, plantation (reforestation) and agricultural land in aboveground, soil organic and fine root within forest were estimated through field data collection. Results revealed that the amount of total carbon stock of forests (533.64 +/- 37.54 Mg.ha(-1), simplified expression of Mg (carbon) .ha(-1)) was significantly greater (P<0.05) than the plantation (324.37 +/- 15.0 Mg.ha(-1)) and the agricultural land (120.50 +/- 2.17 Mg.ha(-1)). Soil organic carbon in the forests (172.84 +/- 3.78 Mg.ha(-1)) was also significantly greater (P<0.05) than the plantation (153.20 +/- 7.48 Mg.ha(-1)) and the agricultural land (108.71 +/- 1.68 Mg.ha(-1)). The differences in carbon stocks across land-use types are the primary consequence of variations in the vegetation biomass and the soil organic matter. Fine root carbon was a small fraction of carbon stocks in all land-use types. Most of the soil organic carbon and fine root carbon content was found in the upper 30-cm layer and decreased with soil depth. The aboveground carbon (ABGC): soil organic carbon (SOC): fine root carbon ratios (FRC), was 8:4:1, 4:5:1, and 3:37:1 for the forest, plantation and agricultural land, respectively. These results indicate that a relatively large proportion of the C loss is due to forest conversion to agricultural land.

TI  - Will Passive Protection Save Congo Forests?
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Central Africa's tropical forests are among the world's largest carbon reserves. Historically, they have experienced low rates of deforestation. Pressures to clear land are increasing due to development of infrastructure and livelihoods, foreign investment in agriculture, and shifting land use management, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The DRC contains the greatest area of intact African forests. These store approximately 22 billion tons of carbon in aboveground live biomass, yet only 10% are protected. Can the status quo of passive protection-forest management that is low or nonexistent-ensure the preservation of this forest and its carbon? We have developed the SimCongo model to simulate changes in land cover and land use based on theorized policy scenarios from 2010 to 2050. Three scenarios were examined: the first (Historical Trends) assumes passive forest protection; the next (Conservation) posits active protection of forests and activation of the national REDD+ action plan, and the last (Agricultural Development) assumes increased agricultural activities in forested land with concomitant increased deforestation. SimCongo is a cellular automata model based on Bayesian statistical methods tailored for the DRC, built with the Dinamica-EGO platform. The model is parameterized and validated with deforestation observations from the past and runs the scenarios from 2010 through 2050 with a yearly time step. We estimate the Historical Trends trajectory will result in average emissions of 139 million t CO2 year(-1) by the 2040s, a 15% increase over current emissions. The Conservation scenario would result in 58% less clearing than Historical Trends and would conserve carbon-dense forest and woodland savanna areas. The Agricultural Development scenario leads to emissions of 212 million t CO2 year(-1) by the 2040s. These scenarios are heuristic examples of policy's influence on forest conservation and carbon storage. Our results suggest that 1) passive protection of the DRC's forest and woodland savanna is insufficient to reduce deforestation; and 2): enactment of a REDD+ plan or similar conservation measure is needed to actively protect Congo forests, their unique ecology, and their important role in the global carbon cycle.

TI  - Review of allometric equations for major land covers in SE Asia: Uncertainty and implications for above- and below-ground carbon estimates
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Our review of biomass studies conducted for 11 Southeast Asian countries, Papua New Guinea, and southern China uncovered 402 above-ground and 138 below-ground biomass allometric equations for the following major land covers: forest, peat swamp forest, mangrove forest, logged over forest, orchard and tree plantation, rubber plantation, oil palm plantation, bamboo, swidden fallow, and grassland/pasture/shrub land. No equations existed for non-swidden agroforest and permanent croplands, two other important land covers involved in current and projected land-cover transitions. We also found 245 stem-volume equations and 50 height-diameter equations. Applying existing allometric equations out of convenience is potentially a key source of uncertainty in above- and below-ground carbon stock estimates in many SE Asian landscapes. Differences in environmental conditions and vegetation characteristics should preclude the use of many pre-existing equations at locations outside of the geographical location where they were developed, without first verifying their applicability. While use of site-specific equations is preferred to reduce uncertainty in estimates, there are few in existence for many land covers and many geographical areas of the region. For example, few or no equations exist for Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, and Timor Leste. Ten or fewer above-ground biomass equations exist for rubber plantation, oil palm plantation, non-swidden agroforest, grassland/pasture/shrublands, and permanent croplands for the entire region. Even site-specific equations can introduce uncertainties to biomass estimates if they were determined from an insufficient sample size. Difficulties associated with sampling below-ground root biomass accurately often leads to allometric equations that potentially under-estimate below-ground biomass. In addition, substantial errors may be present if these below-ground equations are conveniently used by researchers in lieu of site-specific measurements. Although the importance of including wood density in allometry is increasingly recognized, only 26 of the reviewed studies did so. Ideally, when wood density values are used to estimate biomass, new on-site measurements should be taken, rather than relying on pre-existing values. This review demonstrates that more research in SE Asia is needed on biomass in general, specifically for several land covers including peat swamp forest, rubber and oil palm plantations, bamboo, swidden fallow, non-swidden agroforest, and permanent cropland. Importantly, for the purpose of informing the development and implementation of policies and programs such as REDD+, our meta-analysis highlights the pressing need to address the insufficient number of allometric equations and the possible inappropriate use of some when estimating vegetation biomass related to current and potential land cover changes in the region.

TI  - Cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) climate zones and its associated agrobiodiversity in Arauca, Colombia
T2  - BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL
AB  - Cacao (Theobroma cacao L) is one of the most relevant crops in terms of economy and social rural development in Colombia. Cacao is also an important crop due to its potential to replace illicit crops and it is related to less deforestation and preserves the biodiversity. There are several cacao districts in Colombia, one of these being Arauca. The Department of Arauca is the second largest cocoa producing region in Colombia; however, it is heavily affected by armed conflict. To raise the knowledge and technology available in the region, integrating data on the occurrence of cacao farms with climatic variables becomes powerful socioeconomic mapping tool for maintaining agrobiodiversity and food security the region. Consequently, this type of agrodiversity data and agroclimatic approaches help to better manage agrobiodiversity, as in the cacao region of Arauca. These tools are even more relevant in biodiverse regions, such as flooded savannahs and tropical forest ecosystems, which are currently undergoing drastic changes due to agricultural expansion and climate change. One of the knowledge gaps in Colombia ' s cacao regions is that there are currently no agroclimatic maps made with a social and scientific approach. This study aimed to provide a database of the spatial distribution of cacao farms in Arauca, as well as agroclimatic maps that identify and locate cacao climate regions in Arauca. We also present a presence-only matrix consisting of twenty-six tree species, or agrobiodiversity, distributed across the study region and specifically associated with the cacao forestry systems in Arauca.New information We present the first database of both climate and agrobiodiversity data related to cacao farms in Arauca, developed with a research and socioeconomic vision that generated a novel approach for the agroclimatic zoning of cocoa in the Arauca Region and Colombia. Using 1,538 cacao farms at the regional scale, we identified two national and six regional -scale climate and soil regions. The selection at the local scale allowed us to classify 180 cacao farms comprising nine agroclimatic clusters in Arauca. We found twenty-six tree species distributed across the cacao climate zones. This dataset and its related maps also represent the agrobiodiversity of cultivated cacao locally. This is the most complete climate and agrobiodiversity dataset of cacao farms distribution in one of the top cocoa-producing regions in the country. These outputs are crucial because they constitute a baseline for developing research in the biodiversity of agroforestry systems, pests and diseases, pollutant presence, genetics, post-harvest processing and cocoa quality and safety.

TI  - Effects of farm and landscape management on bird and butterfly conservation in western Honduras
T2  - ECOSPHERE
AB  - Previous research has indicated that a substantial portion of native flora and fauna may persist in agricultural mosaics in the Neotropics. However, understanding the relative importance of different habitat factors and management practices at different scales for sustaining this biodiversity has proven somewhat elusive. In addition, most such research has taken place in only a few fairly well-studied landscapes, thus limiting our ability to infer broader patterns that might be transferred to unstudied locales. This study expands the geographic breadth of prior research by evaluating bird and butterfly assemblages in an agricultural landscape in the Rio Copan watershed of western Honduras. The study also provides a systematic assessment of the relative influence of categorical and continuous habitat variables across a range of scales likely to be significant for birds and butterflies. Overall, we recorded 145 tree species, 139 bird species, and 119 butterfly species. Birds and butterflies displayed contrasting responses to land cover: birds were most strongly associated with dense vegetation in broadleaf forests, forest fallows, shade-grown coffee farms, and live fences, while butterflies were most abundant in live fences, pastures, and riparian forests. Bird assemblages were heavily skewed toward common and non-forest-dependent species, likely due to the young age and high disturbance level of forest plots. In contrast, butterfly assemblages contained a substantial proportion of forest-dependent species, which were observed in forests as well as pastures and live fences. Contrary to expectations, categorical land cover descriptors were more effective at explaining faunal assemblage patterns than continuous habitat descriptors related to vegetation and landscape context. In addition, plot scale (25-100 m) habitat features had a greater influence on faunal assemblages than did neighborhood scale (200-3000 m) landscape composition or structure, although differences in management intensity at the scale of the entire watershed (5-20 km) also exerted a strong influence on conservation outcomes.

TI  - Traditional Agroforestry Systems and Conservation of Native Plant Diversity of Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Traditional agroforestry systems (TAFS), which integrate crops with wildlife, are important reservoirs of human culture and technical experiences with a high capacity for biodiversity conservation. Our study aimed to evaluate the capacity of TAFS to conserve the floristic diversity of tropical dry forests (TDF) in the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan Valley, Mexico. We compared TAFS and TDF by measuring their forest cover, floristic composition, and structure, in addition to documenting the motivations of people to maintain native vegetation in their agricultural fields. We conducted a restricted randomized sampling of perennial plant species, including nine sites of TAFS and nine of TDF to determine the alpha, beta, and gamma diversity. Furthermore, we conducted semi-structured interviews with peasants who managed the agricultural plots we studied. We also performed workshops with people of the communities where surveys were performed. Our findings show that TAFS can maintain, on average, 68% of the species (95% of them native to the region) and 53% of the abundance of individuals occurring in the adjacent TDF. TAFS harbour 30% (39 species) of plants endemic to Mexico. Total species richness of TDF and TAFS were similar, as well as the effective number of species or communities estimated for the alpha, beta, and gamma diversity, but differed in the abundance of individuals. The high species turnover recorded in TDF (72%) and TAFS (74%) has profound implications for conservation, suggesting that it would be necessary to maintain several sites in order to conserve the regional diversity of native vegetation. Material, non-material, and regulatory contributions were reported to be the reason that peasants take into account maintaining natural vegetation. TAFS associated with TDF in the region (also called "Apancles") contain an important richness, diversity, and endemism of components of natural ecosystems, as well as provide multiple socio-ecological contributions. These systems could represent a viable alternative to reconcile biological conservation with social well-being.

TI  - Determining High Conservation Values in Production Landscapes: Biodiversity and Assessment Approaches
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Conversion of natural, heterogenous tropical forests to intensively managed, monoculture-production landscapes is a major threat to biodiversity. This phenomenon is driven by global demand for commodities such as wood, palm oil, sugar, and soybean. The economies of many countries in tropical areas depend on these commodities, and there is a need to ensure economic welfare while protecting biodiversity. Certification schemes such as those developed by the Forest Stewardship Council and Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil are intended to provide incentive to companies to employ environmentally and socially sustainable production practices. One element of these certification schemes is the concept of High Conservation Values (HCVs) which fall into six categories that encompass ecological indicators and human dimensions. The HCV process has expanded beyond production landscapes to include long-term conservation planning. Despite expansion, implementation of the HCV process as it pertains to biodiversity is challenged, in part, by a lack of specificity regarding target metrics. Another challenge is that, in practice, there is a short time period for assessment, resulting in limited collection of primary data and a reliance on secondary data sources for interpolation. HCV guidance advances a precautionary approach to assessment, but in some regions, there is not enough known about the biology, behavior, or interspecific associations of species to effectively assess what is not observed. In this paper, we assess environmental HCVs in a well-studied timber production system in Sarawak, East Malaysia. Using an original long-term multi-method dataset of avifaunal surveys as well as published datasets of other taxa, we 1) assess biodiversity metrics at the site including presence of Rare, Threatened, and Endemic species, 2) assess change over time at assessment locations, and 3) evaluate costs and benefits of the various methods and provide best practice recommendations for HCV assessment and long-term monitoring. Finally, we recommend transparent data-archiving and sharing for improved accuracy and efficiency in the HCV process. Managed landscapes are important areas for ecological research that are beneficial not only to the restoration and conservation of species and ecosystems but also to well-informed certification and long-term sustainability.

TI  - Biodiversity, dynamics, and impact of chakras on the Ecuadorian Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY
AB  - Aims Deforestation and biodiversity loss are two alarming, closely related problems, and the main factors triggering changes in land use. Indigenous agricultural practices in the western Amazon Basin are known as chakras, and their structure and dynamics are seemingly optimal for forest management. However, the variability in tree species and the degree of forest recovery after abandonment is poorly documented in this agroforestry system (AFS). The goals of this study were: (i) to investigate whether the different AFSs (chakras) preserve similar levels of forest diversity, (ii) to determine the effect of transformation of mature forests (MF) to chakras, in particular, forest alpha and beta diversity levels, and (iii) to investigate whether native tree species recovery leads to the original forest structure following chakra abandonment.
   Methods We assessed the floristic composition in three AFSs (cassava, corn, and cocoa), the secondary forest (SF), and the forest remnants in the buffer zone of the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon (NEA). All tree species with a diameter at breast height (dbh) 10 cm were inventoried in 61 plots (0.28 ha average) representing 17.44 ha. Alpha diversity was calculated in all systems to determine the levels of variability using species richness and the Shannon diversity index. Also, beta diversity was examined to evaluate the degree of dissimilarity among all AFSs with the MF in order to analyze changes in floristic composition. The divergence between the SF and the MF was analyzed to ascertain forest recovery after chakra abandonment.
   Important Findings A total of 4,060 trees (dbh 10 cm) representing 109 species, 96 genera, and 43 plant families were inventoried in 17.44 ha sampled in five systems in the buffer zone of the NEA. The most dominant plant families were Arecaceae, Myristicaceae, Fabaceae, Meliaceae, and Malvaceae, and the most representative genera included Iriartea, Virola, Guarea, Ocotea, Cordia, Chrysophyllum, and Inga. The MF in this zone is composed of 81 tree species circumscribed in 74 genera and 30 plant families. Transforming this MF to different chakras leads to a decrease of alpha diversity between 52% and 75%, particularly in AFS practiced for local food security (corn and cassava). However, all the AFSs preserve ca. 56% of the native flora existing in the MF, in which at least 8% of the species are threatened; however, the status of the remaining 92% of species is still unknown, indicating that the assessment of the rarity of the native trees is virtually unexplored. Additionally, all sites investigated consistently formed three clusters that corresponded to AFS, MF, and SF. Thus, the trend of forests to recover the original structure is facilitated by native trees left intact in the chakras. These results strongly support the potential to execute sustainable forest management and preservation of endangered tree species practicing this AFS.

TI  - Using leaf δ<SUP>13</SUP>C and photosynthetic parameters to understand acclimation to irradiance and leaf age effects during tropical forest regeneration
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Regenerating forests are important for the maintenance of tropical biodiversity. Forest management in fragments of Atlantic forest in Brazil includes removal of exotic eucalyptus trees that were once part of plantations, in order to reestablish native flora. However, it is unclear how native tree saplings regenerating under former plantations respond to abrupt changes in environmental conditions associated, with exotic tree removal. We used leaf carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) and photosynthetic parameters to evaluate physiological responses of native tree saplings to canopy opening. We analyzed young and mature leaves of the three most representative species of regenerating trees (Byrsonima sericea, Siparuna guianensis, Xylopia sericea) in one secondary forest fragment and three managed areas that form an irradiance gradient (9, 85, 230 and 550 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) in Brazilian Atlantic forest. Eucalyptus removal increased photosynthetic CO2 assimilation and stomatal conductance in mature leaves of all species, but there was no change in intercellular CO2 concentration. In young leaves, two species showed increasing A and one species showed increasing gs in response to canopy opening. Leaf delta C-13 did not vary significantly among species, but site and age affected delta C-13, as leaves from shaded sites showed lower delta C-13 values (around -33 parts per thousand) than leaves from lighter sites (around -30 parts per thousand), and young leaves showed higher delta C-13 values (around -30 parts per thousand) than mature leaves (around -32 parts per thousand). Mature leaves showed greater photosynthesis and stomatal conductance than young leaves. The sensitivity of young leaf delta C-13 to irradiance increases suggests that delta C-13 in these organs is controlled not only through carbon imported to new leaves during growth, but also through direct responses of stomatal control and carboxylation as these young leaves develop their photosynthetic competency. Young and mature leaves showed decreased total chlorophyll/carotenoids with increasing irradiance, indicating acclimation capacity from early developmental phases. Young leaves in high irradiance sites showed susceptibility to irradiance stress (F-v/F-m, around 0.7), but values for mature leaves did not show high irradiance stress (F-v/F-m around 0.8). In conclusion, forest management affected leaf delta C-13 of the main regenerating understary species, with site effects being more important than species-specific features for photosynthetic performance. The data also indicate that these species are resilient to forest management that includes exotic eucalyptus canopy tree removal. In this context, carbon stable isotopes can be considered as recorders of ecological change and can be used to study the effects of management on forest regeneration and photosynthetic competency.

TI  - Disturbance or propagule pressure? Unravelling the drivers and mapping the intensity of invasion of free-ranging dogs across the Atlantic forest hotspot
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
AB  - Aim Identifying the drivers of biological invasions is crucial to predict the risk of invasion across broad spatial scales and to devise strategies to prevent invasion impacts. Here, we explore the relative importance and synergies between two key drivers-propagule pressure and landscape disturbance-in determining the invasion of native forest remnants by dogs, one of the most abundant, widely distributed, and harmful invasive species worldwide. Location Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Methods Combining a camera trap dataset (96 sites in forest remnants) and censuses of populations of dogs raised by humans across 12 landscapes (2,830 ha each), we used N-mixture models that account for imperfect detection to confront alternative hypotheses of invasion drivers. We then used this empirical evidence to predict the intensity of dog invasion across the Atlantic Forest hotspot. Results Propagule pressure (density of raised dogs, positive effect) and landscape disturbance (forest cover, negative effect) were equally important drivers of dog invasion, presenting additive rather than synergistic effects. Dogs invade forest remnants far from their homes, making the density of raised dogs the key component of propagule pressure (relative to dog spatial distribution). Forest cover was more important than either the length or density of forest edges, suggesting that both reduced area of forested barriers to long-distance movements and increased proximity of forests to edges facilitate dog access to forests. Across the Atlantic Forest, the combination of high human population density and extensive deforestation makes dog invasion an additional and widespread threat. Main conclusion Combined with available maps of priority areas for biodiversity conservation, our spatial prediction of dog invasion can help target areas for integrated management actions. These actions should go beyond measures to control dog populations and encompass the maintenance and restoration of native forests and strategic planning of afforestation through planted forests.

TI  - Quantification of carbon stocks in Mount Marsabit Forest Reserve, a sub-humid montane forest in northern Kenya under anthropogenic disturbance
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - The quantification of carbon stocks is vital for decision making in forest management, carbon stock change assessment and scientific applications. We applied the land degradation surveillance framework (LDSF) method with a sentinel site of (10 km x 10 km) to assess carbon stock levels and tree diversity in the Marsabit Forest Reserve (MFR). The above ground (ABG) carbon stock was estimated at 12.42 t/ha, while soil organic carbon (SOC) was 12.51 t/ha, with SOC densities increasing with increasing depth. The mean ABG carbon and SOC densities were higher in the least disturbed strata than the disturbed strata. The estimated ABG carbon and SOC stocks were significantly lower than the range observed in a typical dry tropical forest. Twenty-one tree species were recorded belonging to twelve families with the disturbed areas recording nine tree species while the least disturbed recording twelve species. Rubiaceae and Rutaceae were the richest families with four species each while Boraginaceae, Capparaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Tiliaceae, Violaceae, and Ochnaceae the least frequent with one species each. The most common tree species were, Croton megalocarpus, Drypetes gerrardii, Ochna insculpta, Strychnos henningsii and Vangueria madagascariensis. The forest recorded a basal diameter of 14.09 +/- 12.15 cm, basal area of 0.016 m 2/ha with a mean height of 8.69 m. The basal size class distribution declined monotonically indicative of a stable population. Livestock grazing, selective logging, and firewood collection were the primary forms of anthropogenic activities recorded in the MFR despite the moratorium imposed on consumptive utilisation of forest products by the Marsabit County security committee. The Pearson correlation coefficient returned an inverse relationship between forest disturbance with SOC and ABG carbon in the disturbed strata suggesting that anthropogenic activities reduced carbon stocks in the MFR. Concerted efforts to mitigate anthropogenic impacts on the MFR could significantly increase its terrestrial carbon sequestration potential and the provision of critical ecosystem goods and services.

TI  - How persistent are the impacts of logging roads on Central African forest vegetation?
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Logging roads can trigger tropical forest degradation by reducing the integrity of the ecosystem and providing access for encroachment. Therefore, road management is crucial in reconciling selective logging and biodiversity conservation. Most logging roads are abandoned after timber harvesting; however, little is known about their long-term impacts on forest vegetation and accessibility, especially in Central Africa. In 11 logging concessions in the Congo Basin, we field-sampled a chronosequence of roads that, judging from satellite images, had been abandoned between 1985 and 2015. We assessed recovery of timber resources, tree diversity and above-ground biomass in three zones: the road track, the road edge (where forest had been cleared during road construction) and the adjacent logged forest. The density of commercial timber species <15cm d.b.h. was almost three times higher in the road track (321 individuals ha(-1)) and edge (267) than in the logged adjacent forest (97). Over time, tree species diversity converged to a comparable level between roads and adjacent forests, along with an increase in canopy closure. The average width of forest clearing for road construction was 20m, covering a total 076% of the forest area inside concessions. After 15years following abandonment, road tracks had recovered 24 Mgha(-1) of above-ground woody biomass, which was 6% of that in the adjacent forest, while road edges had accumulated 167 Mgha(-1) (42%). Ten years after abandonment, roads were no longer penetrable by poachers on motorcycles. An exotic herb species was fully replaced by dominant Marantaceae that have even higher abundance in the adjacent forest.Synthesis and applications. Our evidence of vegetation recovery suggests that logging roads are mostly transient elements in the forest landscapes. However, given the slow recovery of biomass on abandoned road tracks, we advocate both reducing the width of forest clearing for road construction and reopening old logging roads for future harvests, rather than building new roads in intact forests. Road edges seem suitable for post-logging silviculture which needs to be assisted by removing dominant herbs during the early years after abandonment while the road track is still accessible.

TI  - Growth, productivity, aboveground biomass, and carbon sequestration of pure and mixed native tree plantations in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - In Costa Rica, reforestation programs with indigenous tree species are a recent activity. Information is still scarce on long-term species performance and silvicultural management to ensure the success of tree plantings, especially for mixed stands. This study aims to estimate growth, aboveground biomass, and carbon sequestration of nine native tree species growing in mixed and pure plantings. The study was carried out at La Selva Biological Station in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica. More than a half of the tree species studied (e.g. Calophyllum brasiliense, Jacaranda copaia, Terminalia amazonia, Hyeronima alchorneoides, Vochysiaferruginea, Balizia elegans) are distributed from Mexico-Guatemala to South America and a few have more limited distribution in Central America (e.g. Vochysia guatemalensis, Virola koschnyi, Dipteryx panamensis). The nine tree species are divided into three sets. The 3 members of each set were grown separately in pure plantations, and together in I mixed plantation, giving 12 monocultures and 4 mixtures. Plantation 1 (13 years old) is composed of V guatemalensis, C. brasiliense, and J. copaia. Plantation 2 (13 years old) is comprised of D. panamensis, T amazonia and V koschnyi. Plantation 3 (12 years old) is composed of H. alchorneoides, B. elegans, and V. ferruginea. Overall, all the species had good growth and productivity either in pure or mixed stands in comparison to other native and exotic species growing in similar ecological conditions. The exception was C. brasiliense in mixed stands, where it was suppressed by the fast-growing species V guatemalensis and J. copaia. At the stand level, the mixed stands performed well for volume, basal area, aboveground biomass, and carbon sequestration, in comparison to other pure or mixed plantations of tropical timber species. Pure plantations of V guatemalensis, V ferruginea, V koschnyi, J. copaia, and T amazonia also presented good productivity. At the tree level, V guatemalensis, J. copaia, T amazonia, H. alchorneoides, and D. panamensis performed better in mixtures than in pure stands for diameter, height, aboveground biomass, and carbon sequestration estimations. Values for the former three species were significantly higher in mixed than in pure stands. C. brasiliense was the only species with significantly better growth in pure stands than in mixed stands, for the three-species combination examined. The results show that mixed plantings had similar or higher productivities for several of the variables examined, but conclusions, on relative productivities depend on the species and growth features, interactions among species, and the variables quantified. In addition, there is a need to continue monitoring over longer time-frames, and for further studies of the species interactions and site factors involved, in order to develop reforestation guidelines for a range of objectives and environmental settings.

TI  - Termite diversity is resilient to land-use change along a forest-cocoa intensification gradient in Ghana, West Africa
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Cocoa is an important crop for Ghana's economy, contributing 25% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The crop, however, is mainly cultivated on forest-derived soils and is a major cause of land-use change. Termites are an important biological component of tropical ecosystems providing numerous ecosystem services. Previous studies have indicated that termites are sensitive to forest disturbance and decrease in richness and abundance across land-use intensification gradients, with consequences for the essential services that they provide. Native shade trees are often used to improve cocoa cultivation and may reduce the detrimental effects of land-use change on some aspects of biodiversity. The aim of this study was therefore to explore how termites respond to land-use change along a shade-tree gradient in Kakum National Park and surrounding cocoa farms in Ghana (from forest at 80% tree cover to cocoa with no shade cover, to the extreme of cultivated arable crop land). It was predicted that termite richness and abundance would decrease with decreasing shade cover, and with increasing distance from the forest edge. Thirty-four species from 29 genera were sampled, with Ancistrotermes crucifer being found in all the locations (47% of all encounters). Species richness and abundance differed marginally across the land-use gradient, as well as the distance from the forest edge; however, species richness did not show any significance with distance. All the same, termite communities were robust to the disturbance. Our findings suggest that though site influenced species richness and abundance, cocoa trees can play a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity and environmental quality in an agricultural landscape by providing a habitat for forest species that are not found in pastures or farm fields. However, we caution that the relatively low forest baseline of existing forest diversity may inflate the value of cocoa land, with those forests no longer representing undisturbed natural habitats: this highlights that shifting baselines may need to be accounted for when interpreting findings in the Anthropocene.

TI  - Shade coffee agroforests as native plant sources for restoration
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Tropical agroforestry systems such as shade coffee are recognised as important refuges for biodiversity in human-modified landscapes. In these systems, many conservation initiatives aiming to sustain biodiversity against the trend of intensifying agroforestry management focus on promoting biodiverse tree overstories but engage less with conservation opportunities and challenges associated with agroforest understories. In coffee agroforests with native shade trees, weeding of natural regeneration constitutes lost conservation opportunities. We explore the potential for reducing such losses by rescuing native tree seeds and naturally regenerating seedlings from coffee agroforests and developing local native plant nurseries, which are a critical bottleneck for restoration. For this, we draw on floristic surveys using 42 0.3 ha plots in eight polyculture shade coffee agroforests and collaborative pilot rescue, nursery development and restoration initiatives in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, India. Ninety restoration-relevant native tree species (inferred from species distributions, traits and practitioner knowledge) constituted 37% of all trees recorded in coffee agroforests. The species list included 30 conservation-priority species (endemic to the Western Ghats and/or classified as threatened or near-threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature), most of which were not stocked in existing public nurseries. Experiences from pilot rescue efforts, which collected over 18,000 seeds and seedlings spanning 56 restoration-relevant species in 12 months, underscore the importance of efficient rescue planning focussed on mapping target trees and monitoring phenology, fostering partnerships with agroforest landowners to enhance rescue opportunities and developing nursery infrastructure to house rescued plants and support local restoration efforts. Synthesis and applications. Shade coffee agroforests can contribute to conservation beyond their boundaries as sources of native plants that can help expand and diversify local nurseries and scale up restoration, while alleviating the need to exploit remnant natural forests as plant sources for nurseries and restoration. Harnessing this opportunity requires the development of strategies and partnerships for integrating native plant sourcing, nursery and restoration efforts, backed by policies and initiatives that promote landscape-level benefits of agroforestry for biodiversity and conservation.

TI  - Effects of land-use change and elevation on endemic shrub frogs in a biodiversity hotspot
T2  - ANIMAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Agroforestry, often promoted as a sustainable agriculture practice, is rapidly expanding, often at the cost of primary tropical forests. While agroforestry negatively impacts amphibian diversity, its effects on population demography, microhabitat, use and body condition are relatively understudied. This information is crucial for determining and promoting amphibian-friendly land-use practices. We compared habitats, population densities, microhabitat use and body condition of two endemic species of shrub frogs (Pseudophilautus amboli and Raorchestes bombayensis) across (1) elevations (low- and high-elevation forests) and (2) land-use categories (cashew, rubber and low-elevation forests) in the northern part of the Western Ghats Biodiversity Hotspot. Using distance sampling, we demonstrated that the abundances of the two shrub frog species differed across elevation categories, with P. amboli more common in low-elevation forests and R. bombayensis more prevalent in high-elevation forests. Both species of frogs exhibited extremely skewed, male-biased sex ratios, with three females for 100 males. P. amboli had lower densities and poor recruitment and exhibited altered microhabitat use in cashew plantations compared to low-elevation forests. Although adult male P. amboli densities in rubber were similar to those in low-elevation forests, they exhibited altered microhabitat use and smaller body sizes than in forests, indicating poor body condition. We demonstrate the differential impacts of agroforestry types on shrub frogs. We also demonstrate that distance sampling can be a useful tool for population monitoring of shrub frogs, which comprise almost 25% of the anuran diversity in the Western Ghats. There is a need to identify the drivers of extremely skewed sex ratios, which make these species vulnerable to population crashes. Given the recent downlisting of the two focal species to Least Concern, we advocate for their uplisting to at least Near Threatened status considering their patchy distribution, negative impacts of rapidly expanding agroforestry plantations and extremely skewed sex ratios.
   Agroforestry negatively impacts amphibian diversity, yet its impacts on population demography, microhabitat use and body condition remain poorly studied. We compared habitats, population densities and body condition of two endemic shrub frogs (Pseudophilautus amboli and Raorchestes bombayensis) across elevation categories and three land-use types (forests, cashew and rubber plantations) in the Western Ghats. We show altered microhabitat use, male-biased sex ratios and poor recruitment in agroforestry plantations, advocating for the uplisting of these species to at least Near Threatened due to their vulnerability to rapidly expanding agroforests.

TI  - Potential environmental implications of sandbar afforestation: Insights from ecosystem restoration initiatives in a sandbar of Brahmaputra River Assam, India
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Plantation in riverine sandbars offers an excellent opportunity for restoration of ecosystem with a vast potential for enhancing carbon stock. Afforestation on barren islands is challenging task; however, Padmashree Jadav Payeng has single-handedly transformed a sandbar of the river Brahmaputra into a forested landscape in India's northeastern state of Assam. Such inspiring initiative needs more attention in terms of scientific assessment to quantify ecosystem value and services that can be enriched through such activities. This study uses remote sensing data viz., Landsat4-5TM and Sentinel 2 A data to provide a detailed information on spatio-temporal variability of land use land cover of study region from 1990 to 2021. It aims to conduct a scientific and systematic assessment of biophysical changes that have occurred in the sandbars, understand the status of afforestation, and evaluate the current levels of aboveground biomass (AGB), belowground biomass (BGB), and carbon stock in the selected sandbars. The spatial distribution of AGB, BGB and carbon stock is derived using linear regression model between SAR backscatter and field-based AGB. The results demonstrate that forest cover increased by 31.92 % and sandbar area is reduced by 26.87 % from 1990 to 2021. Spatially derived AGB ranges from 9 to 1295.89 Mg per ha, BGB from 2.35 to 290.50 Mg per ha and carbon stock from 6.18 to 763.34 Mg per ha. Ficus religiosa exhibits a high biomass, ranging from 564.7 Mg per ha to 994.7 Mg per ha, and a high carbon stock, ranging from 8 to 557.30 Mg per ha, attributed to its larger diameter at breast height (DBH). Moreover, phytosociological assessment was conducted for the studied forest, which reveal a total tree species richness of 79. The forest exhibits a total tree density of 395 individuals per hectare. Different biodiversity indices provide a comprehensive understanding of species composition; where results show a Shannon diversity index of 2.81, a Simpson's index of 0.08, a Menhinick's richness index of 2.7, and a Margalef's richness index of 5.26. The article provides detailed information on change in forest cover and present status of AGB, BGB and Carbon stock, providing evidence-based narratives on ecosystem restoration. The initiative by a single person has created a forested landscape and habitat for a large number of wild animals, contributing to better carbon stock and a healthier ecosystem. With regard to the current debate of carbon market, the study suggests the need of instrumentalization of carbon credits for such restoration activities to encourage increase in carbon stock. It also concludes that in-depth research should be taken up on long-term effectiveness of such plantation activities and the potential for scaling up these initiatives for ecosystem restoration in view of climate change mitigation and sustainable forest development.

TI  - Land-use change impact on time-averaged carbon balances: Rubber expansion and reforestation in a biosphere reserve, South-West China
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The expansion of rubber plantations (Hevea brasiliensis mall. Arg) is a major driving force for deforestation and forest degradation in mountainous South-East Asia. In China, the unclear distinction between natural forest and commercial plantations has permitted the expansion of rubber into protected forest areas of nature reserves. However, the impact of such land-use changes on landscape carbon balances within nature reserves has rarely been investigated. We selected the Naban River Watershed National Nature Reserve (NRWNNR) in Xishuangbanna, China as a case study area and evaluated carbon stocks using the Rapid Carbon Stock Appraisal (RaCSA) method based on tree, plot, land use and landscape assessments, integrating field sampling with remote sensing and GIS technology. Six dominant land use systems were surveyed: lowland forest (<800 m above sea level), highland forest (>800 m a.s.l.), lowland rubber, highland rubber, bush and grassland and agricultural crops. Land use type-specific time-averaged carbon stocks (C-ta) were calculated based on total above ground biomass (AGB). Soil organic carbon (surface 30 cm) and below ground biomass were measured, but not included in C-ta calculations due to large uncertainties unrelated to land use change. The C-ta of lowland and highland rubber plantations were 58 Mg C ha(-1) and 28 Mg C ha(-1) respectively, showing larger carbon sequestration potential than nonforest land use types (agricultural crops, bush and grassland) but much lower than C-ta of natural forest (156-185 Mg C ha(-1)). Sensitivity analysis of C-ta variability showed that forest C stocks have the largest influence on landscape carbon balance. Time series analysis of land-use and land-cover maps (1989, 2007, 2012) demonstrated that during 23 years, the whole landscape of the nature reserve (26,574 ha) gained 0.644 Tg C. Despite rubber expansion, biosphere zoning strategy (i.e. experimental, buffer, core zones), and reforestation activities conducted in NRWNNR were able to enhance the carbon stocks.

TI  - Land-use Change Dynamics, Soil Type and Species Forming Mono-dominant Patches: the Case of Pteridium aquilinum in a Neotropical Rain Forest Region
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Deforestation and agricultural land degradation in tropical regions can create conditions for growth of perennial plant species forming mono-dominated patches (MDP). Such species might limit forest regeneration, and their proliferation forces the abandonment of fields and subsequent deforestation to establish new fields. Therefore, identifying factors fostering MDP species is critical for biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes. Here, we propose a conceptual framework to identify such factors and apply it to the case of Pteridium aquilinum (bracken fern), a light-demanding species, tolerant of low soil fertility and fire. We hypothesize that bracken proliferation is promoted by land-use changes that increase light availability, especially in sites with low soil fertility and land uses involving fire. We assessed this idea using agricultural fields in southeastern Mexico with different land-use change histories and quantifying prevalence and cover of bracken. Five different land-use change histories resulted from transitions among forest, crop, pasture, and fallow field stages. Of the 133 fields sampled, 71 percent had P.aquilinum; regression tree analysis indicated that 65 percent of inter-field variation in prevalence and 90 percent in cover was explained by land-use change history and soil type. Maximum prevalence, cover, and rates of increase in bracken were found on fields with low fertility sandy/clay soils, which had been used for crops and pasture, were frequently burned, and had high levels of light. Fields on fertile alluvial soil never used for pasture were bracken-free. Agriculture promoting high light environments on less fertile soils is a major cause of bracken proliferation and likely that of other MDP species.
   Abstracto En regiones tropicales, la deforestacion y la degradacion de campos agricolas puede crear las condiciones para el crecimiento de plantas perennes formadoras de parches mono-dominados. Tales especies pueden limitar la regeneracion del bosque y su proliferacion conlleva el abandono de los campos agricolas y genera subsecuente deforestacion debido al establecimiento de nuevos campos agricolas. Por lo tanto, identificar los factores que promueven especies formadoras de parches mono-dominados es critico para la conservacion de la biodiversidad en paisajes dominados por el humano. En este articulo se propone un marco conceptual para identificar tales factores y lo aplicamos al caso del helecho Pteridium aquilinum (petatilla), una especie demandante de luz, tolerante a la baja fertilidad del suelo y al fuego. Hipotetizamos que la proliferacion de P.aquilinum es promovida por cambios en el uso del suelo que incrementan la disponibilidad de luz, especialmente en sitios con baja fertilidad del suelo y que incluyen el uso de fuego. Evaluamos esta idea mediante el uso de campos agricolas con diferentes historias de cambio de uso del suelo y cuantificamos la prevalencia y la cobertura de P.aquilinum en el sureste de Mexico. Cinco diferente historias de cambio de uso de suelo resultaron de la transicion entre bosque, agricultura, pastizales y sitios abandonados. De los 133 campos muestreados, 71% presentaron P.aquilinum. Un analisis de arbol de regresion indico que para la prevalencia y la cobertura, el 65% y 90% de la variacion entre campos, respectivamente fue explicada por la historia de cambios de uso de suelo y el tipo de suelo. La maxima prevalencia, la cobertura y las tasas de incremento de P.aquilinum se encontraron en campos con baja fertilidad tales como suelos arenosos y arcillosos, que se utilizaron para agricultura y pastizales y que fueron frecuentemente quemados y con alta disponibilidad de luz. Campos en suelos aluviales que representan suelo fertiles y que nunca se utilizaron como pastizales estuvieron libres de P.aquilinum. Las historias de uso de suelo que promueven ambientes de alta disponibilidad de luz en suelo fertiles son una causa mayor de la proliferacion de P.aquilinum y probablemente de otras plantas perennes que forman parches dominados por una sola especie.

TI  - Mega El Ni(n)over-tildeo's change the playing field for culturally important tree species and hence the foundation for human-nature interactions in tropical forests
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
AB  - Humans have interacted with trees for millennia and the strength of such interactions determines the long-term social values of trees and forests. Such ecocultural linkages could be important to promote during reforestation efforts, potentially helping to turn the tide on the current rapid extinction of cultural and biological diversity. In addition, predicting the fate of ecoculturally important species to changing climates may help guide tree species selection best-suited to future climates. We assessed the vulnerability of four ecoculturally important tree species native to Southeast Asia to an extreme drought: Koompassia excelsa, Nephelium lappaceum, Shorea fallax and Shorea leprosula. These species provide distinct and unique products, and Koompassia excelsa is well-represented in local mythological stories and considered a Cultural Keystone Species (CKS). We used two complementary approaches: 1) an experimental common garden and 2) naturally occurring wild trees growing in a secondary forest and compared the performance of trees before, after, and during the 2016 El Ni (n) over tildeo event with record breaking low precipitation and high temperatures. We found that mortality of the CKS K. excelsa in the common garden, along with mortality and growth of wild trees were unaffected by the El Ni (n) over tildeo drought. In contrast, young trees of N. lappaceum and S. fallax planted in the common garden had mortality 4 and 3 times higher, respectively, during the El Ni (n) over tildeo drought compared to normal years. Growth rate of S. fallax in the wild was also significantly lower during the El Ni (n) over tildeo drought and this effect was particularly pronounced in highly disturbed forests. Our results demonstrate that the impact of extreme climatic events, that are predicted to become more common with climate change, on culturally important tree species is species specific. Management of such species may thus need species specific measures to maintain viable populations and hence provide the basic physical settings for human-nature interactions and associated cultural identities to persist. In this context, our findings that cultural keystone species such as K. excelsa could be drought tolerant is noteworthy, as investing on such species could prove to be beneficial for both local cultures and conservation of native ecosystems and biodiversity.

TI  - Mammal species composition and habitat associations in a commercial forest and mixed-plantation landscape
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Commercial forest plantations of fast-growing species have been established globally to meet increasing demands for timber, pulpwood, and other wood products. Industrial plantations may contribute to tropical forest conservation by reducing exploitation of primary and secondary natural forests. Whether such plantations can support critical elements of biodiversity, including provision of habitat and movement corridors for species of conservation concern, is an important question in Southeast Asia. Our objectives were to investigate relationships between habitat gradients and community attributes of medium-sized to large mammals in a mixed plantation mosaic in Bengkoka Peninsula, Sabah, East Malaysia. Data on mammals were collected using 59 remote camera stations deployed for a minimum of 21 days (24-hour sampling occasions) in three major land-use types: natural forest, Acacia plantations, and non-Acacia plantations (oil palm, rubber, young Eucalyptus pellita). We used sample-based rarefaction to evaluate variation in species richness with land use. We used generalized linear models and ordination analyses to evaluate whether variation in mammal detections and species composition was associated with habitat gradients. We recorded >22 mammal species over 1572 sampling occasions. Natural forest area was positively associated with mammal species richness and detections of threatened mammals. Overall detections of mammals increased with decreasing elevation, but decreased within, and close to, Acacia plantations. Detections of threatened mammals increased with greater proportions of natural forest and Acacia and increasing proximity to roads. Sample-based rarefaction indicated that species richness of mammals in Acacia and natural forest was considerably higher than observed. Both natural forest and Acacia plantations shared similar values for species richness and diversity, but non-Acacia plantations scored lower in both metrics. Mammal species composition differed among different types of land use. Smaller generalists used non-Acacia plantation forests. A variety of other mammals including some threatened species used natural forest, Acacia, or a combination of the two. Acacia plantations possess attributes supporting a diversity of mammal species, including those we defined as threatened based on IUCN criteria. However, this is likely a function of the habitat mosaic with natural forest in the study area and the mangrove forests on the fringes of the peninsula serving as refuges of mammal diversity. Retention and restoration of natural and mangrove forests may therefore enhance the conservation potential of industrial Acacia plantations. Additionally, controlled road access in conjunction with anti-poaching operations and strengthening public awareness are essential to reduce the threat of overexploitation.

TI  - Impact of forest conversion to oil palm and rubber plantations on microclimate and the role of the 2015 ENSO event
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - Oil palm and rubber expansion is a main driver of the widespread deforestation of tropical rainforests taking place in South-East Asia, particularly in Indonesia. The replacement of forests with monoculture plantations of rubber and oil palm reduces biodiversity and carbon pools but also modifies canopy structure, which is an important determinant of microclimate. There is, however, a lack of quantitative information characterizing the effect of such land transformation on microclimate. We report the first medium-term observations of below canopy microclimatic conditions (air temperature, relative humidity, vapour pressure deficit and soil temperature) across forest, jungle rubber agroforest, oil palm and rubber monoculture plantations in Sumatra/Indonesia. The data set covers a period of approximately three years (2013-2016) and includes one of the strongest El Nino-Southern Oscillations (ENSO) of the last decades. Forests were up to 2.3 and 2.2 degrees C cooler than oil palm and rubber monocultures respectively. The monocultures were also drier (11.9% and 12.8% less in oil palm and rubber respectively) and had higher vapour pressure deficit (632 Pa and 665 Pa higher in oil palm and rubber respectively) than the forest, while differences in soil temperature were less pronounced. Conversion from forest to other land uses, especially to monocultures, also amplified the diurnal range of all microclimatic variables studied. Jungle rubber stands out as the transformed land-use system that maintains more stable microclimatic conditions. Our results indicate that canopy openness is a key driver of below-canopy micro climate, and hence could be used in climate models to better evaluate climatic feedbacks of land-use change to rubber and oil palm. The ENSO event of 2015 led to warmer and drier conditions than in the previous two years in all four land-use systems, especially in the forest (up to 2.3 degrees C warmer, 8.9% drier and up to 351 Pa more during ENSO). The relative effect of ENSO was lower in the monoculture plantations, where below-canopy microclimate is generally more similar to open areas. Forests exhibited the largest differences with the pre-ENSO years, but still maintained more stable microclimatic conditions (lower temperatures and vapour pressure deficit and higher relative humidity) due to their higher climate regulation capacity. During ENSO, microclimatic conditions in jungle rubber were comparable to those in the monocultures, suggesting that while forests buffered the increase of temperature, jungle rubber might have surpassed its buffering capacity to extreme events. This capacity of buffering extreme climatic events should be considered when assessing the effects of land-use change.

TI  - Impacts of fire on canopy structure and its resilience depend on successional stage in Amazonian secondary forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Secondary forests in the Amazon are important carbon sinks, biodiversity reservoirs, and connections between forest fragments. However, their regrowth is highly threatened by fire. Using airborne laser scanning (ALS), surveyed between 2016 and 2018, we analyzed canopy metrics in burned (fires occurred between 2001 and 2018) and unburned secondary forests across different successional stages and their ability to recover after fire. We assessed maximum and mean canopy height, openness at 5 and 10 m, canopy roughness, leaf area index (LAI) and leaf area height volume (LAHV) for 20 sites across South-East Amazonia (ranging from 375 to 1200 ha). Compared to unburned forests, burned forests had reductions in canopy height, LAI, and LAHV, and increases in openness and roughness. These effects were more pronounced in early successional (ES) than later successional (LS) stages, for example, mean canopy height decreased 33% in ES and 14% in LS and LAI decreased 36% in ES and 18% in LS. Forests in ES stages were less resistant to fire, but more resilient (capable of recovering from a disturbance) in their post-fire regrowth than LS stage forests. Data extrapolation from our models suggests that canopy structure partially recovers with time since fire for six out of seven canopy metrics; however, LAI and LAHV in LS forests may never fully recover. Our results indicate that successional stage-specific management and policies that mitigate against fire in early secondary forests should be implemented to increase the success of forest regeneration. Mitigation of fires is critical if secondary forests are to continue to provide their wide array of ecological services.

Florestas no est & aacute;gio ES foram menos resistentes ao fogo, mas mais resilientes (capazes de se recuperar de uma perturba & ccedil;& atilde;o) em sua regenera & ccedil;& atilde;o p & oacute;s-fogo do que florestas no est & aacute;gio LS. A partir da extrapola & ccedil;& atilde;o de dados, nossos modelos sugerem que a estrutura do dossel se recupera parcialmente com o tempo desde o fogo para seis dos sete atributos do dossel, algumas m & eacute;tricas como LAI e LAHV em florestas LS talvez nunca se recuperem totalmente.

TI  - Designing a carbon market that protects forests in developing countries
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON SERIES A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB  - Firmly incorporated into the Kyoto Protocol, market mechanisms offer an innovative and cost-effective means of controlling atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. However, as with markets for many other goods and services, a carbon market may generate negative environmental externalities. Possible interpretations and application of Kyoto provisions under COP-6bis and COP-7 raise concerns that rules governing forestry with respect to the Kyoto carbon market may increase pressure on native forests and their biodiversity in developing countries. In this paper, we assess the following two specific concerns with Kyoto provisions for forestry measures. First, whether, under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), by restricting allowable forestry measures to afforestation and reforestation, and explicitly excluding protection of threatened native forests, the Kyoto Protocol will enhance incentives for degradation and clearing of forests in developing countries; second, whether carbon crediting for forest management in Annex I (industrialized) regions under Article 3.4 creates a dynamic that can encourage displacement of timber harvests from Annex I countries to developing nations. Given current timber extraction patterns in developing regions, additional harvest pressure would certainly entail a considerable cost in terms of biodiversity loss.
   In both cases, we find that the concerns about deleterious impacts to forests and biodiversity are justified, although the scale of such impacts is difficult to predict. Both to ensure reliable progress in managing carbon concentrations and to avoid unintended consequences with respect to forest biodiversity, the further development of the Kyoto carbon market must explicitly correct these perverse incentives. We recommend several steps that climate policymakers can take to ensure that conservation and restoration of biodiversity-rich natural forests in developing countries are rewarded rather than penalized. To correct incentives to clear natural forests through CDM crediting for afforestation and reforestation, we recommend for the first commitment period that policymakers establish an early base year, such as 1990, such that lands cleared after that year would be ineligible for crediting. We further recommend an exception to this rule for CDM projects that are explicitly designed to promote natural forest restoration and that pass rigorous environmental impact review. Restoration efforts are typically most effective on lands that are adjacent to standing forests and hence likely to have been recently cleared. Thus, we recommend for these projects establishing a more recent base year, such as 2000.
   For the second and subsequent commitment periods, we recommend that climate policymakers act to restrain inter-annex leakage and its impacts by ensuring that crediting for forest management in industrialized countries is informed by modelling efforts to anticipate the scale of leakage associated with different Annex I 'Land use, land-use change and forestry' policy options, and coupled with effective measures to protect natural forests in developing countries. The latter should include expanding the options permitted under the CDM to carbon crediting for projects that protect threatened forests from deforestation and forest degradation.
   Ultimately, carbon market incentives for forest clearing can be reduced and incentives for forest conservation most effectively strengthened by fully capturing carbon emissions associated with deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries under a future emissions cap. Finally, we note that these recommendations have broader relevance to any forest-based measures to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions developed outside of the specific context of the Kyoto Protocol.

TI  - Biomass Production and Carbon Sequestration Potential of Different Agroforestry Systems in India: A Critical Review
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Agroforestry systems (AFS) and practices followed in India are highly diverse due to varied climatic conditions ranging from temperate to humid tropics. The estimated area under AFS in India is 13.75 million ha with the highest concentration being in the states of Uttar Pradesh (1.86 million ha), followed by Maharashtra (1.61 million ha), Rajasthan (1.55 million ha) and Andhra Pradesh (1.17 million ha). There are many forms of agroforestry practice in India ranging from intensified simple systems of monoculture, such as block plantations and boundary planting, to far more diverse and complex systems, such as home gardens. As a result, the biomass production and carbon sequestration potential of AFS are highly variable across different agro-climatic zones of India. Studies pertaining to the assessment of biomass and carbon storage in different agroforestry systems in the Indian sub-continent are scanty and most of these studies have reported region and system specific carbon stocks. However, while biomass and carbon stock data from different AFS at national scale has been scanty hitherto, such information is essential for national accounting, reporting of C sinks and sources, as well as for realizing the benefits of carbon credit to farmers engaged in tree-based production activities. Therefore, the objective of this study was to collate and synthesize the existing information on biomass carbon and SOC stocks associated with agroforestry practices across agro-climatic zones of India. The results revealed considerable variation in biomass and carbon stocks among AFS, as well as between different agro-climatic zones. Higher total biomass (>200 Mg ha(-1)) was observed in the humid tropics of India which are prevalent in southern and northeastern regions, while lower total biomass (<50 Mg ha(-1)) was reported from Indo-Gangetic, western and central India. Total biomass carbon varied in the range of 1.84 to 131 Mg ha(-1) in the agrihorticulture systems of western and central India and the coffee agroforests of southern peninsular India. Similarly, soil organic carbon (SOC) ranged between 12.26-170.43 Mg ha(-1), with the highest SOC in the coffee agroforests of southern India and the lowest in the agrisilviculture systems of western India. The AFS which recorded relatively higher SOC included plantation crop-based practices of southern, eastern and northeastern India, followed by the agrihorticulture and agrisilviculture systems of the northern Himalayas. The meta-analysis indicated that the growth and nature of different agroforestry tree species is the key factor affecting the carbon storage capacity of an agroforestry system. The baseline data obtained across various regions could be useful for devising policies on carbon trading or financing for agroforestry.

AB  - Second-growth forests represent the largest area of forest in southern Mexico and can provide relevant information on how their structural attributes in are linked to anthropogenic factors and for their forest management. However, a knowledge gap remains at national level with little scientific literature available. Therefore, this research aimed to investigate the structure and tree richness of second-growth forests in the south of Quintana Roo State, Mexico. With stratified sampling through participatory mapping of local collaborators, secondary tropical forests of 7, 15, 27, 37, and >= 48 to 80 years (y) old-growth were identified. We categorized forests into three successional stage classes: 5-20 y (Class I; forests of 7 and 15 y); 25-40 y (Class II; forests of 27 and 37 y), and old-growth forest (Class III; forests 48-80 y). In each forest (7, 15, 27, 37, 48, and 80 y of time since abandonment [tSA]) three plots were randomly chosen and established within the forest. Each age class was composed of two forests and six sample plots. In total there were 18 plots of 500 m2 2 each. Subsequently, we: i) calculated the land use intensity (LUI) to which the sites were subjected, ii) described the following structural attributes: floristic similarity, true diversity (effective number of species), stem density, and basal area (AB), and iii) evaluated if tSA and LUI influence the aforementioned structural attributes. Tree diversity was characterized with Hill numbers associated with observed species richness (0D), richness of equally abundant species (1D), and dominant species (2D). Forest structure was analyzed by density (number of trees ha(-1)) and distribution of stems by diameter class ha(-1) and basal area (BA, m(2) ha(-1)). The second-growth forest was derived from the milpa agricultural system under moderate land use intensity (LUI index = 0.02- 0.1). Floristic structure was at least similar between Class I and Class III. Forest age and LUI do not affect tree composition of the forests (p >= 0.1667). However, these two factors affected stem density and BA. Only the species richness (0D) of second-growth forest and old-growth forest was influenced by tSA (p = 0.0002). In second-growth forests, Classes I and II, 78 species (0D) were recorded, 8 and 8 exclusive species, 28 and 36 equally abundant species (1D), and 15 to 24 dominant species (2D). In the old-growth forest, Class III, 70 species were recorded, and 38 and 26 equally abundant (1D) and dominant species (2D), as well as 5 exclusive species. The density of stems decreased with increasing forest age and increasing BA. Second-growth forest and old-growth forest all showed a high density of small diameter stems. These results indicate that second-growth forests are important tree species reservoirs (including those for timber purposes), comparable to old-growth or mature forests, and therefore they are relevant not only as biodiversity conservation areas or carbon sinks, but also for planned sustainable forest management.

TI  - Changes in tropical terrestrial vertebrate communities along two anthropogenic gradients: Forest degradation and accessibility
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Forest degradation and hunting are two major drivers of species declines in tropical forests, often associated with forest production activities and infrastructure. To assess how the medium-to-large bodied terrestrial vertebrate community varied across these two main gradients of anthropogenic impact, we conducted a camera-trap survey across three production forest reserves in central Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, each with different past and current logging regimes. We analyzed data from a 32-species community using a Bayesian community occupancy model, investigating the response of occurrence, diversity, and composition to forest degradation and accessibility (a proxy for hunting pressure). We found forest degradation to be a strong driver of occurrence of individual species. Such responses led to declines in diversity and shifts in community composition, where forest-dependent species decreased while disturbance-tolerant species increased in occupancy probability with increasing forest degradation. Accessibility had a weaker effect on community diversity and species occupancy, and low-level hunting pressure and management of access to our study sites likely played an important role in mitigating accessibility effects. Nonetheless, our results showed accessibility had compounding effects on a wildlife community already affected negatively by forest degradation. Despite the impacts of forest degradation and accessibility on the terrestrial vertebrate community, our results highlight how the application of more sustainable practices-reducing forest disturbance and managing unauthorized access to logging roads-resulted in more intact wildlife communities. Understanding how both disturbances combined affect the terrestrial vertebrate community is essential for evaluating and developing effective sustainability guidelines.Abstract in malay is available with online material.
   Kemerosotan hutan dan pemburuan adalah dua faktor utama penurunan spesies di hutan tropika. Kedua-dua ancaman ini selalu dikaitkan dengan aktiviti pembalakan dan pembangunan infrastruktur. Untuk menilai bagaimana komuniti haiwan vertebrata darat sederhana dan besar bertindak balas terhadapkedua-dua ancaman antropogenik ini, kami menjalankan survei perangkap kamera di tiga hutan simpan di pedalaman Sabah, wilayah Borneo Malaysia, masing-masing dengan rejim pembalakan yang berbeza pada masa lalu dan kini. Kami menganalisis data dari 32 spesies menggunakan model Bayesian community occupancy untuk meneliti corak occupancy, diversity dan composition terhadap kemerosotan hutan dan kebolehcapaian (sebagai proksi tekanan pemburuan). Kami mendapati bahawa kemerosotan hutan adalah pemacu kuat kepada occupancy- spesies. Respon tersebut mengakibatkan penurunan dalam diversity dan perubahan dalam composition komuniti, di mana spesies yang bergantung kepada hutan menurun sementara spesies yang lebih bertahan terhadap kemerosotan hutan meningkat dari segi occupancy. Kebolehcapaian (proksi tekanan pemburuan) menunjukkan kesan yang lebih lemah pada diversity dan occupancy. Tekanan pemburuan pada kadar yang rendah dan pengawalan akses ke lokasi survei kami berkemungkinan memainkan peranan penting dalam mitigasi kesan kobolehcapaian. Namun demikian, hasil kajian kami menunjukkan kebolehcapaian memberi kesan secara akumulatif kepada komuniti spesies yang sudah terpengaruh negatif oleh kemerosotan hutan. Meskipun ada impak kemerosotan hutan dan kebolehcapaian kepada komuniti vertebrata darat, hasil kajian kami menyoroti bagaimana pengurusan hutan yang lebih mampan seperti mengurangkan gangguan hutan dan menghadkan akses pemburu akan menghasilkan komuniti hidupan liar yang lebih utuh. Memahami bagaimana kedua-dua gangguan tersebut mengaruhi komuniti vertebrata darat secara bergabung adalah penting untuk menilai dan membangunkan garis panduan kelesterian alam yang efektif.
   This study examines the impact of forest degradation and hunting on the terrestrial vertebrate community in Malaysian Borneo. Using camera traps across three forest reserves, it reveals that forest degradation significantly affects species occurrence, diversity, and composition, leading to declines in forest-dependent species and increases in disturbance-tolerant ones. While hunting pressure has a weaker effect, managing access to logging roads helps mitigate its impact, emphasizing the importance of sustainable practices for maintaining intact wildlife communities.image

TI  - Tree diversity assessment and above ground forests biomass estimation using SAR remote sensing: A case study of higher altitude vegetation of North-East Himalayas, India
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
AB  - Forest biomass is one of the significant components for assessing the productivity and sustainability of the forest's ecosystem. In the present study, the mapping and estimation of above ground biomass (AGB) was performed using field observations employing allometric equations and C band Sentinel 1A and L band Advanced Land Observation System (ALOS) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) remote sensing satellite images for the parts of north eastern Himalayan forests, Arunachal Pradesh. Total 57 transects of 500 m x 10 m size was laid in West Kameng and Tawang districts (altitude range: 1047-4161 m) of Arunachal Pradesh, in which a total of 12203 individuals of 67 tree species (Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) range: 3.18-235.45 cm) was recorded. The study exhibited higher tree density (428 individuals' ha(-1)) and basal cover (7658.63 m(2)ha(-1)) in the studied forests. The highest above ground biomass was contributed by Castanopsis indica (103.82 t ha(-1)) followed by Pinus roxburghii (46.24 t ha(-1)) and Quercus semicarpifolia (23.14 t ha(-1)). Further, AGB was estimated using the Horizontal-Horizontal (HH), Horizontal-Vertical (HV) polarizations acquired by the ALOS PALSAR 50m mosaic (2008) dataset and Vertical-Vertical (VV), Vertical-Horizontal (VH) polarizations acquired by the Sentinel 1A dataset. The relationship between field based AGB and radar backscatter for selected sample plots was established using pair wise correlation. While comparing the two satellite-based SAR images, it is observed that high correlation between radar backscatter and field based AGB was observed in ALOS PALSAR as compared to Sentinel 1A SAR. This is due to higher sensitive to backscatter values and higher penetration level of L band ALOS PALSAR as compared to C band Sentinel 1A SAR. The correlation study indicates high correlation of HV polarizations in ALOS PALSAR (HV polarization R-2= 0.63; HH polarization R-2= 0.58) as compared to Sentinel 1A (VV polarization R-2= 0.054 and VH polarization R-2= 0.044). The most accurate and reliable method to estimate AGB is the field based method, but it is time consuming and tedious. Whereas, AGB estimation by L band SAR remote sensing is time effective and can be used for larger area in comparatively less time. The present study exhibited poor species diversity in higher altitudes northeast Himalayan forests as species diversity decreases with increase in altitudes. On the other hand, the higher AGB in the studied forests may be due to favorable environmental conditions including less temperature and more nutrient availability as well as less biotic interferences in terms of anthropogenic disturbances, herbivory and grazing. The study signifies the potential use of L and C band backscatter information in the reliable estimation of spatial AGB in subtropical to alpine forests of Arunachal Pradesh.

TI  - Ecosystem nutrient use efficiency, productivity, and nutrient accrual in model tropical communities
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Ecosystem nutrient use efficiency-the ratio of net primary productivity to soil nutrient supply-is an integrative measure of ecosystem functioning. High productivity and nutrient retention in natural systems are frequently attributed to high species diversity, even though some single-species systems can be highly productive and effective at resource capture. We investigated the effects of both individual species and life-form diversity on ecosystem nutrient use efficiency using model tropical ecosystems comprised of monocultures of three tree species and polycultures in which each of the tree species was coplanted with species of two additional life forms. Tree species significantly influenced nutrient use efficiency by whole ecosystems in monocultures; however, in polycultures, the additional life forms interacted with the influence exerted by the dominant tree. Furthermore, the presence of the additional life forms significantly increased nutrient uptake and uptake efficiency, but in only two of the three systems and 2 of the 4 years of the study period. These results indicate that the effect of life-form diversity on ecosystem functioning is not constant and that there may be temporal shifts in the influence exerted by different components of the community. Furthermore, although species (and life forms) exerted considerable influence on ecosystem nutrient use efficiency, this efficiency was most closely related to soil nutrient availability. These findings demonstrate that ecosystem nutrient use efficiency is an outcome not only of the characteristics of the species or tife forms that comprise the system but also of factors that affect soil nutrient supply. The results argue against the simple upward scaling of nutrient use efficiency from leaves and plants to ecosystems.

TI  - Migration and ethnicity as cultural impact factors on land use change in the rainforest margins of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - STABILITY OF TROPICAL RAINFOREST MARGINS: LINKING ECOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONSTRAINTS OF LAND USE AND CONSERVATION
CP  - International Symposium on Stability of Tropical Rainforest Margins
AB  - Human activity endangers tropical forests in different parts of the world. The conflicting interests of nature conservation on the one hand, and the livelihood of farmers living at the forest margins, on the other, clash noticeably in so-called hotspots of biodiversity, such as the Lore Lindu region of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. Biodiversity generally decreases along a land use gradient from natural forest to agroforestry and annual crop systems. Thus, before solutions for a sustainable balance between conservation and the needs of people living at the forest margins can be sought, changing land use strategies and the factors that influence them must be analyzed. While similar studies often concentrate on economic indicators of land use change only, this chapter highlights the importance of two cultural realities, namely migration and ethnicity. We will demonstrate the great influence of these two factors on land use decisions and on the accessibility of land in the Lore Lindu region.
   Based on results from previous qualitative studies, we selected three upland villages, which represent a continuum that leads, in terms of migration history, from a pre-transition village, to a transitional village, to a post-transition village. We used quantitative and qualitative methods for our analysis.
   The results show a general land use change in the region, ranging from a strategy that places food first (e.g., rice) to one that places cash first, especially by the cultivation of cacao. This change cannot be observed to the same extent in the study region as a whole. It varies from village to village, depending on the share of households belonging to the Bugis migrants. Bugis as an ethnic group and as migrants have an enormous effect on the land use decisions of local ethnic groups in their respective villages. Strong ethnic networks among Bugis migrants play an important role not only with respect to their village preferences, but also with respect to the transfer of knowledge regarding agricultural management. A lack of interaction between local and migrant ethnic groups results in differences in the efficiency of cacao cultivation. While the Bugis migrants mainly buy their agricultural land from local farmers or, depending on the village's migration history, from other Bugis households, members of the autochthonous ethnic group usually clear the primary forest. The findings of the present study reveal that an analysis of migration and ethnicity is a crucial precondition to finding sustainable solutions for ensuring that the margins of the rainforest in the Lore Lindu region remain stable. This chapter will emphasize that, in addition to economic considerations, an analysis of the cultural forces that influence land use changes cannot be neglected.

TI  - Deforestation and Reforestation of Latin America and the Caribbean (2001-2010)
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Forest cover change directly affects biodiversity, the global carbon budget, and ecosystem function. Within Latin American and the Caribbean region (LAC), many studies have documented extensive deforestation, but there are also many local studies reporting forest recovery. These contrasting dynamics have been largely attributed to demographic and socio-economic change. For example, local population change due to migration can stimulate forest recovery, while the increasing global demand for food can drive agriculture expansion. However, as no analysis has simultaneously evaluated deforestation and reforestation from the municipal to continental scale, we lack a comprehensive assessment of the spatial distribution of these processes. We overcame this limitation by producing wall-to-wall, annual maps of change in woody vegetation and other land-cover classes between 2001 and 2010 for each of the 16,050 municipalities in LAC, and we used nonparametric Random Forest regression analyses to determine which environmental or population variables best explained the variation in woody vegetation change. Woody vegetation change was dominated by deforestation (541,835km2), particularly in the moist forest, dry forest, and savannas/shrublands biomes in South America. Extensive areas also recovered woody vegetation (+362,430km2), particularly in regions too dry or too steep for modern agriculture. Deforestation in moist forests tended to occur in lowland areas with low population density, but woody cover change was not related to municipality-scale population change. These results emphasize the importance of quantitating deforestation and reforestation at multiple spatial scales and linking these changes with global drivers such as the global demand for food. Resumen Los cambios en la cobertura de bosque tienen efectos directos sobre la biodiversidad, el ciclo global del carbono, y el funcionamiento de los ecosistemas. Muchos estudios en la region de America Latina y el Caribe han documentado extensa deforestacion; sin embargo, existen estudios locales que reportan recuperacion del bosque. Ambas dinamicas, deforestacion y reforestacion, han sido relacionadas con cambios demograficos y socioeconomicos. Por ejemplo, dinamicas poblacionales, como la migracion rural urbana, pueden estimular la recuperacion del bosque, mientras que el aumento en la demanda mundial de alimentos puede promover la expansion agricola. Dado a que ningun estudio ha evaluado conjuntamente los procesos de deforestacion y reforestacion a escala municipal o regional, no existe un analisis sobre de la distribucion espacial de estos procesos. Hemos superado esta limitacion al producir, simultaneamente, mapas del cambio en las coberturas de vegetacion lenosa y usos del suelo entre 2001 y 2010 para cada uno de los 16,050municipios de America Latina. Se utilizo el analisis no parametrico de regresion Random Forest para determinar cuales de las variables demograficas o medioambientales explican la variacion del cambio en vegetacion lenosa. Los cambios mas significativos en la cobertura de vegetacion lenosa fueron causados por procesos de deforestacion (541,835km2), particularmente en los biomas de bosque humedo, bosque seco, y en las sabanas o matorrales de America del Sur. Igualmente, se registro un aumento en la cobertura de vegetacion lenosa (362,430km2), especialmente en zonas aridas o empinados poco favorables para la agricultura industrial.
   La deforestacion en los bosques humedos tiende a ocurrir en zonas de baja elevacion y de poca densidad poblacional, sin embargo, los cambios en vegetacion lenosa no estuvieron relacionados con cambios en poblacion a nivel de municipio. Estos resultados enfatizan la importancia de cuantificar la deforestacion y la reforestacion a multiples escalas espaciales y de vincular estos cambios con acontecimientos globales, como el incremento mundial en la demanda de alimentos.

TI  - Drivers of biomass stocks and productivity of tropical secondary forests
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Young tropical secondary forests play an important role in the local and global carbon cycles because of their large area and rapid biomass accumulation rates. This study examines how environmental conditions and forest attributes shape biomass compartments and the productivity of young tropical secondary forests. We compared 36 young secondary forest stands that differed in the time since agricultural land abandonment (2.3-3.6 years) from dry and wet regions in Ghana. We quantified biomass stocks in living and dead stems, roots, and soil, and aboveground biomass and litter productivity. We used structural equation models to evaluate how macroclimate, soil nutrients (N, P), and forest attributes (structure, diversity, and functional composition) affect ecosystem functioning. After three years of succession, tropical wet forests stored on average 115 t biomass ha-1 (the sum of aboveground living and dead biomass, belowground fine root biomass, and soil organic matter), and dry forests stored 99 t ha-1. These values represent 31% (in the wet forest) and 39% (in the dry forest) of the biomass compared with neighboring old-growth forests. The majority of forest ecosystem biomass was stored in the soil (70%) and aboveground living vegetation (25%). Macroclimate strongly shaped forest attributes, which in turn determined biomass stocks and productivity. Soil phosphorus strongly increased litter production and soil organic matter, confirming that it is a limiting element in tropical ecosystems. Tree density and species diversity increased forest biomass stocks, suggesting crown packing and complementary resource use enhance forest functioning. A more conservative trait composition (high wood density) increased biomass stocks but reduced productivity, indicating that quantity, identity, and quality of species affect ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Secondary forest growth deviation from chronosequence predictions in central Amazonia
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Nearly all published rates of secondary forest (SF) regrowth for Amazonia are inferred from chronosequences. We examined SF regrowth on abandoned pastures over a 4-year period to determine if measured rates of forest recovery differ from chronosequence predictions. We studied the emergence, development and death of over 1300 stems in 10 SFs representing three age classes (< 1-5, 6-10 and 11-14 years old). Mean tree biomass accumulation in both the < 1-5 and 6-10 years old (4.4 and 5.7 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively) abandoned pastures was lower than predicted and deviated significantly (57% and 41%) from rates estimated from the chronosequence. The older SFs, with a mean growth rate of 9.9 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) followed the rate predicted by the chronosequence. Understocking was the primary cause of low biomass recovery rates in the youngest forests; although the youngest stands had a diameter at breast height increment three times the oldest stands, the youngest stands lacked sufficient density to cumulatively produce high biomass accumulation rates. Four years of measurement indicated that the youngest stands had developed 59% of the stems measured in the older stands during the same time period. The 6-10-year-old stands were rapidly self-thinning and approached stem density values measured in the same aged stands at the onset of the study. Mortality was high for all stands, with 54% of the original stems remaining after 4 years in intermediate-aged stands. The forests were dominated by the tree Vismia, which represented 55-66% of the biomass in all stands. The Vismia share of the biomass was decreasing over time, with other genera replacing the pioneer. Our measured rates of regrowth indicate that generalized estimates of forest regrowth through chronosequence studies will overestimate forest regrowth for the youngest forests that were under land use for longer time-periods before abandonment. Certified Emission Reductions under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto protocol should consider these results when predicting and compensating for carbon sequestered under natural forest management.

TI  - Fire-sensitive and threatened plants in the Upper Paraguay River Basin, Brazil: Identifying priority areas for Integrated Fire Management and ecological restoration
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Extreme wildfires present an ever-increasing problem in different landscapes around the world. Here, we explore recent wildfires to prioritize recovery efforts and mitigate effects of future wildfires in the Pantanal, the largest continuous wetland in the world. Using ecological niche modeling (ENM), we categorize affected areas based on potential levels of degradation by fire and the predicted suitability for threatened and fire-sensitive plants. Based on this information, we identify key areas for fire prevention. Under land cover change scenarios predicted for 2050, approximately 25 % of the land cover under future threat will have potentially high biomass accumulation. We identified 1272 km(2) in priority areas with forest formation, with restoration cost of at least US$ 576,189. This case study provides an analysis workflow that can be used to assess other wildfire-threatened parts of the world. These results can inform public policy to establish new fire brigades, conservation efforts using Integrated Fire Management, and restoration areas to mitigate biodiversity loss.

TI  - Open ecosystems restoration: a global review shows biases and mismatches between theory and practice
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Ecological restoration aims to recover the structure, biodiversity, and function of degraded ecosystems. However, open ecosystems have been largely overlooked in restoration, and the extent of theory-based restoration is unclear. We systematically review papers on open ecosystems restoration from 2011 to 2021, examining publication trends with data on restored site age, size, indicators, and assessment frequency. We also explore the relationships between interventions, indicators, and ecological concepts. By analyzing 343 papers, we found that open ecosystems restoration is concentrated in North America and Europe, with nearly 75% of restored areas originating in these continents. Restored areas are small, assessed for a short duration, with a plethora of indicators and no establishment of clear control or reference areas for meaningful comparisons. Common open ecosystems restoration sites interventions involved trees and shrubs management, soil management, seeding, and transfer of plant material as the main interventions. From our analyzed papers, we found that 30% of them mentioned any ecological concepts, with community assembly and succession being the most mentioned ones. Furthermore, our exploratory analysis revealed no relationship between interventions, indicators, and ecological concepts, suggesting a widespread mismatch between theory and practice. As the Decade for Ecosystem Restoration unfolds, we call practitioners, researchers, and stakeholders working on open ecosystems to address challenges and curtail widespread biases. Despite the uniqueness of each restoration project, a clear, well-planned design encompassing site-specific variables and solid theoretical bases is expected to enhance restoration outcomes, optimizing costs and biodiversity gains.

TI  - Extending the baseline of tropical dry forest loss in Ghana (1984-2015) reveals drivers of major deforestation inside a protected area
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Tropical dry forests experience the highest deforestation rates on Earth, with major implications for the biodiversity of these ecosystems, as well as for its human occupants. Global remote sensing based forest cover data (2000 2012) point to the rapid loss of tropical dry forest in South America and Africa, also, if not foremost, inside formally protected areas. Here, we significantly extend the baseline of tropical dry forest loss inside a protected area in Ghana using a generalizable change detection technique. The forest cover change detection is based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from historical Landsat data (1984-2015). Field measurements were carried out in dry semi-deciduous forest and in the adjacent savanna and woodland. Estimates of the canopy area index and above ground woody biomass were related to NDVI derived from Landsat 8 data. The change detection indicated significant NDVI decrease in a large area initially covered by tropical dry forest, associated with deforestation. The peak in deforestation was found to have occurred between 1990 and 2002, hereafter, the conservation status of the area was improved. A combination of remote sensing data corroborated by secondary data sources provides evidence for the almost complete clearance of a tropical dry forest inside a strictly protected area, attributable to logging and land clearing for arable farming. The NDVI change detection also revealed NDVI increase in the adjacent woodlands from 2002 to 2015, demonstrating woody encroachment. Historical fire data from the MODIS burned area product indicate that the deforested area experienced a high frequency of anthropogenic burning since 2004, which may have caused further degradation and largely prevents forest regeneration. The results show the ongoing destruction of tropical ecosystems even within ostensibly protected areas and ask for the revision of protection and management strategies of such areas.

TI  - Do the impact of organic residues on soil quality extend beyond the deposition area under oil palm?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY
AB  - Recycling empty fruit bunches (EFBs) in mature oil palm stands usually consists in distributing them over a limited area representing 3%-10% of the plot. The impact of this practice on soil quality, including soil biodiversity, is not well known at the plot scale. We analysed soil physical, chemical, and biological variables. Five zones were defined around the palm tree to assess spatial heterogeneity due to plant cover and application of organic and inorganic fertilisers. Each zone was analysed separately. Our study revealed marked variations in mineral contents around the palm tree, ranging from deficiency to excess or nutrient imbalance in adjacent zones, particularly in available P and K, Mg and pH. Similar variations in macrofauna were observed both in the litter and the soil. Our results demonstrate that the changes caused by plant cover and applications of fertiliser are mainly limited in space, but that earthworm communities move as a function of variations in nutrient availability or stress associated with EFB deposition over time. The Amacher index, adapted to the soil nutrient status for oil palm, indicated that average mineral fertility at the plot scale was rather good. The average density of soil macrofauna and nematofauna was low compared to other tropical ecosystems, but reference data from Indonesia are lacking. Application of EFBs on the harvest path mainly improved the homogeneity of soil quality within the elementary plot around the palm. However these data did not show that recycling EFB stimulates soil fauna communities or carbon sequestration at the plot scale. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Litterfall-Associated Carbon Deposition and Vertical Profiles of Soil Organic Carbon in Different Land-Use Systems
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - Litterfall is one of the major inputs for soil nutrients. Understanding the connection of litterfall and soil organic carbon (SOC) as the part of ecological processes is a key step towards carbon sequestration as a climate change mitigation strategy. Yet, it remains inadequate to support by empirical pieces of evidence particularly in tropical ecosystems. In this study, litter traps were used to monitor the monthly organic carbon deposition over a year through litterfall, and soil samples were collected vertically up to 30 cm depth to define the SOC depth distribution in three different land use types located at Wondo Genet district, southern Ethiopia. The results were interpreted by deploying both the carbon stratification ratio (CSR) and carbon flow balance ratio (CFBR) as ecological indicators. The results revealed that both the annual litterfall amount and associated organic carbon input in plantation forest (958.4 +/- 112 g center dot m-2 center dot yr-1; 391.4 +/- 112 g center dot C center dot m-2 center dot yr-1) were higher than those in the homegarden (183.5.4 +/- 26 g center dot m-2 center dot yr-1; 67.4 +/- 10 g center dot C center dot m-2 center dot yr-1), conceivably due to few litter contributors (trees) present in the homegarden. The CSR of the homegarden (1.3 +/- 0.01) was found between the ratio obtained for crop (1.2 +/- 0.01) and plantation forest (1.4 +/- 0.01), indicating that it is definitely a combination of pure plantation forest and crop system. The CFBR was higher in plantation forest (3.4 yr-1) than in soil of homegarden (0.77 yr-1), implying the net accumulation of soil carbon over time in the latter system. Hence, homegardens could be considered as a system of climate-smart practice with multiple-biogeochemistry pathways, which simultaneously address the social-absolute needs. Given the current tendency of transforming homegarden agroforestry to monoculture types owing to economical drivers, such indicators can dictate of making rational decisions related to land use planning and soil fertility management.

TI  - Abundance and phenology drive plant-pollinator network responses to restoration in the Southern Atlantic rainforest in Brazil
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Ecological restoration has been increasingly considering biotic interactions. Different restoration strategies usually rely on different composition and abundance of plants with potential impact on the establishment of plant-pollinator interactions. We evaluated the restoration of plant-pollinator interaction networks in young restoration areas in the South Atlantic rainforest, Brazil. We assessed the relative contribution of two restoration strategies (natural regeneration vs. reforestation), geographic distance, plant composition, pollinator composition, abundance of flowers and insects, and plant-pollinator temporal overlap, that is, phenological coupling, to predict the establishment of pairwise interactions. We expected that restoration strategies would indirectly affect the patterns (identity and frequency) of pairwise interactions due to their influence on the processes driving interactions. We sampled monthly pollinators and the plants they visited on six reforestation sites and six natural regeneration sites during 20 months. We surveyed flower abundance in summer. We analyzed the relative contribution of each factor to predict the identity and frequency of pairwise interactions using structural equation modeling. Contrary to expectations, the restoration strategy did not predict interactions, probably because the sites under restoration were surrounded by natural and conserved landscapes. Since we found no effect of restoration strategies on plant composition, abundance, and phenological coupling, the restoration strategy did not predict interactions. Phenological coupling explained more than half of the interaction patterns, representing the best predictor of interactions followed by abundance and plant composition. Therefore, these predictors should be considered to select plant species in restoration projects that encompass interactions and pollination services.

TI  - Influence of cashew Anacardium occidentale L. Cultivation on termite diversity in the Korhogo savannah zone (Northern Cote d'ivoire)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
AB  - Termites play an important role in the process of decomposition of organic matter in tropical ecosystems and participate in the evolution of soil structure. This study was carried out in the north of Cote d'Ivoire to evaluate the influence of cashew tree orchards' age on termite assemblages. The standardised method for rapid estimation (RAP) of biodiversity was used to collect termites in four (4) classes of cashew tree orchards (Class 1: < 5 years, Class 2: 5-10 years, Class 3: 11-20 years, Class 4: 21 years and above) in comparison to savannah. The results showed that species richness, were low in young orchards of class 1 (9 species). This increased progressively with age to its maximum in older orchards of class 4 (30 species). These old orchards were even richer in termite species than the savannah (27 species). Shannon-Weiner diversity index varied in the same way as species richness. The abundance of termites, were low in young orchards (45 occurrences), higher in older orchards of class 4 (423 occurrences), with a predominance of fungus-growing termite species. This study showed the recovery of termite diversity in cashew tree orchards after the stoppage in agricultural activities. Suggesting that, this form of agroforestry would allow for the conservation of diversity of the soil fauna while ensuring food security in the area.

TI  - Microbiome resilience of Amazonian forests: Agroforest divergence to bacteria and secondary forest succession convergence to fungi
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - An alarming and increasing deforestation rate threatens Amazon tropical ecosystems and subsequent degradation due to frequent fires. Agroforestry systems (AFS) may offer a sustainable alternative, reportedly mimicking the plant-soil interactions of the natural mature forest (MF). However, the role of microbial community in tropical AFS remains largely unknown. This knowledge is crucial for evaluating the sustainability of AFS and practices given the key role of microbes in the aboveground-belowground interactions. The current study, by comparing different AFS and successions of secondary and MFs, showed that AFS fostered distinct groups of bacterial community, diverging from the MFs, likely a result of management practices while secondary forests converged to the same soil microbiome found in the MF, by favoring the same groups of fungi. Model simulations reveal that AFS would require profound changes in aboveground biomass and in soil factors to reach the same microbiome found in MFs. In summary, AFS practices did not result in ecosystems mimicking natural forest plant-soil interactions but rather reshaped the ecosystem to a completely different relation between aboveground biomass, soil abiotic properties, and the soil microbiome.

TI  - Potential conditions for fire occurrence in vegetation in the Peruvian Andes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
AB  - Fire activity in the Peruvian Andes has increased significantly in recent decades, but climatic parameters associated with drought, which may indirectly contribute to the occurrence of severe forest fires, have not yet been investigated. Because fire prevention tools are scarce, strategies for deterring burning are necessary in order to reduce impacts in regions where forest fires usually result from human activity. This study explores the conditions conducive to forest fire in the Andes of Peru. Daily precipitation and temperature observed data from the PISCO gridded dataset for the 2002-2016 period were used. In addition, MODIS satellite images (MOD09A1 product) were collected to characterise Andean vegetation using spectral indices. Analysis of daily temperature and rainfall indicates that climatic parameters such as cumulative precipitation, dry-day frequency and hot-day frequency are statistically associated with conditions that could contribute to increased forest fire occurrence. Our findings suggest that a decrease in the water content of vegetation, estimated by the Global Vegetation Moisture Index during the dry period and wet period onset, can be used to identify potential conditions for forest fire occurrence. This study suggests that forest managers should consider implementing prevention strategies that include continuous monitoring of climate and vegetation parameters.

TI  - Coffee Rust Severity Analysis in Agroforestry Systems Using Deep Learning in Peruvian Tropical Ecosystems
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Agroforestry systems can influence the occurrence and abundance of pests and diseases because integrating crops with trees or other vegetation can create diverse microclimates that may either enhance or inhibit their development. This study analyzes the severity of coffee rust in two agroforestry systems in the provinces of Ja & eacute;n and San Ignacio in the department of Cajamarca (Peru). This research used a quantitative descriptive approach, and 319 photographs were collected with a professional camera during field trips. The photographs were segmented, classified and analyzed using the deep learning MobileNet and VGG16 transfer learning models with two methods for measuring rust severity from SENASA Peru and SENASICA Mexico. The results reported that grade 1 is the most prevalent rust severity according to the SENASA methodology (1 to 5% of the leaf affected) and SENASICA Mexico (0 to 2% of the leaf affected). Moreover, the proposed MobileNet model presented the best classification accuracy rate of 94% over 50 epochs. This research demonstrates the capacity of machine learning algorithms in disease diagnosis, which could be an alternative to help experts quantify the severity of coffee rust in coffee trees and broadens the field of research for future low-cost computational tools for disease recognition and classification

TI  - Ten principles for restoring campo rupestre, a threatened tropical, megadiverse, nutrient-impoverished montane grassland
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - To achieve the ambitious goals of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, restoration frameworks should embrace the diversity of ecosystems found on Earth, including open-canopy ecosystems, which have been largely overlooked. Considering the paucity of scientific foundations promoting restoration science, policy, and practice for open tropical ecosystems, we provide overarching guidelines to restore the campo rupestre, a Neotropical, open megadiverse grassland that has been increasingly threatened by multiple human activities, especially mining. Restoration techniques for tropical grasslands are still at its infancy, and attempts to restore campo rupestre have had, so far, low to moderate success, highlighting the need for a tailored restoration framework. In a scenario of increasing degradation and scarcity of on-site restoration experiments, we propose 10 principles to improve our ability to plan, implement, and monitor restoration in campo rupestre: (1) include socioeconomic dimensions, (2) implement active restoration, (3) keep low soil fertility, (4) restore disturbance regimes, (5) address genetic structure and adaptation potential, (6) restore geographically restricted and specialized ecological interactions, (7) incorporate functional approaches, (8) use seed-based restoration strategies to enhance biodiversity, (9) translocation is inevitable, and (10) long-term monitoring is mandatory. Our principles represent the best available evidence to support better science and practice for the restoration of campo rupestre and, to some extent, can be useful for other megadiverse, fire-prone, and nutrient-poor ecosystems.

TI  - Rainforest transformation reallocates energy from green to brown food webs
T2  - NATURE
AB  - Terrestrial animal biodiversity is increasingly being lost because of land-use change(1,2). However, functional and energetic consequences aboveground and belowground and across trophic levels in megadiverse tropical ecosystems remain largely unknown. To fill this gap, we assessed changes in energy fluxes across 'green' aboveground (canopy arthropods and birds) and 'brown' belowground (soil arthropods and earthworms) animal food webs in tropical rainforests and plantations in Sumatra, Indonesia. Our results showed that most of the energy in rainforests is channelled to the belowground animal food web. Oil palm and rubber plantations had similar or, in the case of rubber agroforest, higher total animal energy fluxes compared to rainforest but the key energetic nodes were distinctly different: in rainforest more than 90% of the total animal energy flux was channelled by arthropods in soil and canopy, whereas in plantations more than 50% of the energy was allocated to annelids (earthworms). Land-use change led to a consistent decline in multitrophic energy flux aboveground, whereas belowground food webs responded with reduced energy flux to higher trophic levels, down to -90%, and with shifts from slow (fungal) to fast (bacterial) energy channels and from faeces production towards consumption of soil organic matter. This coincides with previously reported soil carbon stock depletion(3). Here we show that well-documented animal biodiversity declines with tropical land-use change(4-6) are associated with vast energetic and functional restructuring in food webs across aboveground and belowground ecosystem compartments.

TI  - Meta-analysis reveals that vertebrates enhance plant litter decomposition at the global scale
T2  - NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
AB  - Evidence is mounting that vertebrate defaunation greatly impacts global biogeochemical cycling. Yet, there is no comprehensive assessment of the potential vertebrate influence over plant decomposition, despite litter decay being one of the largest global carbon fluxes. We therefore conducted a global meta-analysis to evaluate vertebrate effects on litter mass loss and associated element release across terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Here we show that vertebrates affected litter decomposition by various direct and indirect pathways, increasing litter mass loss by 6.7% on average, and up to 34.4% via physical breakdown. This positive vertebrate impact on litter mass loss was consistent across contrasting litter types (woody and non-woody), climatic regions (boreal, temperate and tropical), ecosystem types (aquatic and terrestrial) and vertebrate taxa, but disappeared when evaluating litter nitrogen and phosphorus release. Moreover, we found evidence of interactive effects between vertebrates and non-vertebrate decomposers on litter mass loss, and a larger influence of vertebrates at mid-to-late decomposition stages, contrasting with the invertebrate effect known to be strongest at early decomposition stage. Our synthesis demonstrates a global vertebrate control over litter mass loss, and further stresses the need to account for vertebrates when assessing the impacts of biodiversity loss on biogeochemical cycles.
   Across terrestrial and aqueous ecosystems, vertebrates increase litter decomposition, both directly and indirectly, by 6.7% on average, and this effect interacts with but generally occurs at a later stage of decomposition than the effect of invertebrates.

TI  - Termite diversity along a land use intensification gradient in a semi-arid savanna
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
AB  - Disturbance, particularly agricultural expansion is one of the major threats to the biodiversity and ecological functions of tropical and sub-tropical ecosystems. In this regard, we examined changes in the species richness, abundance, and diversity of termites across different disturbance treatments in a sub-tropical semi-arid savanna in south eastern Zimbabwe. Nine transects (100 x 2 m) representing three habitat disturbance treatments (primary woodland; grazing area; agricultural field) were sampled for termites using a rapid biodiversity assessment protocol. Termites were more abundant and species-rich in primary woodland and grazing area than in the agricultural field. Twelve termite species from three sub-families were present, with Microtermes sp. constituting 35% of the identified termite species. Termite feeding group structure differed significantly among land-use types, and of all termites present, wood-feeding termites were the most abundant while soil-feeders were rare in the agricultural field. In conclusion the observed pattern in termite species richness and relative abundance indicates that termites are very resilient to natural disturbance and might actually benefit from some natural disturbances like they did in the grazing area of this study, but they are not resilient to extreme anthropogenic disturbance. Although there was no notable difference in termite species richness and relative abundance between agricultural field and primary woodland, the pattern observed across the three sites may be potential support for the IDH suggesting that intermediate levels of physical disturbance intensity influence the structure and functioning of termite assemblages in semi-arid savanna.

TI  - Shade tree cover criteria for non-point source pollution control in the Rainforest Alliance coffee certification program: A snapshot assessment of Costa Rica's Tarrazu coffee region
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Management of non-point source pollution is of great importance in the context of coffee agriculture, as this land use often coincides with headwater streams that influence water quality at the basin scale. Sustainability certification programs, such as the Rainforest Alliance (RA), provide management guidelines that promote non-point source pollution control in coffee. One of these practices is the maintenance of shade trees within farms, required by RA at a minimum of 40% shade tree cover. Here we assess the effectiveness of this practice in Tarrazii, a high elevation coffee growing region in Costa Rica. We monitored indicators of non-point source pollution in streams with both high and low shade tree cover. Streams with High Shade Tree Cover (HSTC, N= 5 subwatersheds) had 35-55% cover, approximating or exceeding the RA recommendation of at least 40%; and streams with Low Shade Tree Cover (LSTC, N= 5 subwatersheds), had 18-31% cover. We monitored the ten study streams during the dry (April & December), transition (July), and peak (October) rainfall seasons of 2013, and compared responses using t-tests. We found support for the effectiveness of shade tree cover in controlling non-point source pollution: HSTC streams had significantly (p = 0.042) lower mean annual turbidity and significantly (p =0.004) lower turbidity during the transition season. HSTC streams also had significantly (p= 0.05) lower conductivity values during the transition period, although this trend was weaker through the year. Subwatersheds with HSTC streams were characterized by a higher percentage of RA-certified coffee than LSTC streams. Our study provides evidence of the benefits of RA shade tree cover criteria for managing water quality within high elevation tropical agro-ecosystems, especially if implemented at the watershed scale. These results contribute to our understanding of the role of agroforestry certification on tropical ecosystem conservation, and are the first account of the effectiveness of a specific coffee certification guideline on non-point source pollution control.

TI  - Regeneration after fire in campo rupestre: Short- and long-term vegetation dynamics
T2  - FLORA
AB  - The Cerrado (Brazilian savanna) is the second largest biome in Brazil, covering 22% of the country, and campo rupestre is one of the most biodiverse ecosystem. Campo rupestre are extremely old mountaintop tropical ecosystems, composed of a mosaic of herbaceous, shrubland and savanna vegetation, generally located above 900 m above sea level characterized by shallow, acidic and nutrient-poor soils. In the context of increased land-use changes, effective conservation and management projects appear necessary to guarantee the conservation of these ecosystems. Although fire is a natural disturbance in campo rupestre, the effects of fire on vegetation dynamics remain poorly understood. Our objective was to assess the effects of fire on vegetation recovery and plant composition on both the short- and long-term in the main herbaceous vegetation types: the sandy and stony grasslands. We monitored plant community composition before and after a wildfire in order to assess the short- term vegetation recovery. Diachronic analyses of grasslands burnt at various dates were used to understand the effects of fire on the long-term vegetation dynamics. Our results highlighted a rapid recovery of campo rupestre vegetation after wildfires, suggesting a high adaptation to fire of plant communities. We did not find a significant variation in species richness of sandy grasslands according to time after fire, whereas higher species richness was observed in the recently burnt stony grasslands. No change in plant composition of campo rupestre in response to fire was highlighted, probably due to the high heterogeneity of this ecosystem. After fire, biomass gradually increased over time in both vegetation types. High biomass accumulation could lead to stronger fires. Further studies are necessary to understand the relationship between biomass accumulation and fire intensity in campo rupestre in order to set up adapted fire management strategies to conserve campo rupestre biodiversity.

TI  - Entomofauna Associated with Agroforestry Systems of Timber Species and Cacao in the Southern Region of the Maracaibo Lake Basin (Merida, Venezuela)
T2  - INSECTS
AB  - Agroforestry systems are environment-friendly production systems which help to preserve biodiversity while providing people with a way of earning a living. Cacao is a historically important crop in Venezuela that traditionally has been produced in agroforestry systems. However, few studies have evaluated how different trees used in those systems affect the dynamics and abundance of insects. The present study evaluated the entomofauna assemblages associated with different combinations of four timber-yielding trees and four Criollo cacao cultivars established in a lowland tropical ecosystem in Venezuela. A randomized block design with two replicates was used, each block having 16 plots which included all 16 possible combinations of four native timber trees (Cordia thaisiana, Cedrela odorata, Swietenia macrophylla, and Tabebuia rosea) and four Criollo cacao cultivars (Porcelana, Guasare, Lobatera and Criollo Merideno). Insects were collected with yellow pan traps and sorted to order. Coleoptera and parasitoid Hymenoptera were determined to the family level. In total, 49,538 individuals of seven orders were collected, with Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Hemiptera being the most abundant, although only Lepidoptera and Coleoptera abundances were significantly influenced by the timber tree species. Twenty-three families of parasitoid Hymenoptera and 26 of Coleoptera were found. Significant differences in insects' assemblages were found both in parasitoid Hymenoptera and Coleoptera families associated to every shade tree, with the families Eulophidae and Lycidae being indicators for Cordia, and Chalcididae for Swietenia. The entomofauna relationship with the cacao cultivar was barely significant, although Scydmaenidae and Scarabaeidae were indicators for Lobatera and Merideno, respectively. No significant effects were found for interaction with cacao cultivars and native trees. We concluded that the particular insect assemblages found in Cedrela odorata and Cordia thaisiana, together with their high growing rates, make these two species an optimal choice for cacao agroforestry systems.

TI  - Toward an ecological understanding of a flood-pulse system lake in a tropical ecosystem: Food web structure and ecosystem health
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB  - Tonle Sap Great Lake (TSL) is the largest freshwater lake ecosystem in Southeast Asia and receptacle of impressive biodiversity. However, there is surprisingly little knowledge of its ecosystem structure and functioning. The main objective of the current work was to quantify the food web structure and assess the ecosystem health status of the TSL system by constructing the first holistic food web model using Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE). The results indicate that the ecotrophic efficiency (EE) values were very high for most of functional groups (EE > 0.5) except molluscs (0.146) and macrophytes (0.102). The high EE values together with the MTI (Mixed Trophic Impact) analysis indicated the overexploitation and degradation of fishery resources in the TSL system. The discrete trophic levels varied from 1 (phytoplankton, macrophytes and detritus) to 3.17 (snakehead). The energy transfer in the TSL food web was based mostly on the detrital food chain (77.9%) rather than the grazing food chain (22.1%), with an average transfer efficiency of 8.27%. The ratios of total primary production to respiration (TPP/TR) and to biomass (TPP/TB) were 1.23 and 2.04, respectively, while the Ascendency and Finn cycling index (FCI) of the system were estimated at 27.4% and 23.62%. Nevertheless, the connectance index (CI: 0.253) and system omnivory index (SOI: 0.075) were in-between compared to other lake ecosystems, which indicated that the food web structure was characterized by linear, rather than web-like features. Systematic analysis and indicators suggested that the ecosystem was a relatively healthy ecosystem achieving a certain stage of maturity, albeit with a vulnerable food web structure. Accordingly, some ecosystem-based strategies are presented for the improvement of fishery management and ecosystem conservation in TSL. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Biodiversity responses to land-use change in the equatorial Andes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Land-use change is a primary driver of biodiversity loss. Tropical ecosystems face rapid conversion rates due to the encroachment of agricultural lands and supply needs for goods and services from an increasing population and changing market demands. Measuring the effect of land conversion on species diversity is challenging due to incomplete and uneven knowledge of different taxonomical groups. Here, we contrast different metrics for measuring biodiversity loss across three land-use typologies: secondary forest, agroforestry, and monoculture for five taxonomic groups: birds, frogs, fish, dung beetles, and macroinvertebrates in the Andean piedmont forests of the western equatorial Andes. Albeit our limited and uneven sample in space and time, we found that rarity, Non Metric Multidimensional Scaling, and Multinomial Classification Model (i.e., classifications of habitat specialists and generalists) constitute a more sensitive set of indicators to assess land-use change impacts on tropical mountain biodiversity compared to classical metrics. Likewise, our results showed that land-use intensification influenced community assemblages in the five taxonomic groups. These non-classical biodiversity metrics can provide better insight into the effect of land conversion on these highly biodiverse ecosystems composed of many rare species.

TI  - Birds as predators in tropical agroforestry systems
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Insectivorous birds reduce arthropod abundances and their damage to plants in some, but not all, studies where predation by birds has been assessed. The variation in bird effects may be due to characteristics such as plant productivity or quality, habitat complexity, and/or species diversity of predator and prey assemblages. Since agroforestry systems vary in such characteristics, these systems provide a good starting point for understanding when and where we can expect predation by birds to be important. We analyze data from bird exclosure studies in forests and agroforestry systems to ask whether birds consistently reduce their arthropod prey base and whether bird predation differs between forests and agroforestry systems. Further, we focus on agroforestry systems to ask whether the magnitude of bird predation (1) differs between canopy trees and understory plants, (2) differs when migratory birds are present or absent, and (3) correlates with bird abundance and diversity. We found that, across all studies, birds reduce all arthropods, herbivores, carnivores, and plant damage. We observed no difference in the magnitude of bird effects between agroforestry systems and forests despite simplified habitat structure and plant diversity in agroforests. Within agroforestry systems, bird reduction of arthropods was greater in the canopy than the crop layer. Top-down effects of bird predation were especially strong during censuses when migratory birds were present in agroforestry systems. Importantly, the diversity of the predator assemblage correlated with the magnitude of predator effects; where the diversity of birds, especially migratory birds, was greater, birds reduced arthropod densities to a greater extent. We outline potential mechanisms for relationships between bird predator, insect prey, and habitat characteristics, and we suggest future studies using tropical agroforests as a model system to further test these areas of ecological theory.

TI  - Spatial analysis and machine learning prediction of forest fire susceptibility: a comprehensive approach for effective management and mitigation
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Forest fires (FF) in tropical seasonal forests impact ecosystem. Addressing FF in tropical ecosystems has become a priority to mitigate impacts on biodiversity loss and climate change. The escalating frequency and intensity of FF globally have become a mounting concern. Understanding their tendencies, patterns, and vulnerabilities is imperative for conserving ecosystems and facilitating the development of effective prevention and management strategies. This study investigates the trends, patterns, and spatiotemporal distribution of FF for the period of 2001-2022, and delineates the forest fire susceptibility zones in Odisha State, India. The study utilized: (a) MODIS imagery to examine active fire point data; (b) Kernel density tools; (c) FF risk prediction using two machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF); (d) Receiver Operating Characteristic and Area Under the Curve, along with various evaluation metrics; and (e) a total of 19 factors, including three topographical, seven climatic, four biophysical, and five anthropogenic, to create a map indicating areas vulnerable to FF. The validation results revealed that the RF model achieved a precision exceeding 94 % on the validation datasets, while the SVM model reached 89 %. The estimated forest fire sus- ceptibility zones using RF , SVM techniques indicated that 20.14 % and 16.72 % of the area, respectively, fall under the " Very High Forest Fire " susceptibility class. Trend analysis reveals a general upward trend in forest fire occurrences (R 2 = 0.59), with a notable increase after 2015, peaking in 2021. Notably, Angul district was identified as the most affected area, documenting the highest number of forest fire incidents over the past 22 years. Additionally, forest fire mitigation plans have been developed by drawing insights from forest fire man- agement strategies implemented in various countries worldwide. Overall, this analysis provides valuable insights for policymakers and forest management authorities to develop effective strategies for forest fire prevention and mitigation.

TI  - Pesticide use in banana plantations in Costa Rica-A review of environmental and human exposure, effects and potential risks
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Biodiversity is declining on a global scale. Especially tropical ecosystems, containing most of the planetary biodiversity, are at risk. Agricultural monocrop systems contribute to this decline as they replace original hab-itats and depend on extensive use of synthetic pesticides that impact ecosystems. In this review we use large-scale banana production for export purposes in Costa Rica as an example for pesticide impacts, as it is in production for over a century and uses pesticides extensively for more than fifty years. We summarise the research on pesticide exposure, effects and risks for aquatic and terrestrial environment, as well as for human health. We show that exposure to pesticides is high and relatively well-studied for aquatic systems and humans, but hardly any data are available for the terrestrial compartment including adjacent non target ecosystems such as rainforest fragments. Ecological effects are demonstrated on an organismic level for various aquatic species and processes but are not available at the population and community level. For human health studies exposure evaluation is crucial and recognised effects include various types of cancer and neurobiological dysfunctions particularly in children. With the many synthetic pesticides involved in banana production, the focus on insecticides, revealing highest aquatic risks, and partly herbicides should be extended to fungicides, which are applied aerially over larger areas. The risk assessment and regulation of pesticides so far relies on temperate models and test species and is therefore likely underestimating the risk of pesticide use in tropical ecosystems, with crops such as banana. We highlight further research approaches to improve risk assessment and, in parallel, urge to follow other strategies to reduce pesticides use and especially hazardous substances.

TI  - Coupled social and ecological outcomes of agricultural intensification in Costa Rica and the future of biodiversity conservation in tropical agricultural regions
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - Tropical ecosystem conversion to agriculture has caused widespread habitat loss and created fragmented landscapes composed of remnant forest patches embedded in a matrix of agricultural land uses. Non-traditional agricultural export (NTAE) crops such as pineapple are rapidly replacing multiuse landscapes characterized by a diverse matrix of pasture and smallholder crops with intensive, large-scale, monoculture plantations. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we conduct a case study to examine the coupled social and ecological implications of agricultural intensification in this region, with larger application to regions experiencing similar patterns of agricultural intensification. Guided by frameworks from both political and landscape ecology, we: (1) describe the social and economic implications of pineapple expansion, specifically the concentration of land, labor and financial resources, (2) quantify pineapple cultivation's spatial characteristics, and (3) assess the effects of pineapple expansion on surrounding forest ecosystems, on the agricultural matrix and on biodiversity conservation. Our results indicate that pineapple production concentrates land, labor, and financial resources, which has a homogenizing effect on the agricultural economy in the study region. This constrains farm-based livelihoods, with larger implications for food security and agricultural diversity. Landscape ecology analyses further reveal how pineapple production simplifies and homogenizes the agricultural matrix between forest patches, which is likely to have a negative effect on biodiversity. To offset the effects of pineapple expansion on social and environmental systems, we recommend developing landscape level land use planning capacity. Furthermore, agricultural and conservation policy reform is needed to promote landscape heterogeneity and economic diversity within the agricultural sector. Our interdisciplinary research provides a detailed examination of the social and ecological impacts of agricultural intensification in a tropical landscape, and offers recommendations for improvement relevant not only to our study region but to the many other tropical landscapes currently undergoing non-traditional agricultural export driven agricultural intensification.
