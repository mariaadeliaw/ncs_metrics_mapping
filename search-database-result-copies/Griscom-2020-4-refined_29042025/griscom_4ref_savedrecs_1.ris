TI  - Tropical forest strata shifts in plant structural diversity-aboveground carbon relationships along altitudinal gradients
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT

AB  - Aboveground carbon storage in forests can be influenced by both structural and compositional diversity of plant communities. However, the relative and interactive effects of structural and compositional diversity on multilevel aboveground carbon storage across forest strata and how these relationships vary with altitude and soil nutrients remain unclear. Using data obtained from 34 tropical forest plots (total area 8.5 ha) in Hainan Island, China, we analyzed the relationships between aboveground carbon at four levels (litter, understory, overstory, and whole-community) with structural diversity (diameter and height diversity) and compositional diversity (species diversity and evenness) in the understory and overstory. The direct and indirect effects of altitude, soil nutrients (total N and total P and N/P ratio), structural diversity, and compositional diversity on aboveground carbon were explored via Bayesian structural equation modeling. The results showed that structural diversity, rather than compositional diversity, in overstory stratum determined aboveground carbon. Specifically, overstory structural diversity was negatively associated with understory carbon, while positively associated with overstory and whole-community carbon. Furthermore, diversity-carbon relationships were slightly affected by soil nutrients but strongly by altitude. Specifically, the relationship between overstory and whole-community carbon content with overstory tree height diversity weakened with altitude, while their relationship with overstory diameter diversity strengthened. Altitude directly and indirectly affected overstory tree height and diameter diversity through overstory species diversity, thereby reducing understory and increasing overstory and whole-community carbon. Altitude directly promoted litter carbon. We provide evidence that the effects of plant diversity on aboveground carbon storage are forest strata-and altitude-dependent. As overstory

TI  - Coverage, vegetation structure and carbon storage of the mangrove forest of Morales, Puntarenas, Costa Rica
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Mangrove forests provide diverse ecosystem services. However, mangroves are one of the most impacted tropical ecosystems, mainly due to land use change, as has occurred in the Gulf of Nicoya in Costa Rica. Objective: Analyze mangrove spatial cover over time, and forest structure, and the carbon storage of the mangrove forest of Morales, to generate a current base line of the state of the mangrove forest. Methods: The study was carried out in the mangrove forest of Morales, Puntarenas, Costa Rica. Total mangrove forest area was calculated from aerial photographs between 1944 and 2020. In 2021, 5 x 5 m plots were sampled in the field. In each plot, trees were counted, they were identified to the lowest possible taxon, their height were measured, and their circumference to calculate their diameter, and soil samples of 4.5 cm depth and interstitial water were collected. The complexity index (CI) of the mangrove stand and the importance value (IV) were calculated for each mangrove genus. Organic carbon content (C-org) was calculated from allometric equations for trees and with loss on ignition for soil. Results: The mangrove forest area decreased by 24 ha between 1944 and 2020, mainly because of the development of shrimp and salt ponds. The forest CI in 2021 was 18.3 and the genus of greatest importance was Rhizophora. The mangrove forest stores 48 Mg C-org/ha in living vegetation and 11 Mg C-org/ha in the soil up to 4.5 cm depth. Conclusions: The mangrove forest structure and the carbon storage, in general, are similar to other mangrove stands in the Gulf of Nicoya. Considering only the carbon in the above ground living vegetation, the loss of 24 ha is equivalent to 4 224 Mg CO(2 )released. The feasibility of carrying out ecological restoration of the lost areas could be analyzed.

TI  - Effectiveness of restoration plantings with Pachira aquatica in swamps
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical freshwater swamps provide essential ecosystem services, such as flood mitigation and control. Land use changes cause alterations in their hydrology, increasing risks of degradation caused by extreme events like storms and hurricanes. We evaluated the effectiveness of different strategies to control opportunistic herbaceous vegetation, as a factor limiting the establishment of the dominant money tree Pachira aquatica for the restoration of swamps in the coastal floodplains of the Gulf coast in Mexico. Pachira aquatica saplings were planted in four treatments: (1) Control (saplings without further intervention), (2) Cut (herbaceous vegetation removal), (3) cutting with Vegetation mulch, and (4) cutting with Plastic cover. The effect of treatments on survival and relative growth rate (RGR) of P. aquatica saplings and on the herbaceous cover was measured after 2 years. Costs per treatment were also calculated. Saplings in the Control had the lowest survival (5.0%; only one seedling survived), followed by Cut (35.0 +/- 12.75%), Vegetation mulch (70.0 +/- 9.35%), and Plastic cover (95.0 +/- 5.0%). Sapling height and RGR were similar among treatments. The herbaceous layer cover was reduced to similar to 30% in Vegetation mulch and Plastic cover in comparison to Control and Cut treatments with similar to 94%. The most cost-effective treatment was Vegetation mulch, with almost half the cost of Plastic cover. Our results support the establishment of restoration plantings with P. aquatica to assist the recovery of swamps and highlight the need to include complementary interventions, to ensure higher tree sapling survival and to avoid total restoration failure in this system.

TI  - Carbon sequestration and conservation of tropical forests under uncertainty
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Concern for global warming has focused attention on the rob of tropical forests in the reduction of ambient CO(2) levels and mitigation of climate change. Deforestation is a major land use change in the tropics, with forest resources undergoing degradation through the influence of logging and conversion to other uses. Land use change is a product of varied local and regional resource use policies. Management of forest resources is one such major temporal factor, influencing resource stability and the carbon pool. Under a given management policy, both the long period of forest growth, and the slow turnover and decay of the carbon pool, enhance the relevance of stand level management policies as cost-effective mechanisms mitigating climate change. Apart from regional level uncertainties like the nature of land use and the estimation of carbon storage in vegetation and soil, the carbon flux of tropical forests is greatly influenced by uncertainty in regenerative capacity of forests and in harvest and management policies. A case study from India is used to develop a transition matrix model of natural forest management, and to explore the economic implications of maintaining and expanding existing carbon sinks. The study further explores the significance of investments in additional carbon sink in plantation forests, given continued uncertainty in natural forest management.

AB  - Tropical forests hold ecosystems of huge wealth in biodiversity and provide a great diversity of ecosystem services critical to human well-being. However, these are regions where deforestation and forest degradation are historically more intense. The Atlantic Forest, for instance, has a great diversity of soils, relief, and vegetation that together generate habitats for unique species. The biome has about 3% of the endemic plant species and more than 2% of the vertebrate species endemic to the whole terrestrial surface, being one of the most important biodiversity hotspots in the world. However, it is estimated that it is the Brazilian biome with the smallest remaining original forest, presenting a great demand for forest restoration initiatives. Forest restoration contributes to increasing habitat cover for biodiversity, protecting soil, providing hydrological services, mitigating climate change, supporting pollination of agricultural crops, strengthening the livelihoods of local communities, and promoting social and economic development. Currently, there is a growing awareness of the importance of forest restoration and the understanding that its actions go beyond the recovery of ecosystem functions, but also have a strong socioeconomic component that implies the development of alternative economic activities with enormous potential to provide a wide variety of ecosystem services to human populations.For this reason, understanding different stakeholder perspectives on restoration becomes crucial for the development of instruments capable of supporting decision-making processes and pointing out alternatives and opportunities for the success of forest restoration initiatives. In this context, the Biota Síntese project has forest restoration in the state of São Paulo as one of its main challenges (challenge 2). The project aims to develop syntheses of academic knowledge and the harmonization of databases capable to support the creation of instruments to encourage and plan forest restoration initiatives. The objective of this post-doctorate is to carry out a survey of data and thematic databases and their subsequent harmonization and improvement in order to provide quick, clear, and interactive information to planners of restoration actions; to carry out interactive analyzes with other work fronts of the Biota Síntese project that involve solutions based on nature in different contexts, and explore alternatives that allow the creation of data-sharing software with users from different sectors of society.

TI  - MANAGEMENT OF TROPICAL SOILS AS SINKS OR SOURCES OF ATMOSPHERIC CARBON
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - The prevailing paradigm for anticipating changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) with changes in land use postulates reductions in SOC in managed systems (agriculture and tree plantations) relative to mature tropical forests. Variations of this notion are used in carbon models to predict the role of tropical soils in the global carbon cycle. Invariably these models show tropical soils as sources of atmospheric carbon. We present data from a variety of studies that show that SOC in managed systems can be lower, the same as, or greater than mature tropical forests and that SOC can increase rapidly after the abandonment of agricultural fields. History of land use affects the comparison of SOC in managed and natural ecosystems. Our review of the literature also highlights the need for greater precautions when comparing SOC in mature tropical forests with that of managed ecosystems. Information on previous land use, bulk density, and consistency in sampling depth are some of the most common omissions in published studies. From comparable SOC data from a variety of tropical land uses we estimate that tropical soils can accumulate between 168 and 553 Tg C/yr. The greatest potential for carbon sequestration in tropical soils is in the forest fallows which cover some 250 million hectares. Increased attention to SOC by land managers can result in greater rates of carbon sequestration than predicted by current SOC models.

TI  - Hawaiian native forest conserves water relative to timber plantation: Species and stand traits influence water use
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests are becoming increasingly alien-dominated through the establishment of timber plantations and secondary forests. Despite widespread recognition that afforestation results in increased evapotranspiration and lower catchment yields, little is known of the impacts of timber plantations on water balance relative to native forest. Native forest trees have been claimed to use water conservatively and enhance groundwater recharge relative to faster-growing alien species, and this argument should motivate native forest preservation and restoration. However, data have been available primarily for leaf-level gas exchange rather than for whole-plant and stand levels. We measured sap flow of dominant tree and tree fern species over eight weeks in native Metrosideros polymorpha forest and adjacent alien timber plantations on the island of Hawai'i and estimated total stand transpiration. Metrosideros polymorpha had the lowest values of sap flux density and whole-tree water use (200 kg.m(-2) sapwood.d(-1), or 8 kg/d for trees of 35 cm mean diameter at breast height, D), substantially less than timber species Eucalyptus saligna or Fraxinus uhdei (33 and 34 kg/d for trees of 73 and 30 cm mean D, respectively). At the stand level, E. saligna and F. uhdei trees had three-and ninefold higher water use, respectively, than native M. polymorpha trees. Understory Cibotium tree ferns were most abundant in M. polymorpha-dominated forest where they accounted for 70% of water use. Overall, F. uhdei plantation had the highest water use at 1.8 mm/d, more than twice that of either E. saligna plantation or M. polymorpha forest. Forest water use was influenced by species composition, stem density, tree size, sapwood allocation, and understory contributions. Transpiration varied strongly among forest types even within the same wet tropical climate, and in this case, native forest had strikingly conservative water use. Comparisons of vegetation cover in water use should provide additional resolution to ecosystem valuation and land management decisions.

TI  - Tropical countries may be willing to pay more to protect their forests
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Inadequate funding from developed countries has hampered international efforts to conserve biodiversity in tropical forests. We present two complementary research approaches that reveal a significant increase in public demand for conservation within tropical developing countries as those countries reach upper-middle-income (UMI) status. We highlight UMI tropical countries because they contain nearly four-fifths of tropical primary forests, which are rich in biodiversity and stored carbon. The first approach is a set of statistical analyses of various cross-country conservation indicators, which suggests that protective government policies have lagged behind the increase in public demand in these countries. The second approach is a case study from Malaysia, which reveals in a more integrated fashion the linkages from rising household income to increased household willingness to pay for conservation, nongovernmental organization activity, and delayed government action. Our findings suggest that domestic funding in UMI tropical countries can play a larger role in (i) closing the funding gap for tropical forest conservation, and (ii) paying for supplementary conservation actions linked to international payments for reduced greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in tropical countries.

TI  - Changes in carbon storage in fallow forests in the tropical lowlands of Borneo
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The range of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from tropical land-use change has long been debated. A major source of uncertainty is attributable to the fluxes of CO2 due to changes in tropical land use. For example, estimate is different depending on whether the biomass or carbon content of tropical forests is totally lost by burning or recovered by regrowth. To estimate CO2 absorption by fallow forests after shifting cultivation, we investigated the floristic composition and measured the biomass of fallow forests in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Above-ground biomass of fallow forests were 8-10 t/ha at one-year-old stands and 45-56 t/ha at 10-12-year-old stands, regardless of the floristic composition. It seems reasonable to suppose that 7.4% of carbon released to the atmosphere by tropical rain forest destruction is reabsorbed and stored by fallow forests in Indonesia. If this is a universal trend in other tropical forests, a significant amount of CO2 is reabsorbed in fallow forests. We consider that fallow forests like the one studied here are substantial carbon sinks and help to offset the effects of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Alternative Tree Species for Sustainable Forest Management in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The scarcity of hardwoods from tropical forests makes the search for alternative species necessary for commercialization. This study aimed to establish groups of timber species from the Amazon Forest with potential for logging purposes through the assessment of their physical-mechanical properties, aiming to identify alternative species that can meet the market demands. We utilized data from the Forest Products Laboratory (LPF) (containing information on basic density and other wood mechanical properties) and the Timberflow platform, as well. We applied a multivariate cluster analysis technique with the aim of grouping species based on the technological characteristics of their wood and evaluating similarity among them to obtain homogeneous groups in terms of economic potential and utilization. The results indicated four homogeneous groups: Cluster 1 (40.72% of species, basic density-db: 690 kg m-3), Cluster 2 (13.92%, db: 260 and 520 kg m-3), Cluster 3 (27.32%, db: 550 and 830 kg m-3), and Cluster 4 (18.04%, db: 830 kg m-3). Most of the 20 listed species are classified as more commercially viable (70%), with high wood density. Species identified as alternatives include Dialium guianense and Zollernia paraensis for Dipteryx odorata, Terminalia argentea for Dinizia excelsa, Terminalia amazonia and Buchenavia grandis for Goupia glabra, and Protium altissimum and Maclura tinctoria for Hymenaea courbaril. The analysis highlighted the overexploitation of a restricted group of species and the need to find alternatives to ensure the sustainability of forest management. This study contributed to identifying species that can serve as alternatives to commercial ones, promoting a more balanced and sustainable forest management.

M3  - Article

AB  - Crops adapted to wetland conditions such as rice (Oryza sativa L.) have been cultivated on waterlogged anoxic soils for millennia. Grazing of livestock is another important agricultural activity in wetlands. Wetlands including peatlands may cover up to 26.9 million km(2) globally, and wetlands may contain up to 158 Pg soil organic carbon (SOC) to 1 m depth, but knowledge on wetland distribution, extent, and volume needs to be strengthened. Peatlands are organic-rich wetlands and cover similar to 4 million km(2) with large areas in the Northern Hemisphere. Over centuries to millennia, organic soils of peatlands have accumulated globally >750 Pg of carbon (C) as peat, sometimes to several meters depth as decomposition rates are greatly reduced under wet and acidic soil conditions. Thus, peatlands while covering only 3% of the global ice-free land area store more than one-fourth of the global SOC stock. Stocks in northern peatlands alone may store >600 Pg C, and their utilization for agriculture may release large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) by peat oxidation. For example, similar to 1 Pg CO2 is emitted annually from drained peatlands (including emissions from fire), with high emissions especially from drained organic soils in tropical regions often for cultivation of oil palms (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.). Further, cumulative net emissions from global peatland use have been estimated at 6 Pg C for the period 1850-2015. Wetlands are also among the major biogenic methane (CH4) sources contributing to about 30% of the total CH4 emissions and will increasingly contribute to the projected climate change. Further, C losses from wetlands may also increase in the future because of the projected climate change. Thus, sustainable intensification (SI) should be applied to reduce CH4 and C losses from wetlands. Options include, for example, restoring drained agricultural land-use types to flooded conditions, improved fertilizer and water management of paddy fields, and breeding of new crop cultivars better adapted to anoxic wetland soil conditions. In this respect, paludiculture of wetlands is promising as a suitable agricultural practice with the cobenefit of C sequestration. This chapter begins with a general overview on wetlands and peatlands. Then, the peatland C balance is discussed in more detail. Agricultural use and management of wetland soils are presented in the following section. The final section discusses options for more 'climate-friendly' agriculture in wetlands.

TI  - Intensive tree planting facilitates tropical forest biodiversity and biomass accumulation in Kibale National Park, Uganda
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The extensive area of degraded tropical land and the calls to conserve forest biodiversity and sequester carbon to offset climate change demonstrate the need to restore forest in the tropics. Deforested land is sometimes replanted with fast-growing trees; however, the consequences of intensive replanting on biomass accumulation or plant and animal diversity are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to determine how intensive replanting affected tropical forest regeneration and biomass accumulation over ten years. We studied reforested sites in Kibale National Park, Uganda, that were degraded in the 1970s and replanted with five native tree species in 1995. We identified and measured the size of planted versus naturally regenerating trees, and felled and weighed matched trees outside the park to calculate region-specific allometric equations for above-ground tree biomass. The role of shrubs and grasses in facilitating or hindering the establishment of trees was evaluated by correlating observed estimates of percent cover to tree biomass. We found 39 tree species naturally regenerating in the restored area in addition to the five originally planted species. Biomass was much higher for planted (15,675 kg/ha) than naturally regenerated trees (4560 kg/ha), but naturally regenerating tree regrowth was an important element of the landscape. The establishment of tree seedlings initially appeared to be facilitated by shrubs, primarily Acanthus pubescens and the invasive Lantana camara; however, both are expected to hinder tree recruitment in the long-term. Large and small-seeded tree species were found in the replanted area, indicating that bird and mammal dispersers contributed to natural forest restoration. These results demonstrate that intensive replanting can accelerate the natural accumulation of biomass and biodiversity and facilitate the restoration of tropical forest communities. However, the long-term financial costs and ecological benefits of planting and maintaining reforested areas need to be weighed against other potential restoration strategies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Near surface air humidity in a megadiverse Andean mountain ecosystem of southern Ecuador and its regionalization
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The near surface humidity in a megadiverse mountain ecosystem in southern Ecuador is examined on the basis of Relative Humidity (RH) measurements inside the natural mountain forest and at open sites along an altitudinal gradient from 1700 to 3200 m. The main methodological aim of the current study is to generate a humidity regionalization tool to provide spatial datasets on average monthly mean, minimum and maximum RH, Specific Humidity (q) and Specific Saturation Deficit (D-S) by using observation data of RH. The maps based on data of the period 1999-2009 are needed by ecological projects working on various plots where no climate station data are available. The humidity maps are generated by combining a straightforward detrending technique with a Digital Elevation Model and a satellite-based land cover classification which also provides the relative forest cover per pixel. The topical aim of the study is to investigate the humidity distribution and structure of both manifestations of our ecosystem (pastures and natural vegetation) with special considerations to the ecosystem regulation service by converting natural forest into pasture. The results reveal a clear differentiation over the year. partly triggered by the change of synoptic weather situation but also by land cover effects. Humidity amplitudes are particularly low during the main rainy season when cloudiness and rainfall are high, but markedly pronounced in the relative dry season when daily irradiance and outgoing nocturnal radiation causes distinct differences between the land cover units. Particularly the upper pasture areas gained by slash and burn of the natural forest exhibit the lowest humidity values while the humidity inside the mountain forest is significantly higher due to the regulating effects of the dense vegetation. Thus, clearing the forest clearly reduces the regulation function (regulating ecosystem services) of the ecosystem which might become problematic for reforestation under future global warming.

TI  - Aligning corporate carbon accounting with natural climate solutions in Southeast Asia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a growing global trend of environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting to promote business transparency. In Southeast Asia, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards 305 is popularly adopted by public-listed companies for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reporting. However, mitigation actions that link corporate GHG emission to Natural Climate Solution (NCS) through tropical forest conservation are relatively absent in the region. This discussion paper explores how the gap can be reconciled. We use the "what if" predictive argument to discuss NCS potential worth USD1,529.8 billion in Southeast Asia. The key strength of the company-led NCS (CNCS) approach is flexibility that considers niche tropical ecosystems, ecological co-benefits and business operation variability. The "bottom-up" option is likely better received as stakeholders will have better control of the finances, scale, pace, governance and transparency. Though this discussion paper deals mainly with Southeast Asia, the principles are universal and provides insights for furthering conversation around decarbonizing the global economy.

TI  - Assessment of Gayo agroforestry coffee characteristics and carbon stock potential in Mumuger social forestry area, Central Aceh Regency
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coffee agroforestry has become a nature-based solution for controlling climate change impacts while, providing access to sustainable forest utilization for rural farmers, especially for the governance of social forestry policies in Indonesia. Ecosystem services established in coffee agroforestry provide high-carbon stocks that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. Statistical and spatial information on carbon stocks in coffee agroforestry in the Sumatran tropical forest region, especially above ground carbon (AGC), is still very limited. Therefore, this study aims to assess the available carbon stocks in Gayo coffee agroforestry in Mumuger Social Forestry Area, Central Aceh Regency, with the help of combining multi-source data (Landsat-Sentinel-NICFI imagery) and involving machine learning algorithms in estimation modelling. The agroforestry carbon stock distributed in the study area has 72.31 +/- 48.46 Mg C ha-1, which is dominated by the Leucaena-coffee agroforestry combination. There are 13 species at the overstory level that contribute carbon stock values up to 198 Mg C ha-1. Based on modelling tests of carbon stock estimation using 37 predictors, the two best machinelearning algorithms were RF and SVM, with R2 reaching 0.83 and 0.85. Carbon stock quantification information and remote sensing machine learning approaches play a strategic role in studying the impacts of agroforestry systems and as a policy evaluation in social forestry governance that can contribute to climate change mitigation.

TI  - Identifying terrestrial carbon sinks: Classification of successional stages in regenerating tropical forest from Landsat TM data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has generally been usual to study the role of tropical forests as a source of atmospheric carbon, primarily through land-use change, such as deforestation, and biomass burning. Regeneration of forest on previously cleared areas, however is a significant carbon sink. The strength of this carbon sink is dependent on the age and composition of the regenerating forest. The ability to identify regenerating forest classes that may differ in terms of carbon sink strength was investigated with Landsat TBI data of a test site near Manaus, Brazil. A number of forest age classes were defined from a time series of Landsat sensor data, and their separability in Landsat TM data was assessed by maximum likelihood classifications. A high level of class separability was observed with a weighted kappa coefficient of 0.8569 obtained for a classification of six forest regeneration classes. Of the classification errors observed most were found to be associated with the youngest forest age class. At the test site, however, two main successional pathways were followed and the differences between areas of forest of the same age but on different pathways was most apparent with the youngest forests. Splitting the regenerating forests by the successional pathway was found to increase classifications accuracy, with a weighted kappa coefficient of 0.9315 observed for an 11 class classification. A range of tropical forest classes that vary in strength as a carbon sink could therefore be identified accurately from Landsat TM data. Although the broader generality of the results requires further investigation this indicates the potential to use image classifications to scale-up point measurements of the carbon flux between regenerating forest classes and the atmosphere over large areas.

TI  - ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION IN MEXICO: INSIGHTS ON THE PROJECT PLANNING PHASE
T2  - BOTANICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A deep discussion of the phases of planning by all stakeholders will help to identify the challenges faced by countries that are embarking on large-scale restoration actions to comply with international agreements.Question: Was the planning phase of restoration projects done according to international guidance? We evaluated six of the eight aspects of the international guidance for the planning phase of restoration projects carried out in Mexico between 1979 and 2016.Methods: The information about the restoration projects was compiled using a digital survey composed of 137 questions.Results: Seventy-five projects with a total area of 1,556,840 hectares were analyzed, mainly in temperate, humid, and deciduous forest. More projects measured the baseline with biotic than with abiotic variables, and social variables were seldom evaluated. Most projects aimed to recover biodiversity or ecosystem services, and they identified a reference ecosystem. Planned budgets included mainly field work.Conclusions: To promote the integration of ecological, social, and economic priorities, landscape restoration is suggested, since it is done at a scale which maximizes the benefits for nature and people. The inclusion of only field work in the budgets may decrease the total cost, but it may jeopardize project success due to poor planning. Careful and detailed planning of a national strategy constructed by all stakeholders that includes restoration of original ecosystems, agroforestry systems (which facilitate social participation and increase land productivity) and patches under natural succession, and investing in highly trained human resources will allow successful compliance with international restoration commitments.

TI  - Evidence of forest restoration success and the conservation value of community-owned forests in Southwest China using dung beetles as indicators
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Protection of the world's remaining forests and biodiversity is a matter of global concern. Yunnan, China is home to China's only mainland tropical rainforests, and 20% of China's total biodiversity. Despite restoration measures and establishment of new protected areas, this region is still experiencing biodiversity loss due to inadequate management and monitoring. We evaluate restoration success of China's tropical forests in Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserve (XSBN-NNR), Yunnan, China using dung beetles as an indicator taxon. We sampled across a land-use gradient of human alteration: protected forest, restored forest, community owned forest, and rubber plantation. We collected 3,748 dung beetles from 21 species over a 3 month period. Multivariate analyses revealed unique assemblages in each land-use category, but with restored forest most similar to protected areas, suggesting restoration success in this region. Community forests were more diverse than plantations, suggesting that community forests may be a valuable and practical conservation tool in this region. Most species were generalists, although some had dietary and habitat preferences. Furthermore, dietary niche breadths were, on average, higher in disturbed areas, suggesting that disturbance may result in dietary changes. We show that restoration of tropical forests appears to be successful for a key ecological and biological indicator group-dung beetles. Furthermore, community-owned forests appear to be valuable and practical method of maintaining ecosystem health and biodiversity in the region. Future management in this region would likely benefit from encouragement to maintain community-owned forests, economic incentives for restoring farmland to forest, and increased environmental monitoring across the land-use gradient.

TI  - Global land change from 1982 to 2016
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land change is a cause and consequence of global environmental change(1,2). Changes in land use and land cover considerably alter the Earth's energy balance and biogeochemical cycles, which contributes to climate change and-in turn-affects land surface properties and the provision of ecosystem services(1-4). However, quantification of global land change is lacking. Here we analyse 35 years' worth of satellite data and provide a comprehensive record of global land-change dynamics during the period 1982-2016. We show that-contrary to the prevailing view that forest area has declined globally(5)-tree cover has increased by 2.24 million km(2) (+7.1% relative to the 1982 level). This overall net gain is the result of a net loss in the tropics being outweighed by a net gain in the extratropics. Global bare ground cover has decreased by 1.16 million km(2) (-3.1%), most notably in agricultural regions in Asia. Of all land changes, 60% are associated with direct human activities and 40% with indirect drivers such as climate change. Land-use change exhibits regional dominance, including tropical deforestation and agricultural expansion, temperate reforestation or afforestation, cropland intensification and urbanization. Consistently across all climate domains, montane systems have gained tree cover and many arid and semi-arid ecosystems have lost vegetation cover. The mapped land changes and the driver attributions reflect a human-dominated Earth system. The dataset we developed may be used to improve the modelling of land-use changes, biogeochemical cycles and vegetation-climate interactions to advance our understanding of global environmental change(1-4,6).

TI  - Multifunctional shade-tree management in tropical agroforestry landscapes - a review
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - P>1. Agricultural intensification reduces ecological resilience of land-use systems, whereas paradoxically, environmental change and climate extremes require a higher response capacity than ever. Adaptation strategies to environmental change include maintenance of shade trees in tropical agroforestry, but conversion of shaded to unshaded systems is common practice to increase short-term yield.2. In this paper, we review the short-term and long-term ecological benefits of shade trees in coffee Coffea arabica, C. canephora and cacao Theobroma cacao agroforestry and emphasize the poorly understood, multifunctional role of shade trees for farmers and conservation alike.3. Both coffee and cacao are tropical understorey plants. Shade trees in agroforestry enhance functional biodiversity, carbon sequestration, soil fertility, drought resistance as well as weed and biological pest control. However, shade is needed for young cacao trees only and is less important in older cacao plantations. This changing response to shade regime with cacao plantation age often results in a transient role for shade and associated biodiversity in agroforestry.4. Abandonment of old, unshaded cacao in favour of planting young cacao in new, thinned forest sites can be named 'short-term cacao boom-and-bust cycle', which counteracts tropical forest conservation. In a 'long-term cacao boom-and-bust cycle', cacao boom can be followed by cacao bust due to unmanageable pest and pathogen levels (e.g. in Brazil and Malaysia). Higher pest densities can result from physiological stress in unshaded cacao and from the larger cacao area planted. Risk-averse farmers avoid long-term vulnerability of their agroforestry systems by keeping shade as an insurance against insect pest outbreaks, whereas yield-maximizing farmers reduce shade and aim at short-term monetary benefits.5. Synthesis and applications. Sustainable agroforestry management needs to conserve or create a diverse layer of multi-purpose shade trees that can be pruned rather than removed when crops mature. Incentives from payment-for-ecosystem services and certification schemes encourage farmers to keep high to medium shade tree cover. Reducing pesticide spraying protects functional agrobiodiversity such as antagonists of pests and diseases, pollinating midges determining cacao yields and pollinating bees enhancing coffee yield. In a landscape perspective, natural forest alongside agroforestry allows noncrop-crop spillover of a diversity of functionally important organisms. Knowledge transfer between farmers, agronomists and ecologists in a participatory approach helps to encourage a shade management regime that balances economic and ecological needs and provides a 'diversified food-and-cash crop' livelihood strategy.

TI  - Simulated effects of logging on carbon storage in dipterocarp forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. As the role of forestry-based options for reducing or mitigating greenhouse gas emissions is debated by policymakers, there is a need to inform the debate by synthesizing existing information on carbon dynamics in tropical forest systems and by applying this information to a range of possible interventions in forestry.2. To investigate the consequences of reductions in logging damage for ecosystem carbon storage, we constructed a model to simulate changes in biomass and carbon pools following logging of primary dipterocarp forests in south-east Asia. We adapted a physiologically driven tree-based model of natural forest gap dynamics (FORMIX) to simulate forest recovery following logging.3. Following selective logging, simulated ecosystem carbon storage declined from prelogging levels (213 Mg C ha(-1)) to a low of 97 Mg C ha(-1), 7 years after logging. Carbon storage in biomass approached prelogging levels about 120 years after logging.4. The relationship between fatal stand damage and ecosystem carbon storage was not linear, with biomass recovery following logging severely limited by 50-60% stand damage.5. Results from simulations suggest that when 20-50% of the stand is killed during logging, replacing persistent forest species with pioneer tree species can reduce the site's potential for carbon storage by 15-26% over 40-60 years.6. Reducing fatal damage from 40% to 20% of the residual stand, as was the case with a pilot project in Malaysia, was associated with an increase of 36 Mg C ha(-1) in mean carbon storage over 60 years.7. Efforts to monitor and verify the benefits, either through carbon sequestration in new growth or carbon retention in existing biomass, of offset projects involving tropical forests and natural forest management should focus on above-ground biomass, particularly the large trees. Selection of the most appropriate allometric equations for a site and species is important because of their influence on biomass estimates.

TI  - Drivers of soil organic carbon stock during tropical forest succession
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic matter contributes to productivity in terrestrial ecosystems and contains more carbon than is found in the atmosphere. Yet, there is little understanding of soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration processes during tropical forest succession, particularly after land abandonment from agriculture practices.Here, we used vegetation and environmental data from two large-scale surveys covering a total landscape area of 20,000 ha in Southeast Asia to investigate the effects of plant species diversity, functional trait diversity, phylogenetic diversity, above-ground biomass and environmental factors on SOC sequestration during forest succession.We found that functional trait diversity plays an important role in determining SOC sequestration across successional trajectories. Increases in SOC carbon storage were associated with indirect positive effects of species diversity and succession age via functional trait diversity, but phylogenetic diversity and above-ground biomass showed no significant relationship with SOC stock. Furthermore, the effects of soil properties and functional trait diversity on SOC carbon storage shift across elevation.Synthesis. Our results suggest that reforestation and restoration management practices that implement a trait-based approach by combining long-lived and short-lived species (conservative and acquisitive traits) to increase plant functional diversity could enhance SOC sequestration for climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts, as well as accelerate recovery of healthy soils.

TI  - Practitioner views on the determinants of tropical forest restoration longevity
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ensuring the long-term persistence of tropical forest restoration projects is vital to maintaining carbon stocks, biodiversity, and other benefits of restored ecosystems. But our understanding of the factors that determine restoration longevity-the age that a restored ecosystem attains before being converted to another land use-is limited, and derived primarily from studies based on remote sensing or observations at a single site over time. In this article, we apply a new approach by surveying restoration practitioners from across the tropics on the factors that they perceive to influence restoration longevity. Through an online survey (including categorical and open-ended questions) we asked practitioners about the ecological and social characteristics of their restoration projects, and their views on what factors contribute to project longevity. We summarized the information on project characteristics, and conducted thematic analysis and coding of the longevity drivers discussed by respondents. A total of 29 respondents from 15 tropical countries completed our survey, with the majority of projects occurring on previously pastured lands in wet and lowland tropical forests. Practitioners discussed social factors more than twice as frequently as ecological factors. The most frequently cited social factor key to restoration longevity was engagement with multiple stakeholders, followed by long-term funding, the need for innovative project design, as well as effective and inspirational leadership. Overall, the voices of practitioners underscore the critical need to address local social context in order to achieve long-term forest recovery.

TI  - A global review of past land use, climate, and active vs. passive restoration effects on forest recovery
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global forest restoration targets have been set, yet policy makers and land managers lack guiding principles on how to invest limited resources to achieve them. We conducted a meta-analysis of 166 studies in naturally regenerating and actively restored forests worldwide to answer: (1) To what extent do floral and faunal abundance and diversity and biogeochemical functions recover? (2) Does recovery vary as a function of past land use, time since restoration, forest region, or precipitation? (3) Does active restoration result in more complete or faster recovery than passive restoration? Overall, forests showed a high level of recovery, but the time to recovery depended on the metric type measured, past land use, and region. Abundance recovered quickly and completely, whereas diversity recovered slower in tropical than in temperate forests. Biogeochemical functions recovered more slowly after agriculture than after logging or mining. Formerly logged sites were mostly passively restored and generally recovered quickly. Mined sites were nearly always actively restored using a combination of planting and either soil amendments or recontouring topography, which resulted in rapid recovery of the metrics evaluated. Actively restoring former agricultural land, primarily by planting trees, did not result in consistently faster or more complete recovery than passively restored sites. Our results suggest that simply ending the land use is sufficient for forests to recover in many cases, but more studies are needed that directly compare the value added of active versus passive restoration strategies in the same system. Investments in active restoration should be evaluated relative to the past land use, the natural resilience of the system, and the specific objectives of each project.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Tropical Forest Recovery in an Agricultural Landscape
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).Reforestation of tropical landscapes that were cleared of trees is a goal that has important implications for conservation biology, for developing diverse local economies, and for carbon sequestration and climate change. A novel approach of planting tree islands as source points for restoration of tropical forest is being tested with a large-scale and long-term experiment built around 15 ~1 ha plots spread across 100 square km in Costa Rica. The relative importance to forest recovery of local factors (restoration strategy, tree cover) versus the nature of the landscape (nearby forest cover) is also being tested. Treatments, established from 2004-2006, include tree islands of three sizes that were either planted with trees or left to be colonized through natural dispersal. Results to date have provided key insights into patterns of bird foraging, seed rain, seed germination, and seedling growth. This award will maintain an experimental infrastructure that has attracted numerous project collaborators and support  ongoing and new monitoring of vegetation, seed dispersal, bats, and birds in restored and reference forests. Results of this study will inform tropical forest restoration efforts, which are critical to conserve biodiversity and ecosystem services, such as hydrological cycling and carbon sequestration. Additional broader impacts will include training of US and Latin American graduate and undergraduate students, as well as Costa Ricans of all educational levels. Results will be disseminated in English and Spanish to general and scientific audiences, through educational institutions, government agencies, and non-profit organizations.

TI  - Advances in pollination ecology from tropical plantation crops
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although ecologists traditionally focus on natural ecosystems, there is growing awareness that mixed landscapes of managed and unmanaged systems provide a research environment for understanding basic ecological relationships on a large scale. Here, we show how tropical agroforestry systems can be used to develop ideas about the mechanisms that influence species diversity and subsequent biotic interactions at different spatial scales. Our focus is on tropical plantation crops, mainly coffee and cacao, and their pollinators, which are of basic ecological interest as partners in an important mutualistic interaction. We review how insect-mediated pollination services depend on local agroforest and natural habitats in surrounding landscapes. Further, we evaluate the functional significance of pollinator diversity and the explanatory value of species traits, and we provide an intercontinental comparison of pollinator assemblages. We found that optimal pollination success might be best understood as a consequence of niche complementarities among pollinators in landscapes harboring various species. We further show that small cavity-nesting bees and small generalist beetles were especially affected by isolation from forest and that larger-bodied insects in the same landscapes were not similarly affected. We suggest that mixed tropical landscapes with agroforestry systems have great potential for future research on the interactions between plants and pollinators.

TI  - Climate benefits of Amazon secondary forests-recent advances and research needs
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Review
AB  - A quarter of the deforested Amazon has regrown as secondary tropical forest and yet the climatic importance of these complex regenerating landscapes is only beginning to be recognised. Advances in satellite remote-sensing have transformed our ability to detect and map changes in forest cover, while detailed ground-based measurements from permanent monitoring plots and eddy-covariance flux towers are providing new insights into the role of secondary forests in the climate system. This review summarises how progress in data availability on Amazonian secondary forests has led to better understanding of their influence on global, regional and local climate through carbon and non-carbon climate benefits. We discuss the climate implications of secondary forest disturbance and the progress in representing forest regrowth in climate models. Much remains to be learned about how secondary forests function and interact with climate, how these processes change with forest age, and the resilience of secondary forest ecosystems faced with increasing anthropogenic disturbance. Secondary forests face numerous threats: half of secondary forests in the Brazilian legal Amazon were 11 years old or younger in 2023. On average, 1%-2% of Amazon secondary forests burn each year, threatening the permanence of sequestered carbon. The forests that burn are predominantly young (in 2023, 55% of burned secondary forests were <6 years old, <4% were over 30 years old). In the context of legally binding international climate treaties and a rapidly changing political backdrop, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of encouraging tropical forest restoration to mitigate anthropogenic climate change. Amazon secondary forests could make a valuable contribution to Brazil's Nationally Determined Contribution provided there are robust systems in place to ensure permanence. We consider how to improve communication between scientists and decision-makers and identify pressing areas of future research.

TI  - Lianas always outperform tree seedlings regardless of soil nutrients: results from a long-term fertilization experiment
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lianas are a prominent growth form in tropical forests, and there is compelling evidence that they are increasing in abundance throughout the Neotropics. While recent evidence shows that soil resources limit tree growth even in deep shade, the degree to which soil resources limit lianas in forest understories, where they coexist with trees for decades, remains unknown. Regardless, the physiological underpinnings of soil resource limitation in deeply shaded tropical habitats remain largely unexplored for either trees or lianas. Theory predicts that lianas should be more limited by soil resources than trees because they occupy the quick-return end of the leaf economic spectrum, characterized by high rates of photosynthesis, high specific leaf area, short leaf life span, affinity to high-nutrient sites, and greater foliar nutrient concentrations. To address these issues, we asked whether soil resources (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium), alone or in combination, applied experimentally for more than a decade would cause significant changes in the morphology or physiology of tree and liana seedlings in a lowland tropical forest. We found evidence for the first time that phosphorus limits the photosynthetic performance of both trees and lianas in deeply shaded understory habitats. More importantly, lianas always showed significantly greater photosynthetic capacity, quenching, and saturating light levels compared to trees across all treatments. We found little evidence for nutrient x growth form interactions, indicating that lianas were not disproportionately favored in nutrient-rich habitats. Tree and liana seedlings differed markedly for six key morphological traits, demonstrating that architectural differences occurred very early in ontogeny prior to lianas finding a trellis (all seedlings were self-supporting). Overall, our results do not support nutrient loading as a mechanism of increasing liana abundance in the Neotropics. Rather, our finding that lianas always outperform trees, in terms of photosynthetic processes and under contrasting rates of resource supply of macronutrients, will allow lianas to increase in abundance if disturbance and tree turnover rates are increasing in Neotropical forests as has been suggested.

TI  - Factors influencing the expressed willingness to transition from collection to cultivation of non-timber forest products: The case of Caesalpinia spinosa in southern Ecuador
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Planting trees with additional non-timber products (NTFPs) (such as fruits) in agricultural lands is emerging as an important strategy in Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) to enhance the provision of ecosystem services and improve habitat quality. In many cases, the planting of NTFP trees follows a transition from collecting NTFPs in natural forests to integrating the respective trees into agricultural farms with ecological and socio-economic implications. Therefore, understanding the current practice and challenges of current NTFP collection and willingness for cultivation is crucial to effectively use such land-use trajectories for FLR. In this study, we investigate the case of Caesalpinia spinosa (tara), whose fruits provide an emerging NTFP in southern Ecuador. Using household data from 125 households currently collecting tara fruits, we first describe the relatively young production system and then use a Heckman two-step econometric model to identify the factors influencing the expressed willingness to cultivate tara trees on farms and the area to be cultivated. The econometric model results show that the characteristics of tara collection and trade (gender of collectors, distance to the collection site, and management practices) are important determinants of tara cultivation. However, it's the household labor availability and farm characteristics that play a significant role in impacting the willingness to cultivate. The area to be cultivated was mainly influenced by household labor and economic characteristics, and tara collection and trade (management practices) characteristics. Our findings help to understand NTFP-related landuse transitions, thus supporting the design of appropriate and specific policy interventions for the sustainable development of NTFPs.

C8  - 1
AB  - Here, we provide an overview of the use of light detection and ranging (lidar) for tropical ecosystem applications, with a particular focus on the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI). We summarize how data from GEDI measures vegetation vertical structure and give a step-by-step description of how to obtain spatially-subset GEDI Level 2A data from the NASA EarthData Search web portal. We then provide an example of how to characterize the structure of various vegetation classes in Ucayali, Peru. These vegetation classes include: (1) old-growth lowland forest, (2) young lowland vegetation regrowth (Purma), (3) secondary lowland forest, (4) mature oil palm plantations, and (5) cacao plantations (monocrop and agroforestry). We interpret the structural height metrics from GEDI among each of these vegetation classes, identifying edge effects as a possible influence on our results. To address this issue, we conducted a final analysis of the data with an area of 35m diameter footprint (25m of the original diameter area of the beam, and 10m as a conservative additional buffer) and excluded any observations that did not completely overlap with each land cover polygon. When we removed edge effects, no observations remained in the cacao data set and fewer observations remained in the forest stage data set. Nonetheless, the overall structural patterns shown in the relative heights of each forest stage remained very similar. We recommend that future projects utilizing spaceborne lidar for tropical ecosystems consider adopting the techniques and best practices we describe here, including refined noise filtering and explicit consideration of edge effects.

TI  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, MANAGEMENT, AND GOVERNANCE OF WORKING LANDS
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Summary Not Available. Objective(s): Landscapes provide ecologcial, economic, and social goods and services to human societies. Management practices can enhance or degrade the quality and quantity of goods and services provided by landscapes. Over the next 10 years and beyond, human populations are projected to continue to increase and to become more urban increasing demand for resources.  The core challenge is how to address the changes in human population dynamics in terms of balancing the production of goods and conservation of services, while also uncovering viable opportunities to move toward more sustainable resource management across the landscape. Past land use in Puerto Rico and the United States resulted in severely degraded landscapes as forests were cleared for agriculture, timber or fuelwood - activities that are still prolific in much of Latin America and the Caribbean. Today these lands are once again under pressure, this time for urban sprawl, demands for biomass fuel production, overuse for recreation, pollution, etc. Consequently, the competing needs of society for goods and servies from forested landscapes requires a new and expanded research emphasis that clearly identifies and differentiates the ecosystem goods and services that forests provide to city-centers, agricultural and suburban environs, and wilderness, but also considers the (resource dependent) sociological systems that have evolved in these areas. Approach:  Currently, most food and fiber comes from working lands: landscapes that lay between oceans and wilderness. Working lands account for approximately 96% of Puerto Rico's landscape, 80% of the US, and the vast majority of the tropics. In the recent past, these areas have been frequently managed for a single purpose, e.g. monocultures. Today, they include urban and urbanizing landscapes, secondary forests dominated by novel combinations of native and introduced species, community forests, and agricultural lands, among others. They are used for agroforestry purposes, biofuel production, recreation, water conversation, wildlife habitat, and the production of timber and non-timber forest products. Such forestry applications provide important opportunities for stewardship and sustainability that protect working lands but also require cutting edge research that is grounded in a socioecological framework, where natural processes and human dimensions and dynamics are interdependent. Such state-of-the-art research will produce useful findings that once shared with practitioners will protect working lands as well as the urban and rural populations and economies that rely on them. Element 3-1: Coupled human and ecological systems in urban environments. This element includes the following proposed research: The San Juan Urban Long Term Research Area and Urban forests and watersheds.Element 3-2: Ecological function and ecosystem services of working lands. This element includes the following proposed research: Novel forests and ecosystems; Use of agroforestry practices in watershed restoration; Biofuel crops in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands; Improve demographic modeling of big-leaf mahogany and Quantifying the ecosystem services of tropical forests.Element 3-3: Laws, Institutions and Governance. This element includes proposed research in: Legal frameworks: Develop knowledge of laws, regulations, fiscal instruments, and other legal elements intended to influence forested landscape conditions and human dimensions in the American tropics; Policy implementation and effectiveness: Develop knowledge of the means and mechanisms for implementing natural resource and forest policies and assessing their effectiveness in promoting the long-term sustainability of tropical forest landscapes and human societies and Governance: Improve our understanding of existing and emerging natural resource and forest governance approaches at local, domestic, and global levels in Latin America and the Caribbean and their capacity to advance the long-term sustainability of ecological, economic, and social values.

AB  - Summary Not Available. Objective(s): Landscapes provide ecologcial, economic, and social goods and services to human societies. Management practices can enhance or degrade the quality and quantity of goods and services provided by landscapes. Over the next 10 years and beyond, human populations are projected to continue to increase and to become more urban increasing demand for resources.  The core challenge is how to address the changes in human population dynamics in terms of balancing the production of goods and conservation of services, while also uncovering viable opportunities to move toward more sustainable resource management across the landscape. Past land use in Puerto Rico and the United States resulted in severely degraded landscapes as forests were cleared for agriculture, timber or fuelwood - activities that are still prolific in much of Latin America and the Caribbean. Today these lands are once again under pressure, this time for urban sprawl, demands for biomass fuel production, overuse for recreation, pollution, etc. Consequently, the competing needs of society for goods and servies from forested landscapes requires a new and expanded research emphasis that clearly identifies and differentiates the ecosystem goods and services that forests provide to city-centers, agricultural and suburban environs, and wilderness, but also considers the (resource dependent) sociological systems that have evolved in these areas. Approach:  Currently, most food and fiber comes from working lands: landscapes that lay between oceans and wilderness. Working lands account for approximately 96% of Puerto Rico's landscape, 80% of the US, and the vast majority of the tropics. In the recent past, these areas have been frequently managed for a single purpose, e.g. monocultures. Today, they include urban and urbanizing landscapes, secondary forests dominated by novel combinations of native and introduced species, community forests, and agricultural lands, among others. They are used for agroforestry purposes, biofuel production, recreation, water conversation, wildlife habitat, and the production of timber and non-timber forest products. Such forestry applications provide important opportunities for stewardship and sustainability that protect working lands but also require cutting edge research that is grounded in a socioecological framework, where natural processes and human dimensions and dynamics are interdependent. Such state-of-the-art research will produce useful findings that once shared with practitioners will protect working lands as well as the urban and rural populations and economies that rely on them. Element 3-1: Coupled human and ecological systems in urban environments. This element includes the following proposed research: The San Juan Urban Long Term Research Area and Urban forests and watersheds.Element 3-2: Ecological function and ecosystem services of working lands. This element includes the following proposed research: Novel forests and ecosystems; Use of agroforestry practices in watershed restoration; Biofuel crops in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands; Improve demographic modeling of big-leaf mahogany and Quantifying the ecosystem services of tropical forests.Element 3-3: Laws, Institutions and Governance. This element includes proposed research in: Legal frameworks: Develop knowledge of laws, regulations, fiscal instruments, and other legal elements intended to influence forested landscape conditions and human dimensions in the American tropics; Policy implementation and effectiveness: Develop knowledge of the means and mechanisms for implementing natural resource and forest policies and assessing their effectiveness in promoting the long-term sustainability of tropical forest landscapes and human societies and Governance: Improve our understanding of existing and emerging natural resource and forest governance approaches at local, domestic, and global levels in Latin America and the Caribbean and their capacity to advance the long-term sustainability of ecological, economic, and social values.

TI  - Tree Diversity Increases Carbon Stocks and Fluxes Above-But Not Belowground in a Tropical Forest Experiment
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - International commitments advocate large-scale forest restoration as a nature-based solution to climate change mitigation through carbon (C) sequestration. Mounting evidence suggests that mixed compared to monospecific planted forests may sequester more C, exhibit lower susceptibility to climate extremes and offer a broader range of ecosystem services. However, experimental studies comprehensively examining the control of tree diversity on multiple C stocks and fluxes above- and belowground are lacking. To address this gap, we leverage data from the Sardinilla experiment in Panama, the oldest tropical tree diversity experiment, which features a gradient of one-, two-, three- and five-species mixtures of native tree species. Over 16 years, we measured multiple above- and belowground C stocks and fluxes, ranging from tree aboveground C, over leaf litter C production, to soil organic carbon (SOC). We show that tree diversity significantly increased aboveground C stocks and fluxes, with a 57% higher gain in aboveground tree C in five-species mixtures compared to monocultures (35.7 +/- 1.8 vs. 22.8 +/- 3.4 Mg C ha(-1)) 16 years after planting. In contrast, we observed a net reduction in SOC (on average -11.2 +/- 1.1 Mg C ha(-1) across diversity levels) and no significant difference in SOC3 stocks (the predominantly tree-derived, i.e., C-3 plant-derived SOC fraction) between five-species mixtures and monocultures (13.0 +/- 0.9 vs. 15.1 +/- 1.3 Mg C ha(-1)). Positive tree diversity effects persisted despite repeated climate extremes and strengthened over time for aboveground tree growth. Structural equation models showed that higher tree growth in mixtures enhanced leaf litter and coarse woody debris C fluxes to the soil, resulting in a tightly linked C cycle aboveground. However, we did not observe significant links between above- and belowground C stocks and fluxes. Our study elucidates the mechanisms through which higher tree diversity bolsters the climate mitigation potential of tropical forest restoration. Restoration schemes should prioritize mixed over monospecific planted forests.

TI  - Approaches to classifying and restoring degraded tropical forests for the anticipated REDD plus climate change mitigation mechanism
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Inclusion of improved forest management as a way to enhance carbon sinks in the Copenhagen Accord of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (December 2009) suggests that forest restoration will play a role in global climate change mitigation under the post-Kyoto agreement. Although discussions about restoration strategies often pertain solely to severely degraded tropical forests and invoke only the enrichment planting option, different approaches to restoration are needed to counter the full range of degrees of degradation. We propose approaches for restoration of forests that range from being slightly to severely degraded. Our methods start with ceasing the causes of degradation and letting forests regenerate on their own, progress through active management of natural regeneration in degraded areas to accelerate tree regeneration and growth, and finally include the stage of degradation at which re-planting is necessary. We argue that when the appropriate techniques are employed, forest restoration is cost-effective relative to conventional planting, provides abundant social and ecological co-benefits, and results in the sequestration of substantial amounts of carbon. For forest restoration efforts to succeed, a supportive post-Kyoto agreement is needed as well as appropriate national policies, institutional arrangements, and local participation.

TI  - Forest Attribute Dynamics in Secondary Forests: Insights for Advancing Ecological Restoration and Transformative Territorial Management in the Amazon
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon ecosystem plays a vital role in global climate regulation and biodiversity conservation but faces escalating threats from deforestation and degradation. The resulting secondary forests (SFs) provide a promising opportunity for Transformative Territorial Management, fostering restoration and enhancing conservation values. This study evaluated aboveground biomass (AGB), species diversity, forest structure, and soil properties in SFs of the Colombian Amazon along a chronosequence, from early to mature successional stages, in landscapes of mountains and of hills to identify key indicators for effective restoration management. The results show a consistent increase in AGB, species diversity, forest structure, and soil quality with forest age, though recovery patterns varied between both landscapes evaluated. Topographic differences influenced successional dynamics, with mountainous landscapes showing faster early recovery compared to the steadier, linear growth observed in hill areas. In hills, AGB at 10 years reached 12.65% of the biomass expected in a mature forest, increasing to nearly 42% by 40 years of abandonment, at a rate of 0.708 Mg C ha-1 year-1. In contrast, in the mountain landscape, AGB at 10 years reached approximately 8.35% of the carbon in a mature forest and increased to nearly 63.55% at 40 years. Forest age and soil properties emerged as primary drivers of AGB recovery, while diversity and forest structure played indirect but significant roles. In hill areas, soil conservation practices are critical for maintaining steady growth, whereas mountain regions benefit from assisted natural regeneration (ANR) to accelerate recovery. These findings highlight the importance of prioritizing the management of SFs as a central strategy for achieving restoration goals. Such practices are essential to enhance the ecological resilience of SFs and ensure their long-term sustainability, fostering their role as key contributors to restoration efforts and the provision of ecosystem services.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - While Borneo is a global biodiversity hotspot, its species-rich natural rainforests have been degraded and deforested in the past few decades by unsustainable shifting agriculture, commercial logging and the rapid development of industrial tree and oil palm plantations. Populations of some wildlife species have decreased drastically due to landscape changes, while other species may be adapting to the new mosaic landscape. To understand the current condition of biodiversity distribution in a heterogeneous landscape, it is necessary to develop a sustainable plan for various land uses in order to maintain the rich biodiversity and preserve ecosystem services for local communities. Camera trap surveys for medium- to large-sized ground-dwelling mammals and terrestrial birds were conducted in lowland areas of Sarawak that were under different management regimes: logging concessions, land used for shifting agriculture and oil palm plantations. Using the mean trapping rate as an abundance index, the wildlife population in logging concessions seems to have recovered 4 years after harvesting. The composition of endangered or medium-sized species in secondary forests around villages in lowland areas is low, but this habitat still remains favourable for major game species for local communities.

TI  - Chaco region: Forest loss and fragmentation in the context of the territorial planning law. Remote sensing assessment in Formosa, Argentina application case
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural expansion is the primary cause of forest loss and fragmentation. It threatens the conservation of its biodiversity as well as the capability to provide ecosystem services. Land-use policies, such as zonation programs, have been traditionally used as a tool for promoting a sustainable natural resource management; however, we still lack standardized methodologies that can be applied world-widely to achieve this purpose. In the current context of rampant deforestation over the tropical forests, there is an urgent need of identifying policies that steer agricultural land-use change into a reduced pressure on forests. This study focuses on the outcomes of the first territorial planning law in the Province of Formosa (Argentina) located within the Chaco region, one of the world's deforestation hotspots. The research questions were: a) How did agriculture expand in Formosa before, during and after the enactment of the territorial planning law? b) Did the introduction of the law affect the spatial distribution of land-use change?; and c) How did the sanction of the law affect forest loss and forest fragmentation? Landsat imagery was used to map land-use change, and to calculate the cover loss and cover loss rate considering the zoning and physiognomic classification of the law. The forest fragmentation was evaluated in terms of forest loss spatial configuration, classified as perforation or shrinkage, forest edge generation, patch size distribution, and patch isolation. The territorial planning law effect over agricultural expansion was tested using a difference in difference model. After the law was passed, a reduced land-use pressure was observed for the forest within the conservation designated zone; however, the forest presented the highest cover loss rates among the physiognomic categories of the law. Land-use change within the conservation designated zone was predominantly made according to a perforation spatial configuration, which promoted the forest edge generation. The isolation between forest patches decreased and its size distribution changed towards a less large-patch-centered pattern, indicating that Formosa is experiencing an early fragmentation process. Overall, the territorial planning law in Formosa succeeded in the relief of land-use pressure on forest, but highlighted the need of incorporating spatial configuration guidelines for long-term forest conservation. The case of Formosa case could be useful in the design of future sustainable natural resource management policies and implies the importance of early natural resource planning.

T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 6th f-7 Workshop
CL  - MEXICO CITY, MEXICO
AB  - How land-use change and forestry sector options can be used to mitigate global warming will depend on a variety of pending decisions regarding interpretation of the Kyoto Protocol, including treatment of uncertainty. In tropical forest countries, the allocation of effort between plantation silviculture and reduction of deforestation would be influenced by the stringency of requirements regarding certainly. Slowing deforestation offers much greater potential benefits, but the certainty associated with these is much lower than in the case of plantations. In the Brazilian case, deforestation avoidance could produce carbon benefits worth 6-45 times as much as the destructive ranching and logging uses to which the forest is now being converted. Capturing the potential value of carbon benefits from avoided deforestation will depend on increasing our understanding of the deforestation process and consequent ability to reduce the uncertainty associated with the effects of deforestation-avoidance measures. It will also depend on whether carbon credits are defined in terms of a. maximum level of uncertainty. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Unmasking secondary vegetation dynamics in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary vegetation (SV) from land abandonment is a common transition phase between agricultural uses following tropical deforestation. The impact of SV on carbon sequestration and habitat fragmentation across tropical forest frontiers therefore depends on SV dynamics and demographics. Here, we used time series of annual MapBiomas land cover data to generate the first estimates of SV extent, age, and net carbon uptake in the Brazilian Amazon between 1985 and 2017. SV increased over time, totaling 12 Mha in 2017, 44% of which was <= 5 years old. Between 1988 and 2017, 19.6 Mha of SV was cleared, adding 45.5% to the area of primary deforestation detected by the Brazilian monitoring system (PRODES). Rates of SV loss have exceeded PRODES deforestation since 2011. Based on the age and extent of gains and losses, SV was a small net carbon sink during this period (8.9 Tg C yr(-1)). As SV is not formally protected by national environmental legislation or monitored by PRODES, long-term benefits from SV in the Brazilian Amazon remain uncertain.

TI  - Is Planting Trees Enough? The Effect of Different Types of Reforestation on the Offspring of Trypoxylon (Trypargilum) lactitarse (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) in the Southern Amazon
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The deforestation has led to local loss of species and important ecosystem services performed by them, causing ecological and economic losses. It is proposed that the reforestation of such areas aims to reduce those impacts. However, particularly in the tropics, little is known about the real success of different types of reforestation in the recovery of the species, and especially of the population parameters. Here we evaluated whether different types of reforestations affect Trypoxylon (Trypargilum) lactitarse Saussure (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) in terms of abundance, percentage of emergence, proportion of males, fluctuating asymmetry, and foraging capacity. We compared primary forest (control) data to data collected in five different habitats: pasture, secondary forest, and tree plantations of Teak, Ficus, and a mixture of native species. The abundance of T. lactitarse was higher in tree plantations than in pasture. However, among the analyzed parameters, Teak plantation presented lower emergence percentage and the majority of individuals born were males. The emerged females in this habitat showed higher asymmetry and lower foraging capacity. Ficus showed lower individual abundance and mixed plantation showed lower emergence percentage, with both plantation types showing higher male emergence. On the other hand, in secondary forest, the analyzed parameters did not differ in relation to the primary forest, being the habitat more efficient in relation to those with tree planting. The changes in population parameters of T. lactitarse in different reforestations and particularly on Teak monocultures were probably attributed to indirect effects, such as low food availability and inadequate environmental conditions.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Tropical Forest Recovery in an Agricultural Landscape
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - This research will answer theoretical and applied questions about ecosystem recovery across broad temporal and spatial scales, specifically focusing on the recovery of tropical montane rain forest in southern Costa Rica.  The research is the first stage in a long-term study testing a novel restoration approach, planting islands of trees to serve as nuclei for recovery, and evaluating the importance of proximity to existing rain forest patches for recovery.  To address these questions 12 replicate blocks of three 0.25-ha plots will be established in abandoned agricultural lands over a 100 km2 area in southern Costa Rica. Plots will receive one of three treatments: (1) control - no planting, (2) planting the plot with native tree "nuclei" of three sizes, and (3) planting the entire plot with native tree species. These blocks will be split between areas surrounded by "low" and "high" forest cover. We will monitor tree seedling establishment of forest species in these plots, as well as in six remnant forest plots. In the third year, seed rain, microclimatic conditions, soil water potential, soil phosphorus, and seed/seedling herbivory will be measured in selected plots to evaluate alternative mechanisms underlying patterns of seedling establishment. This research constitutes an innovative collaborative research effort between scientists and farmers interested in integrating agricultural production and biological conservation, and consequently will yield ecological, social, and educational benefits. The results of this work will help improve tropical forest restoration efforts both locally and regionally, which has important consequences for conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services.

TI  - Forest Resources Assessment of 2015 shows positive global trends but forest loss and degradation persist in poor tropical countries
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015 shows that deforestation has slowed and afforestation has increased globally during 1990-2015. Planted forests have increasingly provided goods and services hitherto derived from natural forests, and mosaic forests in agricultural landscapes are increasing. Forest gain is occurring at higher latitudes and in richer countries whilst forest loss continues in poor countries in the tropics. Some middle income tropical countries are now also transitioning to forest gain. These transition countries are characterised by reforms to forest management and improvements in agricultural practices but also by significant expansions of planted forest, which account for similar to 25-100% of gains. Forest-area estimates of the FRA align with satellite-derived estimates, with deviations of <=+/- 7% globally and <=+/- 17% for the tropics. Mosaics comprised of trees outside forests, remnant forest patches, and young regenerating forests constitute a modest proportion of the tropical forest estate and are seemingly well inventoried by the FRA. Extensive areas of forest experienced partial canopy cover reduction since 2000, particularly in the tropics where their area is similar to 6.5 times that deforested since 1990. The likelihood of the eventual loss of these forests and a decline in their capacity to provide goods and services is a matter of concern. Demand for industrial wood and fuelwood increased 35% in the tropics since 1990, principally in poorer countries, and growth in demand will accelerate into the future, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Notwithstanding significant increases in forests within protected areas since 1990 to 517 Mha (16.3%) globally and 379 Mha (26.6%) in the tropics, increasing demands for ecological services, forest products, and climate change mitigation is likely to be met from an expanding area of planted forests more than from the declining area of natural forests, particularly in Africa. The global rate of planted-forest expansion since 1990 is close to a target rate of 2.4% per annum necessary to replace wood supplied from natural forests in the medium term, though the expansion rate has declined to 1.5% since 2005. Multiple-use forests permitting both production and conservation account for 26% of the global forest area and 17% of the tropical forest area, and have increased by 81.8 Mha or 8.5% globally since 1990, with most gains in the tropics. Sustainable forest management in low-income and tropical countries remains modest, with only 37% low-income country forests covered by forest inventories. International support has proven effective at increasing this coverage since 2010. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license.

TI  - Soil carbon stocks in stable tropical landforms are dominated by geochemical controls and not by land use
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics depend on soil properties derived from the geoclimatic conditions under which soils develop and are in many cases modified by land conversion. However, SOC stabilization and the responses of SOC to land use change are not well constrained in deeply weathered tropical soils, which are dominated by less reactive minerals than those in temperate regions. Along a gradient of geochemically distinct soil parent materials, we investigated differences in SOC stocks and SOC ( delta C-14) turnover time across soil profile depth between montane tropical forest and cropland situated on flat, non-erosive plateau landforms. We show that SOC stocks and soil delta C-14 patterns do not differ significantly with land use, but that differences in SOC can be explained by the physicochemical properties of soils. More specifically, labile organo-mineral associations in combination with exchangeable base cations were identified as the dominating controls over soil C stocks and turnover. We argue that due to their long weathering history, the investigated tropical soils do not provide enough reactive minerals for the stabilization of C input in either high input (tropical forest) or low-input (cropland) systems. Since these soils exceeded their maximum potential for the mineral related stabilization of SOC, potential positive effects of reforestation on tropical SOC storage are most likely limited to minor differences in topsoil without major impacts on subsoil C stocks. Hence, in deeply weathered soils, increasing C inputs may lead to the accumulation of a larger readily available SOC pool, but does not contribute to long-term SOC stabilization.

TI  - Forest Landscape Restoration and Local Stakeholders: A Global Bibliometric Mapping Analysis
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest landscape restoration (FLR) has a central place in current global debates about the sustainability of natural resources, climate change mitigation and adaptation, livelihoods and biodiversity conservation. FLR approaches support the involvement of different social actors in participatory decision-making processes. We conducted a bibliometric analysis research to provide an overview of scientific publications in forest restoration, FLR and local stakeholders (LS) studies, and, specifically, examine if the studies (1) recognised the relevance of the local level actors and (2) collected primary and/or secondary data on LS using different methods from related publications since 2000. We used the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus as bibliographic sources. We analysed five main research aspects: (1) publication year, (2) most productive countries according to the total number of publications, (3) most influential journals and cited papers, (4) most influential authors ranked by number of publications, their respective organisations and country collaborations, and (5) a co-occurrence analysis of countries' collaborations and keywords. We found that forest restoration, FLR and LS studies have been growing over the years, especially in the last decade. However, only 50% (99 records) of the studies recognised the relevance of the local level actors and also collected primary and/or secondary data through different methods. Authors from organisations in North and South America, and Oceania were the ones with the most publications, with only 20% (4 authors) of the top 20 authors having degrees in social sciences. Studies about "ecosystem services", "ecological restoration", "natural regeneration", "livelihoods", "Bonn challenge" and "governance" have become the main subject of research along the years within the scope of FLR at the local level. Finally, the results showed the gaps that should be considered in future research to improve the involvement and more direct participation of LS, as well as the participation of interdisciplinary and social science researchers in FLR research teams.

TI  - Interactive effects between vegetation structure and soil fertility on tropical ground-dwelling arthropod assemblages
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of forests undergoing restoration determines the structure of the vegetation, influencing ground-dwelling arthropod composition. Soil fertility can interact with vegetation structure, influencing the diversity and composition of arthropod assemblages through bottom-up effects on developing forests. We evaluated if soil fertility (here defined by the attributes directly related to macronutrient availability) and the vegetation structure in three adjacent areas from different land-use/cover categories (abandoned pasture, riparian forest undergoing restoration, and remnant riparian forest) influences ground-dwelling arthropod assemblages. These areas were subject to a gradient of soil fertility due to the presence of a corral that resulted in a local increase of soil nutrients in the three areas, enabling to evaluate the interaction between soil fertility and vegetation structure. We hypothesized that ground-dwelling arthropod assemblages have lower diversity in pasture, intermediate in forest undergoing restoration and higher diversity in the remnant forest. Furthermore, we expected that increasing soil fertility would have a positive effect in these assemblages through bottom-up effects. Environmental conditions were characterized by vegetation structure and soil chemical attributes variables, whereas arthropods were sampled with pitfalls and identified to morphospecies. Diversity indicators responded differentially to the studied effects. Abundances decreased with soil fertility, and were higher in the forest undergoing restoration, followed by pasture and remnant forest. Species richness also varied among categories, following the same pattern as abundances. On the other hand, diversity indices indicated an interaction between soil fertility and land use category, with larger effects of soil fertility on diversity in the more simplified habitats (pasture and forest undergoing restoration), whereas no bottom-up effects were recorded in the remnant forest; species evenness increased with soil fertility in all studied areas. A redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that both vegetation structure and soil attributes significantly influenced arthropod composition. Arthropod assemblages in areas undergoing restoration with higher soil fertility and low grass cover were more similar to assemblages in remnant forest when compared to areas with low soil fertility, independently of the vegetation structure, indicating an interaction between these two effects. Therefore, ground-dwelling arthropod assemblages responded both to increasing vegetation complexity resulting from the different land use/cover categories, and to increasing soil fertility, so that they are effective indicators to evaluate the recovery of ecosystems in forest restoration projects and to determine the importance of soil fertility in this process.

TI  - Accounting for local temperature effect substantially alters afforestation patterns
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Human intervention in forested ecosystems is hoped to perform a fundamental shift within the next decade by reverting current forest loss-a major source of CO2 emissions-to net forest gain taking up carbon and thus aiding climate change mitigation. The demanded extensive establishment of forests will change the local surface energy fluxes, and with it the local climate, in addition to competing with food and fiber production for land and water. Scenario building models encompass this competition for resources but have turned a blind eye to the biogeophysical (BGP) local surface energy flux disturbance so far. We combine the benefit of CO2 sequestration of afforestation/reforestation (A/R) with the additional incentive or penalty of local BGP induced cooling or warming by translating the local BGP induced temperature change to a CO2 equivalent. We then include this new aspect in the land-use model Model for Agricultural Production and their Impact on the Environment (MAgPIE) via modifying the application of the price on greenhouse gases (GHGs). This enables us to use MAgPIE to produce A/R scenarios that are optimized for both their potential CO2 sequestration and the CO2 equivalent local BGP effect, as well as the socio-economic trade-offs of A/R. Here we show that optimal A/R patterns are substantially altered by taking the local BGP effects into account. Considering local cooling benefits of establishing forests triples (+203.4%) the viable global A/R area in 2100 from 116 to 351 Mha under the conditions of the shared socioeconomic pathway 2 (SSP2) scenario driven by the same GHG price. Three quarters (76.0%, +179 Mha) of the additionally forested area is established in tropical climates alone. Therefore, a further neglect of BGP effects in scenario building models undervalues the benefit of tropical forests while simultaneously running the risk of proposing counterproductive measures at high latitudes. However, the induced focus on tropical forestation intensifies the competition with food production where forests contribute most to mitigation. A/R related trade-offs need to be considered alongside their climate benefit to inhibit unintentional harm of mitigation efforts.

TI  - Cacao agroforestry systems have higher return on labor compared to full-sun monocultures
T2  - AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The global demand for cacao has recently increased. To meet this demand, the cultivated area has been expanded in tropical forest areas and production has intensified by replacing traditional agroforestry systems with mono-cultures. This has led to a loss of biodiversity in cacao-growing areas. More sustainable production systems such as agroforestry and organic managed systems are expected to yield less cacao, but by-crops and premium prices, respectively, might economically compensate for the lower yields. Here, we compared the productivity and the return on labor, that is the return per working day, of four different cacao production systems: agroforestry and monocultures under organic and conventional management. Cacao and by-crop yields, costs, revenues, and labor were registered during the first 5 years after establishment. Results show that cacao yields were, on average, 41% higher in monocultures, but the revenues derived from agroforestry by-crops economically overcompensated for this difference. Indeed, the return on labor across the years was roughly twice as high in the agroforestry systems compared to the monocultures. We found similar cacao yields and return on labor in conventional and organically managed agroforestry systems. However, in the monocultures, cacao yields were 48% lower under organic compared with conventional farming, but the return on labor was similar, mainly due to the higher costs associated to the conventional management. Overall, our findings show that cacao agroforestry systems have higher return on labor.

TI  - Scenario-modelling for the sustainable management of non-timber forest products in tropical ecosystems
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data set
AB  - Abstract Ecosystems degradation, and consequently biodiversity loss, has severe impacts on people around the world. The Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is one of the international initiatives that have emerged to inform policy makers and aid decisions to prevent further global biodiversity loss, focusing on the interdependence between natural systems and human culture. IPBES promotes the use of scenarios and modelling approaches as a fundamental tool to advance the understanding of the relationships between drivers of change, Natures Contributions to People (NCP), and social systems. Local-scale case studies with a system approach demonstrating how current knowledge can be used to inform decision-making are still scarce. Here, we present a comprehensive conceptual model and a series of four scenarios under different policies for shea tree species management, as a case-study of applying systems thinking and the NCP concept to a local-scale socio-ecological system. We first characterized the central processes, NCP, drivers and pressures affecting the shea tree system, to investigate the impacts of the multiple uses of the shea tree species on the system as a whole. We then described potential policy options, developed four scenarios, and evaluated them by a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN). We predicted qualitative outcomes of the proposed scenarios: Business-as-usual (BAU), "Conservation and fair trade", "Agroforestry and fair trade" and "Industrial development". We found that the scenarios focussing on conservation, fair trade and agroforestry, can improve the conservation status of shea trees, and enhance wellbeing in the local communities. In this case study, we demonstrate that the development of a comprehensive conceptual model at a local scale can be a useful exercise to identify opportunities for effective policy strategies and social innovation. The shea tree case study can provide an example for modelling non-timber forest products in other regions around the world that face similar drivers and pressures. Species for which this model could be adapted include Central and South American species such as the Brazilian nut (Bertholletia excelsa), cocoa (Theobroma cacao), andiroba (Carapa guianensis), acai (Euterpe oleracea) and the wax palm (Ceroxylon quindiuense). The model and workflow applied here may thus be used to understand similar socio-ecological systems with local and international economic value across the Neotropical region. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, human activities have impacted biodiversity-rich forest in western Rwanda, creating a need to enhance restoration activities of degraded lands in the region. To evaluate the effects of reforestation activities on the community composition of soil-litter ants, research was conducted in Gishwati tropical montane forest, located in northern-western part of Rwanda. The ant fauna was studied in reforested lands dominated by regenerated native species and exotic tree species. Further, a primary forest made of native trees served as a reference. In each forest type, nine sampling points were used to sample ants. Ant specimens were collected using pitfalls, hand sampling and Winkler extractor. They were identified to subfamilies, genus and species levels using dichotomous keys, and also statistically analysed for species richness, diversity, evenness and community composition. We collected a total of 2,481 individuals from 5 subfamilies, 18 genera and 35 species. Higher abundance, diversity and species richness were found in soil-litter under natural primary and secondary forests dominated by regenerated native plant species compared to exotic tree forest. The ant community composition analysis indicated higher similarities in ant species sampled under primary native forest and secondary forest dominated by regenerated native species. Reforestation by regenerating native species may be given priority in restoration of degraded lands due to their importance in species richness and species diversity.

TI  - Long-term effect of selective logging on floristic composition: A 25 year experiment in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Selective logging is one of the most prominent land uses in tropical forests and although it involves harvesting a limited number of trees, the impact on forest structure, composition and aboveground biomass can be significant. Although these impacts are well documented, what is little known is the extent to which selective logging affects tree floristic composition and its recovery process. Understanding how floristic composition is affected by logging activities is essential for determining subsequent cutting cycles, for the maintenance of carbon stocks and for biodiversity conservation. This research investigates the effect of logging on long-term trends on the recovery of species composition in a tropical forest using a unique logging experiment where measurements have been taken annually over a period of 25 years. Changes in 12 long-term 1-hectare (ha) permanent plots were assessed where different selective logging intensities occurred. In the first years after logging, floristic composition differed widely between intact and selectively logged forests, with exploited areas deviating from pre-logged composition. Over time, exploited areas shifted towards the original composition, with more pronounced changes in this trend after similar to 13 years. Shifts in floristic composition were caused mainly by a significant increase in light-demanding fast-growing pioneer species and their subsequent continuous high mortality rates after 13 years of the recovery process. In contrast, the control plots showed similar shifts in composition over time, suggesting external factors such as long-term climate changes may be driving these shifts. The results suggest that 25 years after an experimental selective logging has taken place, floristic composition tends to recover closer to the pre-logged status. Thus, in the absence of further human disturbances, experimental selectively logged forests in low to moderate intensities are compatible with biodiversity conservation, at least during the first cycle of exploitation. Reconciling conservation strategies with the recovery of stocks of commercial timber species would be greatly improved by using these results and lead towards more sustainable forest management plans.

TI  - Qui bono? Justice in the Distribution of the Benefits and Burdens of Avoided Deforestation
T2  - RES PUBLICA-A JOURNAL OF MORAL LEGAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, I explore the question of how the costs of undertaking an important type of climate change mitigation should be shared amongst states seeking an environmentally effective and equitable response to global climate change. While much of the normative literature on climate mitigation has focused on burden sharing within the context of reductions in emissions of greenhouse gas, I explore the question of how the costs of protecting tropical forests in order to harness their climate mitigation potential should be distributed amongst developing and developed states. In response to this question, I outline and defend a 'beneficiary pays' account of forestry mitigation burden sharing that requires affluent states to finance measures supporting avoided deforestation while less affluent states, within whose territory these forests tend to be located, implement these measures. The normative basis for this account, I argue, is a principle of 'unjust enrichment' according to which developed states must bear much of the cost of avoided deforestation for its climate mitigation potential because of the huge economic benefits their citizens have accumulated from productive activities that have contributed to climate change.

TI  - Multifunctional Forest Restoration in Brazil: A Critical Analysis of the Trends and Knowledge Gaps in the Scientific Literature
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The global demand for forest products will increase in the coming decades due to population growth and increasing environmental awareness. Therefore, the production of forest products through multifunctional forest restoration could be a meaningful opportunity for large-scale restoration while promoting sustainability and vegetation recovery. We conducted a comprehensive literature review to explore how forest restoration in Brazil can meet the growing global demand for forest products, thereby promoting the widespread adoption of restoration practices. The number of forest restoration publications addressing forest product supply has increased, but remains limited. Notably, only studies on payments for environmental services have increased significantly over the years, while studies on non-timber forest products and timber have not increased significantly. Similar patterns and trends were found in earlier studies. Many studies do not provide insights into the socioeconomic outcomes of multifunctional forest restoration, which is consistent with other research findings. The studies cited 108 native species of commercial value. According to the literature, these species can provide multiple forest products, making their management economically attractive. Multifunctional restoration in Brazil has the potential for meeting global demand for forest products and supporting large-scale restoration. However, advancing scientific and technological knowledge in this area is needed to make this feasible.

TI  - Forest cover maps of China in 2010 from multiple approaches and data sources: PALSAR, Landsat, MODIS, FRA, and NFI
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests and their changes are important to the regional and global carbon cycle, biodiversity and ecosystem services. Some uncertainty about forest cover area in China calls for an accurate and updated forest cover map. In this study, we combined ALOS PALSAR orthorectified 50-m mosaic images (FED mode with HH and HV polarization) and MODIS time series data in 2010 to map forests in China. We used MODIS-based NDVI dataset (MOD13Q1, 250-m spatial resolution) to generate a map of annual maximum NDVI and used it to mask out built-up lands, barren lands, and sparsely vegetated lands. We developed a decision tree classification algorithm to identify forest and non-forest land cover, based on the signature analysis of PALSAR backscatter coefficient data. The PALSAR-based algorithm was then applied to produce a forest cover map in China in 2010. The resulting forest/non-forest classification map has an overall accuracy of 96.2% and a Kappa Coefficient of 0.91. The resultant 50-m PALSAR-based forest cover map was compared to five forest cover databases. The total forest area (2.02 x 10(6) km(2)) in China from the PALSAR-based forest map is close to the forest area estimates from China National Forestry Inventory (1.95 x 10(6) km(2)), JAXA (2.00 x 10(6) km(2)), and FAO FRA (2.07 x 10(6) km(2)). There are good linear relationships between the PALSAR-based forest map and the forest maps from the JAXA, MCD12Q1, and NLCD-China datasets at the province and county scales. All the forest maps have similar spatial distributions of forest/non-forest at pixel scale. Our PALSAR-based forest map recognizes well the agro-forests in China. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of integrating PALSAR and MODIS images to map forests in large areas. The resultant map of forest cover in China in 2010 can be used for many studies such as forest carbon cycle and ecological restoration.

TI  - Sustainability issues in a tropical mega trail
T2  - ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainability is a target that involves many socio-ecological questions, depends on opportunities and combines different initiatives. This can be especially difficult in regions with high biodiversity scores, mega cities, high level of human populations and an intense and long-standing land use. Here, we show how a mega trail, named Atlantic Forest Trail, within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest can join the protection of biodiversity and sustainable tourism through a 4270 km corridor connecting protected areas and crossing a variety of landscapes. Further, we show some initiatives of ongoing biodiversity monitoring, and an analysis of ecological restoration in private lands that can be applied in many regions to improve habitat connectivity for both biodiversity and human use.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of past and future tropical forest transition and its dynamic to streamflow of the catchment, Malaysia
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The consequences of human interventions on land use have been empirically demonstrated to affect substantially hydrological processes and ecosystem services within watershed environments. Since 1970, Malaysia has faced deforestation, driven mainly by logging and agricultural expansion, aligning with its developmental goals by 2020. From 1970 to 2000, deforestation led to a 25.5% decline in forested land, causing a significant 10.2% rise in excess runoff. Moreover from 2001 to 2021, the nation lost 17% of its total land to deforestation. These trends emphasize the need for a thorough investigation of sustainable conservation efforts in Malaysia. This study focuses on the Langat basin in Malaysia, evaluating past and future land use changes and their effects on the basin's hydrological response. The study employed key informant reports, population growth data, observed land use change, field survey and agricultural land availability considered for developing change scenarios. We emphasized the significance of integrating diverse modeling methods to analyze LULC changes effectively. The use of a semi -distributed hydrological model, SWAT, in combination with Markov chain and Multi -Layer Perceptron (MLP) model and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques proved to be an integrated and suitable tool for comprehensive change analysis and modeling of land use. Markov chain modeling is valuable for predicting land use changes over time, providing input scenarios for SWAT simulations. MLP is a powerful algorithm to capture non-linear relationships and complex patterns in the data, enhancing the modeling accuracy. The simulation results, based on historic land use data (1984-2006-2010) and projected future land use maps (2030-2050-2080), revealed a consistent pattern of urban expansion and deforestation leading to increased streamflow. Projections indicated a substantial rise in streamflow by 20%, 61%, and 71% for the 2030s, 2050s, and 2080s, respectively. To mitigate potential flood and sediment loss, it is crucial to involve local stakeholders such as local communities, government bodies, environmental organizations, and businesses. Such analysis facilitates understanding their perspectives and concerns regarding afforestation and urban expansion control, informing future development programs and land use planning effectively.

TI  - Aboveground Forest Carbon Dynamics in Papua New Guinea: Isolating the Influence of Selective-Harvesting and El Nino
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of forest carbon (C) stock and sequestration and the influence of forest harvesting and climatic variations are important issues in global forest ecology. Quantitative studies of the C balance of tropical forests, such as those in Papua New Guinea (PNG), are also required for forest-based climate change mitigation initiatives. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) of aboveground forest C stock and sequestration in primary, selectively harvested, and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-effected lowland tropical forest from 15 years of Permanent Sample Plot (PSP) census data for PNG consisting of 121 plots in selectively harvested forest, and 35 plots in primary forest. Model parameters indicated: C stock in aboveground live biomass (AGLB) of 137 +/- 9 (95% confidence interval (CI)) MgC ha(-1) in primary forest, compared with 62 +/- 18 MgC ha(-1) for selectively harvested forest (55% difference); C sequestration in primary forest of 0.23 +/- 1.70 MgC ha(-1) y(-1), which was lower than in selectively harvested forest, 1.12 +/- 3.41 MgC ha(-1) y(-1); ENSO-induced fire resulted in significant C emissions (-6.87 +/- 3.94 MgC ha(-1) y(-1)). High variability between PSPs in C stock and C sequestration rates necessitated random plot effects for both stock and sequestration. The HBM approach allowed inclusion of hierarchical autocorrelation, providing valid CIs on model parameters and efficient estimation. The HBM model has provided quantitative insights on the C balance of PNG's forests that can be used as inputs for climate change mitigation initiatives.

TI  - Community forest monitoring in REDD+: the 'M' in MRV?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Transparent, accountable, and sustainable monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) systems are essential for any REDD+ framework. With the prospect of a global agreement on forest preservation on the horizon, establishing functional MRV systems is one of the major goals of so called 'REDD Readiness'. However, due to the ambitious, worldwide scale of the prospective REDD+ framework, financial sustainability is a central issue. MRV of tropical forests has historically been an expensive, expert led process, carried out by external consultants in conjunction with the local population. This professional model of forest monitoring is not viable for a global scale programme, and so attention is turning to the potential of community/locally based monitoring to fulfil the 'M' in REDD+ MRV.This desk-based study attempts to lend support to the above assertion by providing an up to date review of the still relatively limited literature on locally based natural resource monitoring, looking at the inherent advantages it has over professional monitoring. It then picks out key practical lessons from a variety of international case studies, before assessing how locally based monitoring could fit into a REDD+ MRV framework.The investigation shows locally based monitoring to be advantageous in terms of lower costs, enhanced local ownership, greater cultural relevance and improved institutional strength at the community level, while not compromising on accuracy of information produced - there is a growing consensus amongst practitioners in the field that adequately trained local monitors can produce data comparable to that derived from professionals. As REDD+ requires ground-based monitoring to complement remote sensing of forest condition, locally based monitoring can fulfil this role while also creating employment. The author highlights the need to develop a community MRV protocol that maximises the involvement of local people in forest monitoring, while also corresponding to the forest monitoring requirements made by the UN for the prospective REDD+ framework.

TI  - Rocketing restoration: enabling the upscaling of ecological restoration in the Anthropocene
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the 25 years during which the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER) has overseen the publication of Restoration Ecology, the field has witnessed conceptual and practical advances. These have become necessary due to the scale of environmental change wrought by the increasing global human population, and associated demands for food, fiber, energy, and water. As we look to the future, and attempt to fulfill global restoration commitments and meet sustainable development goals, there is a need to reverse land degradation and biodiversity loss through upscaling ecological restoration. Here, we argue that this upscaling requires an expanded vision for restoration that explicitly accounts for people and nature. This expansion can assess success in a future-focused way and as improvements relative to a degraded socio-ecological system. We suggest that upscaling requires addressing governance, legal and ethical challenges, investing in technological and educational capacity building, bolstering the practical science necessary for restoration, encouraging adoptable packages to ensure livelihoods of local stakeholders, and promoting investment opportunities for local actors and industry. Providing SER embraces this socio-ecological vision, it is ideally placed to aid the achievement of goals and remain globally relevant. SER needs to harness and coordinate three sources of potential energy (global political commitments, the green economy, and local community engagement) to rocket restoration into the Anthropocene. With principles that can embrace flexibility and context-dependency in minimum restoration standards, SER has the potential to guide socio-ecological restoration and help realize the ultimate goal of a sustainable Earth.

TI  - Age-specific and species-specific tree response to seasonal drought in tropical dry forests
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Millions of people depend on ecosystem services provided by Tropical Dry Forests (TDFs), yet their proximity to population centers, seasonally dry climate, and the ease at which they are converted to agriculture has left only 10 % of their original extent globally. As more TDFs become protected, basic information relating TDF age to subsurface water resources will help guide forest recovery. Severe deforestation and recent reforestation around Bahia de Caraquez, Ecuador produced a mosaic of different successional stages ideal for exploring relationships between TDF age, subsurface water availability and species-specific responses to seasonal drought. Over one year, we measured gravimetric water content, predawn and midday leaf water potential, and the stable isotope composition of xylem and source waters in two regenerating and one primary forest. Over the transition from wet to dry season, we discovered a sharper decrease in predawn water potential in younger successional forests than in the primary forest. Growing in degraded subsurface environments under increased competition, successional forest trees accessed deeper sources of moisture from unsaturated weathered bedrock and groundwater through the dry season; however, different species employed distinct water use strategies. Ceiba trichistandra maintained midday water potentials above -1.27 MPa through a drought avoidance strategy dependent on groundwater. Sideroxylon celastrinum tolerated drought by lowering predawn and midday water potential through the early dry season but took up greater proportions of saprolite moisture and groundwater as the dry season progressed. Contrastingly, Handroanthus chrysanthus maintained access to shallow soil and saprolite moisture by dropping midday water potential to -4.30 MPa, reflecting drought tolerance. Our results show that limited subsurface water resources in regenerating TDF's lead to species-specific adaptations re-liant on deeper sources of moisture. The recovery of soil and saprolite hydrologic properties following disturbances is likely to exceed 100 years, highlighting the importance of forest conservation.

TI  - Tree regeneration in active and passive cloud forest restoration: Functional groups and timber species
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree regeneration of late-successional, animal-dispersed and/or timber species in restored forests is key to the recovery of ecological functions and interactions, as well as ecosystem services. We assessed whether active restoration is more effective than passive restoration at increasing the recovery of these groups in the tree seedling community. We analysed tree seedlings (>0.3 m to 1.5 m in height) over four years under three conditions in a tropical montane cloud forest landscape in Mexico: mature cloud forest (MF) as the reference system, active restoration (AR; mixed plantation with native species) and passive restoration (PR; natural succession). The AR and PR were 24 years old and were originally established in abandoned grazing land located at similar distances to the MF (709 +/- 67 m and 906 +/- 66 m, respectively). We recorded similar to 488 seedlings/year belonging to 51 tree species. Seedling density was higher in AR than in PR, but no differences were found in recruitment or survival rates between these restoration conditions. The density of late-successional, barochorous-synzoochorous and timber species was much higher in MF than in the restoration conditions. Seedling density of timber species was similar in AR and PR. Our results support higher recovery of the richness and density of late-successional and barochorous-synzoochorous functional groups in the tree seedling community in AR than in that of PR. However, the overall low seedling density and recruitment found in both restoration conditions highlight the need for additional intervention, even after 24 years, in order to overcome barriers to tree regeneration. Direct seeding and enrichment plantings of late-successional, barochorous-synzoochorous and high-value timber species could contribute towards more ecologically and economically valuable forests.

TI  - Synthesizing Global and Local Datasets to Estimate Jurisdictional Forest Carbon Fluxes in Berau, Indonesia
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundForest conservation efforts are increasingly being implemented at the scale of sub-national jurisdictions in order to mitigate global climate change and provide other ecosystem services. We see an urgent need for robust estimates of historic forest carbon emissions at this scale, as the basis for credible measures of climate and other benefits achieved. Despite the arrival of a new generation of global datasets on forest area change and biomass, confusion remains about how to produce credible jurisdictional estimates of forest emissions. We demonstrate a method for estimating the relevant historic forest carbon fluxes within the Regency of Berau in eastern Borneo, Indonesia. Our method integrates best available global and local datasets, and includes a comprehensive analysis of uncertainty at the regency scale.Principal Findings and SignificanceWe find that Berau generated 8.91 +/- 1.99 million tonnes of net CO2 emissions per year during 2000-2010. Berau is an early frontier landscape where gross emissions are 12 times higher than gross sequestration. Yet most (85%) of Berau's original forests are still standing. The majority of net emissions were due to conversion of native forests to unspecified agriculture (43% of total), oil palm (28%), and fiber plantations (9%). Most of the remainder was due to legal commercial selective logging (17%). Our overall uncertainty estimate offers an independent basis for assessing three other estimates for Berau. Two other estimates were above the upper end of our uncertainty range. We emphasize the importance of including an uncertainty range for all parameters of the emissions equation to generate a comprehensive uncertainty estimate-which has not been done before. We believe comprehensive estimates of carbon flux uncertainty are increasingly important as national and international institutions are challenged with comparing alternative estimates and identifying a credible range of historic emissions values.

TI  - Dissimilar forests along the Rio Doce watershed call for multiple restoration references to avoid biotic homogenization
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An environmental disaster caused by the rupture of a mining tailings dam has impacted a large area of the Rio Doce watershed in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, resulting in unprecedented damage at spatial and temporal scales. The Atlantic Forest is one of the world's most important biodiversity hotspots. A long history of land use conversion has resulted in a highly fragmented landscape. Despite numerous restoration initiatives, these efforts have often biased criteria and use limited species assemblages. We conducted a comprehensive synthesis of the plant community in riparian forests along the Rio Doce watershed. Our work detailed vegetation composition (tree and sapling strata) and examined its relationship with edaphic and landscape factors, aiming to inform restoration projects with scientifically robust knowledge. A total of 4906 individuals from the tree strata and 4565 individuals from the sapling strata were recorded, representing a total of 1192 species from 75 families. Only 0.8% of the tree species and 0.5% of the sapling species occurred in all sampled sectors, with over 84% of the species occurring in a single watershed sector for both strata. We observed a high species heterogeneity modulated by turnover (92.3% in the tree, and 92.7% in the sapling strata) among sites. Overall, our research revealed a gradient of soil fertility influencing species composition across different strata. Additionally, we discovered that preserved landscapes had a positive impact on species diversity within both strata. The species exclusivity in the sampled sites and the high turnover rate imply the need to consider multiple reference ecosystems when restoring the watershed to reduce the risk of biotic homogenization. Finally, the reference ecosystems defined here serve as a basis for the selection of locally particular species in the implementation of restoration projects that aim to improve biodiversity, ecosystem services, and water security.

TI  - A large-scale field assessment of carbon stocks in human-modified tropical forests
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical rainforests store enormous amounts of carbon, the protection of which represents a vital component of efforts to mitigate global climate change. Currently, tropical forest conservation, science, policies, and climate mitigation actions focus predominantly on reducing carbon emissions from deforestation alone. However, every year vast areas of the humid tropics are disturbed by selective logging, understory fires, and habitat fragmentation. There is an urgent need to understand the effect of such disturbances on carbon stocks, and how stocks in disturbed forests compare to those found in undisturbed primary forests as well as in regenerating secondary forests. Here, we present the results of the largest field study to date on the impacts of human disturbances on above and belowground carbon stocks in tropical forests. Live vegetation, the largest carbon pool, was extremely sensitive to disturbance: forests that experienced both selective logging and understory fires stored, on average, 40% less aboveground carbon than undisturbed forests and were structurally similar to secondary forests. Edge effects also played an important role in explaining variability in aboveground carbon stocks of disturbed forests. Results indicate a potential rapid recovery of the dead wood and litter carbon pools, while soil stocks (0-30cm) appeared to be resistant to the effects of logging and fire. Carbon loss and subsequent emissions due to human disturbances remain largely unaccounted for in greenhouse gas inventories, but by comparing our estimates of depleted carbon stocks in disturbed forests with Brazilian government assessments of the total forest area annually disturbed in the Amazon, we show that these emissions could represent up to 40% of the carbon loss from deforestation in the region. We conclude that conservation programs aiming to ensure the long-term permanence of forest carbon stocks, such as REDD+, will remain limited in their success unless they effectively avoid degradation as well as deforestation.

TI  - Fire and grazing modify grass community response to environmental determinants in savannas: Implications for sustainable use
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical dry forests and savannas are important repositories of plant diversity and ecosystem services in the tropics. These ecosystems are also used extensively for grazing by livestock, and represent a critical element of the rural economy of many tropical countries. Fire is considered as a part of co-evolution in these ecosystems across the globe. However, in recent decades, there has been a shift in historical fire regime. Fire has become more frequent in these landscapes, and could be further enhanced under climate change. This poses threats to existing biodiversity, ecosystem processes, and rural economy. We asked how variability in fire frequency has influenced diversity and heterogeneity in grass species composition, and richness and abundance of grass species preferred by large herbivores (referred to as grazing acceptability) in a South Indian tropical savanna forest. We assumed that an increase in fire frequency acts as the active constraint and limits an ecosystem from attaining the maximum heterogeneity, and the maximum grazing acceptability (maximum richness and abundance of grass species preferred by herbivores) in its native settings. We used MODIS active fire and burned area products to estimate fire frequency across the landscape. A nested sampling approach was used to collect information on vegetation and soil at different fire frequencies. Quantile regression analyses indicated that diversity and heterogeneity in grass species composition as well a's grazing acceptability decreased with increasing fire frequencies. We found that livestock grazing intervened with the observed vegetation patterns; grass species diversity and heterogeneity, and grazing acceptability increased with grazing intensity at lower quantiles. Other measured covariates, rainfall, and soil-fertility, alone were not able to explain the observed vegetation patterns in the landscape. The results show a need to control annual fires but allow and manage intermittent fires in this landscape. A complete suppression of fire is not desirable as fire releases nutrients from burning of deeper-rooted vegetation and thus acts as a periodic nutrient pump. It also played an important role in maintaining the grass cover by reducing shrub cover. Hence, it is important to consider the complex interactions between fires-grazers-soil-vegetation to develop effective management practices. We conclude that fire frequency should be managed at low to intermediate levels (one fire in every 5-9 years, resembling the native settings), and grazing regulated, in order to sustain wild and domestic herbivores, biodiversity, and other key ecosystem processes and services over the long-term.

TI  - Mapping selective logging impacts in Borneo with GPS and airborne lidar
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reduced-impact logging (RIL) is a promising management strategy for biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration, but incentive mechanisms are hindered by inadequate monitoring methods. We mapped 937 ha of logging infrastructure in a selectively harvested tropical forest to inform a scalable approach to measuring the impacts of discrete management practices (hauling, skidding, and felling). We used a lidar-derived disturbance model to map all skid trails and haul roads within 26 months of the selective harvest of six blocks of dipterocarp forest in five industrial concessions in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Lidar maps of logging impacts (220 ha) agreed well with ground-based maps (total of 217 ha, RMS error of 6 ha or 3%), but skid trail positions agreed only 59% of the time. Due to rapid forest regeneration, total lidar-derived haul road area was 31% smaller than road area measured in the field; agreement was higher for lidar collections within a year of the harvest. Maps of carbon density generated from Fourier transforms of lidar height profiles estimated skidding and felling biomass losses to within 1-5% of ground-based measurements. Lidar-derived skidding and hauling impact zones covered only 69% of the permitted harvest area; the remaining areas showed no signs of logging disturbance, and available biophysical data did not explain their location. These results emphasize the need for more extensive mapping of logging infrastructure to capture spatial variability in skid trail density and hitherto undetected no-impact zones. While a ground-based GPS is recommended as the most affordable method for wide-scale infrastructure mapping, aerial lidar is an effective tool for remotely quantifying the extent of logging impacts in tropical forests.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study showed changing patterns in the plant species composition, diversity, and carbon storage potential of different forests along altitudinal gradients (i.e. 100 - 1900 m) in Eastern Himalayan India. Different tree, shrub and herb species were sampled along the altitudinal gradients ranging from tropical to temperate forests through Nested Plot design. In each forest, vegetation sampling was made by establishing a permanent plot of 250 m x 250 m as per ISRO-GBP/NCP-VCP protocol. Individuals of trees >= 10 cm girth at breast height (GBH), shrubs and herbs were recorded in 4, 8 and 16 subplots of 31.62 m x 31.62 m, 5 m x 5 m and 1 m x 1 m, respectively. Community attributes such as species richness, density, basal area, diversity indices and biomass and carbon storages were computed for each study site. A total of 5 forest communities (2 each from tropical and subtropical and one from temperate forest) were identified. The woody species diversity was highest in the subtropical forest followed by tropical and temperate forest. Altitude played an important role in the Eastern Himalayan Mountains in the establishment and distribution of forest community. Forest community composition changes with elevation, for instance, the dominant communities like Dipterocarpus retusus-Phoebe goalparensis-Schima wallichii (D-PS), Gmelina arborea-Schima wallichii-Duabanga grandiflora (G-S-D), Schima wallichii-Duabanga grandiflora-Alstonia scholaris (S-D-A), Alstonia scholaris-Terminalia myriocarpa-Bischofia javanica (A-T-B) and Acer thomsonii-Rhodendron arboreum-Quercus lamellose (A-R-Q) were present at elevational ranges of 100-300 m, 300-700 m, 700-1100 m, 1100-1500 m and 1500-1900 m, respectively. The study showed that about 41-57% of the tree species exhibited good regeneration followed by 23-30% as fair, 6-16% as poor, and 6-21% species did not show regeneration along the altitudinal gradient. The total biomass carbon (Mg C ha-1) varied from 84.74 to 163.56 in tropical, 103.12 - 156.41 in subtropical and 133.05 in temperate forest. In conclusion, community composition, regeneration pattern and biomass carbon storage changes along altitude because of altered biophysical characteristics. However, despite variations in elevation, factors for forest disturbance at different altitudes significantly contributed to the community attributes and overall accumulation of biomass carbon. Hence, the traditional management practices carried out by local communities also play a crucial role in shaping the structure, composition, and carbon dynamics of forest ecosystems. Understanding the impacts of these practices is essential for promoting sustainable forest management by conserving forests and preserving carbon stocks for mitigating climate change in future. This study emphasizes the importance of long-term forest monitoring to promote biodiversity conservation and formulate conservation strategies that support sustainable forest management policies to which ensure continuous provision of ecosystem services in the region.

TI  - Accelerating tropical forest restoration through the selective removal of pioneer species
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Demand for tropical forest restoration has grown rapidly as the potential role of recovering secondary forests in sequestering carbon and enhancing biodiversity has been recognised. Active forest management is often prescribed to accelerate natural regeneration, but evidence for the efficacy of interventions is scarce for tropical forests. In this study we examine the hypothesis that the selective removal of abundant pioneers in the understory of recovering selectively logged forests can improve the composition of forest stands and accelerate succession. Four selective thinning treatments of increasing intensity were implemented in 8.75 ha compartments and replicated six times. Within each compartment, three monitoring plots were established and measured immediately after thinning and one year later to assess implementation of thinning treatments, growth and survival of stems, and changes in stand composition. Canopy openness was measured using hemispherical photography. Thinning treatments substantially reduced the abundance of pioneers, but there was only a slight increase in canopy openness (3.7-4.3%) relative to the control (1.8%) 8 months after implementation. Canopy openness increased dramatically across all treatments in the follow year due to the 2015-16 El Nino event and increased more in thinning treatments. Large (>10 cm dbh) and small (2-10 cm dbh) late-successional stems showed enhanced growth only in the low intensity thinning treatment, whereas the growth of small pioneer stems increased across the thinning intensity gradient. The cost of implementing thinning treatments was $US80 per ha or approximately 10% of the cost of planting treatments in the same forest. Our findings suggest that selective thinning of understory pioneer stems is a practical option for manipulating stand composition and potentially accelerating natural regeneration. Continued monitoring of the experiment should reveal the long-term impact and cost-effectiveness of treatments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The large-scale potential of regenerating Cerrado and Atlantic Forests for atmospheric carbon removal
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Understanding changes in aboveground biomass (AGB) stocks in regenerating tropical forests for the purposes of environmental restoration is essential to determine the ecosystem services provided by forests and to support international forest restoration agreements and the UN Decade of Ecological Restoration. This Postdoctoral (PD) grant aims to support research within the Nature Based Solutions component of the project supported by Shell-FAPESP. The selected candidate will collaborate with researchers from the RestoreC project at FAPESP-Shell POLI-USP Research Center for Gas Innovation at the University of São Paulo. Summary of the program and projects can be found on the RCGI website (http://www.rcgi.poli.USP.br/).This PD grant will aim to quantify the large-scale potential of annual carbon removals by forest restoration in the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest biomes as a basis for prioritizing different locally assessed restoration strategies. The PD fellow will be crucial to analyze information derived from special high and moderate resolution remote sensing (including LIDAR) combined with geoprocessing methods and field-based inventory data to obtain large-scale information about regenerating areas in both biomes, their age under different environmental and climatic conditions to produce C accumulation curves and map the potential of these phytophysiognomies to sequester and accumulate carbon.

TI  - National carbon model not sensitive to species, families and site characteristics in a young tropical reforestation project
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reforestation and restoration offer critical contributions to addressing climate change and biodiversity decline. Enabling carbon credits to be derived from these activities is important for reforestation, particularly since reforestation does not come cheaply. Australia's Carbon Farming Initiative is a world-leading policy that allows carbon credits to be obtained by using published methods-based approaches. Here we apply two different approaches to a young mixed species reforestation project in the wet tropics of Queensland, Australia. One approach assesses carbon sequestration from published allometric equations requiring direct field measurements, and the other applies a national carbon accounting model, FulICAM. Using allometric equations, we found above-ground biomass was influenced significantly by family, species, size class, and the interaction of family and size class. Species in the family Proteaceae outperformed species in other families. Selection of species according to soil nutrient status could enhance growth rates, but if soil nutrients and species responses are not known, then a bet-hedging strategy using mixed species from a variety of families is probably the best option. For three year old forest plots, FulICAM modelled significantly more carbon mass of trees than published allometric models for mixed tropical forests, suggesting that FulICAM needs adjustment to more accurately reflect species, families, local conditions and small-scale sites. Current policy settings are at odds with the needs of carbon farmers, considering the importance of forests and landscape restoration in fighting climate change and biodiversity decline. Legislated national methods allowing the development of species-specific allometrics for small mixed plantations do not account for the costs of developing these allometrics, especially in markets that are marginal.

TI  - Greater stability of carbon capture in species-rich natural forests compared to species-poor plantations
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree plantations and forest restoration are leading strategies for enhancing terrestrial carbon (C) sequestration and mitigating climate change. While it is well established that species-rich natural forests offer superior C sequestering benefits relative to short-rotation commercial monoculture plantations, differences in rates of C capture and storage between longer-lived plantations (commercial or non-commercial) and natural forests remain unclear. Using a natural experiment in the Western Ghats of India, where late-20th century conservation laws prohibited timber extraction from monodominant plantations and natural forests within nature reserves, we assessed forests and plantations for aboveground C storage and the magnitude and temporal stability of rates of photosynthetic C capture (gross primary production). Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that species-rich forests show greater temporal stability of C capture, and are more resistant to drought, than monodominant plantations. Carbon stocks in monodominant teak (Tectona grandis) and Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp.) plantations were 30%-50% lower than in natural evergreen forests, but differed little from moist-deciduous forests. Plantations had 4%-9% higher average C capture rates (estimated using the Enhanced Vegetation Index-EVI) than natural forests during wet seasons, but up to 29% lower C capture during dry seasons across the 2000-18 period. In both seasons, the rate of C capture by plantations was less stable across years, and decreased more during drought years (i.e. lower resistance to drought), compared to forests. Thus, even as certain monodominant plantations could match natural forests for C capture and storage potential, plantations are unlikely to match the stability-and hence reliability-of C capture exhibited by forests, particularly in the face of increasing droughts and other climatic perturbations. Promoting natural forest regeneration and/or multi-species native tree plantations instead of plantation monocultures could therefore benefit climate change mitigation efforts, while offering valuable co-benefits for biodiversity conservation and other ecosystem services.

TI  - Impacts of carbon-based policy instruments and taxes on tropical deforestation
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of carbon payments and income taxes on curbing tropical forest loss are analyzed under a market equilibrium framework. The supply of cleared forest land was derived by using a two-period utility maximization model when the carbon sequestration of a private forestholder is credited. The land demand was derived from the profit maximization problem of a cash-crop farmer. The model was applied to data from the humid Chaco eco-region of Paraguay. The results indicate that taxes on cash-crop and forestry incomes may in fact be ineffective in curbing forest loss. Carbon payments, however, would effectively reduce forest clearing. In the context studied, a carbon payment of (sic)30 per ton of carbon would limit deforestation to 10% of existing forest cover. A reversible carbon crediting system, in which a forestholder can redeem a credited forest, seems to substantially increase, at least in the short run, the effectiveness of carbon payments. Carbon payments could also complement the tax on cash-crop income in curbing tropical forest loss. An effective policy to combat tropical deforestation should, therefore, jointly consider forestry and cash-crop sectors. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Supporting decision-making by companies in delivering their climate net-zero and nature recovery commitments: Synthesising current information and identifying research priorities in rainforest restoration
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Many companies are making ambitious pledges to achieve positive impacts for climate and nature by financing restoration of carbon-and biodiversity-rich natural habitats. However, companies cannot make evidence-based choices that will deliver successful restoration if the scientific in-formation required to guide investment has not been synthesised in a way that they can use, or there are knowledge gaps. To explore this issue, share information, and identify knowledge gaps and research priorities, we bring together researchers, a conservation NGO and a multinational consumer goods company (Unilever), focusing on Southeast Asian rainforests. These habitats offer significant restoration opportunities for carbon and biodiversity in areas that have been degraded by commercial logging and agriculture. We find that procedures for carbon restoration are much better developed than those for biodiversity, and that new research is urgently needed to deliver evidence-based biodiversity restoration. Companies need to be confident that their actions are fit-for-purpose to meet their environmental pledges. Achieving successful restoration outcomes will require co-designed projects with the potential to deliver positive co-benefits for carbon, biodiversity and local livelihoods.

TI  - Does Tree Species Composition Affect Productivity in a Tropical Planted Forest?
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - With growing pressure on primary forests from destructive land uses, increasing the diversity of native species plantations can increase ecosystem service provision, such as timber production or carbon sequestration, thus better supporting sustainable livelihoods. Understanding the effects of tree species composition on productivity can inform plantation design and ecological restoration strategies. However, tree species composition effects have been neglected in experimental biodiversity-ecosystem function (BEF) research. This study uses a 10-yr data set from one of the first tropical planted forest experiments established with native species and designed for BEF research at scales relevant to forest management. At our site in Sardinilla, Panama, we established plots containing 6 species from a pool of 18, in four combinations, to investigate how composition affects species and plot productivity. We used basal area as a proxy for productivity through time, measured annually, and summed this at species and plot levels for analysis. We found that plots that differed in species composition appeared to differ in temporal rate of basal area increase, but did not differ in BA after 10yr. Species were generally consistent in size between compositions, and composition performance was correlated with the size of component species, suggesting that species identities were most important in determining plot productivity. Our results suggest that species choice can be based on preferences for individual species, as species performance was consistent across composition contexts. We make recommendations for the use of particularly productive species that also provide multiple services such as Guazuma ulmifolia, Spondias mombin, and Anacardium excelsum.Resumen Con la presion cada vez mayor sobre los bosques primarios proveniente de utilizaciones del suelo destructivas, el aumento de la diversidad de plantaciones de especies nativas puede aumentar la prestacion de servicios de los ecosistemas, tales como la produccion de madera o la captura de carbono, y por lo tanto, aumentar el apoyo a medios de vida sostenibles. La comprension de los efectos de la composicion de las especies de arboles en la productividad, puede informar sobre el diseno de plantacion y las estrategias de restauracion ecologica. Sin embargo, los efectos de la composicion de especies de arboles se han descuidado en las investigaciones de funcion experimental de la biodiversidad en los ecosistemas o BEF por sus siglas en ingles. Este estudio utiliza un conjunto de datos de 10 anos de uno de los primeros experimentos establecido en bosques tropicales con especies nativas y disenado para la investigacion BEF a escalas relevantes para la gestion forestal. En nuestro sitio en Sardinilla, Panama, establecimos parcelas que contienen seis especies de un grupo de dieciocho anos, en cuatro combinaciones, para investigar como la composicion afecta las especies y la productividad en las parcelas. Utilizamos el area basal como proxy de la productividad a traves del tiempo, medido anualmente, y esto lo sumamos al nivel de las especies y las parcelas para el analisis. Se encontro que las parcelas que diferian en la composicion de especies parecian diferir en la tasa de incremento temporal de la zona basal pero no difirieron en el area basal despues de 10 anos. Las especies fueron generalmente consistentes en tamano entre las composiciones, y el rendimiento de la composicion se correlaciono con el tamano de las especies que lo componen, lo que sugiere que la identidad de las especies fue mas importante para determinar la productividad en la parcela. Nuestros resultados sugieren que la eleccion de las especies puede estar basada en las preferencias por las distintas especies, ya que el rendimiento de especies fue consistente en contextos de composicion. Hacemos recomendaciones para el uso de especies particularmente productivas que tambien ofrecen multiples servicios como Guazuma ulmifolia, Spondias mombin y Anacardium excelsum.

AB  - Community-based forest management (CBFM) is a major strategy in managing forest lands in the Philippines. Forest and land management activities implemented in CBFM project sites include management of tropical forests (enrichment planting, timber stand improvement or TSI and limited harvesting), rehabilitation of degraded lands (reforestation, assisted natural regeneration (ANR)) and agroforestry. The environmental effects of CBFM and its technologies are largely positive. CBFM has led to the conservation of natural forests and the associated biodiversity. The planting of trees in farms and landscapes has led to soil and water conservation, carbon sequestration and biomass production.

TI  - Allelopathy: a tool for weed management in forest restoration
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest restoration uses active management to re-establish natural forest habitat after disturbance. However, competition from early successional species, often aggressively invasive exotic plant species, can inhibit tree establishment and forest regeneration. Ideally, restoration ecologists can plant native tree species that not only establish and grow rapidly, but also suppress exotic competitors. Allelopathy may be a key mechanism by which some native trees could reduce the abundance and impact of exotic species. Allelopathy is a recognized tool for weed management in agriculture and agroforestry, but few studies have considered how allelopathic interactions may aid restoration. Here we introduce the "Homeland Security" hypothesis, which posits that some na < ve exotic species may be particularly sensitive to allelochemicals produced by native species, providing a tool to reduce the growth and impacts of invasive exotic species on reforestation. This article explores how exploiting allelopathy in native species could improve restoration success and the re-establishment of natural successional dynamics. We review the evidence for allelopathy in agroforestry systems, and consider its relevance for reforestation. We then illustrate the potential for this approach with a case study of tropical forest restoration in Panama. C-4 grasses heavily invade deforested areas in the Panama Canal watershed, especially Saccharum spontaneum L. We measured the effect of leaf litter from 17 potential restoration tree species on the growth of invasive C-4 grasses. We found that leaf litter from legume trees had a greater inhibitory effect on performance of S. spontaneum than did litter from non-legume trees. However, allelopathic effects varied greatly among species within tree functional groups. Further evaluation of intra- and inter-specific interactions will help to improve our selection of restoration species.

TI  - Can current native tree seedling production and infrastructure meet an increasing forest restoration demand in Brazil?
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent global commitments have placed forest and landscape restoration at the forefront of countries' efforts to recover ecosystem services, conserve biodiversity, and mitigate the effects of climate change. However, it needs to be asked if current native tree seedling supply meets an increase in demand for forest restoration? This study assessed the current configuration, distribution, and production capacity of forest nurseries producing native trees in Brazil. Brazil provides an interesting example of how global agreements aligned with national policies can lead to the proliferation of native seedling nurseries, and the challenges faced to restore species-rich native forest ecosystems. We found that the nurseries in the Atlantic Forest region can still meet an increase in demand-both in terms of seedling quantity and diversity-because most of their production capacity is not currently used. However, not all Brazilian biomes have sufficient nurseries to meet restoration demands, thus there is a risk of using native species from a few biogeographical regions in a much spatially wider and ecologically diverse area. In addition, lack of seed supply and qualified labor can hamper the growth of the market. Barriers to seed supply may also lead to low levels of genetic variability and floristic representation in the populations and ecosystems to be restored. We conclude that restoration of high-diversity forest ecosystems requires policies and supportive programs, with emphasis on private nurseries, to guarantee adequate supply of native tree seedlings and provide the necessary incentives to develop the emergent economy of forest restoration.

TI  - Earthworms and litter management contributions to ecosystem services in a tropical agroforestry system
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of sustainable agricultural systems depends in part upon improved management of non-crop species to enhance the overall functioning and provision of services by agroecosystems. To address this need, our research examined the role of earthworms and litter management on nutrient dynamics, soil organic matter (SOM) stabilization, and crop growth in the Quesungual agroforestry system of western Honduras. Field mesocosms were established with two earthworm treatments (0 vs. 8 Pontoscolex corethrurus individuals per mesocosm) and four litter quality treatments: (1) low-quality Zea mays, (2) high-quality Diphysa robinioides, (3) a mixture of low-and high-quality litters, and (4) a control with no organic residues applied. Mesocosms included a single Z. mays plant and additions of N-15-labeled inorganic nitrogen. At maize harvest, surface soils (0-15 cm) in the mesocosms were sampled to determine total and available P as well as the distribution of C, N, and N-15 among different aggregate-associated SOM pools. Maize plants were divided into grain and non-grain components and analyzed for total P, N, and N-15. Earthworm additions improved soil structure as demonstrated by a 10% increase in mean weight diameter and higher C and N storage within large macro-aggregates (>2000 mu m). A corresponding 17% increase in C contained in micro-aggregates within the macro-aggregates indicates that earthworms enhance the stabilization of SOM in these soils; however, this effect only occurred when organic residues were applied. Earthworms also decreased available P and total soil P, indicating that earthworms may facilitate the loss of labile P added to this system. Earthworms decreased the recovery of fertilizer-derived N in the soil but increased the uptake of N-15 by maize by 7%. Litter treatments yielded minimal effects on soil properties and plant growth. Our results indicate that the application of litter inputs and proper management of earthworm populations can have important implications for the provision of ecosystem services (e.g., C sequestration, soil fertility, and plant production) by tropical agroforestry systems.

TI  - Land-use trade-offs between tree biodiversity and crop production in the Atlantic Forest
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Trade-offs in ecosystem services (ES) have received increasing attention because provisioning services often come at the expense of biodiversity loss. When land-use patterns are not maximally efficient relative to productivity, provisioning services, such as crop production, can often be increased without losing biodiversity. The Atlantic Forest (AF) encompasses dense, mixed, and seasonal forests and has high levels of endemism and anthropogenic threat. We examined trade-offs between biodiversity and crop production in the AF to provide insights into land-use management decisions. We developed a biodiversity metric that combines information on tree species richness, evolutionary distinctiveness, and rarity at the local level. We examined the extent to which the nature of ES trade-offs differ among the 3 forest types. We assessed how annual deforestation rates and land management practices affect biodiversity and agricultural revenues. Finally, we tested whether it is possible to achieve the same total regional revenue without reducing biodiversity by improving local management practices. The 3 forest types had similar patterns in ES trade-offs, although within mixed forest patterns differed. Biodiversity appeared to be more sensitive to land-use change than crop revenues. Certain crops yielded up to 10 times higher values in some sites. Enhanced crop productivity may increase revenues without reducing biodiversity. Our results showed that to enhance human well-being without further conversion of AF, maximizing crop productivity is needed . Increasing efficiency of management outcomes by maintaining higher biodiversity and increasing provisioning services depends on knowledge of forest type, the comparative advantage of planting crops in the best places, and preserving species in a balanced manner across forests.Compensaciones de Uso de Suelo entre la Biodiversidad de arboles y la Produccion Agricola en el Bosque Atlantico Las compensaciones en los servicios ecosistemicos (SE) han recibido mayor atencion porque los servicios de aprovisionamiento a menudo conllevan la perdida de biodiversidad. Cuando los patrones de uso de suelo no son maximamente eficientes en relacion con la productividad, los servicios de aprovisionamiento, como la produccion agricola, a menudo pueden ser incrementados sin perder biodiversidad. El Bosque Atlantico (BA) comprende bosques densos, mixtos y estacionales y tiene altos niveles de endemismo y amenazas antropogenicas. Examinamos las compensaciones entre biodiversidad y produccion agricola en el BA para proporcionar ideas para las decisiones de manejo de uso de suelo. Desarrollamos una medida de la biodiversidad que combina informacion sobre la riqueza de arboles, la singularidad evolutiva y rareza a nivel local Examinamos el grado en que la naturaleza de las compensaciones de los SE difiere entre los 3 tipos de bosque. Evaluamos como afectan las tasas anuales de deforestacion y las practicas de manejo a la biodiversidad y a las ganancias agricolas. Finalmente, probamos si es posible obtener la misma ganancia regional total son reducir la biodiversidad mediante la mejora de las practicas de manejo locales. Los 3 tipos de bosque tuvieron patrones similares de compensaciones de SE, aunque los patrones difirieron en los bosques mixtos. La biodiversidad parecio ser mas sensible al cambio de uso de suelo que a las ganancias agricolas. Ciertos cultivos proporcionaron valores 10 veces mas altos en algunos sitios. El incremento de la produccion agricola puede incrementar las ganancias sin reducir la biodiversidad. Nuestros resultados muestran que para incrementar el bienestar humano sin mayor alteracion del BA se requiere maximizar la produccion agricola. El incremento de la eficiencia del manejo al mantener mas biodiversidad y aumentar los servicios de aprovisionamiento depende del conocimiento del tipo de bosque, de la ventaja comparativa de sembrar cultivos en los mejores sitios y la preservacion de especies de manera equilibrada en los bosques.Resumen???? ???????????????????, ????????????????????????????????????????????, ????????????????, ????????????????????????????????, ????, ????????????????????????????????????????????, ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????, ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????, ???????????????????, ????????????????????????????????????????????, ????????????????????, ???????????????????????, ????????????????????????, ??????????????????????????, ??????????????????????????, ??????????????????????????????????????????????, ???????????????????????, ???????????????????????: ???; ??: ????

TI  - The effects of belowground resources on aboveground allometric growth in Bornean tree species
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree height and crown allometries reflect adaptations for resource acquisition and structural stability, as well as plastic responses to a heterogeneous environment. While both light and soil resources limit growth and influence competitive responses in tropical forests, the effects of belowground resources on allometries are less understood, especially within the understory. To characterize outcomes of tree competition along an edaphic resource gradient, we quantified variation in height and crown allometries of six Bornean tree species from contrasting regeneration niches (light-demanding vs. shade-tolerant) on two soil habitats (clay-fine loam and sandy loam) within a 52-ha forest dynamics plot. Using empirically-fit allometric parameters and diameter growth rates from plot census data, we modeled tree height and crown area growth over the projected life span of each species. Based on resource competition theory, we hypothesized that tree species specializing on and populations of generalist species growing on the relatively moister, more fertile clay-fine loam soil habitat would have faster height and crown growth rates, compared to those on the sandy loam habitat, regardless of regeneration niche. Among soil specialists and within generalists of both genera, trees growing on clay-fine loam had taller stems and larger crowns at a given age and faster height and crown area growth rates at most sizes than trees on sandy loam. Differences in height and crown growth were driven by the faster diameter growth rates of trees on clay-fine loam, not by differences in height- and crown-diameter allometries, as trees on sandy loam were significantly taller at a given diameter, and differences in crown allometry were not consistent across soil habitats. Characterizing the height and crown growth responses of trees along resource gradients provides insight into the mechanisms that maintain diversity in tropical forests. Our results point to the importance of adaptive and plastic responses to both above and belowground resource availability in determining the allometric growth of trees and suggest that this diversity of responses may contribute tree species coexistence through competition-based trade-off mechanisms and variation in growth among individuals. Additionally, as the importance estimating natural carbon sequestration increases with the escalating effects of anthropogenic climate change, differences in tree growth and architecture across soil habitats also have implications for the approximation of forest carbon storage on heterogeneous tropical soils.

TI  - Advancing Knowledge in Forest Water Use Efficiency Under Global Climate Change Through Scientometric Analysis
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Forests are critical in regulation of carbon and water cycles and mitigation of climate change. Forest water-use efficiency (WUE) refers to the ratio of biomass produced (or assimilated carbon) to the amount of water used by forests, which indicates how effectively a forest utilizes water to achieve productivity. Climate change and its impact on forest WUE are important research directions that explore the complex relationship between global environmental change and the forest ecosystem dynamics. The global intensification of climate change underscores the need for an inclusive understanding of forest water use and makes it crucial to know how forests balance carbon and water resources, which is essential for effective forest management and predicting ecosystem responses to climate change. This study aims to comprehensively and objectively analyze current research trends and future directions related to the response of forest WUE to climate change. Our database included 1755 research papers from the Web of Science Core Collection, spanning from 2000 to 2023. Our analysis included cooperative networks of countries, authors, and institutions, as well as the most frequently cited journals and articles, keyword co-occurrence analysis, and a keyword burst analysis. The results showed that the top cooperative country, author, and institution is PR China, Prof. Dr. Jes & uacute;s Julio Camarero from the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient & iacute;ficas (CSIC), and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, respectively. The leading journal in this field is "Global Change Biology". Critical research hot topics include gas exchange, modeling, altitudinal gradients, tree growth dynamics, net carbon exchange, global change drivers, tropical forests, nitrogen stoichiometry, Northern China plains, and extreme drought conditions. Frontier topics that have emerged in recent years include studies on China's Loess Plateau, stable isotopes, radial growth, gross primary productivity, and Scots pine. The insights from this analysis are vital for researchers, decision-makers, and forestry professionals aiming to mitigate the impacts of climate change on forest WUE and overall ecosystem health and resilience. This study emphasizes the importance of sustained research efforts and global research collaboration in addressing the intricate challenges posed by climate change to forest ecosystems.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of reducing emissions from tropical deforestation, 2016-2050
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing tropical deforestation is potentially a large-scale and low-cost strategy for mitigating climate change. Yet previous efforts to project the cost-effectiveness of policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from future deforestation across the tropics were hampered by crude available data on historical forest loss. Here we use recently available satellite-based maps of annual forest loss between 2001-2012, along with information on topography, accessibility, protected status, potential agricultural revenue, and an observed inverted-U-shaped relationship between forest cover loss and forest cover, to project tropical deforestation from 2016-2050 under alternative policy scenarios and to construct new marginal abatement cost curves for reducing emissions from tropical deforestation. We project that without new forest conservation policies 289 million hectares of tropical forest will be cleared from 2016-2050, releasing 169 GtCO(2). A carbon price of US$20/tCO(2) ($50/tCO(2)) across tropical countries would avoid 41 GtCO(2) (77 GtCO(2)) from 2016-2050. By comparison, we estimate that Brazil's restrictive policies in the Amazon between 2004-2012 successfully decoupled potential agricultural revenue from deforestation and reduced deforestation by 47% below what would have otherwise occurred, preventing the emission of 5.2 GtCO(2). All tropical countries enacting restrictive anti-deforestation policies as effective as those in the Brazilian Amazon between 2004-2012 would avoid 58 GtCO(2) from 2016-2050.

TI  - Habitat disturbance trumps moonlight effects on the activity of tropical insectivorous bats
T2  - ANIMAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in moonlight intensity can affect predation risk and induce changes in habitat use and activity of nocturnal species. However, the effect of moonlight on animal activity is rarely evaluated in human-modified landscapes and can be of vital importance to understand possible changes in ecosystem services provided by light-sensitive taxa, such as insectivorous bats. Fragmentation changes forest structure and affects light penetration across the landscape. In this case, the effects of fragmentation on bat activity can be modulated by cyclical variations of moonlight intensity. We acoustically quantified the activity of nine aerial insectivorous bat species in relation to moonlight at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, Central Amazonia. We aimed to understand species-level variation in activity across habitats (continuous forest, fragments and secondary forest) at different temporal scales: lunar cycle, dark vs. bright nights and within nights. Amazonian aerial insectivorous bats responded more to habitat type than to moonlight, with two and six species showing reduced activity in fragments and secondary forest, respectively, compared to continuous forest. The lower activity in secondary forest suggests that despite c. 30 years of secondary forest regeneration, it is still less attractive as foraging habitat. An interactive effect of habitat type and moonlight on bat activity was most evident when contrasting dark and bright nights. Our results indicate that fragments have reduced bat activity on extremely bright nights, probably due to higher predation risk in small fragments. Species that emit constant-frequency calls (Pteronotus spp.) were the ones that most modulated their responses to habitat disturbance and moonlight. Otherwise, moonlight had little effect on hourly activity levels, irrespective of habitat type. Moonlight is capable of modulating the responses of some bat species in disturbed habitats, particularly in fragments.

TI  - Bat phylogenetic responses to regenerating Amazonian forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Throughout the tropics, regenerating secondary forests occupy vast areas previously cleared for agriculture and cattle ranching. However, despite the importance of regenerating forests in mitigating the pervasive negative consequences of forest loss and fragmentation on forest-associated biodiversity, longitudinal studies on species' phylogenetic responses to matrix regeneration are rare.2. We surveyed bats in continuous primary forest, primary forest fragments and in the regenerating secondary forest matrix of a whole-ecosystem Amazonian fragmentation experiment, similar to 15 and similar to 30 years after forest clearance, to investigate how changes in matrix quality through forest recovery affect phylogenetic alpha- and beta-diversity.3.We found that temporal changes in phylogenetic alpha-richness were more marked in the secondary forest matrix than in forest fragments and continuous forest, evidencing a significant increase in total evolutionary history over time. However, when the effects of species richness were accounted for, the phylogenetic structure of each assemblage was reduced close to zero, evincing a random pattern of lineages in all habitat types. Temporal differences in phylogenetic beta-diversity were driven mainly by beta(replacement) in secondary forest and continuous forest similar to 30 years after forest clearance. Both habitats also clustered together in terms of beta(richness), indicating similar levels of evolutionary heritage. Consequently, regenerating secondary forest showed a reduction in the extinction probability of lineages over time.4. Synthesis and applications. Approximately 30 years of secondary forest regeneration were sufficient for phylogenetic richness to recover to levels similar to those observed in continuous forest. Promoting forest succession on degraded land through a combination of natural and active restoration, while ensuring the long-term protection of secondary forests regardless of their age, is of key importance for conserving tropical bat diversity and their associated ecosystem services. Such restoration measures would stimulate the recolonization of fragments and matrix habitats by evolutionarily distinct bat species, safeguarding phylogenetically diverse assemblages and ecological functions. Our study suggests that forest restoration in tropical degraded areas should be encouraged and secondary forests be protected by law, especially in countryside ecosystems with high primary forest cover, and in the surroundings of protected areas.

TI  - Field observed relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning during secondary succession in a tropical lowland rainforest
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) is one of the most concerned topics in ecology. However, most of the studies have been conducted in controlled experiments in grasslands, few observational, field studies have been carried out in forests. In this paper, we report variations of species diversity, functional diversity and aboveground biomass (AGB) for woody plants (trees and shrubs) along a chronosequence of four successional stages (18-year-old fallow, 30-year-old fallow, 60-year-old fallow, and old-growth forest) in a tropical lowland rainforest recovered after shifting cultivation on Hainan Island, China. Fifty randomly selected sample plots of 20 m x 20 m were investigated in each of the four successional stages. Four functional traits (specific leaf area, wood density, maximum species height and leaf dry matter content) were measured for each woody plants species and the relationships between species/functional diversity and AGB during secondary succession were explored. The results showed that both plant diversity and AGB recovered gradually with the secondary succession. AGB was positively correlated with both species and functional diversity in each stage of succession. Consistent with many controlled experimental results in grasslands, our observational field study confirms that ecosystem functioning is closely related to biodiversity during secondary succession in species rich tropical forests.

TI  - Enrichment Planting in Secondary Forests: a Promising Clean Development Mechanism to Increase Terrestrial Carbon Sinks
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing need to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations, afforestation and reforestation (A/R) projects are being implemented under the Kyoto Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and under the voluntary carbon (C) market. The specific objective of A/R C projects is to enhance terrestrial sinks. They could also provide low-income communities in developing countries with a source of revenue, as well as a number of ecological and social services. However, feasibility issues have hindered implementation of A/R CDMs. We propose enrichment planting (EP) in old fallow using high-value native timber species as a land-use alternative and a small-scale C projects opportunity. We present EP in the context of ongoing work in a poor indigenous community in eastern Panama. We consider economic risks and advantages and concordance with existing modalities under the compliance market. The potential storage capacity for EP at the site of our study was similar to 113 Mg C ha(-1), which is comparable to other land uses with high C storage, such as industrial teak plantations and primary forest. Because secondary forests show high aboveground biomass production, C projects using EP could harness large amounts of atmospheric C while improving diversity. Carbon projects using EP can also provide high levels of social, cultural, and ecological services by planting native tree species of traditional importance to local communities and preserving most of the secondary forest's ecological attributes. Therefore, EP planting could be considered as a way to promote synergies between two UN Conventions: climate change and biodiversity.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Forests contain 70-80 percent of terrestrial carbon (C) and represent a global C sink, despite of continued deforestation. On the other hand, forests and land-use change (LUC) account for the largest uncertainties within the global C balance. The future role of forests is even more uncertain within the context of global change. The question if forests will shift from C sinks to sources is fundamental for conservation and management. We aim to synthesize current knowledge on the role of the major forest biomes in the global C cycle. Furthermore, we evaluate management options, based on their potential to maximize greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation and other benefits from forest ecosystems. Whereas boreal and temperate forests currently act as net sinks, there is a potential for increased insect outbreaks, fires, and droughts. Pressure from infrastructure development and the demand for biomass fuels is increasing. Tropical forests account for the largest gross C sink, but face deforestation and degradation. The future role of tropical forests depends mostly on LUC dynamics. Uncertainties persist about deforestation rates and impacts from global change. It is clear, however, that changes in the C balance of tropical forests will affect atmospheric CO2 levels on a global scale. In managed temperate and boreal forests, aboveground carbon (AGC) can be maximized by optimizing rotation cycles in even-aged stands. Mixed-species stands may increase productivity and resilience to disturbances. Research is needed on the impacts of silvicultural activities on soil organic carbon (SOC). In the tropics, reforestation and deforestation avoidance are the most important GHG mitigation pathways. Lessons learnt from REDD (reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) pilot projects may help to establish GHG mitigation strategies in the future. The majority of timber harvest in the tropics is unsustainable and could be improved by extending rotation cycles, reduced impact logging, and long-term management planning. International support is needed to ensure capacity building and strong institutions, and to create incentives for global markets. The extension of planted forests is growing worldwide. Plantations sequester important amounts of C, although afforestation may initially lead to SOC losses, and AGC storage over multiple rotation cycles is low, compared to natural forests. Conservation of old-growth forests is the most effective way to secure C storage.

TI  - Contributions of a global network of tree diversity experiments to sustainable forest plantations
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - The area of forest plantations is increasing worldwide helping to meet timber demand and protect natural forests. However, with global change, monospecific plantations are increasingly vulnerable to abiotic and biotic disturbances. As an adaption measure we need to move to plantations that are more diverse in genotypes, species, and structure, with a design underpinned by science. TreeDivNet, a global network of tree diversity experiments, responds to this need by assessing the advantages and disadvantages of mixed species plantations. The network currently consists of 18 experiments, distributed over 36 sites and five ecoregions. With plantations 1-15 years old, TreeDivNet can already provide relevant data for forest policy and management. In this paper, we highlight some early results on the carbon sequestration and pest resistance potential of more diverse plantations. Finally, suggestions are made for new, innovative experiments in understudied regions to complement the existing network.

TI  - The CO2 dependence of photosynthesis, plant growth responses to elevated CO2 concentrations and their interaction with soil nutrient status, II.: Temperate and boreal forest productivity and the combined effects of increasing CO2 concentrations and increased nitrogen deposition at a global scale
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - 1. Appropriate rates of carbon acquisition by temperate and boreal forests are re-evaluatted, Based on continental-scale forestry data it is suggested that the productivity of temperate and boreal forests has been overestimated previously.2, Using these values, a model of the integrated response of ecosystems to carbon dioxide concentration and soil nitrogen availability is presented. The model does not assume constant C/N ratios in plant or soil and considers effects of increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and nitrogen deposition separately or together.3, For temperate-zone forests a co-occurrence of a CO2 increase and nitrogen deposition doubles the increase in net primary productivity and carbon sequestration that would be the case for nitrogen deposition occurring on its own. Considered separately, the effect of the atmospheric CO2 increase is less than even moderate rates of anthropogenic N deposition for temperate or boreal forests. By contrast, for tropical forests, the atmospheric CO2 increase is sufficient to induce large rates of carbon accumulation in plants and soil.4, Application of the model at the global scale suggests large localized sinks for CO2 in either tropical rain forests or in forested or grassland areas of Europe and North America where appreciable N deposition occurs. Overall, the model suggests a terrestrial sink owing to CO2 fertilization and N deposition of about 0.2 Pmol C per year. About half of this is in the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere and about half in the tropics.

TI  - Causes and consequences ofCedrela odoratainvasion in West African semi-deciduous tropical forests
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of the West African forests have disappeared or have been deeply fragmented. This deforestation dynamic is still ongoing under a strong demographic pressure, forests being mostly replaced by agricultural lands. On the other hand, some reforestation projects are also undertaken, in particular by planting non-native species likeCedrela odorata. To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the causes and consequences ofCedrela odorataspread in West African natural forests. We studied a 400ha area of natural forest where 100ha of permanent plots have been affected by a major fire in 1983. Within these permanent plots, 21,444 trees were mapped, botanically determined and their diameters at breast height were measured in 2018. Using a bayesian hierarchical framework, we modelled the causes of the spread ofCedrela odoratain the studied plots, and its consequences on aboveground biomass and tree community diversity. Regarding the causes, the occurrence ofCedrela odoratais significantly linked to the fire occurence 25 years ago, to the proximity of the forest edge and to the presence of hydromorphic soils. Regarding the consequences,Cedrela odoratainvasion doesn't have any significant impact on the above-ground biomass but has a strong negative effect on the tree community diversity, as far as decreasing Simpson diversity in Hill numbers from 27 equivalent species in slightly invaded plots to 2 equivalent species in largely invaded plots. Our results highlight the long-lasting impacts of human disturbance (fire,Cedrela odorataintroduction) on forest ecosystems and the need to use local species for ongoing reforestation plans in West African semi-deciduous forests.

TI  - It is possible to reverse soil degradation caused by bauxite mining through ecological restoration?
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Mining is one of the most impacting human activities to natural resources, and that can profoundly affect ecosystem resilience depending on the level of soil degradation. Thus many mined areas are not effectively recovered to the point of restoring relevant part of biodiversity and ecosystem services, restricting rehabilitation. If the physical, chemical and microbiological soil properties are not considered in forest restoration, resilience is not viable, and consequently, the ecosystem will not restore its ecological functions. In particular, the physical and chemical attributes are the first to be recovered to establish vegetation, facilitating ecological succession. The recovery of the chemical attributes denotes attention, since soils of tropical ecosystems are generally poor in nutrients. The mineralogical composition of the soil is intrinsically linked to that context by conditioning the physical and chemical soil properties, in particular its physical structure, which may different managements that compartment are needed and chemically mineralogy vary significantly among soil types, so in terms of fertility, working the soil as a reservoir or drain nutrients. The aim of this study is to determine the total and clay fraction in newly mined soils, forests and restoration of native forests and forest rehabilitation process mineralogy. The study areas are located in the city of Pocos de Caldas / MG and belong to ALCOA Aluminum. In each study area, ie each sample unit correspond to a collection point, this being composed of 15 sub-samples, the 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-40, 40-60 cm. The mineralogy of the soil will be determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). (AU)

TI  - Payment for environmental services to reduce deforestation: Do the positive effects last?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Are the forest conservation practices sustained after Payment for Environmental Services (PES) programmes end? Using a sample of 268 (former) PES recipients and non-recipients from the Budongo-Bugoma PES programme in Western Uganda, we employ the before-after-control-intervention (difference-in-difference) approach to esti-mate the PES programme outcome on their privately owned forests. PES is associated with less deforestation during the operational period, but the link has vanished four years after programme termination. We label this weak permanence, i.e., PES recipients abandon the induced practices soon after the programme ended, but the gains (relatively higher forest cover) during the operational period are maintained. We also find that household and contextual variables are important in explaining PES permanence: low levels of agricultural land and remoteness from agricultural markets weaken PES permanence. Therefore monetary payments alone may be insufficient for lasting forest conservation. Integrating PES with other approaches, such as climate-smart agri-culture may result in more permanent reductions in deforestation.

TI  - Data from: Rubber agroforestry in Thailand provides some biodiversity benefits without reducing yields
T2  - Dryad
M3  - Data set
AB  - Monocultural rubber plantations have replaced tropical forest, causing biodiversity loss. While protecting intact or semi-intact biodiverse forest is paramount, improving biodiversity value within the 11.4 million hectares of existing rubber plantations could offer important conservation benefits, if yields are also maintained. Some farmers practice agroforestry with high-yielding clonal rubber varieties to increase and diversify incomes. Here, we ask whether such rubber agroforestry improves biodiversity value or affects rubber yields relative to monoculture. We surveyed birds, fruit-feeding butterflies and reptiles in 25 monocultural and 39 agroforest smallholder rubber plots in Thailand, the worlds biggest rubber producer. Management and vegetation structure data were collected from each plot, and landscape composition around plots was quantified. Rubber yield data were collected for a separate set of 34 monocultural and 47 agroforest rubber plots in the same region.Reported rubber yields did not differ between agroforests and monocultures, meaning adoption of agroforestry in this context should not increase land demand for natural rubber. Butterfly richness was greater in agroforests, where richness increased with greater natural forest extent in the landscape. Bird and reptile richness were similar between agroforests and monocultures, but bird richness increased with the height of herbaceous vegetation inside rubber plots. Species composition of butterflies differed between agroforests and monocultures, and in response to natural forest extent, while bird composition was influenced by herbaceous vegetation height within plots, the density of non-rubber trees within plots (representing agroforestry complexity), and natural forest extent in the landscape. Reptile composition was influenced by canopy cover and open habitat extent in the landscape. Conservation priority and forest-dependent birds were not supported within rubber.Synthesis and applications. Rubber agroforestry using clonal varieties provides modest biodiversity benefits relative to monocultures, without compromising yields. Agroforests may also generate ecosystem service and livelihood benefits. Management of monocultural rubber production to increase inter-row vegetation height and complexity may further benefit biodiversity. However, biodiversity losses from encroachment of rubber onto forests will not be offset by rubber agroforestry or rubber plot management. This evidence is important for developing guidelines around biodiversity-friendly rubber and sustainable supply chains, and for farmers interested in diversifying rubber production.

TI  - Rethinking the Ecosystem Functions of Dicranopteris, a Widespread Genus of Ferns
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Dicranopteris is an ancient and widespread genus of ferns in pantropical regions. Some species of the genus can form dense thickets, and dominate the understory, which are common and key species in tropical and subtropical ecosystems. However, they were mostly cut or burned in forest management because of forming dense thickets which were considered to interfere with forest regeneration and succession. In the current review, we argue that the Dicranopteris species which are able to rapidly colonize barren areas may contribute to ecosystem recovery, resistance to environmental stress, and succession control. Rapid colonization involves prolific spore production, rapid clonal growth, the generation of high surface cover, and the ability to fill gaps; stress resistance includes resistance to abiotic stress, and the ability to reduce soil erosion from rainfall, alien species invasion, and soil contamination and toxicity; and succession facilitation consists of carbon and nutrient sequestration in soil, moderation of the microclimate, alteration of the soil microbial and faunal communities, and determination of which plant species to be established in the next successional stage. All of these ecosystem functions may be beneficial to ecosystem resilience. We expect that the distribution of Dicranopteris will expand in response to global warming, changes in precipitation patterns, increases in soil pollution, deforestation, and land degradation. We recommend that Dicranopteris, as a pioneer fern and a valuable component of tropical and subtropical ecosystems, needs more attention in future research and better management practices to promote forest regeneration and succession.

TI  - Competing effects of soil fertility and toxicity on tropical greening
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests are expected to green up with increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but primary productivity may be limited by soil nutrient availability. However, rarely have canopy-scale measurements been assessed against soil measurements in the tropics. Here, we sought to assess remotely sensed canopy greenness against steep soil nutrient gradients across 50 1-ha mature forest plots in Panama. Contrary to expectations, increases in in situ extractable soil phosphorus (P) and base cations (K, Mg) corresponded to declines in remotely sensed mean annual canopy greenness (r(2)=0.77-0.85; p<0.1), controlling for precipitation. The reason for this inverse relationship appears to be that litterfall also increased with increasing soil P and cation availability (r(2)=0.88-0.98; p<0.1), resulting in a decline in greenness with increasing annual litterfall (r(2)=0.94; p<0.1). As such, greater soil nutrient availability corresponded to greater leaf turnover, resulting in decreased greenness. However, these decreases in greenness with increasing soil P and cations were countered by increases in greenness with increasing soil nitrogen (N) (r(2)=0.14; p<0.1), which had no significant relationship with litterfall, likely reflecting a direct effect of soil N on leaf chlorophyll content, but not on litterfall rates. In addition, greenness increased with extractable soil aluminum (Al) (r(2)=0.97; p<0.1), but Al had no significant relationship with litterfall, suggesting a physiological adaptation of plants to high levels of toxic metals. Thus, spatial gradients in canopy greenness are not necessarily positive indicators of soil nutrient scarcity. Using a novel remote sensing index of canopy greenness limitation, we assessed how observed greenness compares with potential greenness. We found a strong relationship with soil N only (r(2)=0.65; p<0.1), suggesting that tropical canopy greenness in Panama is predominantly limited by soil N, even if plant productivity (e.g., litterfall) responds to rock-derived nutrients. Moreover, greenness limitation was also significantly correlated with fine root biomass and soil carbon stocks (r(2)=0.62-0.71; p<0.1), suggesting a feedback from soil N to canopy greenness to soil carbon storage. Overall, these data point to the potential utility of a remote sensing product for assessing belowground properties in tropical ecosystems.

TI  - Comparing the success of active and passive restoration in a tropical cloud forest landscape: A multi-taxa fauna approach
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forest restoration initiatives are becoming more frequent worldwide in an effort to mitigate biodiversity loss and ecosystems degradation. However, there is little consensus on whether an active or a passive restoration strategy is more successful for recovering biodiversity because few studies make adequate comparisons. Furthermore, studies on animal responses to restoration are scarce compared to those on plants, and those that assess faunal recovery often focus on a single taxon, limiting the generalization of results. We assessed the success of active (native mixed-species plantations) and passive (natural regeneration) tropical cloud forest restoration strategies based on the responses of three animal taxa: amphibians, ants, and dung beetles. We compared community attributes of these three taxa in a 23-year-old active restoration forest, a 23-year-old passive restoration forest, a cattle pasture, and a mature forest, with emphasis on forest-specialist species. We also evaluated the relationship between faunal recovery and environmental variables. For all taxa, we found that recovery of species richness and composition were similar in active and passive restoration sites. However, recovery of forest specialists was enhanced through active restoration. For both forests under restoration, similarity in species composition of all faunal groups was 60-70% with respect to the reference ecosystem due to a replacement of generalist species by forest-specialist species. The recovery of faunal communities was mainly associated with canopy and leaf litter covers. We recommend implementing active restoration using mixed plantations of native tree species and, whenever possible, selecting sites close to mature forest to accelerate the recovery of tropical cloud forest biodiversity. As active restoration is more expensive than passive restoration, both strategies might be used in a complementary manner at the landscape level to compensate for high implementation costs.

TI  - Forest conservation in the Philippines: A cost-effective approach to mitigating climate change?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Slowing tropical deforestation can reduce global carbon emissions and prevent climate change. This article estimates the costs of preserving the carbon sequestration and storage services of tropical forests in the Philippines, and compares the costs of this approach to mitigating climate change with the costs of alternative abatement options in the developed world. Unlike most previous studies, the analysis estimates costs based on opportunity costs and includes non-market activities such as subsistence agriculture. The analysis finds that while the opportunity costs for the Philippines are significant, countries like the U.S. may find paying the Philippines for forest conservation to be a cost-efficient alternative to reducing emissions within their own borders.

TI  - A probabilistic scenario approach for developing improved Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD plus ) baselines
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Performance-based payments are widely seen as a promising tool for Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) in tropical forests. Despite great advances in international REDD+ negotiations, there is a lack of consensus around the development of business-as-usual (BAU) reference scenarios or baselines to derive and quantify net carbon emission reductions. In this paper, we explore a novel approach for developing baselines (point forecasts) using exponential smoothing. Further, we introduce the concept of probabilistic BAU scenario ranges developed using this approach.We compare predictive performance with the linear trend and historical averages approaches conventionally used in policy proposals and REDD+ pilots. Weempirically test the relative performance of all three approaches by forecasting BAU baselines and scenario ranges in 36 sites (consisting of 20 countries and 8 Amazonian states with and 8 countries without REDD+ schemes). Based on two predictive performance measures (the root mean squared error and mean absolute percentage error), we find that exponential smoothing outperforms the linear trend and historical average models at predicting forest cover changes. In addition, we show how prediction intervals based on a desired confidence level generated through exponential smoothing can be used in novel ways to determine likely baseline scenario ranges. In this way it is possible to quantify the degree of variability and uncertainty in datasets. Importantly, this also provides a statistical measure of confidence to determine if REDD+ interventions have been effective.By generating robust probabilistic baseline scenarios, exponential smoothing models can facilitate the effectiveness of REDD+ payments, support a more efficient allocation of scarce conservation resources, and improve our understanding of effective forest conservation investments, also beyond REDD+.

TI  - Forestry and the carbon market response to stabilize climate
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the potential contribution of forestry management in meeting a CO, stabilization policy of 550 ppmv by 2100. In order to assess the optimal response of the carbon market to forest sequestration, we couple two global models. An energy-economy-climate model for the study of climate policies is linked with a detailed forestry model through an iterative procedure to provide the optimal abatement strategy. Results show that forestry is a determinant abatement option and could lead to significantly lower policy costs if included. Linking forestry management to the carbon market has the potential to alleviate the policy burden of 50 ppmv or equivalently of (1)/(4)degrees C, and to significantly decrease the price of carbon. Biological sequestration will mostly come from avoided deforestation in tropical-forest-rich countries. The inclusion of this mitigation option is demonstrated to crowd out some of the traditional abatement in the energy sector and to lessen induced technological change in clean technologies.

TI  - Post-fire ecological restoration in Latin American forest ecosystems: Insights and lessons from the last two decades
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are responsible for a substantial loss of forest ecosystem services globally and represent a major driving force of forest degradation across Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC). The detrimental effect of forest fires is particularly relevant in regions where fire has been historically absent or has rarely occurred. Nowadays, there is an increasing interest to promote and develop ecological restoration (ER) following fire. LAC constitutes a hotspot where work and interest in ER has been steadily increasing over the last decades, mainly due to the drive of a new generation of young and experienced ecologists and foresters. Despite the increasing attention in post-fire restoration in the region, there is a dearth of initiatives compiling and organizing all the available information on this topic. This work aims to address such constraint, providing current information on post-fire ER in LAC forests. After a brief contextualization of environmental and social consequences of wildfires, we collect and discuss recent advances on restoring degraded forests. From the conifer Mexican ecosystems to the Southern Patagonian evergreen forests, we look back over the last two decades (2000-2020) mainly discussing experiences of success and failure, as well as limitations of implementing approaches based on passive/natural restoration or active/assisted restoration. Furthermore, we also explore other aspects of the restoration process, including those related to social participation and community engagement (e. g. education in restored areas), the use of fire regulation and management to reduce fire risks and increase ecosystem resilience, educational aspects and intermediate approaches as agroforestry and silviculture practices. In the last sections, we identify three major categories of specific constraints that condition ER, including environmental limitations (biotic and abiotic factors), technical/management factors and the socio-economic challenge of restoration. Finally, we briefly discuss future perspectives for ER in LAC.

TI  - Committed to restoring tropical forests: an overview of Brazil's and Indonesia's restoration targets and policies
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Review
AB  - The restoration of tropical forests has become a popular nature-based solution for climate change mitigation, protection of biodiversity, and improving the livelihoods of local populations. The Bonn Challenge and the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration underscore the international momentum of the restoration movement, with many countries committing to restore millions of hectares of deforested and degraded land in the next decade. Brazil and Indonesia are among the ones with the most ambitious restoration commitments globally. Since both their economies are highly dependent on the export of agricultural commodities, reconciling economic growth with environmental sustainability will be a major policy challenge. In this paper, we (a) identify the main restoration targets and the policies supporting their implementation in both countries, (b) provide a descriptive overview of these restoration-supportive policies, and (c) discuss the main challenges that Brazil and Indonesia face in the implementation of their restoration commitments. We find that Brazil has an explicit and dedicated strategy to achieve its restoration target, but that recent political developments have weakened environmental governance in the country, affecting the implementation of its restoration commitment. In the case of Indonesia, we find that the government has rather focused and progressed on the restoration of peatlands and mangroves, whereas its commitment to restore forestlands has yet to benefit from a dedicated plan that allows to coordinate policies and agencies' efforts towards the achievement of its restoration target.

TI  - Maximizing biodiversity conservation and carbon stocking in restored tropical forests
T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the conservation value of restoration plantings is critical to support the global forest landscape restoration movement. We assessed the implications of tree species selection in the restoration of Brazil's Atlantic Forest regarding carbon stocking and species conservation. This assessment was based on a comprehensive dataset of seedling acquisition records from 961 restoration projects, more than14 million seedlings, 192 forest remnants, and functional data from 1,223 tree species. We found that animal-dispersed trees with larger seeds tend to have higher seed prices, yet are underrepresented in the seedlings acquired for restoration plantations. Compared to forest remnants, fruit supply potentially offered by the species acquired for restoration plantings is lower for birds, but higher for bats. Reduced abundance of medium- and/or large-seeded, animal-dispersed trees lead to declines of 2.8-10.6% in simulated potential carbon stocking. Given the uncertainty in these estimates, policy interventions may be needed to encourage greater representation of large-seeded, animal-dispersed tree species in Atlantic Forest restorations. These findings provide critical guidance for recovering tree functional diversity, plant-frugivore mutualistic interactions, and carbon stocking in multi-species tropical forest restoration plantings.

TI  - Phyllostomid Bat Occurrence in Successional Stages of Neotropical Dry Forests.
T2  - PLoS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical dry forests (TDFs) are highly endangered tropical ecosystems being replaced by a complex mosaic of patches of different successional stages, agricultural fields and pasturelands. In this context, it is urgent to understand how taxa playing critical ecosystem roles respond to habitat modification. Because Phyllostomid bats provide important ecosystem services (e. g. facilitate gene flow among plant populations and promote forest regeneration), in this study we aimed to identify potential patterns on their response to TDF transformation in sites representing four different successional stages (initial, early, intermediate and late) in three Neotropical regions: Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil. We evaluated bat occurrence at the species, ensemble (abundance) and assemblage level (species richness and composition, guild composition). We also evaluated how bat occurrence was modulated by the marked seasonality of TDFs. In general, we found high seasonal and regional specificities in phyllostomid occurrence, driven by specificities at species and guild levels. For example, highest frugivore abundance occurred in the early stage of the moistest TDF, while highest nectarivore abundance occurred in the same stage of the driest TDF. The high regional specificity of phyllostomid responses could arise from: (1) the distinctive environmental conditions of each region, (2) the specific behavior and ecological requirements of the regional bat species, (3) the composition, structure and phenological patterns of plant assemblages in the different stages, and (4) the regional landscape composition and configuration. We conclude that, in tropical seasonal environments, it is imperative to perform long-term studies considering seasonal variations in environmental conditions and plant phenology, as well as the role of landscape attributes. This approach will allow us to identify potential patterns in bat responses to habitat modification, which constitute an invaluable tool for not only bat biodiversity conservation but also for the conservation of the key ecological processes they provide.

TI  - Dynamics of soil aggregate-associated organic carbon based on diversity and high biomass-C input under conservation agriculture in a savanna ecosystem in Cambodia
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - No-till (NT) cropping systems have the potential to enhance soil aggregation, providing physical protection and soil C sequestration. The existence of discrepancies in the impact of tillage on soil aggregation and soil C sequestration warrants further studies, particularly for different crop rotations. We hypothesized the following: a) NT biannual crop rotations tend to be more effective in restoring large macroaggregation and the concentrations of soil organic C (SOC), total N and permanganate oxidizable C (POXC) associated with macroaggregates than NT systems with a one-year frequency pattern and conventional tillage (CT); b) the continuous biomass-C inputs via crop residues in large macroaggregates under NT tend to increase the proportion of aliphatic C than those under CT. Therefore, the objectives of this study were: (i) to assess changes in the aggregate size distribution and levels of aggregate-associated total SOC, total N and POXC and (ii) to characterize humic acid (HA) using C-13 CP-MAS nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of 8- to 19-mm soil aggregate size class in a reference vegetation (RV) and in rice-, soybean- and cassava-based cropping systems (RcCS, SbCS and CsCS, respectively) in a clayed Oxisol after tillage and crop rotation management. We evaluated four treatments in each cropping system: 1) CT, and 2) three NT systems in a randomized complete block design with three replicates. Soil aggregate samples were collected at depths of 0-5, 5-10 and 10-20 cm. The conversion of RV to agricultural land influenced the distribution of aggregate size classes, soil aggregation indices and aggregate-associated SOC, total N and POXC in the two surface layers. The formation of large macroaggregates (8-19 mm) dominated the aggregate size distribution with a relatively higher proportion under RV and NT than under CT. Across all soil depths, the proportions of the 8- to 19-mm aggregate size fraction were 59% (NV), 43% and 47% (RcCS), 45% and 53% (SbCS) and 34% and 37% (CsCS) for the CT and NT systems, respectively. Among the three NT systems, the biannual crop rotations in the three cropping systems (NT2-Rice, NT2-Soybean, NT2-Cassava; NT3-Rice, NT3-Soybean and NT3-Cassava) indicated better performance than the one-year frequency pattern in restoring large macroaggregation and the concentrations of SOC, total N and POXC associated with large macroaggregates. Additionally, in the surface (0-5 cm) and subsurface (10-20 cm) soil layers, the SbCS with a high rate (7.32 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) and diversity [Pennisetum typhoides) (Pearl millet)/maize + Brachiaria ruziziensis (Brz), Stylosanthes guianensis (St)] of biomass-C inputs reached the highest levels of lability of SOC and POXC in the macroaggregate size classes of 0.25-0.5 and 8-19 mm, respectively. The CP-MAS C-13 NMR measurement suggests that the continuous and high biomass-C inputs with diverse crop residues under NT, such as millet, maize, Brz, St and Crotalaria juncea, tended to increase the proportion of aliphatic C than under CT; an opposite trend was observed for aromatic C. C-13 NMR revealed an advance caused by the association between the quantity and quality of C addition via cultural residues in the discrimination of the composition of C in the macroaggregation in the tropical region.

TI  - Global Forest Transition: Prospects for an End to Deforestation
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES, VOL 36
M3  - Review
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Although global rates of tropical deforestation remain alarmingly high, they have decreased over the period 2000-2010, and a handful of tropical developing countries have recently been through a forest transition a shift from net deforestation to net reforestation. This review synthesizes existing knowledge on the occurrence, causes, and ecological impacts of forest transitions and examines the prospects and policy options for a global forest transition. The ecological quality of forest transitions depends on multiple factors, including the importance of natural forest regeneration versus plantations. Given an increased competition for productive land between different land uses, a global forest transition will require major technological and policy innovations to supply wood and agricultural products. In the globalization era, national strategies aimed at forest protection and sustainable use of forest resources may have unintended effects abroad owing to a displacement of land use across countries. Decisions by consumers combined with certification schemes and moratoriums have an increasing influence on the fate of forests.

TI  - Multi-purpose forest management in the tropics: Incorporating values of carbon, biodiversity and timber in managing Tectona grandis (teak) plantations in Costa Rica
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Plantation forestry is the ultimate alternative in reforesting degraded tropical ecosystems and in provisioning multiple ecosystem services beyond timber production. Therefore, we studied the management of Tectona grandis L.f. (teak) plantations in Costa Rica and simulated alternative management strategies incorporating simultaneously the values of carbon storage, biodiversity and timber production. Alternative management strategies included (1) extension of rotations, (2) reduced thinning and (3) conversion of even-aged to uneven-aged systems. Evaluation criteria were carbon storage in biomass, stand structural diversity as a proxy of biodiversity, and economic return from timber harvests. For growth predictions under future climatic conditions, we calibrated the hybrid forest growth model 3PG. We found that carbon storage could be increased by increasing rotation periods (e.g. + 29.7% of carbon for a 50% increase in rotation length) and a no thinning management (+ 9.5% of carbon). For rotation extension associated economic losses were high (e.g. at 5% discount rate, the Land Expectation Value (LEV) decreased by 25.1% for a 50% extension of rotations). For thinning LEV increased with a low-thinning regime, but decreased with a no-thinning management (+ 9.5% and 23.6%, respectively). Payments for ecosystem services (PES) increased economic return by about 3-4%. Structural diversity increased by conversion to uneven-aged forest stands (Gini coefficients for basal area increased from 0.21 to 0.52). Economic returns from timber harvests were almost equal for even-aged and uneven-aged systems at 1% discount rate (max. -2% of LEV). At 5% discount rate, we observed economic losses of 11.1-20.1% compared to the even-aged scenario. At 10% discount rate, economic losses ranged between 43.6 and 104%. We concluded that extension of rotations and reduction of thinning intensity can be used as management strategies to increase the carbon storage of teak plantations. However, to compensate the associated economic losses through a PES scheme, payments for carbon sequestration need to be increased and special incentives for longer rotation periods and low thinning management need to be developed. The transformation into uneven-aged forest stands requires active investment at discount rates higher than 1%. Whether this investment can be offset by benefits from biodiversity and increased forest resilience is unknown and requires further investigations. Other measures of biodiversity conservation, such as the use of native and mixed tree species and the retention of old trees and deadwood are moreover necessary.

TI  - Liana Dynamics in Southeast Asia: Causes and Consequences
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Tropical ecosystems are particularly valuable not only because they harbour high biodiversity, but also because they provide a number of ecosystem services, carbon storage being among the most important ones. Forests in the tropics have been under significant pressure due to timber harvest, land use change and fragmentation. Furthermore, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that climate change is likely to have a significant impapact on tropical systems. The interaction between forest degradation and climate change threatens the sustainability of tropical ecosystems and good knowledge of the forest dynamics is needed to inform effective forest management and conservation efforts.   Lianas are large woody vines that have been observed to raise in abundance in neotropical forests most likely due to human-mediated global change. They have the potential to contribute to forest degradation by inducing collateral damage during tree fall by pulling neighbouring trees down, smothering seedlings and biasing forest regeneration towards faster growing species, ultimately reducing the forest capacity to store carbon. Therefore, pantropical understanding of liana dynamics is of increasing importance.  Lianas in Southeast Asia have been particularly understudied and this project aims to contribute to filing this knowledge gap. Analysis of liana cover will determine what are the best predictors of diversity and abundance and comparison between is rare vs. common and early vs. late-successional species will pinpoint the traits that make lianas successful. Unprecedented large scale sequencing of functional elements in non-model organisms will provide insights of liana evolution and employed strategies. Further components of the project will look into the impact of liana on carbon storage as well as effect of palm oil cultivation and forest fragmentation on liana cover

TI  - Carbon sequestration in Africa: The land tenure problem
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - The prospect of using tropical forest projects to sequester significant amounts of atmospheric carbon as one mitigation approach to climate change has received considerable attention. In the Kyoto Protocol, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) aspires to make such projects viable. This article examines the prospect of these projects in Africa, and argues that land tenure is much more than just a set of variables to be changed, and that instead it exists as a prohibitive obstacle to the implementation of afforestation and reforestation sequestration approaches. Five primary tenure problems are examined: (I) the disconnect between customary and statutory land rights, (2) legal pluralism, (3) tree planting as land claim, (4) expansion of treed areas in smallholder land use systems, and (5) the difficulty of using the 'abandoned land' category. The pervasiveness of these tenurial issues mean that the prospects for successfully implementing afforestation and reforestation projects in Africa are in reality quite weak. The current project approach to carbon storage in Africa needs to be significantly realigned with African reality in order for sequestration expectations to be practical. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - RESEARCH AND EDUCATION TO IMPROVE TROPICAL FOREST CONSERVATION AND LOCAL LIVELIHOODS
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Tropical forest cover nearly 10% of the earth's land surface and house the largest assemblages of biodiversity of any terrestrial ecosystem. They also are home to over 60 million indigenous forest residents and an additional 400 to 500 million nonindigenous who depend directly on these forests to provide critical subsistence needs such as food, construction materials, medicines, fuel, and cash as well as local ecosystem services such as flood control and soil enrichment and stabilization. However, local communities are not just passive users, but rather own and/or manage an estimated 25% of all tropical forests, and that proportion is increasing. Indeed while many benefits of tropical forests accrue at higher transnational and global scales (i.e., climate regulation, biodiversity conservation, carbon storage and sequestration), the costs of maintaining them are disproportionally borne at lower national and regional scales, with the largest burden typically felt at the local level. Thus, communities often are expected to attend to much broader international forest conservation objectives while concurrently addressing their own livelihood needs. And although there is little concrete evidence to suggest that local communities are optimal stewards of tropical forests, it is also unlikely that large tracts of tropical forest will be conserved without engaging local people who depend upon them daily for their survival. The implication of these livelihood realities and ownership trends is that in many parts of the tropical world, local peoples who have resided in the forest for generations increasingly aspire to, and are expected to, manage their forest ecosystems and the resources obtained from them with greater economic and ecological sophistication. However, often lacking are management strategies and even basic ecological data to inform this transition from general exploitation of forest resources by local people to more conscious management of the ecosystem and its resources. Although global in perspective, geographic focus of this research project is on the two largest contiguous tracts of neotropical forests: the Amazon (with emphasis on Brazil) and Maya forests (with emphasis on Mexico). Institutions of higher education can play a critical role to advance the intertwined goals of tropical conservation and human well-being. Thus, this project also investigates how higher education can better prepare graduate students to take on complex leadership roles required to bridge theory and practice to advance biodiversity conservation, sustainable resource use, and human well-being in the tropics.

TI  - Resilience of a peatland in Central Sumatra, Indonesia to past anthropogenic disturbance: Improving conservation and restoration designs using palaeoecology
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatlands, which provide important functions such as biodiversity provisioning and carbon (C) storage, are currently threatened by land-use conversions. Thus, conservation and restoration efforts are needed to maintain their functions. Conservation concepts aiming to separate human from ecosystems are no longer conceivable. Therefore, understanding peatland resilience to human disturbance, that is the ability of peatland ecosystems to maintain their structure and function despite perturbations and to return to their predisturbance states, can assist with integrating human needs into conservation strategies and improving restoration effectiveness. Understanding ecosystem resilience is often impeded by a lack of long-term data, which can be obtained from palaeoecological studies. Located close to the archaeological remains of the Malayu Empire, the Sungai Buluh peatland in Sumatra, Indonesia provides an opportunity to study the resilience of a tropical peatland to past human disturbance. We subjected a 250-cm-long peat core to palynological, charcoal and C content analyses to delineate the anthropogenic impact on the peatland and the ecosystem's response. The results revealed that extensive human activities in Sungai Buluh such as logging, grazing/cut-and-carry, and wild-harvesting started soon after humans occupied the vicinity of the peatland c. 1,000cal yr bp. Even without fire use and cultivation, these activities were able to alter vegetation composition and decrease the peatland's C sequestration capacity. Following site abandonment after the demise of the Malayu Empire at c. 600cal yr bp, the palaeoecological record suggests that the Sungai Buluh peatland recovered in terms of both floristic composition and C sink function, with the latter recovering faster (c. 60years) than the former (c. 170years).Synthesis. The palaeoecological record from Sungai Buluh provides the first evidence of tropical peatland recovery following human disturbance, which can help improve present peatland conservation/restoration strategies. The design of peatland wise-use strategies can mimic the resilience-friendly human activities identified in this study. Consideration should also be given to selecting rapidly regenerating taxa for cost-and-effort-efficient restoration strategies. Additionally, the 170-year recovery time of the Sungai Buluh peatland suggests that the 60-year timeframe currently allocated in most tropical peatland restoration projects may be insufficient.

TI  - Costs and benefits of restoration are still poorly quantified: evidence from a systematic literature review on the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The achievement of international forest restoration goals requires economically viable land-use options. The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is a priority area for ecosystem restoration, as it is widely deforested to make place for intensive agriculture and one of the most threatened biodiversity hotspots in the world. We systematically reviewed existing scientific literature on the biome to highlight the evidence on economic benefits and costs of forest restoration. A total of 15 publications were identified that quantify costs and/or economic benefits of forest restoration. We observed that most studies (12) were published after 2018 and that research on the topic was biogeographically biased as 12 publications referred to study sites in Brazil's Southeast Region. Given its beneficial natural conditions, the Atlantic Forest is predestined for a wide range of restoration-related opportunities, yet economic benefits of restoration are underexplored (seven studies). Moreover, benefits from a multifunctional use of restored forests are almost absent in the literature with only three studies presenting primary data. Elaboration of restoration costs is also limited to 10 studies that focus predominantly on active restoration. Thus, we argue that the economic costs and benefits of forest restoration are not well understood. Clarity thereon is, however, critical for policy formulation and to mobilize private investments. We therefore call for studies to fill in the knowledge gap on restoration economics in the Atlantic Forest biome, and to study restoration economics in other biomes as well.

TI  - High Carbon Stock forests provide co-benefits for tropical biodiversity
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Carbon-based policies provide powerful opportunities to unite tropical forest conservation with climate change mitigation. However, their effectiveness in delivering biodiversity co-benefits is dependent on high levels of biodiversity being found in high carbon areas. Previous studies have focussed solely on the co-benefits associated with Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) over large spatial scales, with few empirically testing carbon-biodiversity correlations at management unit scales appropriate to decision-makers. Yet, in development frontiers, where most biodiversity and carbon loss occurs, carbon-based policies are increasingly driven by commodity certification schemes, which are applied at the concession level.2. Working in a typical human-modified landscape in Southeast Asia, we examined the biodiversity value of land prioritised via application of REDD+ or the High Carbon Stock (HCS) approach, the emerging land-use planning tool for oil palm certification. Carbon stocks were estimated via low- and high-resolution datasets derived from global or local-level biomass. Mammalian species richness was predicted using hierarchical Bayesian multispecies occupancy models of camera-trap data from forest and oil palm habitats.3. At the community level, HCS forest supported comparable mammal diversity to control sites in continuous forest, while lower carbon strata exhibited reduced species occupancy.4. No association was found between species richness and carbon when the latter was estimated using coarse-resolution data. However, when using high-resolution, locally validated biomass data, diversity demonstrated positive relationships with carbon for threatened and disturbance-sensitive species, suggesting sensitivity of co-benefits to carbon data sources and the species considered.5. Policy implications. Our work confirms the potential for environmental certification and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation to work in tandem with conservation to mitigate agricultural impacts on tropical forest carbon stocks and biodiversity. Successful implementation of both approaches could be used to direct development to low carbon, low biodiversity areas in tropical countries.

TI  - Biomass and carbon stock along an altitudinal gradient in the forest of Manipur, Northeast India
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are natural storehouses of biomass and store more carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem. The relationship between species richness, aboveground biomass and carbon stock at different altitudes can have crucial implications for the management and conservation of carbon sinks. The study was undertaken to assessthe aboveground biomass and carbon stock in ten forest stands along an altitudinal gradient in Manipur, Northeast India. Stand density varied from 128 to 168 trees ha(-1) across the study sites with the highest stand density at higher altitude. The aboveground biomass varied between 124.56 and 254.99 t ha(-1) and carbon stock ranged from 60.09 to 121.43 t C ha(-1) across the study sites. Our results show that there is a significant positive correlation of stand density, aboveground biomass and carbon stock with increasing altitude. This positive relationship could be attributed to less disturbance and the dominance of larger trees at higher altitudes as compared to lower altitudes. Our results could be helpful to devise appropriate strategies in the restoration of degraded forests ecosystems to enhance carbon sequestration and to mitigate climate change.

TI  - Frugivores enhance potential carbon recovery in fragmented landscapes
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest restoration is fundamental to overcoming biodiversity crises and climate change. In tropical forests, animals can improve forest recovery as they disperse >70% of tree species. However, representing animals in restoration and climate change policies remains challenging because a quantitative assessment of their contribution to forest and carbon recovery is lacking. Here we used individual-based models to assess frugivore-mediated seed rain in open areas along a fragmentation gradient. Movements of large birds were limited in landscapes with <40% forest cover, although small birds continued to disperse seeds. Large birds disperse seeds of late-successional species with higher carbon storage potential. Their restricted movement therefore reduced potential biomass in future forests by 38%. Maintaining forest cover >40% is essential to optimizing animals' contribution to restoration success. Active restoration (for example, planting trees) is required in more fragmented landscapes to achieve carbon and biodiversity targets.

TI  - Above-ground woody biomass distribution in Amazonian floodplain forests: Effects of hydroperiod and substrate properties
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of tropical forests in regulating global carbon stocks is well known. However, the role of abiotic variables related to climate conditions and edaphic parameters for patterns of above-ground woody biomass (AGWB) are still under debate. For Amazonian forests subjected to periodic floods, these patterns are even more uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate AGWB stocks in Amazonian floodplain forest, and investigate the importance of forest structure, hydroperiod and edaphic parameters for AGWB. Results are based on floristic inventories conducted in twelve hectares of forest distributed across four floodplains. All trees >= 10 cm DBH were tagged, identified, and had their DBH and height measured. Allometric equations were applied for calculating AGWB. Hydroperiod was estimated for each sample plot, and soil samples were collected and chemical and physical components analyzed. Hierarchical partitioning was applied to determine importance of forest structure variables for AGWB, and GLMMs to evaluate the individual role of several edaphic parameters and hydroperiod for AGWB stocks. AGWB estimates varied substantially both between and within sites, as did the proportional contribution of forest structure variables to AGWB. Fabaceae contributed most to AGWB overall, and hydro period was more important than soil fertility in explaining variation in AGWB values. Amongst the edaphic variables, Iron (Fe) was the component that influenced AGWB the most, followed by Aluminium (Al) and Phosphorus (P). Overall, our results indicate that, on the investigated Amazonian floodplains, AGWB is mainly driven by hydroperiod rather than edaphic properties. This occurs despite a constant input of nutrients caused by flooding events. In addition, this is the first study to suggest that P appears to be of some importance in Amazonian varzea and paleo-varzea floodplains, where soil fertility is generally higher than in non-flooded terra firme forests.

TI  - Scenarios and alternatives for ecological restoration in degraded Andean landscapes: the case of the upper basin of the Bogotá River (Suesca, Cundinamarca)
T2  - REVISTA DE LA ACADEMIA COLOMBIANA DE CIENCIAS EXACTAS FISICAS Y NATURALES
M3  - Article
AB  - The intensification of agriculture and urban expansion have reduced habitats in tropical ecosystems resulting in the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services and impacting on the living conditions of people. In the Andean region of Colombia, the socio-ecological dynamics and fragmentation of the landscape underscore the necessity for comprehensive ecological restoration approaches engaging local communities to bolster territories resilience and sustainability. Here we used a participatory methodology to investigate communities' perspectives on the future restoration of their environment. We derived our findings from surveys, interviews, workshops, and field trips. We identified and categorized areas and restoration strategies and we proposed two complementary future scenarios: ecological connectivity and agro-ecological transition aimed at recovering biodiversity and ecological processes associated with water, soil, agriculture, and livestock (pollination, natural pest control, thermal comfort), associating specific restoration strategies and plant species. Our findings indicated that participatory scenarios facilitate community management of territories towards collaborative solutions related to ecological restoration. We believe the study can be replicated in other degraded Andean landscapes where communities' knowledge and academia's support are essential to improve restoration effectiveness.

TI  - State of the art and for remote sensing monitoring of carbon dynamics in African tropical forests
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - African tropical forests play a crucial role in global carbon dynamics, biodiversity conservation, and climate regulation, yet monitoring their structure, diversity, carbon stocks and changes remains challenging. Remote sensing techniques, including multi-spectral data, lidar-based canopy height and vertical structure detection, and radar interferometry, have significantly improved our ability to map forest composition, estimate height and biomass, and detect degradation and deforestation features at a finer scale. Machine learning approaches further enhance these capabilities by integrating multiple data sources to produce improved maps of forest attributes and track changes over time. Despite these advancements, uncertainties remain due to limited ground-truth validation, and the structural complexity and large spatial heterogeneity of African forests. Future developments in remote sensing should examine how multi-sensor integration of high-resolution data from instruments such as Planet, Tandem-X, SPOT and improved AI methods can refine forest composition, carbon storage and function maps, enhance large-scale monitoring of tree height and biomass dynamics, and improve forest degradation and deforestation detection down to tree level. These advancements will be essential for supporting science-based decision-making in forest conservation and climate mitigation.

TI  - Quantification by allometric equations of carbon sequestered by Tectona grandis in different agroforestry systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Non destructive methods for quantification of carbon sequestration in tropical trees are inadequately developed. We described a standardized method for estimating carbon stock in teak (Tectona grandis Linn. F.). We developed linear allometric equations using girth at breast height (GBH), height and age to quantify above ground biomass (AGB). We used AGB to estimate carbon stock for teak trees of different age groups (1.5, 3.5, 7.5, 13.5, 18.5 and 23.5 years). The regression equation with GBH, y = 3.174x -21.27, r(2)=0.898 (p < 0.01), was found precise and convenient due to the difficulty in determination of height and age in dense natural forests of teak. The equation was evaluated in teak agroforestry systems that included Triticum aestivum (wheat), Cicer arietinum (gram), Withania somnifera (ashwagandha), Avena fatua (wild oat) and Hordeum vulgare (barley) as agricultural crops established at Tropical Forest Research Institute, Jabalpur, M.P. (India). The annual carbon stock gain in teak in different agroforestry systems was in the order: teak-barley (60.47%) > teak-wheat (56.92%) > teak-wild oat (54.94%) > teak-gram (37.15%) > teak-ashwagandha (11.86%). The results from GBH-based regression equations provided satisfactory estimates of carbon stock in tropical trees.

TI  - Monitoring and estimating tropical forest carbon stocks: making REDD a reality
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation in developing countries is of central importance in efforts to combat climate change. Key scientific challenges must be addressed to prevent any policy roadblocks. Foremost among the challenges is quantifying nations' carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, which requires information on forest clearing and carbon storage. Here we review a range of methods available to estimate national-level forest carbon stocks in developing countries. While there are no practical methods to directly measure all forest carbon stocks across a country, both ground-based and remote-sensing measurements of forest attributes can be converted into estimates of national carbon stocks using allometric relationships. Here we synthesize, map and update prominent forest biomass carbon databases to create the first complete set of national-level forest carbon stock estimates. These forest carbon estimates expand on the default values recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guidelines and provide a range of globally consistent estimates.

TI  - Effects of land use change on turnover and storage of soil organic matter in a tropical forest
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Land-use change of tropical forests causes loss of soil organic matter and plant productivity. Effects of fallow or plantation vegetation on soil organic matter storage need to be clarified to optimize land-use that maximizes soil organic matter storage and plant productivity. Methods We compared 30-year changes in soil carbon stocks and litter decomposition under different land-uses (primary dipterocarp forest, Macaranga forest, Imperata grassland, transition of Imperata grassland to Acacia plantation, transition of Imperata grassland to oil palm plantation) in Indonesia. Results The Imperata grassland maximizes soil carbon stocks for up to 10 years due to considerable root litter inputs, but additional organic matter storage is limited over the following 20 years, due to high grass litter decomposability in the less acidified soil. The conversion of Imperata grassland to oil palm plantation causes greatest loss of soil organic matter, whereas Acacia plantation on Imperata grassland or the Macaranga forest maximizes soil carbon stocks due to input of recalcitrant forest litters and reduced microbial activities in the acidified soils. Conclusion Farmers could adopt short-term (<10 years) grass fallow or longer-term (>10 years) fallow under Acacia plantation on Imperata grassland or Macaranga regeneration forest to maximize soil organic matter storage. The optimum and feasible land-use strategies should be selected based on the length of fallow period and the original acidity of soil.

TI  - Seasonal nitrous oxide emissions from different land uses and their controlling factors in a tropical riparian ecosystem
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An important ecological service provided by tropical riparian ecosystems is the mitigation of nutrient pollution (e.g. nitrate) from surrounding agricultural areas. However, a negative impact of this nutrient remediation may be that the ecozone also functions as a major emitter of nitrous oxide (N2O). We hypothesized that the high inorganic nitrogen, organic carbon, and soil water content in tropical riparian ecosystems enhances N2O production through rapid nitrification and denitrification processes. This study was therefore designed to quantify the variability in N2O emissions in such an ecosystem in northern Thailand with specific emphasis on (1) different land uses (comparing replicate leguminous reforestation areas with conventional maize agriculture with high rates of nitrogen fertilizer addition), and (2) temporal aspects (comparing wet and dry seasons). Our aim was to quantify N2O emissions and to identify the major drivers controlling these emissions. Using in situ closed chambers the annual average emissions of N2O from the leguminous reforestation area (3.3 kg N2O-N ha(-1) y(-1)) was significantly higher than agricultural areas with maize (2.2 kg N2O-N ha(-1) y(-1))). The seasonal variation results indicated that the rate of N2O flux in the wet season was higher than in the dry season. The variations of N2O emission rates were strongly correlated with water filled pore space (WFPS), denitrification, and microbial biomass C, but not with nitrification. This study indicates that when inorganic N and soil organic C are sufficient, WFPS plays an important role in controlling N2O emissions from denitrification. Comparatively, annual N2O emissions from the tropical riparian reforestation were similar to that reported for temperate riparian forests and other ecosystems. Although the annual N2O emissions from the maize agricultural area were comparable to other crops cultivated in riparian ecosystems, it was higher than the N2O fluxes from crops grown in non-riparian zones. We conclude that agricultural lands located in tropical riparian zones do not represent a major hotspot of N2O emissions and that this does not diminish the positive benefits they provide in relation to other aspects of ecosystem service provision.

TI  - Protecting tropical forests from the rapid expansion of rubber using carbon payments
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Expansion of Hevea brasiliensis rubber plantations is a resurgent driver of deforestation, carbon emissions, and biodiversity loss in Southeast Asia. Southeast Asian rubber extent is massive, equivalent to 67% of oil palm, with rapid further expansion predicted. Results-based carbon finance could dis-incentivise forest conversion to rubber, but efficacy will be limited unless payments match, or at least approach, the costs of avoided deforestation. These include opportunity costs (timber and rubber profits), plus carbon finance scheme setup (transaction) and implementation costs. Using comprehensive Cambodian forest data, exploring scenarios of selective logging and conversion, and assuming land-use choice is based on net present value, we find that carbon prices of $30-$51 per tCO(2) are needed to break even against costs, higher than those currently paid on carbon markets or through carbon funds. To defend forests from rubber, either carbon prices must be increased, or other strategies are needed, such as corporate zero-deforestation pledges, and governmental regulation and enforcement of forest protection.

TI  - Building a socio-ecological monitoring platform for the comprehensive management of tropical dry forests
T2  - PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET
M3  - Review
AB  - Societal Impact Statement Tropical dry forests (TDF) underpin the wellbeing of millions, mostly rural populations; yet have suffered from severe clearing in Colombia, triggering cascading effects such as desertification. By engaging scientists, society, and institutions in the establishment of platforms for monitoring biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, crucial knowledge gaps will be bridged, helping to find a path toward sustainable development. Science-led but socially and economically anchored information on biodiversity will help to incorporate nature's contributions to people into the society's cultural values. Ultimately, these transformative actions will translate into the comprehensive management of TDF through a greater impact in decision making.SummaryThousands of permanent plots have been established across the tropics with the purpose of monitoring tree communities. Research outcomes from these platforms, however, have been mainly directed toward the academic community, and their contribution to society has been limited so far. Here, we show how generating robust data on biodiversity has supported decision making in Colombian tropical dry forests (TDF), where less than 8% of their original cover remains. As a first step to build a national dialogue around the critical status of this ecosystem, a national collaborative network on TDF research and monitoring was born in 2014, the Red de Investigacion y Monitoreo del Bosque Seco Tropical en Colombia (Red BST-Col). Our main goal is to generate scientifically sound information that feeds into the comprehensive management of this ecosystem. To do so, a set of biodiversity monitoring platforms has been established across the country, which have already served to answer socio-ecological questions related with deforestation drivers, citizen science, or the valuation of ecosystem services. Overall, this research agenda has nurtured the four lines that underpin the Program for the comprehensive management of dry forests in Colombia (knowledge management, preservation, restoration, and sustainable use), formulated by the Humboldt Institute, the United Nations Development Programme, and the Ministry of Environment in 2019. Many challenges are ahead, however, for a complex territory where multiple social actors and productive sectors coexist. The ultimate goal is to integrate all the dimensions of biodiversity to achieve a synthetic understanding of the functioning of the most endangered ecosystem in Colombia, and its relationship with local communities' wellbeing.

TI  - Response of phyllostomid bat diversity to tree cover types in North-western Ecuador
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural activities affect tropical forest biodiversity; however, some bat species can survive under these anthropogenic changes. We described the characteristics of phyllostomid bat assemblages in tree covers located in 48 plots among four agricultural landscapes of North-western Ecuador. Bats were captured with mist nets installed at a ground level reaching three meters' height. For each of the plots, we installed a mist net in four types of tree cover (polyspecific live fences, monospecific live fences, cacao plantations, and isolated trees in pastures). We captured 250 phyllostomid bats belonging to 16 species with a trapping effort of 19,200 m2 of net coverage. Polyspecific live fences showed significant differences in relative abundance, richness, and diversity of phyllostomid bats compared to the other three. Frugivorous and nectarivorous guilds were the most abundant, and also exhibited the highest richness among other guilds present in agricultural landscapes. In addition, frugivorous, and nectarivorous guilds increase their abundance and richness in agricultural landscapes, while the animalivorous guild is negatively affected. We recommend installing polyspecific live fences in tropical production systems to support the conservation of phyllostomid bats. We conclude that living fences composed of various plant species favour the abundance, richness, and diversity of phyllostomid bats.

TI  - Unexpectedly large impact of forest management and grazing on global vegetation biomass
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon stocks in vegetation have a key role in the climate system(1-4). However, the magnitude, patterns and uncertainties of carbon stocks and the effect of land use on the stocks remain poorly quantified. Here we show, using state-of-the-art datasets, that vegetation currently stores around 450 petagrams of carbon. In the hypothetical absence of land use, potential vegetation would store around 916 petagrams of carbon, under current climate conditions. This difference highlights the massive effect of land use on biomass stocks. Deforestation and other land-cover changes are responsible for 53-58% of the difference between current and potential biomass stocks. Land management effects (the biomass stock changes induced by land use within the same land cover) contribute 42-47%, but have been underestimated in the literature. Therefore, avoiding deforestation is necessary but not sufficient for mitigation of climate change. Our results imply that trade-offs exist between conserving carbon stocks on managed land and raising the contribution of biomass to raw material and energy supply for the mitigation of climate change. Efforts to raise biomass stocks are currently verifiable only in temperate forests, where their potential is limited. By contrast, large uncertainties hinder verification in the tropical forest, where the largest potential is located, pointing to challenges for the upcoming stocktaking exercises under the Paris agreement.

TI  - Lower land-use emissions responsible for increased net land carbon sink during the slow warming period
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The terrestrial carbon sink accelerated during 1998-2012, concurrently with the slow warming period, but the mechanisms behind this acceleration are unclear. Here we analyse recent changes in the net land carbon sink (NLS) and its driving factors, using atmospheric inversions and terrestrial carbon models. We show that the linear trend of NLS during 1998-2012 is about 0.17 +/- 0.05 Pg C yr(-2), which is three times larger than during 1980-1998 (0.05 +/- 0.05 Pg C yr(-2)). According to terrestrial carbon model simulations, the intensification of the NLS cannot be explained by CO2 fertilization or climate change alone. We therefore use a bookkeeping model to explore the contribution of changes in land-use emissions and find that decreasing land-use emissions are the dominant cause of the intensification of the NLS during the slow warming period. This reduction of land-use emissions is due to both decreased tropical forest area loss and increased afforestation in northern temperate regions. The estimate based on atmospheric inversions shows consistently reduced land-use emissions, whereas another bookkeeping model did not reproduce such changes, probably owing to missing the signal of reduced tropical deforestation. These results highlight the importance of better constraining emissions from land-use change to understand recent trends in land carbon sinks.

TI  - Soil organic carbon variation under sub-tropical forest of Himachal Pradesh, India
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is important to estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) content of natural forests for an understanding of the Himalayan ecosystem. In this study SOC concentration was evaluated at three different soil depths (0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm) under Anogeissus latifolia (site I) and Pinus roxburghii (site II) forest stands in Himachal Pradesh, India. SOC (%) in these forests ranged from 0.37% to 2.20% up to 30 cm soil depth and was higher at site I compared to site II. Tree density was also more at site I than site II. The present study shows that the tree species can influence SOC of the forest ecosystem, but other environmental parameters such as soil type, moisture and pH are also responsible for changes in the soil carbon sequestration potential. Carbon sequestration in the study area showed significant contribution in minimizing the increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and improving soil quality.

TI  - Agroforestry Systems
T2  - CARBON SEQUESTRATION IN AGRICULTURAL ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Agroforestry implies the inclusion of trees or other woody perennials within farming systems to capture the interactive benefits of perennials and seasonals, and/or animals for sustainable agricultural production. Among the benefits is the greater ability of agroforestry systems to capture and utilize growth resources (i.e., light, nutrients, water) compared to single-species systems. Agroforestry systems are estimated to cover about 10 million km(2) of agricultural land globally. Estimates for carbon (C) sequestration potential above- and belowground over 50 years range between 1.1 and 2.2 Pg (1 Pg = 1Gt = 10(15)g) C yr(-1), but these numbers are highly uncertain. Land-use practices for agroforestry systems are very diverse. In the tropics, this includes alley cropping, homegardens, improved fallows, multi-purpose trees on farms and rangelands, silvopastoral grazing systems, shaded perennial-crop systems, shelterbelts, windbreaks, and taungya (i.e., growing agricultural crops during early stages of establishment of forestry plantations). Furthermore, alley cropping, forest farming, riparian buffer strips, silvopasture, and windbreaks are agroforestry practices in temperate regions. Thus, agroforestry systems are structurally and functionally more complex than either croplands or pastures or tree monocultures. Also, the greater efficiency of growth resource capture and utilization enhances net carbon (C) sequestration in soils under agroforestry compared to those under crops and pastures. Trees capture large amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) during photosynthesis, and transfer a fraction to the soil as surface and subsurface input which may eventually be sequestered. However, data on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and sequestration of agroforestry systems are scanty. The few published data vary greatly depending on the agroforestry system, species composition and age, geographical location, environmental factors, and management practices. For example, 1.25 and 302 Mg C ha(-1) may be stored to 40 cm depth in a Canadian alley cropping system and to 100 cm depth in a cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) agroforestry system in Brazil, respectively. Furthermore, sequestration rates of up to 7.4 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in the top 0-10 or 0-20 cm soil depth have been reported. Land-use conversion from less complex systems such as agricultural system to agroforestry systems may, particularly, increase SOC stocks. However, lack of standard methods and procedures does not allow any firm conclusions about the C sequestration potential of agroforestry soils. Furthermore, any generalizations about the SOC sequestration potential of agroforestry systems are hampered by interrelated and site-specific factors such as agroecological conditions and management practices. This chapter begins with a comparison of different tropical and temperate agroforestry practices. This is followed by a discussion about afforestation of denuded lands and associated changes in SOC stocks and its importance for the role of trees for SOC sequestration in agroforests. Then, an overview is given about SOC stocks and sequestration in existing agroforestry systems, and also for those after conversion from other land uses. This chapter concludes with a list of recommendations to enhance SOC sequestration in agroforests.

TI  - Quantifying Tree Diversity, Carbon Stocks, and Sequestration Potential for Diverse Land Uses in Northeast India
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the modern era, rapid anthropogenic activities in the vicinity of the Himalayas disturb the carbon sequestration potential resulting in climate change. For the first time, this study estimates the biomass and carbon storage potential of Northeast India's diverse land uses through a biomass estimation model developed for this region. The mean tree density in tropical, subtropical, and temperate forests was 539, 554, and 638 trees ha(-1), respectively. The mean vegetation carbon stock was the highest for temperate forests (122.09 Mg C ha(-1)), followed by subtropical plantations (115.45 Mg C ha(-1)), subtropical forests (106.01 Mg C ha(-1)), tropical forests (105.33 Mg C ha(-1)), tropical plantations (93.00 Mg C ha(-1)), and temperate plantations (50.10 Mg C ha(-1)). Among the forests, the mean soil organic carbon (SOC) stock up to 45 cm depth was the highest for tropical forests (72.54 Mg C ha(-1)), followed by temperate forests (63.4 Mg C ha(-1)) and subtropical forests (42.58 Mg C ha(-1)). A strong relationship between the tree basal area and biomass carbon storage was found for all land-use types. The land-use transformation from agriculture to agroforestry, and grassland to plantations increased both vegetation carbon (VC) and SOC stocks. The corresponding increase in VC and SOC was 40.80 and 43.34 Mg C ha(-1), respectively, in the former, and 83.18 and 97.64 Mg C ha(-1) in the latter. In general, the landscape-level estimates were drawn from site-level estimates in a given land-use type, and therefore, the corresponding values might be overestimated. Nevertheless, the results provide baseline information on carbon stock which may serve as a reference for devising appropriate land-use change policies in the region.</p>

TI  - Active versus passive restoration: Recovery of cloud forest structure, diversity and soil condition in abandoned pastures
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical montane cloud forest is a priority ecosystem for restoration due to the diversity and ecosystem services it provides and because it is under severe threat. Forest restoration can be achieved by active interventions and/or natural regeneration (passive restoration). However, there has been little comparison of the effectiveness of active versus passive restoration strategies and even fewer studies have monitored the long-term success of forest restoration practices. We assessed the effectiveness of active (mixed plantation with native species) and passive (areas adjacent and non-adjacent to mature cloud forest) restoration strategies implemented in pastures with 21 years of exclosure, and compared these to a mature cloud forest (reference system), in eastern Mexico. In the mature forest and in the areas represented by each restoration strategy, similar to 15 plots (200 m(2)) were established in order to assess forest structure, tree diversity and soil properties as indicators of restoration success. Active restoration proved more effective than passive restoration at recovering forest structure (e.g. higher basal area, tree density and height). Adult tree diversity was similar across all restoration sites and the mature forest, while composition differed greatly between the mature forest and each of the restoration sites, from which the characteristic mature cloud forest tree species were mostly absent. The restoration sites presented very low tree seedling density (0.39 individuals/m(2)) relative to the mature forest (1.68 seedlings/m(2)), probably due to the higher cover of climbers, ferns, grasses and shrubs found in the understory of the restoration sites (similar to 78%), compared to that of the mature forest (8%). In all of the restoration sites, soil pH was higher, and carbon content in both the soil and litter was lower, than in the mature forest. This denotes a slow recovery of soil properties after use of the land as cattle pasture. In general, the passive restoration site non-adjacent to the forest presented the lowest recovery (lower canopy cover, composition similarity and seedling density), indicating the importance of proximity to seed sources. Our results highlight the need, in both actively and passively restored areas, for management practices such as enrichment planting, in order to assist tree seedling recruitment of key species and recovery of forest attributes. Active and passive restoration strategies could be implemented as complementary strategies for the restoration of cloud forest landscapes.

TI  - WHAT FUTURE FOR ASIA'S LOWLAND TROPICAL EVERGREEN FORESTS?
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Little now remains of the lowland dipterocarp forest, logged over the last fifty years as home markets were neglected in favour of exportation, increasingly exacerbated by conversion to oil palm on those soils where techniques for sustainable silvicultural management had become known. What remains will be amenable only to selective silvicultural management methods based on deep knowledge of tree flora, growth rates, and methods developed by continuing research and trials, with oversight by highly trained researchers and technicians. These will be costly. In view of the increasing global value of tropical forests for atmospheric carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation, as well as for local and regional services, success must depend on international investment and support. But a residue of traditional forest knowledge and skills still resides among traditional forest communities. By investing in them, the desperately needed diversification of rural economies can still be achieved.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration in Cropland Soils
T2  - CARBON SEQUESTRATION IN AGRICULTURAL ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Humans began to cultivate land thousands of years ago, for growing crops after clearing the previous vegetation cover and plowing the soil. The soil disturbance altered, in particular, soil C dynamics which has recently been exacerbated by the increase in crop intensification (i.e., fertilization, irrigation, liming, mechanization). This has resulted in major losses of terrestrial carbon (C); i.e., global emissions by the expansion of agriculture for croplands were estimated at 98.4 Pg C for the period 1850-2015. Cropland management can alter soil inorganic carbon (SIC) stocks which, in arid and semiarid climates, can be similar to or more than the amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock. However, whether a specific practice leads to a net sequestration of SIC in cropland soils needs additional research. Otherwise, the conversion of land to cropland in temperate regions may release up to 36% of the SOC stock to 27 cm depth, and up to 30% of the SOC stock to 48 cm depth in tropical regions. In 2000, about 12% of Earth's ice-free land surface or 15 million km(2) was used for croplands. Climate, geology, and land and crop management practices control the magnitude of the cropland SOC stock. A major fraction (25-70%) of the carbon dioxide (CO2) fixed during crop photosynthesis by gross primary production (GPP) is respired autotrophically (R-a) back to the atmosphere. Estimates of global cropland GPP vary between 8.2 and 20.0 Pg C yr(-1) (1 Pg = 10(15) g). The remaining net primary production (NPP = GPP - Ra) is the main C input into cropland soils. Cropland NPP includes the production of biomass in foliage, shoots and roots, weed and seed production, root exudation, the carbon (C) transfer to microorganisms that are symbiotically associated with roots, and the volatile organic carbon (VOC) emissions that are lost from leaves to the atmosphere. However, not all components of cropland NPP have yet been measured in a single study. NPP enters soil by rhizodeposition and decomposition of plant litter, but the major fraction is heterotrophically converted back to CO2 by soil respiration and some is lost as methane (CH4). Aside decomposition, C losses from croplands soils occur also by fire, erosion, leaching, and harvest. Thus, a small amount of fixed C remains in cropland soils and accumulates as SOC due to a combination of short- and long-term stabilization processes. Stabilization processes include physical protection of organic matter (OM) against decomposers and their enzymes, stabilization by organo-mineral complexes and organo-metal interactions, and some as biochemically recalcitrant black carbon (BC). Soil aggregation, in particular, may be the most important stabilization process in the surface layers of cropland soils. Site-specific factors including climate, physicochemical characteristics, soil and vegetation management determine the balance between C input and losses. Cropland soils can be recarbonized through the adoption of recommended management practices (RMPs) such as conservation tillage, residue mulching and use of cover crops, practices which all contribute to SOC accumulation and sequestration by an additional transfer of C from the atmosphere to the soil. Translating science of cropland soil management into a global restorative program is a high priority for feeding the world, mitigating climate change and improving the environment.

In the present investigation, AGNPP was limited by multiple nutrients and environmental factors like temperature and moisture. The importance of the small patchy area in carbon sequestration and their role in regional carbon balance under the influence of abiotic factors including soil resources was undertaken. Considering the importance of resources and abiotic factors in the carbon sequestration potential of forest ecosystem in low latitudinal belt, while framing the mitigation mechanism of climate change, emphasis should be given on the enhancement of soil fertility to improve resource capture prioritized in such region and further study on traits related with aboveground components should be emphasized in the study of carbon sequestration in the forest ecosystem of such region.

AB  - Migratory nectarivorous bats provide important ecological services throughout their ranges, particularly for their food plants. These services include pollinating food plants, dispersing seeds, and reducing genetic isolation in plant populations. However, many important food plants occur in imperiled ecosystems, particularly in tropical dry forests. We assessed the conservation status of lands containing high richness of food plants for three migratory nectarivores-the Mexican long-tongued bat (Choeronycteris mexicana), the Mexican long-nosed bat (Leptonycteris nivalis), and the lesser long-nosed bat (Leptonycteris yerbabuenae)-throughout their ranges including migratory, transition, and resident habitat zones. We found low to moderate levels of land protection in regions with high chiropterophilic plant diversity, but this may be offset by sustainable agroforestry, cultivation, and in-situ management. The models we used are available as an ArcGIS map package to help allocate conservation and restoration efforts on the ground. Our results support the need for greater land protection throughout the Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra Madre Oriental to increase contiguity of protected lands and potential stopover habitat for migratory nectarivorous bats. Additionally, our data show the need for greater land protection in southern resident zones to enhance year-round habitat for nectarivorous bats in the face of rapid deforestation.

TI  - Managing rubber plantations for advancing climate change mitigation strategy
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Storing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in a long-term reservoir is one of the viable strategies to decelerate the climate change phenomenon. Terrestrial vegetation, especially forestry and agroforestry systems have been prioritized to stock CO2 through phototropic sequestration. Rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), primarily managed for latex production, is explored in this contribution for its role in vegetation carbon stock management and climate change mitigation. The present study was carried out in selected Hevea stands aged between 5 and 40 years from Barak Valley, part of North East India. A total of 67 trees were harvested to estimate the biomass carbon stock in above-and below-ground components in plantations of different age groups. The study revealed that plantation density of 688-784 trees ha(-1) is managed under plantations of different age groups. Total biomass (above and below ground) increased from 41 kg tree(-1) under 5-10 years to 307 kg tree(-1) under 30-40 years age group of plantations. Total vegetation carbon stock (Mg ha(-1); above and below ground) ranged from 16.00 (5-10 years) to 105.73 (30-40 years), which is more than many tropical forestry and agroforestry systems across the world. Vegetation carbon sequestration rate revealed that 2.56 mg C ha(-1) year(-1) organic carbon is being accumulated in Hevea plantations. Considering the economic profitability from Hevea plantation management (through latex production) and its capability to stock high-biomass carbon, restoring degraded and secondary forests through this species will improve livelihood security and advance climate change mitigation strategies.

TI  - Tree community, vegetation structure and aboveground carbon storage in Atlantic tropical forests of Cameroon.
T2  - Heliyon
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Understanding Atlantic tropical forests' ecological dynamics and carbon storage potential in Cameroon is crucial for guiding sustainable management and conservation strategies. These forests play a significant role in carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. This study aimed to fill existing knowledge gaps by characterising plant communities, assessing the vegetation structure, and quantifying the potential of carbon stocks. Twelve 1-ha permanent plots were established within the Atlantic forests of Okoroba and Yingui to achieve these objectives. All the trees with diameters at breast height (DBH) ≥10cm were inventoried, and various environmental data, including soil texture and climate information, were collected. The Multivariate Regression Trees (MRT) technique was employed to analyse species composition and identify different plant communities (PCs). Additionally, multiple regression models were used to examine the effects of environmental variables and stand size structure on non-destructive carbon stock assessments. The MRT analysis was conducted on 6425 trees spanning 317 species, 212 genera and 60 families, and it identified three distinct PCs with unique species compositions and environmental preferences. The study revealed variations in tree density, ranging from 425 to 645Nha-1, and basal area, from 32 to 38 m2ha-1 among PCs and forest types. Although carbon stocks did not differ significantly between the PCs, they varied in distribution, ranging from 195 to 203MgC.ha-1. A single-factor model indicated a significant correlation between tree density with DBH ≥50cm and aboveground biomass variability (R2=0.86). A multi-factor model, considering DBH ranges of 10-30cm and 30-50cm, explained 93% and 94% of biomass variability, respectively, incorporating elevation and other tree density factors. These findings enhance our understanding of carbon dynamics in Atlantic forests and support conservation and sustainable management practices. They highlight the importance of biodiversity protection in mitigating climate change and maintaining ecosystem health.

Sp.Matrix.point1: Column 1 are the different point-count stations numbered 1-108 (1-48 are in unlogged forests, 49-72 are in naturally regenerating logged forests, 73-108 are in restored logged forests). Row 1 are the scientific names for the avian species and below them are the abundances or absences (0) of the species that occur at the different point-count stations. Sp.Matrix.Mist: Column 1 are the different transects with names UL in unlogged forests, NR in naturally regenerating logged forests and R in restored logged forests. Row 1 are the scientific names for the avian species and below them are the abundances or absences (0) of the species that occur at the different transects. Data collection method: Two avian communities (overall bird community, understorey bird community) were sampled in 3 habitat types (unlogged forests, naturally regenerating logged forests, restored logged forests) in the lowland dry dipterocarp forests of the one million hectare Yayasan Sabah (YS) logging concession in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Data for both communities were extracted from Ansell et al. (2011) and Edwards et al. (2013, 2014a). Overall bird community (Point Count Data): Point count surveys with unlimited-radius were conducted from May - September 2008 and May - June 2009. At sites created within each habitat type, we sampled 12 point-count stations per site with each station separated by 250 m (48 point-count stations in unlogged forests, 24 in naturally regenerating forests, and 36 in restored forests). Point-count surveys occurred for 15 minutes on three consecutive days from 0545 - 1000 h. Each site was only sampled in one year, and any temporal effects (within or between years) were minimized by rotating sampling between the different habitat types. The highest number of individual birds recorded for a certain species on any of the three days was taken as our estimate of maximum abundance but not the species true abundance, which is unknown. All point counts were conducted by a single experienced observer (D. P. Edwards) to minimise the potential for observer bias. Understorey bird community (Mist Net Data): Mist netting was conducted from June - October 2007, May - September 2008 and May - July 2009. Fifty-four transects were created (18 transects in unlogged primary forests, 18 in naturally regenerating logged forests and 18 in restored logged forests) with transects within each habitat placed at least 500 m apart. Each transect contained 15 mist nets (12 x 2.7 m; mesh size 25 mm) placed end to end. Sampling occurred for three consecutive days from 0600 - 1200 h. Each site was only sampled in one year, and any temporal effects (i.e., within or between years) were minimized by rotating sampling between the different habitat types. To ensure that individual birds were sampled only once, each bird was marked with a uniquely numbered metal leg ring. Totalling the unique individuals of each species across the three sampling days gave an estimate of maximum abundance, but not a species true abundance, which is unknown. References Ansell, F. A., D.

TI  - Conversion of a tropical forest into agroforest alters the fine root-related carbon flux to the soil
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Large areas of remaining tropical forests are affected by anthropogenic disturbances of various intensities. These disturbances alter the structure of the forest ecosystem and consequently its carbon budget. We analysed the role of fine root dynamics in the soil carbon budget of tropical moist forests in Southeast Asia along a gradient of increasing disturbance intensity. Fine root production, fine root turnover, and the associated carbon fluxes from the fine root system to the soil were estimated with three different approaches in five stands ranging from an old growth forest with negligible anthropogenic disturbance to a cacao agroforestry system with planted shade trees. Annual fine root production and mortality in three natural forest sites with increasing canopy openness decreased continuously with increasing forest disturbance, with a reduction of more than 45% between the undisturbed forest and the forest with large timber extraction. Cacao agroforestry stands had higher fine root production and mortality rates than forest with large timber extraction but less than undisturbed forest. The amount of carbon annually transferred to the soil carbon pool through fine root mortality was highest in the undisturbed forest and generally decreased with increasing forest use intensity. However, root-related C flux was also relatively high in the plantation with planted shading trees. In contrast, the relative importance of C transfer from root death in the total above- and below-ground C input to the soil increased with increasing forest use intensity and was even similar to the C input via leaf litter fall in the more intensively managed agroforest. We conclude that moderate to heavy disturbance in South-east Asian tropical moist forests has a profound impact on fine root turnover and the related carbon transfer to the soil.

T2  - MADERA Y BOSQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Trees have played an important role in the development of civilizations, both for provisioning of resources and for other environmental services. However, there is a strong decrease in the quantity and diversity of tropical forests trees due to land use changes. One of the main causes of this situation is the livestock activity, which in the state of Veracruz, Mexico, occupies a surface of about 3.7 million hectares (representing 50.6% of its territory). The objective of this study was to research into cattle ranchers' knowledge of arboreal species, their uses, their cultural importance and the changes that have taken place over time. Sixty eight species of trees were mentioned and their uses were classified in 22 types of uses. The cultural importance index was calculated for each species and the most important changes in the communities' lifestyle were described. The results showed that ranchers have a wide knowledge about trees but it is rapidly disappearing. Trees are used not only to get benefits for the livestock activity but also to satisfy other needs of daily life. The quantity and diversity of arboreal species reflect the lifestyle, influences and changes over time within the communities. The decisions of ranchers configure the landscape, and therefore the recommendation is to increase the amount of trees, their conservation and uses to maintain the environmental services they provide.

TI  - Impacts of ecosystem service message framing and dynamic social norms on public support for tropical forest restoration
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The effectiveness of strategic psychology-based marketing techniques for increasing public support for conservation is poorly understood. We assessed how such techniques affect support for tropical rainforest restoration with a controlled online experiment with 1166 nationally representative residents of the United Kingdom. We tested whether support increased when adding ecosystem service (ES) framings to typical nongovernmental organizations' (NGOs) biodiversity-focused messages that emphasize benefits to UK residents or people living near the tropical restoration site and a dynamic social norm nudge that emphasized increasing popularity of environmental restoration. We considered how respondents' psychological traits (nature connection, self-efficacy, psychological benefits of supporting charities, awareness of environmental degradation in the Global South, and climate change skepticism) influenced responses. Outcomes included respondents' reported advertisement sufficiency, sympathetic attitudes, behavioral support, and financial support. The study population typically found advertisements sufficient and exhibited sympathetic attitudes and financial, but not behavioral, support. Younger people exhibited greater conservation support than older respondents. Messages framed solely on biodiversity conservation were as effective as those highlighting additional ES benefits received by UK residents and people near the tropical restoration site. This suggests that framing around ESs, rather than nature's intrinsic value, may not strengthen public support for conservation. The dynamic social norm nudge had perverse effects. It reduced perceived social norms and most outcome variables. Alternative dynamic norm nudges warrant testing, but our results support research suggesting dynamic norm nudges can be ineffective when associated with activism, challenging their use by conservation NGOs. Psychological benefits of supporting charities and perceived self-efficacy increased support for advertisements, highlighting the benefits of including impact statements relating respondents' support to specific outcomes. Climate change skepticism decreased support, whereas nature connection and perceived static social norms increased it, highlighting the need to increase nature connection and pro-environmental social norms to elevate public support for conservation.

TI  - Forbidden fire: Does criminalising fire hinder conservation efforts in swidden landscapes of the Brazilian Amazon?
T2  - GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Global environmental change has motivated multiple interventions in pursuit of sustainable outcomes within tropical forest landscapes. Fire is recognised as a key stressor facing forest conservation efforts. Large-scale accidental fires are increasingly prevalent across the forested tropics, generating negative impacts across sectors and scales. Policy responses to mega-fires in the Brazilian Amazon have been diverse but all are dominated by an anti-fire narrative that highlights long-stigmatised smallholder agricultural practices. Despite forest conservation initiatives and fire management policies, escaped fire (wildfire) remains pervasive. Forest conservation initiatives are often situated in contexts where swidden agriculture prevails, generating a need for an improved understanding of the interplay between fire management and conservation initiatives on the ground. We explore these dynamics through a case study approach in three leading forest conservation initiative types, situated across diverse contexts in the Brazilian Amazon: a Reduction of Emissions of Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) site (in Middle SolimA mu es region), an extractive reserve (RESEX) (in Arapiuns region), and a Green Municipality Pact (GMP) (in Paragominas). Between sites, climate and colonisation histories vary, yet all demonstrate that farmers experience the burden of escaped fire, attesting to the failure of fire management policies and suggesting that fire (as currently managed) threatens forest conservation goals. Restrictive fire management policies do not replace the necessity of fire-based agriculture and rather serve to disempower swidden farmers by making burning increasingly illicit. We show that awareness of fire-free alternatives exists, yet experience is limited and constraints are considerable. We argue that marginalising fire use in the context of forest conservation initiatives contributes to a legacy of failed interventions and jeopardises partnerships between communities and conservation practitioners. Finally, we suggest that given the absence of imminent and viable fire-free alternatives, particularly in sites where swidden and conservation collide, a new model of fire warrants experimentation.

TI  - Aboveground biomass mapping of La Trinidad forests in Benguet, Philippines, using Landsat Thematic Mapper data and k-nearest neighbor method
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was conducted to estimate the aboveground biomass (AGB) of the La Trinidad forests in Benguet, Philippines, using the following data: Landsat Thematic Mapper, forest map, and field data, utilizing the k-nearest neighbor method. A total of 35 plots were established in the Pinus kesiya forests of La Trinidad, Benguet. The root mean square error and bias of the different k values ranging from 1 to 20 and horizontal reference area (HRA) ranging from 4 km to 7 km were determined. Results of the evaluation showed that the optimum k value and HRA were 4 and 7 km, respectively. These values were used for AGB estimation, and results showed that the mean AGB of the La Trinidad forests was 240.46Mg/ha, which is higher than the previous studies that estimated the AGB of Pinus kesiya forests in other areas in the Philippines. Overall accuracy was also determined using the confusion matrix and results showed that the overall accuracy was 56%. It is suggested that the AGB map for Pinus kesiya could provide baseline information for considering the carbon-sink potential of this forest, which is essential for sustainable forest management of tropical forests.

TI  - QUANTIFYING THE CONSERVATION VALUE OF PLANTATION FORESTS FOR A MADAGASCAN HERPETOFAUNA
T2  - HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Plantations are becoming a dominant component of the forest landscape of Madagascar, yet there is very little information available regarding the implications of different forms of plantation agriculture for Madagascan reptiles and amphibians. I determined the conservation value of bamboo, secondary, open-canopy plantation, and closed-canopy plantation forests for reptiles and amphibians on the island of Nosy Komba, in the Sambirano region of north-west Madagascar. Assistants and I conducted 220 Visual Encounter Surveys between 29 January 2016 and 5 July 2017 and recorded 3,113 reptiles (32 species) and 751 amphibians (nine species). Closed-canopy plantation supported levels of alpha diversity and community compositions reflective of natural forest, including several threatened and forest-specialist species. Open-canopy plantation exhibited diminished herpetofaunal diversity and a distinct community composition dominated by disturbance-resistant generalist species. Woody tree density and bamboo density were positively correlated with herpetofaunal species richness, and plantation species richness, plantation species density, sapling density, and the proportion of wood ground cover were negatively associated with herpetofaunal diversity. I recommend the integration of closed-canopy plantations on Nosy Komba, and across wider Madagascar, to help mitigate the negative effects of secondary forest conversion for agriculture on Madagascan herpetofauna; however, it will be necessary to retain areas of natural forest to act as sources of biodiversity for agroforestry plantations. It will also be necessary to employ plantation management techniques that maintain environmental variables known to enhance alpha diversity.

TI  - Artificial light puts ecosystem services of frugivorous bats at risk
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - <list list-type="1" id="jpe12206-list-0001">Currently, tropical forests are transformed into pasture and agricultural areas at an unprecedented rate, yet converted areas are often abandoned by farmers because depleting soil fertility renders unprofitable any agricultural land use. Natural succession of abandoned land could counter the loss of biodiversity, but the rate of natural reforestation is slow.Neotropical frugivorous bats facilitate natural succession because they seem to tolerate habitat disturbance when dispersing seeds of pioneer plants. Under naturally dark conditions, bats produce a copious seed rain even in deforested habitats and connect distant forest fragments. Yet, artificial light at night may compromise bat-mediated seed dispersal if bats avoid lit areas. This may delay or jeopardize natural forest succession in fragmented tropical landscapes.We asked whether the foraging behaviour of Sowell's short-tailed bats Carollia sowelli, a specialist on infructescences of pepper plants (Piperaceae), is negatively affected by artificial light at night.First, in a dual choice experiment with captive bats, we demonstrate that food was less often explored and consumed in the dimly illuminated than in the dark compartment, indicating that artificial light alters the foraging behaviour of fruit-eating bats. Secondly, using observations in free-ranging bats, we found that infructescences were less likely to be harvested when plants were illuminated by a street lamp than under natural darkness.Synthesis and applications. Natural succession of deforested areas and connectivity of remaining forest patches may suffer due to artificial light at night through a reduction in nocturnal seed disperser activity in lit areas. This could have negative impacts on biodiversity and consequent effects on land erosion, particularly in developing countries of the tropics where light pollution increases rapidly with growing economies and human populations. Mitigation requires that the use of artificial light should be limited in space, time and intensity to the minimum necessary. The effectiveness of darkness corridors' to enhance fragment connectivity and to reduce species loss should be evaluated. Policy-makers of tropical countries should become aware of the potential detrimental effects of artificial lighting on wildlife and ecosystem functioning.Natural succession of deforested areas and connectivity of remaining forest patches may suffer due to artificial light at night through a reduction in nocturnal seed disperser activity in lit areas.

TI  - Do selective logging and pine plantations in humid subtropical forests affect aboveground primary productivity as well as carbon and nutrients transfer to soil?
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use changes due to forestry activities can alter forest carbon (C) sequestration capacity by modifying vegetation structure and ecosystem functioning. The main objective of this study was to analyze aboveground net primary productivity (aNPP), through stem growth and litterfall production, and their feedback on soil C and nutrient contents, within a humid subtropical region. Two main forestry activities in NE Argentina were studied: selectively logged forests and Pinus taeda (loblolly pine) plantations for wood production. Well-preserved native forests were used as a control to compare the effects of interventions on the original subtropical forests. Despite differences in tree density and aboveground biomass among forests and pine plantation stands, the aNPP and total annual litterfall were similar across all ecosystems. However, litterfall quality and soil N content were substantially lower in pine plantations compared to both native forests. The labile soil C fractions were higher in pine plantations than native forests while no differences were observed in recalcitrant humic fractions across ecosystems. Overall, the results of this study suggest that man-made intervention in the structure of forest ecosystems does not necessarily result in degradation of aboveground ecosystem processes but had an impact on belowground processes and stocks in pine plantations, which has important implications for forest management.

TI  - The long-term effects of active management and landscape characteristics on carbon accumulation and diversity within a seasonal dry tropical ecosystem
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reforestation is the largest natural climate solution, while potentially reversing the biodiversity crisis, especially in tropical countries. Dry tropical forests are of particular interest because they experienced greater historic loss, and offer large reforestation opportunities. This study addressed the potential of secondary forests in dry tropical systems regenerating after 60 + years in cattle pasture to accumulate carbon while increasing floristic diversity. Total carbon and woody species diversity were quantified within experimental treatments established 15 years ago. Initial active management practices included removing exotic grass with herbicide, excluding cattle by constructing live fences, and monitoring succession relative to proximity to forested riparian zones and slope position. Overall, carbon accumulated relatively slowly in this landscape (1.30 MgC Ha(-1) Yr(-1)). Differences were seen between management practices and landscape characteristics. Lower slope plots, adjacent to forested zones, had significantly more carbon than upper slope plots, isolated from riparian zones. The initial application of herbicide decreased total carbon. However, natural regeneration of two valuable timber species with small seeds, Astronium graveolens and Cedrela odorata, benefited from this initial treatment. Live fences that were initially planted to exclude cattle significantly increased carbon of regenerating woody species. Lianas were abundant at this successional stage. Almost half of all inventoried trees (44%) had at least one liana climbing through them, with the most common species being Bauhinia glabra and Macherium microfolium. Some valuable timber tree species found within older, protected riparian forests were not yet regenerating in any treatment, such as the wind-dispersed species, Cieba pentandra, and the animal dispersed species, Hymenaea coubaril. These species may need to be actively planted at the mid-successional stage (similar to 15-20 years) to restore biodiversity. A trade-off between timber value, diversity, and carbon sequestration must be considered in reforestation programs and this depends on landscape characteristics and management. Passive management, even with invasive grass species, is a practical option when sites are located near forested riparian zones due to low cost and high timber value of a suite of native species that naturally regenerate. No intervention is needed other than continual protection from fire and grazing. However, low-cost management, such cutting lianas and enrichment planting at the mid-successional stage, is likely to increase carbon accumulation and diversity. More active management, such as planting drought-tolerant, higher timber value tree species, is recommended at sites isolated from forested riparian zones on upper slopes where carbon accumulation is lower. Tropical forest regeneration mechanisms in proximity to forest fragments can be surprisingly resilient if chronic human impacts are removed.

TI  - Potential of slash-and-mulch system with legumes to conserve soil attributes and macrofauna diversity in Eastern Amazon
T2  - PEDOBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Slash-and-burn agriculture has been practiced for thousands of years in the tropics and is sustainable in con-ditions of low population density, and long fallow. However, the population increase leads to intensification, and consequently the reduction of fallow, productivity, and sustainability. Then, public and private institutions with farmers, are seeking alternatives to replace this farming system. The slash-and-mulch technique for smallholder farmers is widespread in Central America and has the potential to be transferred to other regions. Nonetheless, little information is available about its potential for the eastern Amazon. The soil macrofauna is associated with soil quality and agricultural sustainability as it plays a key role in the provision of ecosystem services. Higher taxa of this fauna are often used to evaluate soil management, given that they are influenced by land-use and produce a fast response. Therefore, this study evaluates the short-term effects of the slash-and-burn or the slash -and-mulch system, after different durations of fallow on the composition, density, and diversity of the soil macrofauna higher taxa and selected physical and chemical attributes. Results are compared to old-growth forest and secondary forest fragments. The slash-and-mulch fields had soil fertility attributes similar to slash-and-burn and macrofauna diversity and composition were similar to forests. In particular, functional groups like ecosystem engineers or predators augmented with slash-and-mulch and were efficient indicators of land-use change. Despite its scarcity and their very high fragmentation, old-growth forest small remnants do conserve a more diverse and abundant soil invertebrates community of saprophages and predators, therefore their conservation is of utmost importance. This is the first study to show the potential of the slash-and-mulch system in this region to enhance the resilience of the smallholders' landscapes. Nonetheless, soil quality needs to be monitored to confirm the effective restoration of soil functionality and agriculture productivity.

TI  - Functional diversity and stability of litter-invertebrate communities following land-use change in Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical land-use intensification is rapidly increasing in regions that harbour high levels of biodiversity, thus posing a serious threat to the stability and resilience of tropical ecosystems and the important ecosystem services that they provide. We compared functional group richness and functional dispersion in litter-invertebrate communities among four different land-use systems, ranging in intensity from primary degraded lowland forest to oil-palm agriculture in two landscapes on Sumatra, Indonesia. We then investigated the consequences for functional stability and community resilience by calculating functional redundancy and response diversity of sampled communities. From primary degraded forest to intensively managed oil-palm systems, we found a 46% decrease in species richness and a 48% reduction in density, but weaker effects on functional group richness and an increase in functional dispersion. Although we detected no significant alteration of response diversity, functional redundancy of litter-invertebrate communities decreased clearly by losing 37% of functionally redundant species due to land-use change. Our results indicate that land-use change, from tropical rainforest to oil-palm agriculture, can alter both taxonomic and functional diversity of litter-invertebrate communities, resulting in the loss of functional redundancy and thus functional stability of these ecosystems. However, we also show that land-use systems of intermediate management intensity, such as jungle-rubber agroforestry, could serve as reservoirs of functional diversity and stability in monoculture-dominated production landscapes. 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Evaluation of reclamation success in an open-pit coal mine using integrated soil physical, chemical and biological quality indicators
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The evaluation and success of ecological reclamation can be assessed by measuring soil physical, chemical and biological variables, either in isolation or combined into composite indicators. In this study we tested the suitability of biological, chemical and physical quality indicators-and their combination in a General Indicator of Soil Quality (GISQ)-to monitor soil quality in restored areas of an open cast coal mine. These composite indicators were computed with principal component analyses (PCA) and co-inertia multivariate analyses (CoIA). Our biological indicator showed a significant recovery of soil invertebrate communities along the chronosequence. Taxonomic richness increased from 7 taxa the 1st year to 13-17 taxa in 6-20-y sites, far less than in forests (19-20). Soil pH, bulk density and proportion of physical and macro aggregates were highest in the 1-y site, while soil organic matter (SOM), total N and proportion of biogenic aggregates were highest in older sites. In general, the three sub-indicators and the GISQ yielded the lowest values in the 1-y site (from 0.1 to 0.3 on a scale of 0.1 to 1.0), intermediate in the 16- and 20-y sites, (0.4-0.7) and reached highest values in the two forests (0.4-1.0). The GISQ methodology proved efficient in assessing progress in the reclamation process which should not be achieved only by monitoring vegetation cover changes.

TI  - Carbon sequestration and biodiversity following 18 years of active tropical forest restoration
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vast areas of degraded tropical forest, combined with increasing interest in mitigating climate change and conserving biodiversity, demonstrate the potential value of restoring tropical forest. However, there is a lack of long-term studies assessing active management for restoration. Here we investigate Above Ground Biomass (AGB), forest structure, and biodiversity, before degradation (in old-growth forest), after degradation (in abandoned agricultural savanna grassland), and within a forest that is actively being restored in Kibale National Park, Uganda. In 1995 degraded land in Kibale was protected from fire and replanted with native seedlings (39 species) at a density of 400 seedlings ha(-1). Sixty-five plots (50 m x 10 m) were established in restoration areas in 2005 and 50 of these were re-measured in 2013, allowing changes to be assessed over 18 years. Degraded plots have an Above Ground Biomass (AGB) of 5.1 Mg dry mass ha(-1), of which 80% is grass. By 2005 AGB of trees >= 10 cm DBH was 9.5 Mg ha(-1), increasing to 40.6 Mg ha(-1) by 2013, accumulating at a rate of 3.9 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). A total of 153 planted individuals ha(-1) (38%) remained by 2013, contributing 28.9 Mg ha(-1) (70%) of total AGB. Eighteen years after restoration, AGB in the plots was 12% of old-growth (419 Mg ha(-1)). If current accumulation rates continue restoration forest would reach old-growth AGB in a further 96 years. Biodiversity of degraded plots prior to restoration was low with no tree species and 2 seedling species per sample plot (0.05 ha). By 2005 restoration areas had an average of 3 tree and 3 seedling species per sample plot, increasing to 5 tree and 9 seedling species per plot in 2013. However, biodiversity was still significantly lower than old-growth forest, at 8 tree and 16 seedling species in an equivalent area. The results suggest that forest restoration is beneficial for AGB accumulation with planted stems storing the majority of AGB. Changes in biodiversity appear slower; possibly due to low stem turnover. Overall this restoration treatment is an effective means of restoring degraded land in the area, as can be seen from the lack of regeneration in degraded plots, which remain low-AGB and diversity, largely due to the impacts of fire and competition with grasses.

TI  - Recovery in soil carbon stock but reduction in carbon stabilization after 56-year forest restoration in degraded tropical lands
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Afforestation is considered as an effective method for alleviating the rising of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration through the accumulation and long-term storage of carbon (C) in the vegetation and soil. However, it is still unknown whether soil C accumulation in the restored forests could eventually recover to the equivalent level of the undisturbed forests and much less is known about how afforestation will affect C stabilization. Here we conducted a field study in degraded tropical forests of south China. The aim was to evaluate the recovery of soil C stock following afforestation by comparing different C fractions in soils (0-10 cm and 10-20 cm) in two reforested forests [a restored secondary forest (RSF) and a managed Eucalyptus plantation (MEP)] to those in a bare land (BL) and a nearby undisturbed forest (UF). Results showed that after 56-year afforestation at the bare lands, C stocks in both soil layers were significantly increased with an increase greater in the RSF than the MEP, while C recalcitrant indices (RI) were reduced. Soil C stock in the RSF recovered to a similar level to the UF, but soil RI in the RSF was still lower than the UF particularly in the 10-20 cm layer. The calculated capacity of soil C sequestration with the product of soil C stock and its RI followed the order of UF > RSF > MEP > BL. Our results demonstrate that afforestation on degraded tropical lands could recover soil C stock within a few decades, but C stabilization would be reduced.

TI  - Post-logging changes in a neotropical dry forest composition and structure modify the ecosystem functioning
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Native forests are considered to be the main centers of terrestrial diversity in the world and they provide important ecosystem services for humanity. Unsustainable logging is currently-one of the greatest threats to the biodiversity of these forests. In northwestern Argentina, about 90 % of the piedmont forest in the Southern Yungas has been transformed and the remaining 10% is being intensively logged. The aim of this study was to identify post-logging changes in the structural and compositional attributes affecting the functionality of a dry forest in Argentina. In the control forest, we recorded 1559 individuals from 45 tree species and 22 families, and at post-logging forest, 1376 trees from 47 species and 25 families. Logging affected the forest structure by decreasing timber tree density and basal area. In addition, at the post-logging forest, we observed an increase in the density of non-timber trees and in the horizontal understory cover, which were associated with the normalized difference vegetation index, thus, affecting the forest functioning. The threatened timber species Amburana cearensis and Jacaranda mimosifolia were not recorded in the logged forest. In the control, four timber species had the highest importance value indexes (IVI): Phyllostilon rhamnoides, Anadenanthera colubrina, Cal-icophylum multiflorum, and Myracrodruon urundeuva. Additionally, in the logged forest there was a change in the species order regarding the IVI, with A. colubrina, P. rhamnoides, Cordia americana, and a non-valuable timber species (Ocotea puberula) being the most important tree species. In order to preserve the economic and ecological value of the piedmont forest, the density of non-timber tree species and the horizontal understory cover must be maintained at values close to the control forest. These guidelines can be implemented by applying low-impact logging techniques.

TI  - Generating carbon finance through avoided deforestation and its potential to create climatic, conservation and human development benefits
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent proposals to compensate developing countries for reducing emissions from deforestation ( RED) under forthcoming climate change mitigation regimes are receiving increasing attention. Here we demonstrate that if RED credits were traded on international carbon markets, even moderate decreases in deforestation rates could generate billions of Euros annually for tropical forest conservation. We also discuss the main challenges for a RED mechanism that delivers real climatic benefits. These include providing sufficient incentives while only rewarding deforestation reductions beyond business-as-usual scenarios, addressing risks arising from forest degradation and international leakage, and ensuring permanence of emission reductions. Governance may become a formidable challenge for RED because some countries with the highest RED potentials score poorly on governance indices. In addition to climate mitigation, RED funds could help achieve substantial co-benefits for biodiversity conservation and human development. However, this will probably require targeted additional support because the highest biodiversity threats and human development needs may exist in countries that have limited income potentials from RED. In conclusion, how successfully a market-based RED mechanism can contribute to climate change mitigation, conservation and development will strongly depend on accompanying measures and carefully designed incentive structures involving governments, business, as well as the conservation and development communities.

TI  - Recovery of biodiversity and carbon stocks in forest landscape restoration
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - The forest cover in the Atlantic Forest biome is currently composed of different origins, such as natural regeneration, restoration plantations, commercial monocultures, degraded forest areas, among others. Furthermore, they have different ages, floristic composition and varied structures, having different market impacts with their diversity. Understanding the dynamics of aboveground carbon (AGC) stocks in restoring forests is essential to support international forest restoration agreements and the UN Decade of Ecological Restoration.Monitoring restored areas with different previous land uses and different restoration strategies is crucial for quantifying carbon stocks and evaluating ecosystem services, such as biodiversity, and soil and water protection. New remote sensing approaches have revolutionized the way we monitor the diversity, structure and function of forests, and can play a key role in tracking the progress of restoration programs.AGC estimates are generally performed indirectly (non-destructively) using allometric models developed in mature forests. Little is known about the allometric relationships of individuals (diameter, height and biomass of trees) and the landscape (canopy structure and forest AGB) of forests under restoration. Due to the lack of equations and studies of carbon dynamics in restored forests, it is common to use generalised equations for tropical forests for this carbon estimate, adding many uncertainties to the estimates.In this project, we will explore remote sensing technologies to generate specific equations from lidar metrics to estimate above-ground carbon in different types of restoration. From the results generated, it will be possible to quantify the uncertainties associated with the use of generalized equations to estimate carbon in restored forests, as well as the equations with lower uncertainties for each type of restoration.

TI  - Ecological outcomes of agroforests and restoration 15 years after planting
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale forest restoration relies on approaches that are cost-effective and economically attractive to farmers, and in this context agroforestry systems may be a valuable option. Here, we compared ecological outcomes among (1) 12-15-year-old coffee agroforests established with several native shade trees, (2) 12-15-year-old high-diversity restoration plantations, and (3) reference old-growth forests, within a landscape restoration project in the Pontal do Paranapanema region, in the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil. We compared the aboveground biomass, canopy cover, and abundance, richness, and composition of trees, and the regenerating saplings in the three forest types. In addition, we investigated the landscape drivers of natural regeneration in the restoration plantations and coffee agroforests. Reference forests had a higher abundance of trees and regenerating saplings, but had similar levels of species richness compared to coffee agroforests. High-diversity agroforests and restoration plantations did not differ in tree abundance. However, compared to restoration plantations, agroforests showed higher abundance and species richness of regenerating saplings, a higher proportion of animal-dispersed species, and higher canopy cover. The abundance of regenerating saplings declined with increasing density of coffee plants, thus indicating a potential trade-off between productivity and ecological benefits. High-diversity coffee agroforests provide a cost-effective and ecologically viable alternative to high-diversity native tree plantations for large-scale forest restoration within agricultural landscapes managed by local communities, and should be included as part of the portfolio of reforestation options used to promote the global agenda on forest and landscape restoration.

TI  - Water availability drives aboveground biomass and bird richness in forest restoration plantings to achieve carbon and biodiversity cobenefits
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - To combat global warming and biodiversity loss, we require effective forest restoration that encourages recovery of species diversity and ecosystem function to deliver essential ecosystem services, such as biomass accumulation. Further, understanding how and where to undertake restoration to achieve carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation would provide an opportunity to finance ecosystem restoration under carbon markets. We surveyed 30 native mixed-species plantings in subtropical forests and woodlands in Australia and used structural equation modeling to determine vegetation, soil, and climate variables most likely driving aboveground biomass accrual and bird richness and investigate the relationships between plant diversity, aboveground biomass accrual, and bird diversity. We focussed on woodland and forest-dependent birds, and functional groups at risk of decline (insectivorous, understorey-nesting, and small-bodied birds). We found that mean moisture availability strongly limits aboveground biomass accrual and bird richness in restoration plantings, indicating potential synergies in choosing sites for carbon and biodiversity purposes. Counter to theory, woody plant richness was a poor direct predictor of aboveground biomass accrual, but was indirectly related via significant, positive effects of stand density. We also found no direct relationship between aboveground biomass accrual and bird richness, likely because of the strong effects of moisture availability on both variables. Instead, moisture availability and patch size strongly and positively influenced the richness of woodland and forest-dependent birds. For understorey-nesting birds, however, shrub cover and patch size predicted richness. Stand age or area of native vegetation surrounding the patch did not influence bird richness. Our results suggest that in subtropical biomes, planting larger patches to higher densities, ideally using a diversity of trees and shrubs (characteristics of ecological plantings) in more mesic locations will enhance the provision of carbon and biodiversity cobenefits. Further, ecological plantings will aid the rapid recovery of woodland and forest bird richness, with comparable aboveground biomass accrual to less diverse forestry plantations.

TI  - Enhancing feasibility: Incorporating a socio-ecological systems framework into restoration planning
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest restoration is the counterforce to deforestation. In many parts of the world it mitigates forest loss and degradation, but success rates vary. Socio-political variables are important predictors of effectiveness of restoration activities, indicating that restoration strategies need to be locally adapted. Yet, contextual assessments of the biophysical, social and political characteristics of forest restoration are rare. Here, we integrate a social-ecological systems framework with systematic decision-making to inform forest restoration planning. We illustrate this approach through a prioritization analysis in a community-based forest restoration context in Paser District, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. We compare the solutions of our integrated framework with those identified on the basis of biophysical criteria alone. We discover that incorporating a socio-political context alters the selection of priority areas. While the social feasibility and political permissibility can be enhanced, ecological benefits are likely to be reduced and/or opportunity costs of alternative land uses are to be increased. Our conceptual framework allows the appraisal of potential trade-offs between social and ecological outcomes of alternative options, and has the potential to evaluate the efficiency of existing policies. Empirical testing in a range of contexts is required to ensure broad applicability and transferability of our conceptual framework. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Estimation of Mangrove Blue Carbon in Three Semi-arid Lagoons in the Gulf of California
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems are recognized as natural climate solutions due to their capacity to store carbon (C) in the vegetation and soil. Thus, the extent of such role by mangrove ecosystems has raised interest in the scientific community. Mangrove carbon stock above ground biomass is higher in humid tropical areas than in dry subtropical ones. However, a lack of information persists when it comes to the belowground C. This research aimed to determine the carbon stock in relation to total mangrove biomass in three semi-arid coastal lagoons in the Gulf of California, Mexico. Different methods were used, tree structure and pneumatophore measurements, litter traps, root and production cores; along with measurements of physicochemical parameters in sediment in surface and interstitial water. Mean carbon in the total mangrove biomass was 54.1 MgCorg center dot ha(-1), with a maximum of 102.1 +/- 14.2 MgCorg center dot ha(-1) at the Lobos site. In arid areas, mangroves are characterized by larger amounts of belowground biomass associated with environmental factors such as pH, redox potential, and temperature, leading to a high C-org content belowground. Root production are high, enhancing the efficiency of belowground C-org storage related to the life cycle of roots (turnover). The presence of Conocarpus erectus (L), a new record of the distribution limit of the species in the Gulf of California (Lobos), attained the highest values of structural development, litter-based primary productivity, and belowground root production and biomass. Therefore, this species is recommended for restoration (reforestation), given its high primary productivity that stabilizes the coastline and increases carbon storage dynamics.

TI  - Resilience of lowland Atlantic forests in a highly fragmented landscape: Insights on the temporal scale of landscape restoration
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic forest is one of the most threatened tropical forest ecosystem in the world, and despite current knowledge, its ability to recover structure and diversity after a disturbance is still a matter of debate. Quantifying carbon stocks and species diversity in forests at different successional stages and assessing their recovery capacity is important for designing local conservation and restoration strategies. We investigated the resilience potential of lowland Atlantic forests at landscape-scale using a chronosequence approach in 160 0.1-ha permanent plots, three old-growth and 13 second-growth forests at various stages of recovery. We assessed whether tree species richness, including species with high conservation values (endemic and threatened), composition and aboveground carbon stock recover along succession; and estimated how much of the old-growth forest values the 20-yr-old secondary forests had attained and the time needed to reach old-growth forests levels. Species richness, composition and carbon stock tended to recover along the chronosequence, while endemic and threatened species showed no relationship with forest age. After 20 yr of succession, the secondary forests recovered on average 52% of total species richness, 21% of species composition and only 16% of carbon stock of old-growth forests. We predicted that the absolute recovery of lowland Atlantic forests would take eight decades to thousands of years, much longer than the 10-40 years targeted by national efforts to restore degraded ecosystems. Despite slow recovery, these regenerating forests are important for climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation as they potentially sequester 1.78 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) and harbor a number of species comparable to old-growth forests. Our findings indicate that achieving landscape restoration and conservation goals through passive restoration can be a challenge, highlighting the need to invest in management plans in areas with relatively low resilience and high biodiversity and carbon conservation values.

TI  - Carbon emissions from Mexican forests: Current situation and long-term scenarios
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimates of carbon emissions from the forest sector in Mexico are derived for the year 1985 and for two contrasting scenarios in 2025. The analysis covers both tropical and temperate closed forests. In the mid-1980s, approximately 804,000 ha/year of closed forests suffered major perturbations, of which 668,000 ha was deforestation. Seventy-five percent of total deforestation is concentrated in tropical forests. The resulting annual carbon balance from land-use change is estimated at 67.0 x 10(6) tons/year, which lead to net emissions of 52.3 x 10(6) tons/year accounting for the carbon uptake in restoration plantations and degraded forest lands. This last figure represents approximately 40% of the country's estimated annual total carbon emissions for 1985-1987. The annual carbon balance from the forest sector in 2025 is expected to decline to 28.0 x 10(6) t in the reference scenario and to become negative (i.e., a carbon sink), 62.0 x 10(6) t in the policy scenario. A number of policy changes are identified that would help achieve the carbon sequestration potential identified in this last scenario.

TI  - Tree species composition and selection effects drive overstory and understory productivity in reforested oil sands mining sites
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reforestation is a feasible option for the eventual restoration of biodiversity and ecosystem services on deforested oil-sands mining sites. The associations between plant diversity and productivity spanning the different strata of restoration forests, in conjunction with specific factors that may impact these relationships, remain uncertain. We sampled 94 sites that encompassed conifer, mixed-wood, and broadleaved overstory types as three exemplar substrates following the reforestation of oil-sands mining sites in Alberta, Canada. We employed structural equation modeling to investigate the correlations between species diversity and aboveground biomass production spanning forest vegetation strata, while concurrently accounting for the effects of overstory composition, functional diversity/identity, soil fertility, and restoration age. We found that the relationships between species diversity and biomass were negative, or inconsequential across restoration forest strata. Overstory biomass was linked to the coniferous tree proportion and community-weighted mean of leaf nitrogen, rather than the species and functional diversity of overstory trees. Further, overstory composition, diversity, and biomass were the key features involved in the diversity and biomass of understory strata. Our results demonstrated the importance of overstory tree species composition and selection effects toward driving overstory and understory productivity in restoration forests at post-oil sands mining sites. Coniferous trees were observed to have lower leaf nutrient levels and negative impacts on the productivity and diversity of overstory and shrub layers. Therefore, it was recommended that a greater proportion of broadleaved trees should be incorporated to promote productivity and species diversity in restoration forests through the enhancement and utilization of available resources.

TI  - Limited biomass recovery from gold mining in Amazonian forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Gold mining has rapidly increased across the Amazon Basin in recent years, especially in the Guiana shield, where it is responsible for >90% of total deforestation. However, the ability of forests to recover from gold mining activities remains largely unquantified.2. Forest inventory plots were installed on recently abandoned mines in two major mining regions in Guyana, and re-censused 18 months later, to provide the first ground-based quantification of gold mining impacts on Amazon forest biomass recovery.3. We found that woody biomass recovery rates on abandoned mining pits and tailing ponds are among the lowest ever recorded for tropical forests, with close to no woody biomass recovery after 3-4 years.4. On the overburden sites (i.e. areas not mined but where excavated soil is deposited), however, above-ground biomass recovery rates (0.4-5.4 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) were within the range of those recorded in other secondary forests across the Neotropics following abandonment of pastures and agricultural lands.5. Our results suggest that forest recovery is more strongly limited by severe mining-induced depletion of soil nutrients, especially nitrogen, than by mercury contamination, due to slowing of growth in nutrient-stripped soils.6. We estimate that the slow recovery rates in mining pits and ponds currently reduce carbon sequestration across Amazonian secondary forests by similar to 21,000 t C/year, compared to the carbon that would have accumulated following more traditional land uses such as agriculture or pasture.7. Synthesis and applications. To achieve large-scale restoration targets, Guyana and other Amazonian countries will be challenged to remediate previously mined lands. The recovery process is highly dependent on nitrogen availability rather than mercury contamination, affecting woody biomass regrowth. The significant recovery in overburden zones indicates that one potential active remediation strategy to promote biomass recovery may be to backfill mining pits and ponds with excavated soil.

TI  - Landscape conservation as a strategy for recovering biodiversity: lessons from a long-term program of pasture restoration in the southern Atlantic Forest
T2  - Dryad
M3  - Data set
AB  - Although ecological restoration has entered the global agenda to reverse different anthropogenic disturbances, we still know little about how this solution interacts with other conservation strategies, to avoid the progressive loss of species and ecosystem services. Here we evaluate one of the pioneering restoration programs in the southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest, where the combination of conservation and restoration efforts have been carried out for 20 years. Specifically, we tested how landscape characteristics, restoration strategies and environmental characteristics affect the results of the restoration of pastures. We established 65 circular plots (total 4.0 ha) along restoration areas (3-10 years) and sampled trees and shrubs composing the canopy (DBH > 5cm) and understory (DBH< 5cm, height > 1.3m). We analyzed the landscape metrics (proportion of old-growth forests in 200 m, 500m and 1000m buffers around each plot; and area and distance of the nearest-neighboring old-growth forests). We explored the multiple effects of landscape, restoration strategy (reforestation, natural regeneration) and environmental variables (soil, pasture grass types) on the species composition and multiple diversity metrics of restoration areas. The species composition was very similar among restoration ages and restoration strategies. We found positive and strong effects of old-growth forest (200 m buffer) proportion on the species richness and Shannon diversity (canopy and understory), aboveground biomass (canopy) and functional diversity (understory) of restoration areas. The restoration strategies affected forest structure, and, in general, the reforestation strategy increased aboveground biomass, Shannon, functional and phylogenetic diversities (in canopy), and percentage of endemic species and biomass (understory), when compared to natural regeneration.  The 20 year-experience in the southern Atlantic Forest showed that programs focused on landscape conservation associated with a mixture of restoration strategies (i.e. natural regeneration in larger areas and active restoration in more disturbed sites) , can be an efficient strategy to ensure biodiversity and ecosystem services in tropical landscapes. Synthesis and applications: To manage degraded tropical lands and achieve global targets for biodiversity and ecosystem services, it is necessary to first ensure the conservation of natural remnants and then use multiple restoration strategies in less resilient areas. Restoration experiment: To evaluate the efficiency of the restoration strategies used, we carried out an experiment in partnership with SPVS that authorized the study within its reserves. The experiment consisted of sampling the vegetation in the restored areas in Guaricica and das Aguas Natural Reserves (Figure 1a). We established 65 circular plots (radius of 14m; area of 615.7m2 each) resulting in a total sampled area of 4.0 ha. Plots were distributed in the two reserves and were selected in a way to account for a gradient of all variables of pasture management techniques, soil and landscape characteristics, and restoration strategies (Figure 1b). The plots were established in areas with ages varying from 2 to 10 years since the sites were abandoned of agricultural use, and in areas with four different soil types (Acrisol, n=6 plots, Cambisol, n=15, Gleysol, n=38, and Fluvisol, n=6), two restoration strategies (reforestation=24 plots; natural regeneration=41 plots), and 3 types of grass cover combinations (Urochloa cf humidicola and Urochloa arrecta, n=23 plots, Paspalum sp., n=16; and mixed Urochloa and Paspalum, n=20). For the remaining number of sites, we did not have information whether exotic grasses were used and, therefore, they were analyzed in a different sub-group. The experiment was established in 2010 and since then, some other plots have been incorporated into the sample design and evaluated in several studies (for example, Cequinel et al. 2018; Capellesso et al. 2020). Part of the plots analyzed here (39 plots) were also studied by Kauano et al. (2013) regarding to the effects of the landscape on the canopy of forests ongoing restoration. In this study, we expanded the sample area (here 65 plots) and the vegetation survey (here also considered understorey), incorporating, therefore, a greater environmental gradient where the restoration took place. This field study does not require ethical approval, according to Brazilian standards. Landscape analysis: The images used in the analysis were obtained from overlapping LANDSAT-5-TM images (from 5th March 2009) with Ortho-rectified aerial photos (from 2001), and official Parana state geomorphological maps. From these images, landscape related variables were obtained by the application of Vector-based Landscape Analysis Tools (V-Late 2.0) extension (Lang & Blaschke, 2007) for ArcGis 10.8 software (see more details in Kauano et al., 2013). The landscape surrounding the plots is characterized by the presence of young, intermediate and old-growth forests, fluvial areas (wetlands) and pasture and agriculture areas. The classification of land-use categories was done by visual inspection of images associated by comparisons with historical aerial photos. Old-growth forest sites were considered the forest remnants where there were no signals of intensive logging for the past 80 years. In each plot we obtained the following landscape metrics: distance and the area of the nearest-neighbouring fragment, and proportion of old-growth forest. We chose these metrics because they are related to the amount of available habitat, as well as the distance for the arrival of propagules, which affects regeneration (Magnago et al., 2015). To explore the effects of geographical scales on the proportion of old-growth forest, we considered three buffer distances, with 200 m, 500 m and 1000 m (in radius) around the central coordinate of each plot. Considering the total of plots, the distance to the closest old-growth forest remnant (nearest-neighbor distance) varied from 12 to 488 m, and the area of this remnant varied from 0.36 ha to 4.24 ha. The proportions of old-growth forests for 200 m buffer varied between 0% to 72%, for 500 m buffer varied between 0.13% and 70%, and, for the 1000 m buffer, between 8.5% to 60%. Vegetation survey and plant community metrics: In all 65 plots of 14m in radius we sampled all trees and shrubs with diameter at breast height (DBH; 1.3m) > 5cm, to characterize the canopy. In a smaller concentric sub-plot (4m in radius, 50.3m2), we measured all individuals (tree saplings and shrubs, which will be referred to hereafter as understory) with DBH < 5.0cm and total height >1.30m. For all sampled individuals we determined the species name (by comparing with vouchers in herbarium UPCB) and measured the DBH (or stem base diameter, for understory) and tree total height. The plant communities (canopy and understory) present in each plot were analyzed in relation to different biodiversity metrics: taxonomic richness (S) and diversity (H, Shannons index), functional diversity (FD, Rao's quadratic entropy), and phylogenetic diversity (PD, Mean Pairwise Distance). Rao Q is a measure of divergence by average functional distance between two individuals (Mouchet et al. 2010) and indicates niche complementarity (Ricotta & Moretti, 2011). MPD provides a global community structure value (Webb, 2000; Webb et al., 2002). Additionally, we considered the percentage of endemic species (%_end) of Atlantic Forest and aboveground biomass (Biom, Mg ha-1), in order to represent multiple dimensions of biodiversity. Functional diversity was calculated using the following plant traits: specific leaf area (SLA, cm2 g-1), leaf dry-matter content (LDMC, mg g-1), wood density (WD, g cm3), and maximum height (Hmax, m). All traits were measured based on locally collected samples whenever possible, following standardized protocols (Perez-Harguindeguy et al., 2013, see details in Capellesso et al. 2020). The PD was based on the built of ultrametric phylogeny for tree species (see Supporting Information for details). Aboveground biomass was calculated following the general wet tropical forest formulae provided by Chave et al. (2014). All data are in Excell and can be converted to other formats.

TI  - Reduction of emissions by avoided deforestation in andean high-land tropical forests
T2  - REVISTA DE CIENCIAS AGRICOLAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation and forest degradation, mainly in areas with high carbon density, is one of the most important source of greenhouse gases (GHG). The impact of deforestation on carbon storage in total biomass and its CO2 emissions is analyzed in four land covers in the Santuario de Fauna y Flora Iguaque (SFFI), Boyaca, Colombia. A total of 32 temporal sampling plots (TSP) of 250m(2) was established to measure trees with diameter at breast height (dbh) >= 10 cm whereas 17 TSP of 36m(2) were established to measure total and stipe height of all frailejones (Espeletia boyacensis Cuatrec, E. tunjana Cuatrec and E. cf. Incana). Above and belowground biomass was estimated with allometric models, whereas carbon was calculated using the a fraction of 0.47. The sampling area was proportional to the area of each land cover: open heathlands and moorlands (OMH), dense heathlands and moorlands (DMH), broad-leaved forest with continuous canopy, not on mire (BFCC), natural grassland prevailingly without trees and shrubs (NSWT). BFCC and DMH showed higher carbon storage in biomass (55 and 27Mg C/ha, respectively). SFFI stored around 135.9Gg C, from which 25-38Gg CO(2)e could be emitted to the atmosphere in the 20 next years if the deforestation rates continue. BFCC and OMH are the covers with the highest potential of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Therefore, prioritizing the preservation of these ecosystems by Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) programs, is a key to counter the effects of climate change and ensure the supply of ecosystemic services that support local communities' livelihoods.

M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests are threatened by anthropogenic activities such as conversion into agricultural land, logging and fires. Land-use change and disturbance affect ecosystems not only aboveground, but also belowground including the ecosystems' carbon and nitrogen cycle. We studied the impact of different types of land-use change (intensive and traditional agroforestry, logging) and disturbance by fire on fine root biomass, dynamics, morphology, and related C and N fluxes to the soil via fine root litter across different ecosystems at different elevational zones at Mt. Kilimanjaro (Tanzania). We found a decrease in fine root biomass (80-90%), production (50%), and C and N fluxes to the soil via fine root litter (60-80%) at all elevation zones. The traditional agroforestry 'Chagga homegardens' (lower montane zone) showed enhanced fine root turnover rates, higher values of acquisitive root morphological traits, but similar stand fine root production, C and N fluxes compared to the natural forest. The decrease of C and N fluxes with forest disturbance was particularly strong at the upper montane zone (60 and 80% decrease, respectively), where several patches of Podocarpus forest had been disturbed by fire in the previous years. We conclude that changes on species composition, stand structure and land management practices resulting from land-use change and disturbance have a strong impact on the fine root system, modifying fine root biomass, production and the C and N supply to the soil from fine root litter, which strongly affects the ecosystems' C and N cycle in those East African tropical forest ecosystems.

TI  - A long-term decrease in the persistence of soil carbon caused by ancient Maya land use
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term effects of deforestation on tropical forest soil carbon reservoirs are important for estimating the consequences of land use on the global carbon cycle, but are poorly understood. The Maya Lowlands of Mexico and Guatemala provide a unique opportunity to assess this question, given the widespread deforestation by the ancient Maya that began similar to 4,000 years ago. Here, we compare radiocarbon ages of plant waxes and macrofossils in sediment cores from three lakes in the Maya Lowlands to record past changes in the mean soil transit time of plant waxes (MTTwax). MTTwax indicates the average age of plant waxes that are transported from soils to lake sediments, and comparison of radiocarbon data from soils and lake sediments within the same catchment indicates that MTTwax reflects the age of carbon in deep soils. All three sediment cores showed a decrease in MTTwax, ranging from 2,300 to 800 years, over the past 3,500 years. This decrease in MTTwax, indicating shorter storage times for carbon in lake catchment soils, is associated with evidence for ancient Maya deforestation. MTTwax never recovered to pre- deforestation values, despite subsequent reforestation, implying that current tropical deforestation will have long- lasting effects on soil carbon sinks.

TI  - Genetic diversity of reintroduced tree populations in restoration plantations of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term ecological success of large-scale restoration programs planned for the next decades will rely on genetic diversity (GD) of reintroduced or colonizing species, a limiting factor in highly fragmented landscapes. In small and isolated natural remnants or restoration areas, substantial reduction in population's size or connectivity may lead to local extinctions due to the accumulation of deleterious recessive alleles and ongoing reduction of fecundity, plant vigor, recruitment success, and adaptive potential. Despite the paramount role of GD for species persistence, its levels in restoration programs are poorly known. We assessed the GD of four model tree species (different succession stages, dispersal, and pollination syndromes) from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, comparing two high-diversity restoration plantations, one forest fragment and one conserved remnant. Contrary to the expectation that the plantation strategies adopted in the restoration programs could result in genetic composition homogenization, we found that restoration areas established heterogeneous genetic groups with similar levels of neutral GD and inbreeding to those observed in natural forest remnants. This pattern was consistent across the four functionally different tree species, despite some species idiosyncrasies. For instance, we observed lower allelic richness in early successional species in restoration sites, suggesting that some species may be more prone to reintroduction with lower GD. Thus, we advocate the use of high GD levels in restoration to support biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes, thus reinforcing the role of ecological restoration for recovering the diversity of genesthe basic constituent of biodiversity.

TI  - Carbon storage and emissions offset potential in an East African tropical rainforest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forestry based carbon emissions offset projects have potential to both mitigate climate change and foster sustainable forest management. Degraded African tropical forests could sequester large amounts of additional carbon, but the lack of empirical data limits the feasibility of initiating carbon offset projects in many threatened forests. This study examines the potential to increase carbon stocks in the Kakamega National Forest of western Kenya, a threatened biodiversity hotspot and Kenya's only remaining rainforest. Carbon density values for indigenous forest and plantations were estimated based on forest inventory data from 95 randomized plots distributed throughout the forest. Total ecosystem carbon was estimated using allometric, equations for tree biomass, destructive techniques for litter and herbaceous vegetation biomass, and Dumas combustion and spectroscopy for soils. Land cover maps for 1975, 1986, and 2000 were used to estimate both current carbon stocks and the influence of past land use changes. Mean carbon density in indigenous forest was 330 +/- 65 Mg C/ha, greater than that of the forest's hardwood plantations (280 +/- 77 Mg C/ha) and significantly greater that that of softwood plantations (250 +/- 77 Mg C/ha). The distribution of carbon densities within the indigenous forest and the variation between plantation types suggest management practices could feasibly increase Kakamega's carbon stock. Deforestation between 1975 and 1986 and limited reforestation from 1986 to 2000 have resulted in a net loss of 0.4-0.6 Tg C. If this loss were reversed, the value of possible associated carbon credits dwarfs the current operational budget for managing and protecting the forest, even at low carbon prices. Additional income could help address resource needs of impoverished communities surrounding the forest and promote sustainable protection of Kakamega's high biodiversity. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - What is the evidence for the contribution of forests to poverty alleviation? A systematic map protocol
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Forests provide an essential resource that support the livelihoods of an estimated 20% of the global population. Forests are thought to serve in three primary roles to support livelihoods: subsistence, safety nets, and pathways to prosperity. While we have a working understanding of how poor people depend on forests in individual sites and countries, much of this evidence is dispersed and not easily accessible. Thus, while the importance of forest ecosystems and resources to contribute to poverty alleviation has been increasingly emphasized in international policies, conservation and development initiatives and investments-the strength of evidence to support how forests can affect poverty outcomes is still unclear. This study takes a systematic mapping approach to scope, identify and describe studies that measure the effect of forest-based activities on poverty outcomes at local and regional scales. This effort builds upon an existing systematic map on linkages between conservation and human well-being in order to make this process more efficient. We will conduct a refined and updated search strategy pertinent to forests-poverty linkages to glean additional evidence from studies outside the scope of the original map. Results of this study can be used for informing conservation and development policy and practices in global forest ecosystems and highlight evidence gaps where future primary studies and systematic reviews can add value.Methods: We build upon the search strategy outlined in McKinnon et al. (Environ Evid 1-25, 2016) and expand our search to cover a total of 7 bibliographic databases, 15 organizational websites, 8 existing systematic reviews and maps, and evidence gap maps, and solicit key informants. All searches will be conducted in English and encompass all nations. Search results will be screened at title, abstract, and full text levels, recording both the number of excluded articles and reasons for exclusion. Full text assessment will be conducted on all included article and extracted data will be reported in a narrative review that will summarize trends in the evidence, report any knowledge gaps and gluts, and provide insight for policy, practice and future research. The data from this systematic map will be made available as well, through an open access, searchable data portal and visualization tool.

TI  - Carbon allocation in a Costa Rican dry forest derived from tree ring analysis
T2  - DENDROCHRONOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The rising discussion on carbon balance of tropical forests often does not consider the sequestration. potential of secondary dry forests, which are becoming an increasing importance due to land use change and reforestation. We have developed an easy applicable tool for the estimation of biomass increment of tropical secondary forest stands on the base of tree ring analysis. The existence of annual rings was shown by a combination of anatomical examination and radiocarbon estimations. With tree ring analysis, forest inventories and destructive sampling the above-ground biomass increment of secondary forest stands of age between 9 and 48 years in the dry forest region of Guanacaste, Costa Rica were estimated. The above-ground biomass increment of the tree layer varies between 2.4 and 3.2 Mg/ha yr in different stands. Lianas contribute with up to 23% additional production. Differences in productivity among the stands along a chronosequence were not significant. The measured carbon allocation potential of 1.7-2.1 Mg C/ha yr lies in the range of reported values from other tropical dry forests and old growth humid forests as well.

TI  - CAMARV: Capacity Building for Mangrove Assessment, Restoration and Valuation in East Africa
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Mangroves are tropical and sub-tropical forests that grow in the inter-tidal zone. They are valuable for many reasons: they provide shelter for juvenile fish, they protect shorelines from erosion, they filter sediments and pollution out of rivers and their wood can be used for timber and fuel. They are also amongst the most productive ecosystems on earth and are capable of storing large quantities of carbon both above-ground (as wood) and below-ground (as dead roots and carbon particles derived from the sea, and eventually as peat). This means losing them could accelerate global warming. Despite their importance, mangroves are being lost rapidly, with 1-2% of these forests destroyed each year. This project aims to help conserve and restore mangroves in East Africa. We will do this by developing the expertise and capacity needed to exploit new and emerging markets for 'ecosystem services'. In East Africa, most mangrove destruction occurs because of poverty; people need fuel and building materials and cannot afford to buy them from other sources, so use the mangroves despite often being aware of their importance. If money was available to communities for mangrove conservation and restoration this would provide a powerful conservation incentive. Our project consortium has experience in running community based forestry projects, including one in Mozambique that utilises voluntary payments for carbon sequestration by western companies and individuals to fund new tree planting and conservation. We will apply this experience to mangroves. We will train African scientists, NGO and community workers in a range of skills, and develop networks and methodologies that will help our African partner institutions exploit these new market opportunities. This will require training and development at each stage of the following project development plan: 1) Assessment of extent and quality of ecosystem We need to know how much mangrove forest is present and whether it is in good health (or for example whether is has been heavily poached for wood). This can be done using satellite imagery, but work on the ground ('groundtruthing') will be needed to relate the images to the reality, for example to determine the characteristic features of degraded woodland. 2) Assessment of threats We need to know which forests are most threatened, for example by looking at patterns of past land use or by measuring risk factors such as proximity to large cities. This is important for governments in their conservation planning, but also may be required in order to access conservation money from the new REDD (Reductions in Emissions from forest Destruction and Degradation) fund developed by the United Nations. 3) Assessment of ecosystem value We need to demonstrate the potential monetary value of the mangrove ecosystems, by 'pricing' the various services they provide. In some cases this will be useful as a tool for influencing decision makers - by giving a demonstration in 'hard cash' of the costs of destroying a mangrove - and in others it could translate to real income - for example by calculating the total value of the above and below ground carbon stored. 4) Assessment of barriers to the market or to conservation What factors are likely to prevent projects working successfully, and how can we address these? For example, it is essential that local communities see the benefits of any projects run on their behalf. This will require careful consultation and co-operation with local people and sensitivity to issues such as land management and tenure. We will train partners in techniques of participatory appraisal and in using GIS technology in mapping local resources. The results of this project development process will be proposals for full pilot projects and the establishment of an East African Advisory Group, based in Kenya, that will help oversee projects and encourage communication and good practice in the region.

TI  - ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL FEASIBILITY OF INTERNATIONAL CARBON OFFSETS
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are important in the global carbon cycle, forming a major sink for carbon. Deforestation is a significant source of carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere. There is some scope to enhance natural carbon sinks, and therefore reduce net emissions of greenhouse gases, through afforestation and conservation of existing forests. Such initiatives may be implemented to ''offset'' emissions of greenhouse gases from other sources. This may be undertaken by private companies, or by governments as part of bilateral agreements or multilateral arrangements. International carbon offsets may be cost effective in terms of reduction of carbon emissions achieved, and may also be one way to mobilise private capital to fund forest conservation. It is argued here that theoretically the international offset of emissions may lead to a resource saving, and that forest conservation, as opposed to afforestation, may bring about many other benefits. However, such international contracts are unlikely to be feasible or make a major contribution to the control of greenhouse gases. The reasons for this are monitoring, enforcement and scientific uncertainties, and the implicit change in property rights involved in ''selling'' carbon sequestration rights.

TI  - Phyllostomid Bat Occurrence in Successional Stages of Neotropical Dry Forests
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical dry forests (TDFs) are highly endangered tropical ecosystems being replaced by a complex mosaic of patches of different successional stages, agricultural fields and pasturelands. In this context, it is urgent to understand how taxa playing critical ecosystem roles respond to habitat modification. Because Phyllostomid bats provide important ecosystem services (e. g. facilitate gene flow among plant populations and promote forest regeneration), in this study we aimed to identify potential patterns on their response to TDF transformation in sites representing four different successional stages (initial, early, intermediate and late) in three Neotropical regions: Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil. We evaluated bat occurrence at the species, ensemble (abundance) and assemblage level (species richness and composition, guild composition). We also evaluated how bat occurrence was modulated by the marked seasonality of TDFs. In general, we found high seasonal and regional specificities in phyllostomid occurrence, driven by specificities at species and guild levels. For example, highest frugivore abundance occurred in the early stage of the moistest TDF, while highest nectarivore abundance occurred in the same stage of the driest TDF. The high regional specificity of phyllostomid responses could arise from: (1) the distinctive environmental conditions of each region, (2) the specific behavior and ecological requirements of the regional bat species, (3) the composition, structure and phenological patterns of plant assemblages in the different stages, and (4) the regional landscape composition and configuration. We conclude that, in tropical seasonal environments, it is imperative to perform long-term studies considering seasonal variations in environmental conditions and plant phenology, as well as the role of landscape attributes. This approach will allow us to identify potential patterns in bat responses to habitat modification, which constitute an invaluable tool for not only bat biodiversity conservation but also for the conservation of the key ecological processes they provide.

M3  - Article
AB  - Forested landscapes are increasingly affected by human activities, but little is known about the role of large endangered frugivores as seed dispersers in such ecosystems. We investigated the role played by the bonobo (Pan paniscus) in a human-altered forest-savanna mosaic in Democratic Republic of the Congo. The studied-groups are part of a community-based conservation programme but live at the interface with human activities. We identified dispersed species via faecal analysis, classified them into a regeneration guild and a seed size category, determined the effect of gut transit on seed germination, and the habitat use of bonobos. Bonobos dispersed intact seeds of 77 species, 80.8% of which were large-seeded (>= 10 mm long), of which few can be dispersed by sympatric frugivores. They dispersed a majority (49%) of shade-bearers that thrive in forest understory with limited amount of light, all of which were large-seeded. Transit had an overall positive effect on seed germination. Bonobos used various habitat types, showing preferences for understory with intermediate light availability and dominated by woody or herbaceous vegetation. This dispersal pattern probably enhances recruitment of shade bearers, and we thus hypothesized that those species benefited from directed dispersal by bonobos. This threatened frugivore provides unique dispersal services and likely plays a paramount functional role in the regeneration of late successional forests in this mosaic landscape. Management plans should pay particular attention to the role of large and rare frugivores in human-dominated regions as their disappearance could disrupt forest succession to a climax state.

TI  - Old-growth forest loss and secondary forest recovery across Amazonian countries
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - There is growing recognition of the potential of large-scale forest restoration in the Amazon as a 'nature-based solution' to climate change. However, our knowledge of forest loss and recovery beyond Brazil is limited, and carbon emissions and accumulation have not been estimated for the whole biome. Combining a 33 year land cover dataset with estimates of above-ground biomass and carbon sequestration rates, we evaluate forest loss and recovery across nine Amazonian countries and at a local scale. We also estimate the role of secondary forests in offsetting old-growth deforestation emissions and explore the temporal trends in forest loss and recovery. We find secondary forests across the biome to have offset just 9.7% of carbon emissions from old-growth deforestation, despite occupying 28.8% of deforested land. However, these numbers varied between countries ranging from 9.0% in Brazil to 23.8% in Guyana for carbon offsetting, and 24.8% in Brazil to 56.9% in Ecuador for forest area recovery. We reveal a strong, negative spatial relationship between old-growth forest loss and recovery by secondary forests, showing that regions with the greatest potential for large-scale restoration are also those that currently have the lowest recovery (e.g. Brazil dominates deforestation and emissions but has the lowest recovery). In addition, a temporal analysis of the regions that were >80% deforested in 1997 shows a continued decline in overall forest cover. Our findings identify three important challenges: (a) incentivising large-scale restoration in highly deforested regions, (b) protecting secondary forests without disadvantaging landowners who depend on farm-fallow systems, and (c) preventing further deforestation. Combatting all these successfully is essential to ensuring that the Amazon biome achieves its potential in mitigating anthropogenic climate change.

TI  - Object-Based Mapping of Aboveground Biomass in Tropical Forests Using LiDAR and Very-High-Spatial-Resolution Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing countries that intend to implement the United Nations REDD-plus (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation, and the role of forest conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) framework and obtain economic incentives are required to estimate changes in forest carbon stocks based on the IPCC guidelines. In this study, we developed a method to support REDD-plus implementation by estimating tropical forest aboveground biomass (AGB) by combining airborne LiDAR with very-high-spatial-resolution satellite data. We acquired QuickBird satellite images of Kampong Thom, Cambodia in 2011 and airborne LiDAR measurements in some parts of the same area. After haze reduction and atmospheric correction of the satellite data, we calibrated reflectance values from the mean reflectance of the objects (obtained by segmentation from areas of overlap between dates) to reduce the effects of the observation angle and solar elevation. Then, we performed object-based classification using the satellite data (overall accuracy = 77.0%, versus 92.9% for distinguishing forest from non-forest land). We used a two-step method to estimate AGB and map it in a tropical environment in Cambodia. First, we created a multiple-regression model to estimate AGB from the LiDAR data and plotted field-surveyed AGB values against AGB values predicted by the LiDAR-based model (R-2 = 0.90, RMSE = 38.7 Mg/ha), and calculated reflectance values in each band of the satellite data for the analyzed objects. Then, we created a multiple-regression model using AGB predicted by the LiDAR-based model as the dependent variable and the mean and standard deviation of the reflectance values in each band of the satellite data as the explanatory variables (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 42.8 Mg/ha). We calculated AGB of all objects, divided the results into density classes, and mapped the resulting AGB distribution. Our results suggest that this approach can provide the forest carbon stock per unit area values required to support REDD-plus.

TI  - Assessing carbon stocks using indigenous peoples' field measurements in Amazonian Guyana
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimations of carbon stocks across large tracts of tropical forests are key for participation in programs promoting avoided deforestation and carbon sequestration, such as the UN REDD+ framework. Trained local technicians can provide such data, and this, combined with satellite imagery, allows robust carbon stock estimation across vegetation classes and large areas. In the first comprehensive survey in Guyana conducted by indigenous people, ground data from 21 study sites in the Rupununi region were used to estimate above ground tree carbon density across a diversity of ecosystems and land use types. Carbon stocks varied between village sites from 1 Tg to 22.7 Tg, and these amounts were related to stem density and diameter. This variation was correlated with vegetation type across the region, with savannas holding on average 14 MgC ha(-1) and forests 153 MgC ha(-1). The results indicated that previous estimates based on remotely sensed data for this area may be inaccurate (under estimations). There were also differences in carbon densities between village sites and uninhabited control areas, which are presumably driven by community use. Recruiting local technicians for field work allowed (a) large amounts of ground data to be collected for a wide region otherwise hard to access, and (b) ensured that local people were directly involved in Guyana's Low Carbon Development Strategy as part of REDD+. This is the first such comprehensive survey of carbon stocks, carbon density and vegetation types over a large area in Guyana, one of the first countries to develop such a program. The potential inclusion of forests held by indigenous peoples in REDD+ programs is a global issue: we clearly show that indigenous people are capable of assessing and monitoring carbon on their lands.

AB  - The study assessed the amount of carbon being sequestrated in the Ondo State Afforestation Project in Oluwa Forest, south - west of Nigeria, with the view to determine the above ground biomass (AGB) and belowground biomass (BGB), estimate the total carbon content and evaluate the CO2 sequestered. Geospatial techniques and the non-destructive field observation method were used. The results showed that a total of 359 megatons of CO2 was estimated to have been sequestered using the non-destructive field measurements. In addition, the rate of change in land use land cover between 1984 and 2015 was determined. A geospatial database derived from field measurements was developed to monitor carbon content of the forest.

TI  - Responses of Soil Organic Carbon Fractions and Stability to Forest Conversion in the Nanling Nature Reserve, China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the impact of typical vegetation types in forest conversion zones on soil organic carbon (SOC) structure and stability is crucial for developing terrestrial ecosystem carbon sequestration strategies. In this study, we selected three typical forest stands in the Nanling National Nature Reserve: a primary evergreen broad-leaved forest (BL), a secondary mixed coniferous and broad-leaved forest (ML), and a Chinese fir plantation (CL). Soil samples were collected to examine the SOC fractions and carbon pool management index (CPMI) in three forest stands. The influence of soil property factors on SOC fractions was also analyzed. The results showed that the transformation process from a BL to an ML or a CL changed the structure and stability of organic carbon by reducing the labile SOC fractions and increasing the recalcitrant carbon fraction in the soil. The higher lability index (LI) and CPMI of soils in the BL indicated better carbon accumulation and activity, making this treatment more advantageous for management strategies aimed at promoting natural forest renewal and ecological restoration. Correlation and RDA analysis revealed that the availability of soil P was a key factor limiting the variation in organic C fractions in the acidic soils of tropical forests in South China.

TI  - Potential mechanisms for achieving agricultural benefits from biochar application to temperate soils: a review
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Review
AB  - Natural organic biomass burning creates black carbon which forms a considerable proportion of the soil's organic carbon. Due to black carbon's aromatic structure it is recalcitrant and has the potential for long-term carbon sequestration in soil. Soils within the Amazon-basin contain numerous sites where the 'dark earth of the Indians' (Terra preta de Indio, or Amazonian Dark Earths (ADE)) exist and are composed of variable quantities of highly stable organic black carbon waste ('biochar'). The apparent high agronomic fertility of these sites, relative to tropical soils in general, has attracted interest. Biochars can be produced by 'baking' organic matter under low oxygen ('pyrolysis'). The quantities of key mineral elements within these biochars can be directly related to the levels of these components in the feedstock prior to burning. Their incorporation in soils influences soil structure, texture, porosity, particle size distribution and density. The molecular structure of biochars shows a high degree of chemical and microbial stability. A key physical feature of most biochars is their highly porous structure and large surface area. This structure can provide refugia for beneficial soil micro-organisms such as mycorrhizae and bacteria, and influences the binding of important nutritive cations and anions. This binding can enhance the availability of macro-nutrients such as N and P. Other biochar soil changes include alkalisation of soil pH and increases in electrical conductivity (EC) and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Ammonium leaching has been shown to be reduced, along with N2O soil emissions. There may also be reductions in soil mechanical impedance. Terra preta soils contain a higher number of 'operational taxonomic units' and have highly distinctive microbial communities relative to neighbouring soils. The potential importance of biochar soil incorporation on mycorrhizal fungi has also been noted with biochar providing a physical niche devoid of fungal grazers. Improvements in soil field capacity have been recorded upon biochar additions. Evidence shows that bioavailability and plant uptake of key nutrients increases in response to biochar application, particularly when in the presence of added nutrients. Depending on the quantity of biochar added to soil significant improvements in plant productivity have been achieved, but these reports derive predominantly from studies in the tropics. As yet there is limited critical analysis of possible agricultural impacts of biochar application in temperate regions, nor on the likelihood of utilising such soils as long-term sites for carbon sequestration. This review aims to determine the extent to which inferences of experience mostly from tropical regions could be extrapolated to temperate soils and to suggest areas requiring study.

TI  - Geometrid Moth Species Richness, Distribution and Community Composition in Different Forest Types of Papua New Guinea
T2  - CASE STUDIES IN THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As the major group of herbivorous insects, moths are highly significant in natural ecosystems. In collaboration with the Papua New Guinea (PNG) multipurpose National Forest Inventory (NFI) survey, this study investigates the species richness, distribution and community composition of Geometrid moths (Lepidoptera) in PNG's tropical forests and analyses environmental drivers of the geometrid community structure. By providing a baseline assessment of an important order of insects that can serve as an indicator for broader biodiversity, this study informs how biodiversity assessments can be better integrated into the planning of forest conservation initiatives, particularly those related to REDD+ and forest carbon offset developments. The research was conducted over 3 years at 38 NFI clusters throughout six provinces: Eastern Highlands, Western Highlands, Morobe, Madang and West New Britain and Central Province. Moths were collected from dusk to before midnight (18:00 h to 22:00 h) using a manual light trapping method for four nights per site, with a total of 152 light trap samples. Results included a total of 11,830 specimens from 1,108 morphological species from lowland and montane forests in disturbed (degraded and/or logged) and primary forests. Elevation and forest disturbance are the main variables that influence the distribution of species. Species richness was low in montane undisturbed forests compared with lowland (disturbed and primary) forests and montane disturbed forests. Species similarity between light trap samples tends to decrease as elevation increases. Geometrid moth species were arranged into two main orders of community composition according to the forest types: montane (disturbed and/or primary) forests species and lowland (disturbed and/or primary forest) species as per the samples.

TI  - Restoration plantations accelerate dead wood accumulation in tropical premontane forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dead wood stores 10-20% of global forest carbon stocks, but its recovery and restoration in secondary tropical forests are poorly documented. In this study, we evaluated (1) the recovery pattern of dead wood volumes across a chronosequence of secondary tropical forests that used to be former coffee plantations, and (2) the efficiency of two common restoration strategies to recover dead wood volumes similar to those found in old-growth forests, all in a tropical premontane landscape in southern Costa Rica. Restoration strategies consisted of plantations and natural regeneration. Plantations consist of plots where two endemic (Terminalia amazonia and Vochysia guatemalensis) and two naturalized (Inga edulis and Ertyhrina poeppegiana) species were planted in rows. Natural regeneration consists of plots where no trees were planted, but where agriculture or cattle are excluded though fencing and vegetation is allowed to regenerate naturally. We hypothesized that (1) dead wood volumes increase with forest age following a logistic shape, and that (2) restoration plantations recover dead wood volumes more quickly compared to naturally regenerated forests. We measured dead wood volumes in a total of 35 forest fragments that were former coffee plantations or are currently old-growth forests and 10 restoration plots containing either natural regeneration or restoration plantations that were former fallow or pasture using strip transects. Dead wood volumes significantly increased with forest age following a logistic shape, starting with very low values in early ages (3-5 years), increasing rapidly (6-50 years), and ending with high and relatively stable values after 50 years of age. In addition, plantations (16 to 17 years old) recovered 41% of dead wood volumes found in old-growth forests > 100 years old, whereas naturally regenerated forests of the same age only recovered 1.7% of dead wood volumes found in old-growth forests. Our study shows that restoration plantations not only accelerate the recovery of above ground biomass, but also accelerate the recovery of dead wood in premontane Neotropical ecosystems. This indicates that tree planting positively affects carbon storage, and potentially the preservation of dead wood-associated biodiversity.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

CL  - Bogor, INDONESIA
AB  - Palm oil expansion in tropical forest margins captures headlines, primarily out of concern that encroachment to tropical forest causes environmental problem and ignites social issues [1]. Sustainability has to be understood in the wider context of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), rather than as primarily a plot-level ecological concern about persistence of production, to make sense of the debate that has become a very polarized and find ways forward. Cascading ecological and social issues have caused a loss of trust, (threats of) consumer boycotts and multiple standards and certification responses. Diverse sustainability issues have come up as part of a public issue-attention cycle with five recognisable stages [2]: A) Agenda setting, B) Better and widely shared understanding of what is at stake, C) Commitment to common principles, D) Details of devils derailing operations, devolved to (newly created or existing) formal institutions that handle implementation and associated budgets, and E) Efforts to monitor and evaluate effects. In Indonesia two phases of new establishment of palm oil coexist within a forest transition gradient: (i) (industry-led) expansion into new forest margins with many social and ecological consequences; and (ii) (often farmerled) conversion of existing agroforestry and tree crop (often rubber-based) or pasture economies in mosaic landscapes. External consumer concerns refer to the expansion phase, rather than to production sustainability or issues of smallholder concern. However, certification standards are only partially adjusted to the latter. After a 'voluntary industry standards' phase of differentiation with and shifting blame to non-certified others [3], government involvement in Malaysia and Indonesia suggests that standards and certification can trickle down to enforceable good practice standards for all. This can learn from past ineffective policies that did not address the real issues in local context [4]. On the other hand, subnational jurisdictional entities are the scale at which oil palm production can be balanced with other goals, such as forest conservation and smallholder welfare. This needs a supportive and clear national policy support that combines clarity on forest protection (as in the now permanent moratorium), with support for risk-reducing diversified smallholder oil palm production systems [5,6] and international communication that acknowledges past problems but shows Indonesia is ready to move on, connecting all the dots of sustainable development goals.

TI  - Community forest management and forest cover change in Lampung, Indonesia
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Community-based forestry (CBF) is often cited as a way for improving livelihood of local communities while conserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change. However, empirical assessments of CBF outcomes are still lacking, especially for their biophysical conditions. This study investigates the extent to which a type of CBF practices in Indonesia, Community Forest (HKM), managed to maintain forest cover. We applied a propensity scoring approach to empirically measure the rates of deforestation between 2007 and 2016 for Conservation Forests and Protection Forests with and without HKM concessions. Our finding is that HKMs are less effective than Conservation Forests (e.g. National Parks) in reducing forest cover loss, but more effective than other similar forests without CBF management. This is a promising starting point for expanding CBF in Indonesia. We recommend: 1) explicit consideration of biophysical characteristics of CBF locations in designating future sites; 2) providing site-specific financial and technical supports for local communities; 3) utilizing remotely sensed data and propensity scoring for monitoring conservation outcomes.

TI  - Monitoring carbon stocks in the tropics and the remote sensing operational limitations: from local to regional projects
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Current remote sensing technologies are effective tools for contributing to the estimation of terrestrial carbon stocks and carbon stock changes. This paper provides an overview of information requirements, sensor capabilities and limitations, and analysis approaches for the use of remotely sensed data in the generation of tropical carbon sequestration monitoring systems. While it is evident that remotely sensed data have tremendous utility for monitoring carbon stock changes, it is important to be aware of their limitations. Three critical limitations are: (1) the definition of methods and algorithms to accurately estimate forest age, (2) the provision of techniques that can yield accurate estimation of deforestation rates in both tropical dry and wet forest environments, and (3) the strong need to develop new approaches to link biophysical variables (e. g., leaf area index) to spectral reflectance to support spatially distributed carbon sequestration models. The validity of final estimates of carbon and carbon stock changes rests on complex issues at several levels, from the data themselves, to the analysis, interpretation, and validation of the data. Consideration of these issues, as well as the need for sound project planning and development within budget constraints, will be important in the development of carbon stock monitoring programs in the tropics.

TI  - A review of the ecosystem functions in oil palm plantations, using forests as a reference system
T2  - BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Oil palm plantations have expanded rapidly in recent decades. This large-scale land-use change has had great ecological, economic, and social impacts on both the areas converted to oil palm and their surroundings. However, research on the impacts of oil palm cultivation is scattered and patchy, and no clear overview exists. We address this gap through a systematic and comprehensive literature review of all ecosystem functions in oil palm plantations, including several (genetic, medicinal and ornamental resources, information functions) not included in previous systematic reviews. We compare ecosystem functions in oil palm plantations to those in forests, as the conversion of forest to oil palm is prevalent in the tropics. We find that oil palm plantations generally have reduced ecosystem functioning compared to forests: 11 out of 14 ecosystem functions show a net decrease in level of function. Some functions show decreases with potentially irreversible global impacts (e.g. reductions in gas and climate regulation, habitat and nursery functions, genetic resources, medicinal resources, and information functions). The most serious impacts occur when forest is cleared to establish new plantations, and immediately afterwards, especially on peat soils. To variable degrees, specific plantation management measures can prevent or reduce losses of some ecosystem functions (e.g. avoid illegal land clearing via fire, avoid draining of peat, use of integrated pest management, use of cover crops, mulch, and compost) and we highlight synergistic mitigation measures that can improve multiple ecosystem functions simultaneously. The only ecosystem function which increases in oil palm plantations is, unsurprisingly, the production of marketable goods. Our review highlights numerous research gaps. In particular, there are significant gaps with respect to socio-cultural information functions. Further, there is a need for more empirical data on the importance of spatial and temporal scales, such as differences among plantations in different environments, of different sizes, and of different ages, as our review has identified examples where ecosystem functions vary spatially and temporally. Finally, more research is needed on developing management practices that can offset the losses of ecosystem functions. Our findings should stimulate research to address the identified gaps, and provide a foundation for more systematic research and discussion on ways to minimize the negative impacts and maximize the positive impacts of oil palm cultivation.

AB  - Climate change mitigation mechanisms, such as REDD+, which aim at avoiding deforestation and forest degradation, require an accurate aboveground biomass (AGB) monitoring. In the present study, multi-temporal X-(TerraSAR-X) and L-band (ALOS PALSAR) SAR data and a multispectral RapidEye image were analyzed for their ability to estimate AGB in a tropical forested peatland area in Central Kalimantan on Borneo, Indonesia. Field inventory AGB data was used to calibrate regression models based on SAR backscatter values and spectral unmixed fractions of the RapidEye image. The independent validation indicated that the estimated AGB using optical data is more accurate (RMSE=44%) than the SAR estimated AGB (RMSE=82%). AGB derived from RapidEye data overestimates AGB on burned areas, but these estimations depict degradation through low impact selective logging. The SAR model estimated AGB accurately in lower biomass ranges and on burned scars.

TI  - Forest Carbon Management: a Review of Silvicultural Practices and Management Strategies Across Boreal, Temperate and Tropical Forests
T2  - CURRENT FORESTRY REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of Review Carbon sequestration and storage in forest ecosystems is often promoted as a solution for reducing CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. Yet, our understanding is lacking regarding how forest management strategies affect the net removal of greenhouse gases and contribute to climate change mitigation. Here, we present a review of carbon sequestration and stock dynamics, following three strategies that are widely used in boreal, temperate and tropical forests: extensive forest management, intensive forest management and old-growth forest conservation. Recent Findings Several studies show that specific forest management strategies can improve carbon sequestration capacity and soil carbon storage. Within these studies, the old-growth forest conservation strategy results in greater carbon storage in soils than do extensive and intensive forest management. Intensive forest management enhances forest carbon sequestration capacity through afforestation using fast-growing species, mechanical soil preparation from low to moderate intensity and N fertilization. Extensive forest management is an intermediate compromise regarding carbon sequestration and soil carbon storage, between conservation and intensive forest management strategies. With respect to silvicultural treatments, partial cutting is a practice that increases forest carbon sequestration rates and maintains higher carbon storage in soils compared to clear-cuts. Each silvicultural practice that is discussed in this review showed a similar effect on forest carbon in all biomes, although the magnitude of these effects differs mainly in terms of heterotrophic respiration. To achieve sustainable management and fulfill industrial demand and profitability, specific gaps must be dealt with to improve our scientific knowledge regarding forest carbon sequestration in a climate change context, mainly through the integration of the three aforementioned strategies in a functional zoning approach at the landscape scale. We present a review with promising strategies for guiding sustainable forest management in such a global context.

TI  - Co-benefits of biodiversity and carbon sequestration from regenerating secondary forests in the Philippine uplands: implications for forest landscape restoration
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Shifting cultivation is a widespread practice in tropical forested areas that policy makers often regard as the major cause of forest degradation. Secondary fallow forests regrowing after shifting cultivation are generally not viewed as suitable for biodiversity conservation and carbon retention. Drawing upon our research in the Philippines and other relevant case studies, we compared the biodiversity and carbon sequestration in recovering secondary forests after shifting cultivation to other land uses that commonly follow shifting cultivation. Regenerating secondary forests had higher biodiversity than fast growing timber plantations and other restoration options available in the area. Some old plantations, however, provided carbon benefits comparable the old growth forest, although their biodiversity was less than that of the regenerating forests. Our study demonstrates that secondary forests regrowing after shifting cultivation have a high potential for biodiversity and carbon sequestration co-benefits, representing an effective strategy for forest management and restoration in countries where they are common and where the forest is an integral part of rural people's livelihoods. We discuss the issues and potential mechanisms through which such dynamic land use can be incorporated into development projects that are currently financing the sustainable management, conservation, and restoration of tropical forests.

TI  - The exceptional value of intact forest ecosystems
T2  - NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - As the terrestrial human footprint continues to expand, the amount of native forest that is free from significant damaging human activities is in precipitous decline. There is emerging evidence that the remaining intact forest supports an exceptional confluence of globally significant environmental values relative to degraded forests, including imperilled biodiversity, carbon sequestration and storage, water provision, indigenous culture and the maintenance of human health. Here we argue that maintaining and, where possible, restoring the integrity of dwindling intact forests is an urgent priority for current global efforts to halt the ongoing biodiversity crisis, slow rapid climate change and achieve sustainability goals. Retaining the integrity of intact forest ecosystems should be a central component of proactive global and national environmental strategies, alongside current efforts aimed at halting deforestation and promoting reforestation.

M3  - Data set
AB  - In the modern era, rapid anthropogenic activities in the vicinity of the Himalayas disturb the carbon sequestration potential resulting in climate change. For the first time, this study estimates the biomass and carbon storage potential of Northeast Indias diverse land uses through a biomass estimation model developed for this region. The mean tree density in tropical, subtropical, and temperate forests was 539, 554, and 638 trees ha1, respectively. The mean vegetation carbon stock was the highest for temperate forests (122.09 MgCha1), followed by subtropical plantations (115.45 MgCha1), subtropical forests (106.01MgCha1), tropical forests (105.33 MgCha1), tropical plantations (93.00MgCha1), and temperate plantations (50.10 MgCha1). Among the forests, the mean soil organic carbon (SOC) stock up to 45cm depth was the highest for tropical forests (72.54MgCha1), followed by temperate forests (63.4MgCha1) and subtropical forests (42.58MgCha1). A strong relationship between the tree basal area and biomass carbon storage was found for all land-use types. The land-use transformation from agriculture to agroforestry, and grassland to plantations increased both vegetation carbon (VC) and SOC stocks. The corresponding increase in VC and SOC was 40.80 and 43.34MgCha1, respectively, in the former, and 83.18 and 97.64MgCha1 in the latter. In general, the landscape-level estimates were drawn from site-level estimates in a given land-use type, and therefore, the corresponding values might be overestimated. Nevertheless, the results provide baseline information on carbon stock which may serve as a reference for devising appropriate land-use change policies in the region. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest ecosystems play an important role in mitigating the concentration increase of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere through carbon sequestration by plants and its storage in biomass and soil. The objective was to determine the aerial biomass carbon stock in a dry tropical forest in Brazil. It was developed between 2012 to 2015, in an area with an advanced regeneration stage (50 years) in the semi-arid region of Pernambuco and it was used 40 permanent plots (400 m2) distant 80 m apart, with 50 m from the border, totaling 1.6 ha of the area to sample the shrubby-arboreal component, where all individuals with circumference at breast height (1.30 m of the soil) equal or greater than 6 cm were identified, measured and labeled in 2012 and remeasured in 2015. It was calculated the biomass and carbon stocks through developed equations available in the literature. The results showed that the total biomass and carbon stock in the first year was 27.97 e 12.92 Mg.ha-1 while in 2015 it was 18.49 and 8.39 Mg.ha-1 respectively. The results showed a biomass and carbon stock reduction of more than 30% in the period evaluated, even this, the area manages to present values within the expected pattern for the region, assuring the importance of sustainable forest management of these native/ natural vegetation areas.

TI  - Forests and climate change: Forcings, feedbacks, and the climate benefits of forests
T2  - SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The world's forests influence climate through physical, chemical, and biological processes that affect planetary energetics, the hydrologic cycle, and atmospheric composition. These complex and nonlinear forest-atmosphere interactions can dampen or amplify anthropogenic climate change. Tropical, temperate, and boreal reforestation and afforestation attenuate global warming through carbon sequestration. Biogeophysical feedbacks can enhance or diminish this negative climate forcing. Tropical forests mitigate warming through evaporative cooling, but the low albedo of boreal forests is a positive climate forcing. The evaporative effect of temperate forests is unclear. The net climate forcing from these and other processes is not known. Forests are under tremendous pressure from global change. Interdisciplinary science that integrates knowledge of the many interacting climate services of forests with the impacts of global change is necessary to identify and understand as yet unexplored feedbacks in the Earth system and the potential of forests to mitigate climate change.

TI  - Modeling carbon sequestration in afforestation, agroforestry and forest management projects: the CO2FIX V.2 approach
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper describes the Version 2 of the CO2FIX (CO2FIX V.2) model, a user-friendly tool for dynamically estimating the carbon sequestration potential of forest management, agroforesty and afforestation projects. CO2FIX V.2 is a multi-cohort ecosystem-level model based on carbon accounting of forest stands, including forest biomass, soils and products. Carbon stored in living biomass is estimated with a forest cohort model that allows for competition, natural mortality, logging, and mortality due to logging damage. Soil carbon is modeled using five stock pools, three for litter and two for humus. The dynamics of carbon stored in wood products is simulated with a set of pools for short-, medium- and long-lived products, and includes processing efficiency, re-use of by-products, recycling, and disposal forms. The CO2FIX V.2 model estimates total carbon balance of alternative management regimes in both even and uneven-aged forests, and thus has a wide applicability for both temperate and tropical conditions. Results for the model testing and validation in selected temperate and tropical forest management systems are presented and discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Forest biomass is a key influence for future climate, and the world urgently needs highly scalable financing schemes, such as carbon offsetting certifications, to protect and restore forests. Current manual forest carbon stock inventory methods of measuring single trees by hand are time, labour, and cost intensive and have been shown to be subjective. They can lead to substantial overestimation of the carbon stock and ultimately distrust in forest financing. The potential for impact and scale of leveraging advancements in machine learning and remote sensing technologies is promising, but needs to be of high quality in order to replace the current forest stock protocols for certifications.In this paper, we present ReforesTree, a benchmark dataset of forest carbon stock in six agro-forestry carbon offsetting sites in Ecuador. Furthermore, we show that a deep learning-based end-to-end model using individual tree detection from low cost RGB-only drone imagery is accurately estimating forest carbon stock within official carbon offsetting certification standards. Additionally, our baseline CNN model outperforms state-of-the-art satellite-based forest biomass and carbon stock estimates for this type of small-scale, tropical agro-forestry sites. We present this dataset to encourage machine learning research in this area to increase accountability and transparency of monitoring, verification and reporting (MVR) in carbon offsetting projects, as well as scaling global reforestation financing through accurate remote sensing.

T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data set
AB  - In the modern era, rapid anthropogenic activities in the vicinity of the Himalayas disturb the carbon sequestration potential resulting in climate change. For the first time, this study estimates the biomass and carbon storage potential of Northeast Indias diverse land uses through a biomass estimation model developed for this region. The mean tree density in tropical, subtropical, and temperate forests was 539, 554, and 638 trees ha1, respectively. The mean vegetation carbon stock was the highest for temperate forests (122.09 MgCha1), followed by subtropical plantations (115.45 MgCha1), subtropical forests (106.01MgCha1), tropical forests (105.33 MgCha1), tropical plantations (93.00MgCha1), and temperate plantations (50.10 MgCha1). Among the forests, the mean soil organic carbon (SOC) stock up to 45cm depth was the highest for tropical forests (72.54MgCha1), followed by temperate forests (63.4MgCha1) and subtropical forests (42.58MgCha1). A strong relationship between the tree basal area and biomass carbon storage was found for all land-use types. The land-use transformation from agriculture to agroforestry, and grassland to plantations increased both vegetation carbon (VC) and SOC stocks. The corresponding increase in VC and SOC was 40.80 and 43.34MgCha1, respectively, in the former, and 83.18 and 97.64MgCha1 in the latter. In general, the landscape-level estimates were drawn from site-level estimates in a given land-use type, and therefore, the corresponding values might be overestimated. Nevertheless, the results provide baseline information on carbon stock which may serve as a reference for devising appropriate land-use change policies in the region. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - Uncertain Emission Reductions from Forest Conservation: REDD in the Bale Mountains, Ethiopia
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The environmental integrity of a mechanism rewarding Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) depends on appropriate accounting for emission reductions. Largely stemming from a lack of forest data in developing countries, emission reductions accounting contains substantial uncertainty as a result of forest carbon stock estimates, where the application of biome-averaged data over large forest areas is commonplace. Using a case study in the Bale Mountains in Ethiopia, we exemplify the implications of primary and secondary forest carbon stock estimates on predicted REDD project emission reductions and revenues. Primary data estimate area-weighted mean forest carbon stock of 195 tC/ha +/- 81, and biome-averaged data reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change underestimate forest carbon stock in the Bale Mountains by as much as 63% in moist forest and 58% in dry forest. Combining forest carbon stock estimates and uncertainty in voluntary carbon market prices demonstrates the financial impact of uncertainty: potential revenues over the 20-year project ranged between US$9 million and US$185 million. Estimated revenues will influence decisions to implement a project or not and may have profound implications for the level of benefit sharing that can be supported. Strong financial incentives exist to improve forest carbon stock estimates in tropical forests, as well as the environmental integrity of REDD projects.

TI  - Carbon storage and emissions offset potential in an African dry forest, the Arabuko-Sokoke Forest, Kenya
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Concerns about rapid tropical deforestation, and its contribution to rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, increase the importance of monitoring terrestrial carbon storage in changing landscapes. Emerging markets for carbon emission offsets may offer developing nations needed incentives for reforestation, rehabilitation, and avoided deforestation. However, relatively little empirical data exists regarding carbon storage in African tropical forests, particularly for those in arid or semi-arid regions. Kenya's 416 km(2) Arabuko-Sokoke Forest (ASF) is the largest remaining fragment of East African coastal dry forest and is considered a global biodiversity hotspot (Myers et al. 2000), but has been significantly altered by past commercial logging and ongoing extraction. Forest carbon storage for ASF was estimated using allometric equations for tree biomass, destructive techniques for litter and herbaceous vegetation biomass, and spectroscopy for soils. Satellite imagery was used to assess land cover changes from 1992 to 2004. Forest and thicket types (Cynometra webberi dominated, Brachystegia spiciformis dominated, and mixed species forest) had carbon densities ranging from 58 to 94 Mg C/ha. The ASF area supported a 2.8-3.0 Tg C carbon stock. Although total forested area in ASF did not change over the analyzed time period, ongoing disturbances, quantified by the basal area of cut tree stumps per sample plot, correlated with decreased carbon densities. Madunguni Forest, an adjoining forest patch, lost 86% of its forest cover and at least 76% of its terrestrial carbon stock in the time period. Improved management of wood harvesting in ASF and rehabilitation of Madunguni Forest could substantially increase terrestrial carbon sequestration in the region.

TI  - The effect of ecological restoration methods on carbon stocks in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoring degraded areas is an effective strategy to reestablish the environmental services provided by the forests including global warming mitigation by carbon sequestration. Restoring lands is especially important in the Atlantic Forest, a global hotspot in Brazil threatened by deforestation. To successfully restore degraded lands, it is necessary to apply the most suitable method for each situation. However, studies comparing restoration techniques are scarce. This lack of information hampers the Atlantic Forest restoration and, given the original complexity of its ecological dynamics, restoration success is even more challenging in this ecosystem. This study aimed to assess carbon stocks (above and belowgmund), carbon content (%), and carbon isotope at 5-year old sites implemented by different restoration methods in southeastern Brazil. The restoration methods tested were active restoration (AR), assisted restoration (AsR), and passive restoration in an abandoned pasture (AP), which were compared to a nearby pasture (P) and a remaining forest fragment (RF). The assessed pools were: tree, coarse roots, fine roots, herbaceous, litter, standing dead wood, fallen dead wood, and soil (0-1 cm, 5-10 cm, 10-20 cm layers). Total carbon stock was higher on RF (152.304 Mg C ha(-1)), followed by the P (84.378 Mg C ha(-1)), AR (66.414 Mg C h(-1)) AsR (65.73 Mg C ha(-1)) and AP (65.581 Mg C ha(-1)). The restoration areas sites are still too young to show significant differences in total carbon stock as a result of different restoration methods. However, carbon stock and carbon content (%) differed among the pools according to the method and, in all cases, the largest carbon pool was soil, which shows the importance of sampling every pool for carbon stock and carbon content (%) estimation. Isotope analysis showed that carbon inputs in the soil had different sources, C3 or C4 plants, depending on the method. We concluded that these young secondary areas are already sequestering carbon, which helps mitigate global warming, and that monitoring every pool is important for a complete assessment, not only to restore secondary forests and understand growth but also for other land-uses such as pastures. Besides, the results obtained can be generalized to other tropical forest ecosystems with similar conditions (local and landscape), constituting a relevant contribution to forest restoration and carbon-sequestration related sciences.

TI  - Cropping system diversification for food production in Mindanao rubber plantations: a rice cultivar mixture and rice intercropped with mungbean
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Including food production in non-food systems, such as rubber plantations and biofuel or bioenergy crops, may contribute to household food security. We evaluated the potential for planting rice, mungbean, rice cultivar mixtures, and rice intercropped with mungbean in young rubber plantations in experiments in the Arakan Valley of Mindanao in the Philippines. Rice mixtures consisted of two- or three-row strips of cultivar Dinorado, a cultivar with higher value but lower yield, and high-yielding cultivar UPL Ri-5. Rice and mungbean intercropping treatments consisted of different combinations of two- or three-row strips of rice and mungbean. We used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate the yield of each crop alone and in the mixture or intercropping treatments. We also evaluated a land equivalent ratio for yield, along with weed biomass (where Ageratum conyzoides was particularly abundant), the severity of disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae and Cochliobolus miyabeanus, and rice bug (Leptocorisa acuta) abundance. We analyzed the yield ranking of each cropping system across site-year combinations to determine mean relative performance and yield stability. When weighted by their relative economic value, UPL Ri-5 had the highest mean performance, but with decreasing performance in low-yielding environments. A rice and mungbean intercropping system had the second highest performance, tied with high-value Dinorado but without decreasing relative performance in low-yielding environments. Rice and mungbean intercropped with rubber have been adopted by farmers in the Arakan Valley.

TI  - Recovery of sandy campinaran soils degraded by sand mining to unleash the ecological restoration of this ecosystem
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Sand mining is an activity that causes undesirable environmental impacts on the soil, fauna and flora, leading to the loss of habitats, biodiversity and various ecosystem services. In the Metropolitan Region of Manaus, the main mining activity is the extraction of sand in Campinaranas from sandy soils. Campinaranas are vegetable portions in the middle of the forest, with typical flora and fauna, forming islands of endemic species, from herbaceous to arboreal. Although they have less diversity than the tropical forests that surround them, these islands have great ecological importance, since they are rich in species unique to this ecosystem, also providing relevant ecosystem services like replacement of aquifers and carbon storage. Despite the intense environmental impact, the need for this material in abundance for civil construction and the lack of substitutes on the necessary scale, make sand extraction a very intense economic activity today. Therefore, controlled and rational mining becomes necessary, with the consequent recovery of degraded ecosystems. However, the ecological restoration of mined areas is a a costly activity, which requires a set of elaborate techniques, especially based on the recovery of the soil in the initial phase. The recovery of soils from the mined areas of Campinaranas is even more challenging because it is fragile, highly erodible, poor in nutrients, which occur as entrapments within the forest environment, whose capacity for recolonization and natural regeneration is very restricted. The traditional technique employed to promote the restoration of areas explored in sand mining projects in the region is the direct planting of seedlings of native species, which due to soil degradation, is not proving to be effective. Despite the importance and urgency of this topic (recovery of the soils of Campinaranas), no studies were found that focused on the recovery of the degraded soils of Campinarana by sand mining activities and, therefore, the great majority of the initiatives of recovery of campinaranas mined were not successful. Therefore, the main objective of this proposal is to identify an adequate and economically viable technical procedure for the recovery of degraded soils in Campinaranas after sand exploration. Initially, the characterization of preserved campinaran soils as reference ecosystems will be carried out, as well as the characterization of degraded soils (or mining floor) in Campinaranas after sand mining, through morphological, physical, chemical and soil macrofauna attributes. With the characterization of the degradation of these soils, using the reference ecosystems, the need to recover these soil features will be quantified. Thus, for the recovery of degraded soils, we will implement experiments in greenhouse, and later, in the field, in order to select which treatment is most suitable for the recovery of degraded soils in Campinaranas, by sand extraction. During the experiments, the following materials will be used: a) addition of top layer of top soil, collected from reference areas; b) planting commercial species of green manure; c) addition of residues from açaí processing; d) addition of tanned sawdust; e) correction of acidity and fertilization, according to the results of chemical characterization. These treatments are focused on replacing the organic matter necessary to fix nutrients, which will trigger the trajectory of soil recovery. This study will produce unprecedented data, which will allow to understand the levels of degradation of the impacted soils, to select indicators of the soil quality, the rate of loss of natural vegetation, know which species are established after leaving the area, as well as select the most suitable treatment for the recovery of degraded soils. Finally, based on these results, we will prepare an initial protocol for the restoration of areas of campinaranas degraded by sand mining, which will represent an excellent service for society. (AU)

TI  - Phyllostomid Bat Occurrence in Successional Stages of Neotropical Dry Forests
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Tropical dry forests (TDFs) are highly endangered tropical ecosystems being replaced by a complex mosaic of patches of different successional stages, agricultural fields and pasturelands. In this context, it is urgent to understand how taxa playing critical ecosystem roles respond to habitat modification. Because Phyllostomid bats provide important ecosystem services (e.g. facilitate gene flow among plant populations and promote forest regeneration), in this study we aimed to identify potential patterns on their response to TDF transformation in sites representing four different successional stages (initial, early, intermediate and late) in three Neotropical regions: Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil. We evaluated bat occurrence at the species, ensemble (abundance) and assemblage level (species richness and composition, guild composition). We also evaluated how bat occurrence was modulated by the marked seasonality of TDFs. In general, we found high seasonal and regional specificities in phyllostomid occurrence, driven by specificities at species and guild levels. For example, highest frugivore abundance occurred in the early stage of the moistest TDF, while highest nectarivore abundance occurred in the same stage of the driest TDF. The high regional specificity of phyllostomid responses could arise from: (1) the distinctive environmental conditions of each region, (2) the specific behavior and ecological requirements of the regional bat species, (3) the composition, structure and phenological patterns of plant assemblages in the different stages, and (4) the regional landscape composition and configuration. We conclude that, in tropical seasonal environments, it is imperative to perform long-term studies considering seasonal variations in environmental conditions and plant phenology, as well as the role of landscape attributes. This approach will allow us to identify potential patterns in bat responses to habitat modification, which constitute an invaluable tool for not only bat biodiversity conservation but also for the conservation of the key ecological processes they provide.

TI  - Propensity of farmers to conserve forest within REDD plus projects in areas affected by armed-conflict
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The implementation of carbon-storage efforts in countries experiencing armed conflicts or confronting illegal activities (such as illicit crop cultivation) will permit additional tropical forests to be protected for climate change mitigation. Yet, despite these potential gains, the appropriate design and application of forest conservation and climate change mitigation approaches such as the mechanism for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD +) in such contexts remain little studied. Unanswered questions relate to the propensity of farmers in conflict affected areas to conserve forests for climate change mitigation. Such questions include, for what reasons and under what circumstances would such farmer participate in climate change mitigation activities? In this paper we address these questions by developing an econometric Logit model to understand factors influencing the propensity to conserve forest of farmers from 14 villages in Colombia. These villages are located in a region recognized as a stronghold of guerrilla insurgencies and as the center for illegal crop cultivation. The region was selected as it is also the proposed target area for piloting Colombian government REDD + activities. A household survey (n = 90) showed that four explanatory variables are significantly related to the 'propensity to conserve forest'. 'Harvest of non-timber forest products' (specifically bush meat) positively influences a farmer's propensity to conserve forest. In contrast, higher 'percentage of forest area', 'deforestation for (the production of) subsistence crops' and 'harvest of wood product', each have a negative influence. Overall, results show an already high propensity to conserve forest among farmers (70% of respondents) and indicate their growing propensity toward the conservation of primary forest and management of degraded lands and secondary forest. These results might be attributable to efforts undertaken to reduce the causes of armed-conflicts and ecosystem deterioration, such as enhancement of land tenure security and farmer associations' rules to reduce deforestation. They might also be linked to communities' positive attitudes toward water resources conservation. We conclude that most farmers will not oppose forest conservation as long as it is compatible with their respective livelihood priorities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Intensive silviculture enhances biomass accumulation and tree diversity recovery in tropical forest restoration
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Maximizing initial aboveground woody biomass (AGB) accumulation in order to obtain early payments for carbon stocking is essential for the financial viability of reforestation programs fostered by climate mitigation efforts. Intensive silviculture, i.e., silviculture traditionally used in commercial forestry to maximize productivity and gains, has recently been advocated as a promising approach to enhance AGB accumulation in restoration plantations. However, this approach may hamper natural forest regeneration and ecological succession due to high competition between colonizing plants and planted trees. We investigated the impacts of different silvicultural treatments applied to restoration plantations with 20 native tree species on AGB accumulation and spontaneous regeneration of native woody species in an experiment set up in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. Intensive silviculture demonstrated a remarkable potential to enhance AGB accumulation in restoration plantations by increasing up to three times the AGB of tree stands (from similar to 25 to 75 Mg/ha in the 12th year). Intensive fertilization/weed control enhanced AGB accumulation, while higher tree density and the proportion of pioneers did not have a significant effect on AGB over the time. In spite of higher costs (cost increase of 13-19%), the cost-effectiveness for AGB accumulation of intensive silviculture was comparable to that of traditional silviculture applied to restoration (US$50-100/Mg AGB for 3 x 2 m spacing). Contrary to our expectations, we did not find a trade-off between AGB accumulation by planted trees and the spontaneous regeneration of tree species, since intensive silviculture enhanced the regeneration of both planted (total of 12 species) and colonizing woody species (total of 30 species) in the plantation understory. Specifically, a strong association was found between AGB stocks and the abundance and richness of colonizing species, a vast majority of which (90% of species and 95% of individuals) were dispersed by animals. We report a case of positive correlation between AGB stocking and woody species regeneration in the restoration of the Atlantic Forest. Fostering the establishment and maintenance of restoration tree plantations can, in some cases, be a win-win strategy for climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation in human-modified tropical landscapes.

TI  - Planting exceptional tropical tree species to increase long-term carbon storage in assisted secondary succession
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - With rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, strategies for greater carbon sequestration and long-term storage are urgently needed. Current reforestation schemes typically use fast-growing tree species with low wood density, limiting the amount of carbon stored. In most tropical forests, there are native species with relatively fast growth rates, high wood density and low mortality rates that also achieve large adult size-'exceptional species'.We present a simulated assessment of the carbon sequestration potential using these exceptional species in assisted secondary succession in the Neotropics.In our example, the selected exceptional species could add up to 16.2 Mg C/ha of sequestered carbon in secondary wet forests at maturity.Synthesis and applications. By increasing the representation of exceptional species in reforestation efforts, we could potentially boost long-term carbon storage in reforestation projects focussed on carbon sequestration. However, our approach is not a substitute for protecting existing old primary forests and reforested lands plus reducing deforestation and emissions.Con el aumento de las concentraciones atmosfericas de CO2, se necesitan urgentemente estrategias para una mayor captura y almacenamiento a largo plazo del carbono. Los esquemas de reforestacion actuales suelen utilizar especies de arboles de rapido crecimiento con baja densidad de madera, lo que limita la cantidad de carbono almacenado. En la mayoria de los bosques tropicales, hay especies nativas con tasas de crecimiento relativamente rapidas, alta densidad de madera y bajas tasas de mortalidad que tambien alcanzan un gran tamano adulto-'especies excepcionales'.Presentamos una evaluacion simulada del potencial de secuestro de carbono usando estas especies excepcionales en la sucesion secundaria asistida en el Neotropico.En nuestro ejemplo, las especies excepcionales seleccionadas podrian sumar hasta 16.2 Mg C/ha de carbono secuestrado en bosques humedos secundarios en su madurez.Sintesis y aplicaciones. Al aumentar la representacion de especies excepcionales en los esfuerzos de reforestacion, podriamos impulsar potencialmente el almacenamiento de carbono a largo plazo en proyectos de reforestacion centrados en el secuestro de carbono. Sin embargo, nuestro enfoque no reemplaza la proteccion de los bosques primarios antiguos existentes y las tierras reforestadas, ni reduce la necesidad de disminuir la deforestacion y las emisiones.By increasing the representation of exceptional species in reforestation efforts, we could potentially boost long-term carbon storage in reforestation projects focussed on carbon sequestration. However, our approach is not a substitute for protecting existing old primary forests and reforested lands plus reducing deforestation and emissions.image

TI  - Foliar methane and nitrous oxide fluxes in tropical tree species
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are critical biogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) with global warming potentials substantially greater than that of carbon dioxide (CO2). The exchange of these gases in tropical forests, particularly via foliar processes, remains poorly understood. We quantified foliar CH4 and N2O fluxes among tropical tree species and examined their potential association with the leaf economics spectrum (LES) traits. Sampling within Lawachara National Park, Bangladesh, we used in-situ measurements of foliar CH4 and N2O fluxes employing off-axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy (CH4, CO2 and H2O) and optical feedback-cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy (N2O) analyzers. Leaves were measured under dark, low, and high (0, 100, and 1000 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)) light conditions. Surveyed tree species exhibited both net foliar uptake and efflux of CH4, with a mean flux not different from zero, suggesting negligible net foliar emissions at the stand level. Plant families showed differences in CH4, but not N2O fluxes. Consistent efflux was observed for N2O, with a mean of 0.562 +/- 0.060 pmol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1). Pioneer species exhibited a higher mean N2O flux (0.81 +/- 0.17 pmol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)) compared to late-successional species (0.37 +/- 0.05 pmol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)). Pioneer species also showed a trend toward a higher mean CH4 flux (0.24 +/- 0.21 nmol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)) compared to mid-successional (-0.01 +/- 0.26 nmol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)) and late-successional species (-0.05 +/- 0.28 nmol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)). Moreover, among all leaf traits within the leaf economic spectrum, a significant positive relationship was observed between leaf N2O flux and total leaf nitrogen. Our results suggest that pioneer tree species significantly contribute to net CH4 and N2O emissions, potentially counteracting the carbon sequestration benefits in regenerating tropical forests. These findings indicate that accurate GHG budgeting should include direct measurements of foliar CH4 and N2O fluxes. Moreover, the results suggest that forest conservation and management strategies that prioritize late successional species will better mitigate GHG emissions.

TI  - Carbon emissions and sequestration potential of central African ecosystems
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - Joint Implementation under the Climate Change Convention and Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol require a scientific understanding of current carbon stocks, fluxes, and sequestration potential, especially in tropical ecosystems where there are large carbon reservoirs, significant carbon emissions, and large land areas available for reforestation. Central Africa contains 10% of the world's remaining tropical moist forests and has received little attention in carbon studies. In 1980, aboveground carbon stocks in the central African ecosystem were 28.92 Pg and were reduced to 24.79 Pg by 1990. Improved forest management aimed at increasing biomass density could sequester 18.32 Pg of carbon, and over 500 000 km(2) formerly forested land will be available by 2050 for reforestation with a capacity to offset 10 Pg carbon. Understanding the spatial distribution of biomass carbon and sequestration potential will be essential for carbon trading initiatives through Joint Implementation and Clean Development Mechanism.

TI  - Global estimates of forest soil methane flux identify a temperate and tropical forest methane sink
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest ecosystems play an important role in the global CH4 cycle. Understanding and quantifying the contri-bution and distribution of CH4 sinks and sources in global forest soils is vital for assessing realistic approaches to climate change mitigation. Here, we compiled a dataset of in situ global forest soil CH4 fluxes from published data, incorporating 772 case studies covering boreal (n = 12), temperate (n = 369), subtropical (n = 208), and tropical (n = 183) forests and spanning 1991-2020 as a basis to build the mixed-effect model. Using the screened best model, we identified the main drivers and predicted the global distribution of the forest soil CH4 flux. Our research revealed that global forest soil CH4 uptake decreased significantly with increasing mean annual tem-perature (MAT), soil bulk density (BD), soil organic carbon (SOC), and soil total nitrogen (TN) but increased significantly with increasing mean annual precipitation (MAP). The global mean CH4 uptake rate in forest soils was 3.95 & PLUSMN; 1.78 kg CH4 ha  1 yr  1, with the total sink of 14.98 & PLUSMN; 6.75 Tg CH4 yr  1. The soil CH4 sinks in temperate and tropical forests contributed 84 % to the total sink of global forests. The CH4 emission rate in global forest soils averaged 1.12 & PLUSMN; 1.11 kg CH4 ha  1 yr  1, with the total source of 0.14 & PLUSMN; 0.14 Tg CH4 yr  1. Nearly 3 % of the total area of global forest soils was a net CH4 source. In summary, we identified the key drivers of forest soil CH4 flux and improved previous estimates of the global CH4 budget in forest soils. These findings can support decision-making related to forest management and greenhouse gas restrictions.

TI  - Carbon sequestration in rubber tree plantations established on former arable lands in Xishuangbanna, SW china
T2  - Zhiwu Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability for vegetation and soil organic matter (SOM) to sequester atmospheric CO2 has received a lot of attention recently. Two management options being considered for enhancing C sequestration from the atmosphere include tropical forest conservation and establishment of plantations; however, there is still considerable debate regarding the appropriateness of using plantations and the sequestration potential of tropical plantations. There are 1. 3 x 10(5) hm(2) of rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations in Xishuangbanna, southwest China, which account for approximately 14% of the forest lands in this region. In this study, eleven plantations of different ages were selected to investigate C sequestration in the vegetation and soils following the establishment of rubber tree plantations on former arable lands. The results indicated that the average biomass growth rates of the rubber trees, calculated according to two different biomass growth equations, were 10.2 x 10(3) and 9.4 x 10(3) kg t . hm(-2) . a(-1). Soil C stocks in the top 40 cm and I in of soil increased at rates of 0.61 x 10(3) and 0.72 x 10(3) kg t C . hm(-2) . a(-1), respectively. In total, C sequestration was approximately 5.82 x 10(3) to 5.42 x 10(3) kg t C . hm(-2) . a(-1) in the vegetation and soil as calculated by the two biomass growth models. When comparing the two models, our results showed that the biomass calculated based on the equation of Tang et al. was higher than that based on the equation of Brown, especially in young- and middle-aged rubber tree plantations.

TI  - Variation of soil fertility and carbon sequestration by planting Hevea brasiliensis in Hainan Island, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of rubber industry depends on the sustainable management of rubber plantation. To evaluate the environmental effects of planting Hevea brasiliensis on a subsystem of tropical forest ecosystem, the variation of soil. fertility and carbon sequestration under rubber plantation within 30-year life period were investigated in Hainan Island. Results showed that (1) with the increase of stand age of rubber plantation, soil fertility decreased all along. From 1954 to 1995, soil organic matter, total N, available K and available P decreased by 48.2%, 54.1%, 56.7% and 64.1%, respectively. (2) If the complete return of litters was considered without additional fertilizer application to the soil of the rubber plantations, the consumption periods for P, N, K, Mg were only 825 years, 329 years, 94 years and 65 years, respectively. To improve soil fertility is essential for rubber plantation development. (3) The C sequestration of rubber trees per hectare accounts for 272.08 t within 30-year life period and 57.91% of them was fixed in litters. In comparison with C sequestration by rain forest (234.305 t/hm(2)) and by secondary rain forest (150.203 t/hm(2)), rubber forest has more potentials for C fixation. On the base of above results, the following measures would benefit the maintenance of soil fertility and the development of rubber industry, including applying fertilizer to maintain the balance of soil nutrients, intercropping leguminous plant to improve soil fertility, reducing the collection of litters, optimizing soil properties to improve element P availability such as applying CaCO3. The information gathered from the study can be used as baseline data for the sustainable management of rubber plantation elsewhere.

TI  - Policy forum: Shifting cultivation and agroforestry in the Amazon: Premises for REDD
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Evidence shows that there is a close link between the intensification of shifting cultivation (SC) and the Amazon forest resilience. However, SC, to this day, is a widely implemented agricultural practice around the Amazon region due to its cultural, social, and economic relevance. In pristine indigenous communities, which have not experienced Western influence, SC will continue to be the main livelihood as part of the conservation of a patrimony of the humanity. Nevertheless, the main adverse effects of SC on ecosystems (i.e. forest degradation), particularly on Amazon forests, are our grounds to justify the implementation of public policies aiming to the substitution by agroforestry systems (AFS) as a sustainable food system. In this context, we propose linking AFS to Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD + strategies) in shifting cultivation landscapes where there is high local-scale expansion and intensification of SC. AFS has higher potential as sustainable food systems for degraded forest rehabilitation and reduction of the expansion and intensification of SC. Consequently, AFS reduce deforestation of new forest areas for SC, meanwhile, sustainable management of second-growth forests could also be implemented through improved fallows, increasing the planting density of long-cycle agroforestry tree species. AFS should be implemented in local communities, in particular, those undergoing human-modified Amazon landscapes, where there is a high intensification of SC.

TI  - How much carbon is sequestered during the restoration of tropical forests? Estimates from tree species in the Brazilian Atlantic forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of carbon accumulation in restoration areas over time is an important step for the evaluation of the success of restoration programs and to indicate the best practices for forest management and conservation. In the present study, we evaluated the aboveground biomass (AGB) of 10 tree species (fast-growing and slow-growing tree species) that are representative of the Brazilian Atlantic forest to test if biomass accumulation varies with tree age and ecological group (fast- and slow-growing). We also used regression models to simulate how much carbon is sequestered over time in restoration areas of tropical wet forests. The results exhibited differences between the two groups in terms of biomass accumulation; the slow-growing species accumulated an almost two-fold higher amount of total biomass (379.4 kg) than the fast-growing species (208.56 kg). The estimated age of the individuals explained the biomass accumulation: the long-lived and slow-growing species accumulate less biomass over a longer time, and the short-lived fast-growing species accumulate more biomass over a shorter period. These differences suggest that the fast-growing tree species contribute more to the carbon stock during the early years (approximately 37 years) of the restoration and that the slow-growing species contribute more significantly during the later stages of succession. We estimated that second-growth forests (4160 years old) accumulate more than two-fold carbon than immature forest (21-40 years old) and much more than ten-fold carbon than young forests (7-20 years old). These differences in carbon sequestration magnitudes suggest that services provided by restoration areas, can increase exponentially in the first 60 years, and this is particularly important for future conservation and management of areas undergoing restoration.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration by Tropical Trees and Crops: A Case Study of Oil Palm
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Carbon sequestration by photosynthetic organisms is the principal mechanism for the absorption of atmospheric CO2. Since the 1950s, however, the global carbon cycle has been distorted as increased anthropogenic CO2 emissions have greatly outstripped rates of carbon sequestration, with a 50% increase in atmospheric CO2 levels in less than a century, leading to perturbation of global climate systems and threatening food production and social stability. In order to address the current imbalance in CO2 flux, it is important to both reduce net emissions and promote sequestration. To address the latter issue, we need to better understand the roles of systems, such as natural forests, coastal wetlands, and tropical croplands, in carbon sequestration and devise strategies to facilitate net CO2 uptake. Carbon sequestration by tropical trees and crops already removes in excess of 1000 million tonnes of atmospheric CO2 annually but is threatened by anthropogenic activities such as deforestation and the drainage of carbon-rich peatland. Improvements in carbon sequestration can be achieved by policies such as growing tropical crops as part of agroforestry systems, enforcing limitations on deforestation and the use of peatland, and auditing the carbon impact of major cropping systems in order to focus on those crops that deliver both high yields and carbon efficiency. As an initial step in this process, a detailed case study is presented on the tropical tree crop, the African oil palm, Elaeis guineensis. This analysis includes a comparison of the carbon sequestration potential of oil palm with that of tropical forests and other oil crops, the biomass sequestration potential of oil palm and current and future strategies aimed at achieving net-zero carbon targets for oil palm and related crops.

TI  - Successional trajectories of secondary forests and tree plantations in Costa Rican lowlands
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree plantations used for carbon sequestration or forest restoration often support diverse plant communities. However, it is unknown how rates of successional change in tree plantations compare to secondary forests. In this study, we compared the successional trajectory of tree plantations to that of secondary forests that were between 8 and 23 years old. Censuses of woody plants (>= 2 cm dbh [diameter at breast height]) in seven tree plantation plots and seven secondary forest plots (30 x 30 m) were conducted over three years (May 2013-July 2016) in a lowland tropical forest. Secondary forests were naturally regenerating from abandoned cattle pastures. Tree plantations were monocultures of two different native species (Vochysia guatemalensis and Hieronyma alchorneoides), planted for carbon sequestration. We measured the change in stem density, basal area, species density, rarefied species richness, and relative abundance of different growth forms and regeneration guilds. We found that differences in stem density and basal area between these two forest types were declining. Nevertheless, we did not find evidence for differences between forest types in the rate of accumulation of species richness when accounting for sample size. On the other hand, even though the successional trajectory in tree plantations was very similar to secondary forests, there were differences between forest types in species composition. The rate of change in relative abundance of different growth forms and regeneration guilds was similar in both forest types. Overall, our results suggest that structural - but not compositional differences - between tree plantations and secondary forests are converging during the second decade of succession.

TI  - A comparative assessment of the financial costs and carbon benefits of REDD plus strategies in Southeast Asia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - REDD+ holds potential for mitigating emissions from tropical forest loss by providing financial incentives for carbon stored in forests, but its economic viability is under scrutiny. The primary narrative raised in the literature is thatREDD+ will be of limited utility for reducing forest carbon loss in Southeast Asia, while the level of finance committed falls short of profits from alternative land-use activities in the region, including large-scale timber and oil palm operations. Here we assess the financial costs and carbon benefits of various REDD+ strategies deployed in the region. We find the cost of reducing emissions ranges from $9 to $75 per tonne of avoided carbon emissions. The strategies focused on reducing forest degradation and promoting forest regrowth are the most cost-effective ways of reducing emissions and used in over 60% ofREDD+ projects. By comparing the financial costs and carbon benefits of a broader range of strategies than previously assessed, we highlight the variation between different strategies and draw attention to opportunities where REDD+ can achieve maximum carbon benefits cost-effectively. These findings have broad policy implications for Southeast Asia. Until carbon finance escalates, emissions reductions can be maximized from reforestation, reduced-impact logging and investing in improved management of protected areas. Targeting cost-efficient opportunities for REDD+ is important to improve the efficiency of national REDD+ policy, which in-turn fosters greater financial and political support for the scheme.

AB  - Climate change is a reality and will affect the poor in developing countries in many ways. The effectiveness of global change research could be substantially improved by linking International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) study with Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) centres based in the tropics. These centres are carrying interdisciplinary research and development on how to achieve food security and reduce rural poverty through the innovative management of natural resources. A CGIAR intercentre working group on climate change (ICWG-CC) identified joint opportunities that take advantage of the comparative advantages of both institutions. CGIAR centres will focus on adaptation and mitigation research in developing countries. A natural resource management research approach is suggested, which consists of six steps: (1) identifying and quantifying the extent of food insecurity, rural poverty and resource degradation; (2) conducting technological and policy research on economic and environmental functions; (3) optimising the trade-offs between global environmental benefits and private farmer benefits; (4) extrapolating and disseminating results, including research on policy implementation; (5) assessing impact and (6) providing feedback.Two examples of current CGIAR research illustrate this approach. Agroforestry alternatives to slash and burn (ASB) agriculture at tropical forest margins were identified and the trade-offs between carbon sequestration and farmer profitability provided options to policy makers. Land tenure problems were resolved with participatory policy research. Agroforestry practices sequester an additional 57 Mg C per ha, three times that of croplands or grasslands are able to do. Soil nutrient capital is being replenished in subhumid tropical Africa through improved leguminous tree fallows, rock phosphate and biomass transfers of Tithonia diversifolia, helping farmers to attain food security. Afterwards, when farmers shift to high-value tree or vegetable crop production, poverty is reduced. The transformation of low productivity croplands to sequential agroforestry is estimated to triple system carbon stocks in 20 years. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Global cost estimates of reducing carbon emissions through avoided deforestation
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical deforestation is estimated to cause about one-quarter of anthropogenic carbon emissions, loss of biodiversity, and other environmental services. United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change talks are now considering mechanisms for avoiding deforestation (AD), but the economic potential of AD has yet to be addressed. We use three economic models of global land use and management to analyze the potential contribution of AD activities to reduced greenhouse gas emissions. AD activities are found to be a competitive, low-cost abatement option. A program providing a 10% reduction in deforestation from 2005 to 2030 could provide 0.3-0.6 Gt (1 Gt = 1 x 10(5) g) CO(2)(.)yr(-1) in emission reductions and would require $0.4 billion to $1.7 billion(.)yr(-1) for 30 years. A 50% reduction in deforestation from 2005 to 2030 could provide 1.5-2.7 Gt CO(2)(.)yr(-1) in emission reductions and would require $17.2 billion to $28.0 billion(.)yr(-1). Finally, some caveats to the analysis that could increase costs of AD programs are described.

TI  - Determinants of aboveground carbon offset additionality in plantation forests in a moist tropical forest in western Kenya
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Few studies have attempted to identify factors that contribute to aboveground carbon offset additionality in forest restoration planting in the tropics. Moreover, those that have compared aboveground carbon offset potential of naturally regenerating secondary forests and plantation forests have yielded conflicting results regarding the ability of the latter to attain carbon offset additionality, thus limiting broad adoption of carbon-driven forest restoration interventions. We assessed woody species diversity, stem density, stem diameter and wood specific gravity of secondary and plantation forests in Kakamega Forest in western Kenya to identify determinants of aboveground carbon offset additionality in plantation forests. Secondary forests comprised old-growth, middle-aged and young vegetation stands. Plantation forests consisted of mixed indigenous, Maesopsis eminii indigenous monoculture and Cupressus lusitanica, Pinus patula and Bischofia javanica exotic monoculture stands. Assessment was carried in 135 sample plots in three forest blocks using stratified systematic sampling in nested plots. Analysis of variance indicated that there was no significant difference in woody species diversity between secondary and plantation forests due to natural forest succession in both forest types. Mixed indigenous plantation had more aboveground carbon stock than secondary forest stands of comparable stand age due to its greater proportion of tree species with high wood specific gravity and large tree diameter. Old-growth secondary forest had more aboveground carbon stock than monoculture forest plantations due to its relatively higher wood specific gravity. Middle-aged secondary forest had relatively lower aboveground carbon stock than plantation forests of comparable stand age because of its smaller tree diameter. The results suggest that stem diameter and wood specific gravity are the most important determinants of aboveground carbon offset additionality. Thus, forest managers and investors in carbon offset projects can achieve aboveground carbon offset additionality in forest restoration interventions by planting tree species with relatively higher wood specific gravity and manipulating them to attain large stem diameter through silvicultural management.

TI  - Biomass Equations and Carbon Stock Estimates for the Southeastern Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests play an important role in mitigating global climate change, emphasizing the need for reliable estimates of forest carbon stocks at regional and global scales. This is essential for effective carbon management, which involves strategies like emission reduction and enhanced carbon sequestration through forest restoration and conservation. However, reliable sample-based estimations of forest carbon stocks require accurate allometric equations, which are lacking for the rainforests of the Atlantic Forest Domain (AFD). In this study, we fitted biomass equations for the three main AFD forest types and accurately estimated the amount of carbon stored in their above-ground biomass (AGB) in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. Using non-destructive methods, we measured the total wood volume and wood density of 172 trees from the most abundant species in the main remnants of rainforest, semideciduous forest, and restinga forest in the state. The biomass and carbon stocks were estimated with tree-level data from 185 plots obtained in the National Forest Inventory conducted in Rio de Janeiro. Our locally developed allometric equations estimated the state's biomass stocks at 70.8 +/- 5.4 Mg ha-1 and carbon stocks at 35.4 +/- 2.7 Mg ha-1. Notably, our estimates were more accurate than those obtained using a widely applied pantropical allometric equation from the literature, which tended to overestimate biomass and carbon stocks. These findings can be used for establishing a baseline for monitoring carbon stocks in the Atlantic Forest, especially in the context of the growing voluntary carbon market, which demands more consistent and accurate carbon stock estimations.

TI  - Biomass accumulation after 10-200 years of shifting cultivation in bornean rain forest
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - I examined the effect of repeated long-fallow shifting cultivation on biomass accumulation in a rain-forest landscape occupied for over 200 years in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, The diameters of stems >5 cm dbh were measured in nine secondary forests using a stratified random design of nested plots (3000 m(2) per site). The stands were 9-12 years old and had experienced from I to 10 or more cycles of shifting cultivation. Accounting for differences in soil fertility, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) demonstrated that aboveground live biomass increment (ABI, in megagrams per hectare per year) was significantly greater after four cycles than after six or more cycles. ABI was lowest after two cycles, highest after one or four cycles and intermediate after 6-10 cycles. Differences were driven by the density and biomass of trees >10 cm dbh, which followed a similar pattern. Although the diameter increment and contribution to total biomass of trees >10 cm dbh increased significantly with inherent soil fertility, variation in the rate of biomass accumulation depended primarily on the number of prior cultivation cycles. An ANCOVA with soil fertility as the main effect was not significant. One hypothesis to explain observed patterns of ABI associated with changes in tree density is a shift, over many cycles, in the dominance of seed-banking vs. resprouting species. Previous work has shown that total phosphorus did not decline after six or more cycles; however, a shift from available to occluded forms may be related to lower ABI in sites with the longest cultivation history. An 11% decline in ABI could substantially alter the carbon-sequestration value of secondary tropical forests as they enter their second century of persistent human disturbance.

TI  - Markedly divergent estimates of Amazon forest carbon density from ground plots and satellites
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim The accurate mapping of forest carbon stocks is essential for understanding the global carbon cycle, for assessing emissions from deforestation, and for rational land-use planning. Remote sensing (RS) is currently the key tool for this purpose, but RS does not estimate vegetation biomass directly, and thus may miss significant spatial variations in forest structure. We test the stated accuracy of pantropical carbon maps using a large independent field dataset.Location Tropical forests of the Amazon basin. The permanent archive of the field plot data can be accessed at: http://dx.doi.org/10.5521/FORESTPLOTS.NET/2014_1Methods Two recent pantropical RS maps of vegetation carbon are compared to a unique ground-plot dataset, involving tree measurements in 413 large inventory plots located in nine countries. The RS maps were compared directly to field plots, and kriging of the field data was used to allow area-based comparisons.Results The two RS carbon maps fail to capture the main gradient in Amazon forest carbon detected using 413 ground plots, from the densely wooded tall forests of the north-east, to the light-wooded, shorter forests of the south-west. The differences between plots and RS maps far exceed the uncertainties given in these studies, with whole regions over-or under-estimated by > 25%, whereas regional uncertainties for the maps were reported to be < 5%.Main conclusions Pantropical biomass maps are widely used by governments and by projects aiming to reduce deforestation using carbon offsets, but may have significant regional biases. Carbon-mapping techniques must be revised to account for the known ecological variation in tree wood density and allometry to create maps suitable for carbon accounting. The use of single relationships between tree canopy height and above-ground biomass inevitably yields large, spatially correlated errors. This presents a significant challenge to both the forest conservation and remote sensing communities, because neither wood density nor species assemblages can be reliably mapped from space.

TI  - Change in Land Use Affects Soil Organic Carbon Dynamics and Distribution in Tropical Systems
T2  - SOIL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic land cover change is directly responsible for the deforestation and degradation of tropical forests. In this context, assessing soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks is key to understanding the impact of anthropogenic activities on SOC so that we can implement management practices that effectively reduce emissions or promote carbon sequestration. Our objective was to assess the effect of land-use change on the dynamics and distribution of SOC in three systems (agriculture, pasture and agroforestry) after 40 years of deforestation in a tropical dry forest in the central-eastern region of Honduras. For this purpose, the bulk density, percentage of coarse fragments (>2 mm) and soil organic carbon content were determined at three depths (0.00-0.10 m, 0.10-0.20 m and 0.20-0.30 m). The results showed an increase in bulk density for all new uses, although soil compaction had not yet occurred. In terms of total soil organic carbon (TOC) stocks, deforestation caused a decrease from 17% to 48% in agricultural and agroforestry soils, respectively; on the other hand, grasslands did not show significant differences compared to tropical dry forest, suggesting that they have a high potential as carbon sinks in deforested tropical areas. However, this did not imply a better state of the system, as the greatest increases in bulk density were found in pastures.

TI  - Evaluating the opportunities and limitations to multiple use of Brazil nuts and timber in Western Amazonia
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple-use forest management, which includes timber, non-timber forest products, and environmental services, is considered a promising tropical conservation and development strategy. In the tri-national frontier region of Madre de Dios (Peru), Acre (Brazil), and Pando (Bolivia) in Western Amazonia, we evaluated perceptions of representatives from four stakeholder groups - communities, industries (Brazil nut and timber), non-governmental organizations, and government agencies - on integrated management of timber and Brazil nuts (from the tree species Bertholletia excelsa) at multiple scales. A strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis in combination with an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to accomplish this task. Overall, results showed distinct differences in perceptions among stakeholder groups both within and among countries in pursuing multiple-use forestry strategies. Although many stakeholder groups held positive perceptions about multiple use of Brazil nuts and timber, several limitations were associated with implementation of this model. For instance, policy barriers and high management costs were considered the main weaknesses throughout the region. In Madre de Dios and Pando, logging damage to Brazil nut stands was the dominant threat, whereas in Acre, the main threat was reinvestment of forestry income into cattle. Our work shows that despite the high potential for and positive views of many stakeholders in pursuing integrated management of Brazil nut and timber, specific policy, economic, and technical limitations must first be addressed. To this end, we provide recommendations for promoting this multi-use forestry model in the future. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Implementation and opportunity costs of reducing deforestation and forest degradation in Tanzania
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cancun Agreements provide strong backing for a REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) mechanism whereby developed countries pay developing ones for forest conservation(1). REDD+ has potential to simultaneously deliver cost-effective climate change mitigation and human development(2-5). However, most REDD+ analysis has used coarse-scale data, overlooked important opportunity costs to tropical forest users(4,5) and failed to consider how to best invest funds to limit leakage, that is, merely displacing deforestation(6). Here we examine these issues for Tanzania, a REDD+ country, by comparing district-scale carbon losses from deforestation with the opportunity costs of carbon conservation. Opportunity costs are estimated as rents from both agriculture and charcoal production (the most important proximate causes of regional forest conversion(7-9).). As an alternative we also calculate the implementation costs of alleviating the demand for forest conservation thereby addressing the problem of leakage by raising agricultural yields on existing cropland and increasing charcoal fuel-use efficiency. The implementation costs exceed the opportunity costs of carbon conservation (medians of US$6.50 versus US$3.90 per Mg CO2), so effective REDD+ policies may cost more than simpler estimates suggest. However, even if agricultural yields are doubled, implementation is possible at the competitive price of similar to US$12 per Mg CO2.

TI  - Long-term patterns in tropical reforestation: Plant community composition and aboveground biomass accumulation
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Primary tropical forests are renowned for their high biodiversity and carbon storage, and considerable research has documented both species and carbon losses with deforestation and agricultural land uses. Economic drivers are now leading to the abandonment of agricultural lands, and the area in secondary forests is increasing. We know little about how long it takes for these ecosystems to achieve the structural and compositional characteristics of primary forests. In this study, we examine changes in plant species composition and aboveground biomass during eight decades of tropical secondary succession in Puerto Rico, and compare these patterns with primary forests. Using a well-replicated chronosequence approach, we sampled primary forests and secondary forests established 10, 20, 30, 60, and 80 years ago on abandoned pastures. Tree species composition in all secondary forests was different from that of primary forests and could be divided into early (10-, 20-, and 30-year) vs. late (60- and 80-year) successional phases. The highest rates of aboveground biomass accumulation occurred in the first 20 years, with rates of C sequestration peaking at 6.7 +/- 0.5 Mg C (.) ha(-1) (.) yr(-1). Reforestation of pastures resulted in an accumulation of 125 Mg C/ha in aboveground standing live biomass over 80 years. The 80 year-old secondary forests had greater biomass than the primary forests, due to the replacement of woody species by palms in the primary forests. Our results show that these new ecosystems have different species composition, but similar species richness, and significant potential for carbon sequestration, compared to remnant primary forests.

TI  - Integrating remotely sensed fires for predicting deforestation for REDD
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is an important tool in tropical forest management, as it alters forest composition, structure, and the carbon budget. The United Nations program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) aims to sustainably manage forests, as well as to conserve and enhance their carbon stocks. Despite the crucial role of fire management, decision-making on REDD+ interventions fails to systematically include fires. Here, we address this critical knowledge gap in two ways. First, we review REDD+ projects and programs to assess the inclusion of fires in monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems. Second, we model the relationship between fire and forest for a pilot site in Colombia using near-real-time (NRT) fire monitoring data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The literature review revealed fire remains to be incorporated as a key component of MRV systems. Spatially explicit modeling of land use change showed the probability of deforestation declined sharply with increasing distance to the nearest fire the preceding year (multi-year model area under the curve [AUC] 0.82). Deforestation predictions based on the model performed better than the official REDD earlY-warning system. The model AUC for 2013 and 2014 was 0.81, compared to 0.52 for the early-warning system in 2013 and 0.68 in 2014. This demonstrates NRT fire monitoring is a powerful tool to predict sites of forest deforestation. Applying new, publicly available, and open-access NRT fire data should be an essential element of early-warning systems to detect and prevent deforestation. Our results provide tools for improving both the current MRV systems, and the deforestation early-warning system in Colombia.

TI  - Carbon storage in a silvopastoral system compared to that in a deciduous dry forest in Michoacan, Mexico
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Livestock production in the tropics contributes significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions, so better understanding the role of silvopastoral systems (SPS) in mitigating such emissions is necessary. The aim of this study was to evaluate the amounts of carbon stored in the biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC) components of a Leucaena leucocephala cum Panicum maximum silvopasture system (SPS) compared to a deciduous tropical forest (DTF), and a grass monoculture (GM) in Michoacan, Mexico. The above- and below-ground biomass were measured by destructive sampling in the SPS and GM, while previously reported allometric equations were used to quantify biomass stocks in the DTF. The SOC concentration up to 30cm was determined by dry combustion method. The SPS and DTF contained more aboveground biomass (41.8 +/- 3.30 and 36.7 +/- 5.72MgDMha(-1)) compared to GM (8.0 +/- 0.76MgDMha(-1)). However, the SPS exhibited greater belowground biomass (16.4 +/- 1.95MgDMha(-1)) than the other systems. The DTF had the highest SOC fraction in all depth classes with values ranging from 3.1 +/- 0.07% to 3.7 +/- 0.06%, respectively, compared to the other systems. The total carbon stocks in SPS was similar to DTF (120.7 +/- 10.97 vs. 120.9 +/- 6.38MgCha(-1)) but was significantly higher than GM (78.2 +/- 8.41MgCha(-1)). In dry tropical conditions, SPS displays enormous potential for increasing biomass and soil carbon stocks compared to the GM and can thus be used as a greenhouse gas mitigation strategy in livestock production systems.

TI  - Changes in soil properties and carbon fluxes following afforestation and agriculture in tropical forest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic land use change (LUC) affects soil quality and the global carbon (C) pool. Such LUC is a potential threat for forest ecosystems because it can alter soil biome and increases the emission of greenhouse gasses (GHGs). Here, we investigated the changes in soil quality and CO2 emission following afforestation of reclaimed coal mine land and agriculture land created in a tropical dry deciduous forest of Jharkhand, India. Soil samples were collected from afforested mined soil (AMS), agriculture soils (AGS), and the natural forest soils (NFS) and analyzed for physicochemical and biological properties. Soil infiltration rate and CO2 efflux were recorded in situ, and C balance and emission coefficient (Ci) were calculated to determine soil C dynamics.Our results demonstrated significant alteration in soil quality parameters (decreases/increases based on the individual parameter) in converted land use. Compared to NFS, soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks decreased by 84% in AMS and 50% in AGS, soil CO2 efflux increased by 35% in AGS and decreased by 43% in AMS, attributed to differences in vegetation and microbial activities among sites. Principal component analysis showed soil infiltration rate, total nitrogen, and clay content were highly influenced by the LUC and explicitly indicate soil quality. The 4-year old AMS was C negative and had a greater Ci value than AGS and NFS, probably due to the lesser vegetation cover and adverse soil properties. We concluded that the conversion of tropical forests to different lands altered soil quality that can be assessed using indicator parameters like soil infiltration rate, total nitrogen, and clay content. Such LUC tends to switch the forest from a sink to a source of CO2 whether the end use is afforestation or agriculture. However, land degradation due to surface mining activities had a greater impact on soil quality and C sequestration potential than agriculture.

TI  - Carbon stocks and greenhouse gas emissions (CH4 and N2O) in mangroves with different vegetation assemblies in the central coastal of Veracruz Mexico
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to quantify carbon stocks and the emission of the greenhouse gases (N2O and CH4) in mangrove forests with different vegetation assemblies in coastal lagoons of Veracruz Mexico. The vegetation included: black mangrove BM, dominated by Avicennia germinans, white mangrove WM, dominated by Laguncularia. racemose, red mangrove RM, dominated by Rhizophora mangle and mixed mangrove MM, dominated by the three species. Soil C stocks ranged 187-671 Mg C ha(-1) without significant (p = 0.149) differences among the mangroves with different vegetation. Significantly (p = 0.049) higher tree biomass C stock was observed in RM (127 Mg ha(-1)) than in MM (24.23 Mg ha(-1)). Methane emissions in RM (0.58-6.03 mg m-2 min-1) were significantly higher (p b 0.05) than in MM. (0.0035-0.07 mg m(-2) min(-1)), in WM (-0.0026-0.029 mg m(-2) min(-1)) and in BM (0.0054-0.0097 mg m(-2) min(-1)),during rainy, windy and dry season.RM had the longest period of inundation, the highest soil carbon concentration, and the lowest salinity. CH4 emissions showed a significantly positive correlation with soils carbon concentration, water level and water pH and, negative correlation with water salinity and Cl-1 concentration in soil and water. Emissions of N2O (0.04-3.25 mu g m(-2) min(-1)) were not significantly different among the mangroves with different vegetation, but they showed seasonal variations, with higher emissions during windy and dry seasons. N2O emissions showed significantly positive correlations with soil nitrate concentration and soil temperature. Results of this research are useful for mangrove conservation and restoration strategies to maximize carbon storage and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Secondary forests offset less than 10% of deforestation-mediated carbon emissions in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary forests are increasing in the Brazilian Amazon and have been cited as an important mechanism for reducing net carbon emissions. However, our understanding of the contribution of secondary forests to the Amazonian carbon balance is incomplete, and it is unclear to what extent emissions from old-growth deforestation have been offset by secondary forest growth. Using MapBiomas 3.1 and recently refined IPCC carbon sequestration estimates, we mapped the age and extent of secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon and estimated their role in offsetting old-growth deforestation emissions since 1985. We also assessed whether secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon are growing in conditions favourable for carbon accumulation in relation to a suite of climatic, landscape and local factors. In 2017, the 129,361 km(2)of secondary forest in the Brazilian Amazon stored 0.33 +/- 0.05 billion Mg of above-ground carbon but had offset just 9.37% of old-growth emissions since 1985. However, we find that the majority of Brazilian secondary forests are situated in contexts that are less favourable for carbon accumulation than the biome average. Our results demonstrate that old-growth forest loss remains the most important factor determining the carbon balance in the Brazilian Amazon. Understanding the implications of these findings will be essential for improving estimates of secondary forest carbon sequestration potential. More accurate quantification of secondary forest carbon stocks will support the production of appropriate management proposals that can efficiently harness the potential of secondary forests as a low-cost, nature-based tool for mitigating climate change.

TI  - Reference scenarios for deforestation and forest degradation in support of REDD: a review of data and methods
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate policy initiatives are now being proposed to compensate tropical forest nations for reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation ( REDD). These proposals have the potential to include developing countries more actively in international greenhouse gas mitigation and to address a substantial share of the world's emissions which come from tropical deforestation. For such a policy to be viable it must have a credible benchmark against which emissions reduction can be calculated. This benchmark, sometimes termed a baseline or reference emissions scenario, can be based directly on historical emissions or can use historical emissions as input for business as usual projections. Here, we review existing data and methods that could be used to measure historical deforestation and forest degradation reference scenarios including FAO ( Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations) national statistics and various remote sensing sources. The freely available and corrected global Landsat imagery for 1990, 2000 and soon to come for 2005 may be the best primary data source for most developing countries with other coarser resolution high frequency or radar data as a valuable complement for addressing problems with cloud cover and for distinguishing larger scale degradation. While sampling of imagery has been effectively useful for pan-tropical and continental estimates of deforestation, wall-to-wall ( or full coverage) allows more detailed assessments for measuring national-level reference emissions. It is possible to measure historical deforestation with sufficient certainty for determining reference emissions, but there must be continued calls at the international level for making high-resolution imagery available, and for financial and technical assistance to help countries determine credible reference scenarios. The data available for past years may not be sufficient for assessing all forms of forest degradation, but new data sources will have greater potential in 2007 and after. This paper focuses only on the methods for measuring changes in forest area, but this information must be coupled with estimates of change in forest carbon stocks in order to quantify emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.

TI  - Patterns and drivers of atmospheric nitrogen deposition retention in global forests
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are the largest carbon sink in terrestrial ecosystems, and the impact of nitrogen (N) deposition on this carbon sink depends on the fate of external N inputs. However, the patterns and driving factors of N retention in different forest compartments remain elusive. In this study, we synthesized 408 observations from global forest N-15 tracer experiments to reveal the variation and underlying mechanisms of N-15 retention in plants and soils. The results showed that the average total ecosystem N-15 retention in global forests was 63.04 +/- 1.23%, with the soil pool being the main N sink (45.76 +/- 1.29%). Plants absorbed 17.28 +/- 0.83% of N-15, with more allocated to leaves (5.83 +/- 0.63%) and roots (5.84 +/- 0.44%). In subtropical and tropical forests, N-15 was mainly absorbed by plants and mineral soils, while the organic soil layer in temperate forests retained more N-15. Additionally, forests retained more (NH4+)-N-15 than (NO3-)-N-15 , primarily due to the stronger capacity of the organic soil layer to retain (NH4+)-N-15. The mechanisms of N-15 retention varied among ecosystem compartments, with total ecosystem N-15 retention affected by N deposition. Plant N-15 retention was influenced by vegetative and microbial nutrient demands, while soil N-15 retention was regulated by climate factors and soil nutrient supply. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of climate and nutrient supply and demand in regulating forest N retention and provides data to further explore the impacts of N deposition on forest carbon sequestration.

TI  - Climatic Benefits From the 2006-2017 Avoided Deforestation in Amazonian Brazil
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over three-fourths of Brazil's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions originate from land-use/cover change (LUCC). Alarming rates of forest loss in the Amazon region gained international attention in the past, but deforestation declined substantially since 2004 (although the rate has trended upwards since 2012). This result conforms to the GHG emission reduction targets set by the National Climate Change Plan, originally divided into three phases: 2006-2009; 2010-2013; and 2014-2017. According to the plan, emission reductions are measured against a deforestation baseline, initially corresponding to the average forest loss observed from 1996 to 2005 (reference period). We used an artificial neural network (ANN) model to spatialize the plan's original three-phase baseline and compare (i) the simulated carbon emissions from the baseline scenario to (ii) the emissions from observed deforestation during 2006-2017. Baseline spatialization was performed at the state level and informed by the 2000-2004 deforestation patterns in each state, resulting in nine state-specific calibrated ANNs. Simulated (baseline) and observed deforestation were compared to five biomass-density maps in order to estimate Brazil's GHG emission reductions. Our results indicate that forest loss during the study period was 62,321 km(2) lower than the baseline and associated with 1.5 +/- 0.4 Pg of avoided CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Virtually all emission reductions (93%) occurred in the states of Mato Grosso (74%) and Rondonia (19%). In contrast, Roraima, Amazonas, and Amapa states increased GHG emissions by 44.8, 36.7, and 14.7 Tg CO2, respectively. Lastly, we discuss the issue of attribution of deforestation reductions for results-based payments (REDD+) and the emission reduction certificates issued by the Amazon Fund.

TI  - The Importance of Defining 'Forest': Tropical Forest Degradation, Deforestation, Long-term Phase Shifts, and Further Transitions
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Review
AB  - While research continues on the causes, consequences, and rates of deforestation and forest degradation in the tropics, there is little agreement about what exactly is being lost, what we want back, and to whom the 'we' refers. Particularly unsettling is that many analyses and well-intended actions are implemented in fogs of ambiguity surrounding definitions of the term 'forest'-a problem that is not solely semantic; with development of markets for biomass carbon, vegetation classification exercises take on new relevance. For example, according to the basic implementation guidelines of the Kyoto Protocol, closed canopy natural forest could be replaced by monoclonal plantations of genetically engineered exotic tree species and no deforestation would have occurred. Following these same guidelines, carbon credits for afforestation could be available for planting trees in species-rich savannas; these new plantations would count towards a country moving towards the 'forest transition,' the point at which there is no net 'forest' loss. Such obvious conflicts between biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration might be avoided if 'forest' was clearly defined and if other vegetation types and other ecosystem values were explicitly recognized. While acknowledging that no one approach to vegetation classification is likely to satisfy all users at all scales, we present an approach that recognizes the importance of species composition, reflects the utility of land-cover characteristics that are identifiable via remote sensing, and acknowledges that many sorts of forest degradation do not reduce carbon stocks (e. g., defaunation) or canopy cover (e. g., over-harvesting of understory nontimber forest products).

TI  - Increased aridity and chronic anthropogenic disturbance reduce litter productivity in a Caatinga dry forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical dry forest productivity is thought to be driven by a combination of natural factors, particularly total water availability and seasonality. However, most of the world's dry forests have been converted into forest successional mosaics by a combination of slash-and-burn agriculture and exploitation of forest products, which has potential impacts for forest productivity. Here, we examined litter production, nutrient concentrations and fluxes across regenerating and old-growth stands of a Caatinga dry forest during a 48-mo period, assessing the impact of annual rainfall, forest aboveground biomass, soil fertility, forest successional status, stand age and chronic anthropogenic disturbance. We found our sites to have low litter productivity, producing 0.193 +/- 0.016 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) (mean +/- SE) of litter. Moreover, litter production was highly seasonal (> 90% during the dry season), and varied substantially across forest stands (from 0.0035 to 0.564 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)), but with no differences relative to forest successional status; i.e. similar litter production in regenerating and old-growth stands. Litter production was affected by precipitation, soil fertility and chronic anthropogenic disturbance. Litter nutrient concentration was highly variable across forest stands, but concentration responded very little to our focal drivers. Litter N-concentration was relatively high, while P was very low resulting in a small flux to the soil via litter decomposition. In contrast to litter nutrient concentrations, nutrient fluxes were more predictable, particularly considering forest successional status. Our results suggest that Caatinga dry forest on sandy soils is a low-productivity ecosystem, probably due to a combination of natural and anthropogenic drivers.

TI  - Soil nutrients affect spatial patterns of aboveground biomass and emergent tree density in southwestern Borneo
T2  - OECOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies on the relationship between soil fertility and aboveground biomass in lowland tropical forests have yielded conflicting results, reporting positive, negative and no effect of soil nutrients on aboveground biomass. Here, we quantify the impact of soil variation on the stand structure of mature Bornean forest throughout a lowland watershed (8-196 m a.s.l.) with uniform climate and heterogeneous soils. Categorical and bivariate methods were used to quantify the effects of (1) parent material differing in nutrient content (alluvium > sedimentary > granite) and (2) 27 soil parameters on tree density, size distribution, basal area and aboveground biomass. Trees >= 10 cm (diameter at breast height, dbh) were enumerated in 30 (0.16 ha) plots (sample area = 4.8 ha). Six soil samples (0-20 cm) per plot were analyzed for physiochemical properties. Aboveground biomass was estimated using allometric equations. Across all plots, stem density averaged 521 +/- 13 stems ha(-1), basal area 39.6 +/- 1.4 m(2) ha(-1) and aboveground biomass 518 +/- 28 Mg ha(-1) (mean +/- SE). Adjusted forest-wide aboveground biomass to account for apparent overestimation of large tree density (based on 69 0.3-ha transects; sample area = 20.7 ha) was 430 +/- 25 Mg ha(-1) stop. Stand structure did not vary significantly among substrates, but it did show a clear trend toward larger stature on nutrient-rich alluvium, with a higher density and larger maximum size of emergent trees. Across all plots, surface soil phosphorus (P), potassium, magnesium and percentage sand content were significantly related to stem density and/or aboveground biomass (R-Pearson = 0.368-0.416). In multiple linear regression, extractable P and percentage sand combined explained 31% of the aboveground biomass variance. Regression analyses on size classes showed that the abundance of emergent trees > 120 cm dbh was positively related to soil P and exchangeable bases, whereas trees 60-90 cm dbh were negatively related to these factors. Soil fertility thus had a significant effect on both total aboveground biomass and its distribution among size classes.

TI  - Leaf area index and root biomass variation at different secondary forest ages in the eastern Amazon
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - In the Amazon region, small farmers use secondary forests as the only source of nutrients for agriculture, performing slash and burn in a rotation system. Secondary forests cover a large area of these landscapes and are crucial to maintaining soil fertility. The main objectives of this study were to gain insight into the seasonal variations in leaf area index (LAI) and root biomass growth, and to improve the accuracy of carbon sequestration estimates in early successional tropical secondary forests following shifting cultivation. Secondary vegetation of three different ages (1 year, 6 years and 10 years after shifting cultivation) were monitored monthly with a LI-COR Plant Canopy Analyzer, and root growth was seasonally measured down to a depth of 400 cm using ingrowth bags. The youngest secondary forests showed strong LAI seasonality, and the seasonality in LAI decreased in the oldest forest. The roots grew throughout the year even though the growth rates were higher during the dry season, which supported a dense biomass of leaves over the year. This study clearly indicates that information on deep rooting and seasonality of leaf area in secondary tropical forests is essential for understanding ecosystem ecophysiology, as well as community ecology and biogeochemical cycles.

TI  - The influence of floral resources and microclimate on pollinator visitation in an agro-ecosystem
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As agriculture expands to meet the needs of a growing global population, natural ecosystems are threatened by deforestation and habitat fragmentation. Tropical agroforestry systems offer a sustainable alternative to traditional agriculture by providing food for production while also supporting biodiversity and ecosystem services. Previous studies have shown that these systems may even improve crop pollination, but the mechanisms of how these improvements occur are still poorly understood. Using coffee as a focal crop, we explored how microclimatic conditions affected nectar traits (sugar and caffeine concentration) important for pollinator visitation. We also studied how microclimate, floral traits, floral availability at the coffee plant level, availability of floral resources provided by other plant species in the agroecosystem ("neighborhood floral availability"), and the presence of other bees affected the amount of time bees spent foraging on coffee flowers and the proportion of coffee pollen carried on their bodies. We explored these factors using the two dominant coffee species farmed on Puerto Rico, Coffea canephora and C. arabica, under sun and shade management. We found that high nectar sugar concentration and temperature were important predictors of short floral visits (<15s), while increased numbers of bees and open coffee flowers were important predictors of longer floral visits (16-180 seconds). High nectar caffeine concentration was an important predictor of longer visits on C. arabica flowers while the opposite was observed for C. canephora flowers. For both species, high coffee floral availability was the main predicting factor for the proportion of coffee pollen on the bees' bodies. Surprisingly, neither neighborhood floral availability nor the type of coffee plantation (agroforest/shade or sun) were important predictors of bee visitation. These results suggest non-coffee flowering plants in coffee plantations were neither competitors nor facilitators of coffee plants for pollinators. Additionally, most of the bees surveyed were carrying >= 80 % pollen from one species (C. arabica or C. canephora), likely resulting in little heterospecific pollen deposition between Coffea and non-Coffea flowers. Shade trees in coffee plantations do not detract from pollinator visitation to coffee flowers, suggesting that the provision of multiple ecological and wildlife conservation benefits by shade trees is not in conflict with a grower's ability to maximize the benefits of insect pollination on fruit production.

TI  - Carbon stocks in coffee agroforests and mixed dry tropical forests in the western highlands of Guatemala
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree removal in Latin American coffee agroforestry systems has been widespread due to complex and interacting factors that include fluctuating international markets, government-supported agricultural policies, and climate change. Despite shade tree removal and land conversion risks, there is currently no widespread policy incentive encouraging the maintenance of shade trees for the benefit of carbon sequestration. In facilitation of such incentives, an understanding of the capacity of coffee agroforests to store carbon relative to tropical forests must be developed. Drawing on ecological inventories conducted in 2007 and 2010 in the Lake Atitlan region of Guatemala, this research examines the carbon pools of smallholder coffee agroforests (CAFs) as they compare to a mixed dry forest (MDF) system. Data from 61 plots, covering a total area of 2.24 ha, was used to assess the aboveground, coarse root, and soil carbon reservoirs of the two land-use systems. Results of this research demonstrate the total carbon stocks of CAFs to range from 74.0 to 259.0 Megagrams (Mg) C ha(-1) with a mean of 127.6 +/- A 6.6 (SE) Mg C ha(-)A(1). The average carbon stocks of CAFs was significantly lower than estimated for the MDF (198.7 +/- A 32.1 Mg C ha(-1)); however, individual tree and soil pools were not significantly different suggesting that agroforest shade trees play an important role in facilitating carbon sequestration and soil conservation. This research demonstrates the need for conservation-based initiatives which recognize the carbon sequestration benefits of coffee agroforests alongside natural forest systems.

TI  - Partitioning main carbon pools in a semi-deciduous rainforest in eastern Cameroon
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests contribute to climate change mitigation by absorbing carbon from the atmosphere and storing this in biomass and soil organic matter. However, there is still considerable uncertainty about the above- and belowground quantity and distribution of carbon stocks in African forests. Here, we evaluate how different carbon pools (aboveground live biomass, aboveground dead biomass, belowground biomass) contribute to total carbon stocks, and how different carbon components (e.g. large trees, understorey trees, coarse woody debris, roots, soil organic carbon etc.) contribute to carbon pools and total carbon stocks. We evaluated data of extensive inventories within 30 1-ha plots spanning the terra-finne semi-deciduous forest in eastern Cameroon. Hence, the plots were placed at a mean distance of 1 km from the nearest plot and we analyzed the data using variation partitioning, linear regressions and correlation tests. We found that the terra-firme semi-deciduous forests store 283.97 +/- 51.42 Mg C ha(-1). The aboveground biomass pool, with a carbon stock of 180.99 +/- 25.8 Mg C ha(-1), mostly explained variation in total carbon stocks (R-2 = 0.79). From all aboveground biomass components, carbon in large trees was most strongly correlated with total carbon stocks. The second most important carbon pool was belowground carbon (on average 85.06 +/- 16.86 Mg C ha(-1) ; R-2 = 0.78), mainly explained by coarse root carbon. Carbon in dead biomass had only a small contribution to total carbon stocks (R-2 = 0.04). Hence, our results indicate that aboveground live biomass is a good predictor for variation in total carbon storage within this semi-deciduous terra-firme forest. However, aboveground live carbon and belowground carbon and their interactions explained most of the variation in total carbon stock, indicating that a whole-ecosystem approach is necessary for a full understanding of the carbon cycle.

TI  - Measurement and monitoring needs, capabilities and potential for addressing reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation under REDD
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper presents an overview of the state of measurement and monitoring capabilities for forests in the context of REDD+ needs, with a focus on what is currently possible, where improvements are needed, and what capabilities will be advanced in the near-term with new technologies already under development. We summarize the role of remote sensing (both satellite and aircraft) for observational monitoring of forests, including measuring changes in their current and past extent for setting baselines, their carbon stock density for estimating emissions in areas that are deforested or degraded, and their regrowth dynamics following disturbance. We emphasize the synergistic role of integrating field inventory measurements with remote sensing for best practices in monitoring, reporting and verification. We also address the potential of remote sensing for enforcing safeguards on conservation of natural forests and biodiversity. We argue that capabilities exist now to meet operational needs for REDD+ measurement, reporting, and verification and reference levels. For some other areas of importance for REDD+, such as safeguards for natural forests and biodiversity, monitoring capabilities are approaching operational in the near term. For all REDD+ needs, measurement capabilities will rapidly advance in the next few years as a result of new technology as well as advances in capacity building both within and outside of the tropical forest nations on which REDD+ is primarily focused.

TI  - Cacao Cultivation under Diverse Shade Tree Cover Allows High Carbon Storage and Sequestration without Yield Losses
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main drivers of tropical forest loss is their conversion to oil palm, soy or cacao plantations with low biodiversity and greatly reduced carbon storage. Southeast Asian cacao plantations are often established under shade tree cover, but are later converted to non-shaded monocultures to avoid resource competition. We compared three co-occurring cacao cultivation systems (3 replicate stands each) with different shade intensity (non-shaded monoculture, cacao with the legume Gliricidia sepium shade trees, and cacao with several shade tree species) in Sulawesi (Indonesia) with respect to above-and belowground biomass and productivity, and cacao bean yield. Total biomass C stocks (aboveand belowground) increased fivefold from the monoculture to the multi-shade tree system (from 11 to 57 Mg ha(-1)), total net primary production rose twofold (from 9 to 18 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)). This increase was associated with a 6fold increase in aboveground biomass, but only a 3.5fold increase in root biomass, indicating a clear shift in C allocation to aboveground tree organs with increasing shade for both cacao and shade trees. Despite a canopy cover increase from 50 to 93%, cacao bean yield remained invariant across the systems (variation: 1.1-1.2 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)). The monocultures had a twice as rapid leaf turnover suggesting that shading reduces the exposure of cacao to atmospheric drought, probably resulting in greater leaf longevity. Thus, contrary to general belief, cacao bean yield does not necessarily decrease under shading which seems to reduce physical stress. If planned properly, cacao plantations under a shade tree cover allow combining high yield with benefits for carbon sequestration and storage, production system stability under stress, and higher levels of animal and plant diversity.

TI  - Silvicultural Management System Applied to Logged Forests in the Brazilian Amazon: A Case Study of Adaptation of Techniques to Increase the Yield and Diversity of Species Forestry
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The existence of degraded forests is common in the Eastern Amazon. The maintenance of these forests standing and the recovery of their productivity play an important role in the conservation of biodiversity, storage and carbon sequestration. However, the management techniques currently employed are designed for natural forests in the first harvest cycle or lightly explored and do not apply adequately to forests that have gone through several harvest cycles. Therefore, adaptations and the establishment of new management criteria that take into account other characteristics of these types of forests are necessary to ensure their sustainability. The objective of this study was to propose a silvicultural management system that has the potential to recover and perpetuate the productivity of an intensively logged tropical forest. A forest census was carried out on 535.6 ha for trees with dbh >= 25 cm. With these data, the following two treatments were designed: (1) criteria: the BDq method was applied from B = 9.8 m(2) ha(-1), D = 100 cm and q = 2. The criteria for standing wood commercialization were, in this order, first, Health; second, Tree Stem; third, Tree Density and fourth, dbh >= 105 cm. (2) Control: the planning was in accordance with Brazilian regulations. For the cost-benefit and sensitivity analysis, the Net Present Value (NPV) was used and a projection of +/- 20% was made in the commercial price of standing wood. In the criteria treatment, a higher number of trees and species destined for the commercialization of standing wood was verified in relation to the control treatment, showing a greater diversity of species. In the criteria treatment, NPV was positive and superior to the control treatment in all scenarios. The proposed silvicultural management system with an object of an explored and enriched forest, with criteria for harvesting trees with a minimum cut diameter of 25 cm, proved to be viable to generate economic returns and with conservationist potential for the continuous supply of forest products and maintaining biodiversity.

TI  - The potential of REDD plus for carbon sequestration in tropical forests: Supply curves for carbon storage for Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We study the potential of tropical multi-age multi-species forests for sequestering carbon in response to financial incentives from REDD+. Following existing carbon crediting schemes, the use of reduced impact logging techniques (RIL) allows a forest manager to apply for carbon credits whereas conventional logging (CL) does not. This paper is the first to develop a Hartman model with selective cutting in this setting that takes additionality of carbon sequestration explicitly into account. We apply the model using data for Kalimantan, Indonesia, for both private and government forest managers. The latter have a lower discount rate and are exempt from taxes. RIL leads to less damages on the residual stand than CL and has lower variable but higher fixed costs. We find that a system of carbon credits through REDD+ can increase carbon stored per hectare by 15.8% if the forest is privately managed and by 22% under government management if the carbon price equals the average 2015 price in the European Union's Emission Trading Scheme. Interestingly, awarding carbon credits to carbon stored in end-use wood products does not increase the amount of carbon stored, nor Land Expectation Value. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - High aboveground carbon stock of African tropical montane forests
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests store 40-50 per cent of terrestrial vegetation carbon(1). However, spatial variations in aboveground live tree biomass carbon (AGC) stocks remain poorly understood, in particular in tropical montane forests(2). Owing to climatic and soil changes with increasing elevation(3), AGC stocks are lower in tropical montane forests compared with lowland forests(2). Here we assemble and analyse a dataset of structurally intact old-growth forests (AfriMont) spanning 44 montane sites in 12 African countries. We find that montane sites in the AfriMont plot network have a mean AGC stock of 149.4 megagrams of carbon per hectare (95% confidence interval 137.1-164.2), which is comparable to lowland forests in the African Tropical Rainforest Observation Network(4) and about 70 per cent and 32 per cent higher than averages from plot networks in montane(2,5,6) and lowland(7) forests in the Neotropics, respectively. Notably, our results are two-thirds higher than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change default values for these forests in Africa(8). We find that the low stem density and high abundance of large trees of African lowland forests(4) is mirrored in the montane forests sampled. This carbon store is endangered: we estimate that 0.8 million hectares of old-growth African montane forest have been lost since 2000. We provide country-specific montane forest AGC stock estimates modelled from our plot network to help to guide forest conservation and reforestation interventions. Our findings highlight the need for conserving these biodiverse(9,10) and carbon-rich ecosystems.The aboveground carbon stock of a montane African forest network is comparable to that of a lowland African forest network and two-thirds higher than default values for these montane forests.

TI  - Data from: Spatial and temporal patterns of frugivorous Hornbill movements in Central Africa and their implications for rain forest conservation
T2  - Dryad
M3  - Data set
AB  - Tropical forest conservation and restoration require an understanding of the movements and habitat preferences of important seed dispersers. With forests now being altered at an unprecedented rate, avian frugivores are becoming increasingly vital for forest regeneration. Seed movement, however, is highly dependent on the behavioral characteristics of their dispersers. Here, we examined the movements, habitat preferences, and range sizes of two African frugivores: the Black-casqued (Ceratogymna atrata) and the White-thighed (Bycanistes albotibialis) Hornbill, in the lowland rain forests of southern Cameroon. Using satellite transmitters, we tracked eight hornbills for 3 yr to characterize their movements and relate them to environmental landscape features. Hornbill movements differed significantly, with B. albotibialis ranging over larger areas (mean = 20,274 ha) than C. atrata (mean = 5604 ha), and females of both species covering over 15 times the area of males. Evidence suggests that movements are irruptive during particular periods, perhaps driven by low resource availability. In addition, hornbills often returned to the same localities within a year, although movements were not characterized as migratory. Both species displayed significant differences in habitat preference, with B. albotibialis utilizing disturbed habitat more frequently than C. atrata (t = 22.04, P = 2.2 * 1016). Major roads were found to act as barriers for C. atrata, but not for B. albotibialis. The ability of both hornbill species to move large distances suggests hornbills will play a vital role in the maintenance and regeneration of rain forests in Central Africa as forest fragmentation increases and terrestrial vertebrates decline in numbers.

TI  - Tropical wetlands and land use changes: The case of oil palm in neotropical riverine floodplains
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil palm plantations are expanding in Latin America due to the global demand for food and biofuels, and much of this expansion has occurred at expense of important tropical ecosystems. Nevertheless, there is limited knowledge about effects on aquatic ecosystems near to oil palm-dominated landscapes. In this study, we used Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI imagery and high-resolution images in Google Earth to map the current extent of oil palm plantations and determined prior land use land cover (LULC) in the Usumacinta River Basin as a case-study site. In addition, we assess the proximity of the crop with aquatic ecosystems distributed in the Usumacinta floodplains and their potential effects. Based on our findings, the most significant change was characterized by the expansion of oil palm crop areas mainly at expenses of regional rainforest and previously intervened lands (e.g. secondary vegetation and agriculture). Although aquatic ecosystem class (e.g. rivers, lagoons and channels) decreased in surface around 3% during the study period (2001-2017), the change was not due to the expansion of oil palm lands. However, we find that more than 50% of oil palm cultivations are near (between 500 and 3000 m) to aquatic ecosystems and this could have significant environmental impacts on sediment and water quality. Oil palm crops tend to spatially concentrate in the Upper Usumacinta ecoregion (Guatemala), which is recognized as an area of important fish endemism. We argue that the basic information generated in this study is essential to have better land use decision-making in a region that is relative newcomer to oil palm boom.

TI  - The nature of a 'forest transition' in Thua Thien Hue Province, Central Vietnam - A study of land cover changes over five decades
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Informed from historical case studies of land cover change and development in northern countries, forest transition (FT) theories have a tendency to precast specific conclusions. Considering the case of a so-called FT in Th.a Thien Hue Province in tropical Central Vietnam, we investigated 1.) whether such a 'FT' indeed reflects a resurgence of genuine forest, 2.) whether the land cover changes can be explained through conventional 'pathways' of FT, and 3.) in which ways the changes may or may not portend 'sustainable development'. Using satellite imagery and topographic maps, we produced maps for twenty land cover types for the years 1966, 1973, 1979, 1988, 1998, 2008, 2016 and 2019 and analysed land cover change over time. We contextualize these results with reference to the historical and scientific literature on Vietnam, and find that 1.) the forestlands represent a historically rich bio-cultural landscape; 2.) considerable forest destruction resulted from the Second Indochina War rather than classical degradation pathways; 3.) in the post-war period altered forestland spaces and re-emerging land uses interacted with state-led re-territorialization and socialist plans for land resource development, influencing shifts in forest cover; 4.) during 1979-1988 state-led intensive timber logging in remaining rainforests (causing widespread forest degradation) somewhat paradoxically (in terms of conventional FT models and theories) coincided already with a slight increase in lower-biomass tree cover; 5.) after 1988 logging in natural forests was officially prohibited (logging bans), and forestry shifted to a reliance on wood produced in acacia-based plantations (largely on lands officially allocated to households); and 6.) this shift went along with a significant state-led restructuring and development of land use policies and the promotion of forest-relevant economic industries. 'Restoration' of tree cover mainly consisted of the expansion of exotic tree plantations, but - at least intermittently - this may also have mitigated impacts on natural forests. We conclude with some reflections on the FT-outcome, its 'sustainability', and future trajectories and possibilities of land cover changes in TTHP.

TI  - Calling for landscape-level assessments of participatory forestry?s role in improving forest biophysical conditions
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Participatory forest management (PFM) has been applied to address declining tropical forest conditions. In the literature, there is a mixed evidence on PFM's role in improving forest conditions. However, most assessments ignore a relationship between household distance from PFM forests and impacts to non-PFM forests albeit being an essential aspect. Some PFM assessments show that distance matters in determining an individual's participation But, sparsely discussing the distance in relation to forest biophysical conditions in a landscape context. Drawing on the landscape approach and insights from Miombo forests of Kilwa in southern Tanzania, we illustrate the importance of studying PFM schemes in a landscape context to illuminate the relationship between household distance from PFM forests and impacts to non-PFM forests. Our study villages have forest abundances in areas between households and PFM forests. The average distance between households and PFM forests is 7.8 km. The long distances and forest abundances produce an 'outbound effect', whereby degrading and deforesting activities shift from PFM to non-PFM forests. Our analysis calls for landscape-level assessments that include forests under different governance regimes even those in unreserved landscapes - non-PFM forests. This is important for two reasons. First, for generating locally grounded contextual insights necessary for developing understandings of global forest conservation efforts from the 'ground up'. Second, for revealing correct forest conditions in the entire landscape critical in the light of ongoing national and international interests to manage trees inside and outside designated forest reserves for both carbon sequestration and landscape restoration.

TI  - Response of the copro-necrophagous beetle (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) assemblage to a range of soil characteristics and livestock management in a tropical landscape
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding changes in copro-necrophagous beetle diversity related to characteristics of habitat and soil associated with livestock management systems can provide a tool for the conservation of edaphic fauna and improved use of natural resources. We evaluated changes in species diversity and assemblage structure in copro-necrophagous beetles under different livestock management systems in an anthropized tropical dry forest landscape in Mexico. We used a standard sampling protocol to capture copro-necrophagous beetles in three livestock management systems: silvopastoral systems with Guazuma ulmifolia Lam. (SPS) associated with grasses, treeless pastures (monocultures) and managed tree fallows of tropical dry forest with livestock. We characterized the habitat structure, management practices and physico-chemical parameters of the soil in each system. We recorded a total of 1423 specimens belonging to 15 species. The results show a greater beetle species richness in the SPS with G. ulmifolia, which declines with reduced site complexity and soil quality and increased management practice intensity. There was a positive relationship between beetle species abundance and the soil physico-chemical characteristics such as moisture and nutrient content, as well as with the density of plants. A negative effect of management practices (use of insecticides, anti-parasite treatments and burning) was observed on beetle abundance; when the analyzed variables were related to each individual species, only four species responded to differences in levels of nitrogen and magnesium, as well as to the management practice and density of plants. Systems where perennial woody plants (trees and/or shrubs) interact with traditional components (animals and herbaceous forage plants) under integrated management can provide favorable conditions for the maintenance of a relatively high diversity of beetle species as well as a refuge for species with different habitat requirements.

TI  - The value of local ecological knowledge to guide tree species selection in tropical dry forest restoration
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest restoration projects involving active planting should prioritize species that are useful to local communities, while also considering species' threat status and resistance to local stress factors, but scientific knowledge on these criteria is scarce, especially in understudied tropical ecosystems. We hypothesized that local ecological knowledge can help to fill this gap. Through interviews with 47 local experts and 197 randomly selected households in 8 rural communities of the tropical dry forests of northwestern Peru and southern Ecuador, we identified the species perceived as most useful, most threatened, and most resistant to local stress factors. To better understand the studied local ecological knowledge, we also explored the following research questions and their implications for species selection decisions: (1) How does species' potential usefulness compare to their active use? (2) How does species' perceived threat status relate to their usefulness? (3) Does local knowledge on species' resistance to local stress factors corroborate scientific knowledge? We found large differences between the potential and active use of species and illustrate how data on both can yield useful insights. Furthermore, we found that species' perceived threat status was mainly linked to their usefulness for construction wood, and that the vast majority of local perceptions on species' threat status and stress resistance coincided with scientific knowledge. Our findings illustrate the large potential of local ecological knowledge for improving species selection strategies and thereby increasing the success of forest restoration efforts worldwide.

TI  - Do Lianas Cause Chronic Disturbance and Alter Successional Trajectories in Tropical Forests?
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Growing evidence suggests that lianas (woody vines), when abundant, can substantially alter tropical forests by disrupting tree regeneration and thus impacting carbon sequestration and species diversity.  Because liana abundance and biomass are thought to increase with climate change, studies on the ecology of lianas and their role in tropical forests are now critical.  This research will test a series of interrelated hypotheses to determine whether lianas can set in motion a positive feedback process whereby tropical forests are driven toward permanently liana-altered structure, species composition, and reduced tree density, diversity, and biomass.  To test these hypotheses, the investigators will permanently tag, spatially map the location, measure the diameter, and identify lianas in a 50 ha plot of tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, where nearly 250,000 trees have been studied for the past 25 years.  They will also conduct a separate, controlled liana removal experiment to gain a more mechanistic understanding of liana-tree interactions. The impact of lianas on tree dynamics and forest regeneration, and the question whether lianas can redirect tropical forest succession from tree-dominated to liana-dominated ecosystems, are of profound importance for the potential impact of global change on long-term tropical forest health and the maintenance of species diversity.  In addition to testing these questions directly, this research will also have broader impacts, including educational and international capacity building focusing on training undergraduate and graduate students from both the United States and Panama in tropical biology.

TI  - Environmentally-friendly forestry systems in Central America
T2  - Bois et Forets des Tropiques
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable logging practices can result in higher seedling regeneration, and higher understory biodiversity than in forests logged by conventional methods. Post-harvest silvicultural treatments increase the diameter growth of crop trees, although the consequences of their effects on forest composition need to be assessed. Management operations affect plant diversity in different ways, over different time scales, but there is no evidence of drastic changes in diversity during the first felling cycle, even in stands whose structure is altered by refinement/liberation treatments. Seed dispersal and germination can also be affected as a result of loss of fauna and changes in the forest microenvironment. In addition to research on technologies for sustainable management of tropical forests and their biodiversity, CATIE is also involved in designing systems for diversified forest management, which includes studies on the ecology and management of non-timber forest species. Many forest management practices are best suited to small farmers, farmer cooperatives, or community forest users. Some farmers' cooperatives in Costa Rica manage forests for ecotourism and non-timber forest products, and also cultivate other portions of their land as well as reforesting degraded land with native or exotic species, often as mixed-species planting schemes. Tropical plantations can supply wood products, contribute to carbon sequestration and land reclamation, as well as accelerating natural regeneration. Domestication of promising species for plantations involves selecting outstanding trees, evaluating genetic variability, seed germination and storage, evaluating the performance of species under different silvicultural systems, and developing seed orchards for the production of genetically improved seeds.

TI  - Natural forest at landscape scale is most important for bird conservation in rubber plantation
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Rubber is one of the most rapidly expanding monocultures in the tropics, and has precipitated biodiversity and ecosystem function loss. Identifying measures to improve biodiversity outcomes in rubber-forest mosaics is critical for tropical fauna. We evaluated how avian diversity responded to plantation- and landscape-level environmental variables. The most parsimonious model at the plot scale contained inter-tree planting distance for rubber, plantation age, and inverse distance weight of forest as predictors. The most supported model at the landscape scale contained both distance to forest patches larger than 100 ha and natural forest area as predictors. Model predictions indicated that natural forest area had the largest contribution to bird richness at landscape levels; avian diversity was projected to more than double when natural forest area increased from 25% to 755%. Frugivores and insectivores exhibited the strongest response to gains in natural forest area. Our results indicated that plantation smallholders could achieve biodiversity gains by retaining older trees and planting rubber trees with larger gaps, but that the most critical intervention is retaining large natural forest patches.

TI  - Biofuels from Jatropha curcas oil - Perspectives for tropical regions
T2  - OCL-OILSEEDS AND FATS CROPS AND LIPIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Almost 40% of the world's population of 6,7 billion people do not have access to affordable energy resources and drinking water of acceptable quality. But nothing is more important than the alleviation of hunger. The number of hungry people, according to the newest FAO statistics, has risen to close to one billion in 2008. Therefore, special attention needs to be given to research in food and agriculture. To this stock of global problems new challenges are added through the increase in human population of 80 million persons a year and the concomitant loss of large areas of former fertile agricultural land, mostly in the poorest countries. Jatropha curcas is the most primitive member of the large genus Euphorbiaceae. The name is derived from the Greek iatros (doctor) and trophe (food). Jatropha curcas is a perennial plant, native and widely spread throughout the tropics. It is not grazed by animals, grows readily on degraded lands, is drought and to some extent disease resistant. It is a multipurpose plant. There are two genotypes of Jatropha curcas, a toxic and a non-toxic one. The latter genotype is found in Mexico only. Well developed dry seeds from Jatropha curcas weigh between 650750 mg and contain 30-35% of oil that is suitable for conversion into biodiesel of high quality by the conventional, proven processes. The kernel forms around 65% of the seeds. The de-oiled kernel meal has a crude protein content of between 58% and 60% and a favourable amino acid profile. Extracts of the toxic genotype provide chemicals with potential in medicinal, pharmaceutical and bio-pesticide application. In contrast to other fossil fuel alternatives, like biofuels from food crops such as maize, soybean, sugar cane and palm, bioenergy from Jatropha curcas grown on wasteland incurs no carbon debt and thus, offers immediate and sustained greenhouse gas advantages. Potential benefits of large scale Jatropha plantations on degraded land are expected to be: availability of CO2 neutral fuel in remote rural areas; potential availability of high protein concentrates and biofertilizer locally; wasteland reclamation for food production; carbon sequestration for emission trading; employment generation and socioeconomic development for impoverished farmers and rural labourers. Because of the wild nature of the plant, productivity reports vary considerably from less than 100 kg to more than 10.000 kg of seeds per ha. This huge variation is of importance from a breeder's point of view for future selection and breeding programmes. Such programmes coupled with the development of agronomical practices, are essential prerequisites for economic exploitation to give Jatropha curcas a bright future.

TI  - Carbon recovery in secondary forests: Insights from three West African countries
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the potential of secondary tropical forests to store and sequester substantial amounts of carbon, little is known about their above-ground carbon (AGC) stocks and the factors affecting them, especially in West Africa. This information is of key importance if the countries in this region want to achieve their forest restoration and climate mitigation commitments. To fill in this gap, we investigated how environmental and local management (e.g. remnant trees) factors influenced AGC and tree species richness in secondary forests at seven sites across Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. We established 140 plots (20 x 50 m) in fallows <15 years (20 plots per site) and sampled all trees >= 10 cm diameter following standardised protocols. We found that AGC stocks and tree species richness increased with fallow age, but were highly variable across sites driven by both climatic and local management practices. While drought stress negatively affected AGC, remnant trees had a positive effect. AGC recovery rates ranged between 0.72 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) (second driest site) and 13.76 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) (wettest site). Given its low cost, our findings highlight the potential of passive restoration in secondary forests for carbon sequestration, particularly in wetter landscapes and areas with remnant trees from prior land use.

TI  - Soil carbon stock and nutrient characteristics of forest-savanna transition: Estimates from four land use systems in Ghana
T2  - SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change has led to drastic soil degradation and greenhouse gas emissions with implications for sustainable agriculture and climate change. Here, we report soil carbon stock and nutrient compositions of four land use types in the forest-savanna transition agro-ecological zone of Ghana. These were cashew, mango, oil palm and arable land. Soil samples were collected at 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm depths from each land use type. Soil nutrients and organic carbon content were greater in the tree-based land use types than in the arable land. Total soil organic carbon (SOC) ranged from 1.71% under cashew to 1.12% under the palms at the 0-15 cm depth. Soil carbon stock under the cashew was 12.5% greater than that of mango (56 Mg C/ha), and 40% more than that under oil palm. However, active carbon or permanganate oxidizable carbon was greatest (similar to 130 mg/kg) under mango and least (similar to 92.6 mg/kg) in arable land in the surface soil. Overall, active carbon was dependent on soil total carbon in the land use types (r = 0.81-0.91). Soil microbial biomass carbon was least in arable land (p < 0.05) and similar among the tree-based systems (p > 0.05) at 0-15 cm depth. No clear trend was observed in the exchangeable base compositions in the surface soils but cashew and mango systems appeared to show significantly greater levels of exchangeable calcium and magnesium, respectively. We conclude that strong nexus between soil microbial biomass carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, and active soil carbon may drive soil carbon dynamics in land use systems of tropical forest-savanna ecotone.

TI  - Early REDD plus Implementation: The Journey of an Indigenous Community in Eastern Panama
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) offers developing countries an opportunity to engage in global climate change mitigation through the sale of carbon credits for reforestation, avoided deforestation and forest conservation projects. Funding for REDD+ projects has increased in recent years and REDD+ projects have proliferated, but relatively few studies have, as yet, examined their implementation. Here, we present a synthesis of the challenges and lessons learned while implementing a REDD+ project in an Embera community in Panama. Our case study, documented in four cycles of collaborative action research over 11 years, examines how local communities sought to reduce emissions from deforestation and benefit from carbon offset trading while improving local livelihoods. Through semi-structured interviews and participatory methods, we found that success with REDD+ hinges on broader issues than those widely discussed in the literature and in policy circles. Though economic incentives for participants and the equitable distribution of benefits remain important to project participants, our study finds that, in adapting REDD+ strategies to best suit community needs, the role of a support system for implementation ("bridging institutions") and REDD+'s potential as a conflict resolution mechanism for tenure issues deserve more attention as key factors that contribute to meaningful participation in REDD+.

TI  - RECLAMATION OF SODIC SOIL THROUGH AFFORESTATION
T2  - Indian Forester
M3  - Article
AB  - A forest ecosystem was developed on barren sodic land at Banthra Research Station of National Botanical Research Institute, Lucknow, India during 1960s. About 74 species belonging to 34 families were recorded in this new forest, which was characterized as mixed dry sub-tropical forest with deciduous and evergreen species. The forest was classified into overstory, understory and ground layer vegetation based on the morphological variation and vertical strata of the vegetation. Frequency, density, abundance and basal area were evaluated for each species and dominants were assorted on the basis of basal area and Importance Value Index. Shannon Wiener's diversity index measured as 3.6, 3.3, and 1.8 for overstory, understory and ground layer vegetation, respectively.Forest biomass (dry weight) was estimated to be 347 Mg ha(-1) with a net primary production of 25 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) at the age of 40 years. Forest sequestered about 168 Mg ha(-1) carbon content in their standing biomass with current accumulation rate of 11 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) and conserved 8.9 TJ ha(-1) energy in their standing stock. Annual energy fixation was estimated to 644 GJ ha(-1). Nutrient pool and fluxes in the forest were also determined. Further, the role of litter and fine roots in reclamation of sodic soil was quantified.

TI  - Natural forest regrowth under different land use intensities and landscape configurations in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural forest regrowth is considered the most cost-effective strategy to promote large-scale forest restoration, but regrowth trajectories and their consequences for nature and people can be highly variable. This uncertainty may obstruct devoting land, time and resources in promoting this restoration approach. Process-based models allow to simulate forest regrowth under different scenarios and may thus support decision making to manage areas in ways that maximize forest restoration based on natural forest regrowth. In the present study, we used the process-based model LandClim to assess the following questions:1) How does land use intensity affect forest growth, aboveground biomass (AGB) and tree species diversity in agricultural landscapes in the long term? 2) How do different land use configurations affect the structure and expansion of second-growth forests? We based our study on six 4 x 4 km agricultural landscapes, dominated by pastures and sugarcane, in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest region. We parameterized and validated LandClim for the study region by comparing model outputs with published estimates and information from field data collected across the six landscapes. We then simulated natural forest regrowth under different land use intensities in the six landscapes and analyzed how land use intensity and landscape configuration affect AGB, tree species diversity and the spatial dynamics of second growth forests. Our results showed negative effects of increased land use intensity on landscape biomass accumulation due to limited forest cover expansion. Landscapes dominated by sugarcane had lower forest regrowth potential than pasture-dominated landscapes due to lower likelihood of abandonment, and limited rates of seed availability and seedling growth. Land use intensity and landscape configuration were also important factors for tree diversity changes. However, temporal patterns differed, and while AGB reached a plateau after 100-150 years, tree diversity peaked between 30 and 70 years. Thus, the effects of land use intensity and landscape configuration on forest AGB and tree diversity take decades to be fully expressed, highlighting the importance of a long-term commitment in restoration projects.

TI  - Evolutionary dynamics of selective logging in the tropics: A systematic review of impact studies and their effectiveness in sustainable forest management
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Selective logging is the dominant timber harvesting practice in natural tropical forests. Considering its scale and its contribution to forest management outcome, efficient management of selective logging is crucial to address challenges associated with timber demand, carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. Ongoing selective logging has been a key reason for forest degradation despite a set of recommended practices such as reduced-impact logging. With the objective of drawing the attention of scholars and policy makers to answer the question why effectiveness of selective logging practice is still an issue, we tracked the trend and pattern of scholarly research related to the impact of selective logging. Using a systematic review of literature, we explored and discussed the possible factors hindering implementation of improved forest harvesting practices and the overall knowledge gaps yet not explored in this field of research. This review found consensus among scholars that implementation of improved forest harvesting is still rare despite the constant efforts made by researchers since the 1970s. Based on the review findings we concluded that concentration of research on specific countries, insufficient coverage of diversified forest dimensions/thematic areas, and higher concerns relating to ecological impacts of forest management are the reasons behind poor adoption of research outcomes of improved logging practices. Likewise, their implementation is further hindered by limited attention to the interests and needs of the forest managers/owners, lack of coordination and collaboration among stakeholders and negligible support to develop stakeholders' capacity. Our review suggests a broadening of the geographical and thematic focus of the study as well as a consideration of effective engagement and capacity development of the forest managers/owners and stakeholders in selective logging policies and practices.

TI  - Soil carbon dynamics and climate change: current agro-environmental perspectives and future dimensions
T2  - ENERGY ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The management of soil organic carbon (SOC) has now been identified as the most imperative dimension for managing the global climate change as well as soil fertility. In this respect, various agro-ecological approaches such as organic and integrated nutrient management system have been proposed worldwide, though accepted with limited enthusiasm. The understanding of the different soil C pools and processes are of vital importance before the implementation of these agro-ecological management practices, as it determines the success of SOC management. In the present study, we tried to encompass various SOC pools and processes governing the SOC dynamics in the agro-ecosystems. In this paper, dry tropical ecosystems having a unique ecological behaviour (such as strong nutrient conservation mechanisms and potential C sink nature) have been discussed especially due to its potential role in global climate change and mitigation, and linked soil fertility. It is proposed that a multi-factorial experimentation involving quantitative and qualitative change in soil available N, microbial and aggregate attributes, which has been recently found to be of crucial significance, is required for the proper mechanistic understanding of SOC dynamics. It may also help in the identification of some integrative functional indicators, which can be used to achieve a balanced SOC dynamics via suitable agro-management.

TI  - Effect of land tenure on forest cover and the paradox of private titling in Panama
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Meeting sustainable development goals requires policies that account for interrelatedness in social and environmental issues such as land tenure and deforestation. This work takes advantage of a nationwide titling campaign in Panama to explore the effect of private titling on forest cover across a heterogeneous landscape covering all stages of forest transition and diverse tenure arrangements. Situated in a broader matched analysis of the influence of zoning and tenure on forest cover, private management is estimated to have contributed to the deforestation of 1750-3650 km2 of mature forest nationwide from 1990 to 2020 with an average marginal effect of 15.3%. Conversely, Protected Areas and Indigenous Comarcas are estimated to have protected 1700-3900 km2 and 500-1250 km2 of mature forest, respectively. Private titling is associated with increased deforestation both during titling and years after, supporting observations that the titling process itself encourages speculative deforestation by title seekers and that private landholders value natural forests less than other land uses such as cattle. By disaggregating the data by region to highlight different stages of forest transition as well as by processes of deforestation and forest growth, this analysis shows that while private titling accelerates deforestation, it also encourages investment in reforestation. This presents a paradox for private titles and forests where agencies may perversely encourage speculative deforestation by creating stronger markets for forest-ready landscapes than for intact natural forests. In cases such as this one, where deforestation helps to secure a title, this paradox is confounded when having a title is set as a precondition for participation in a forest conservation program.

TI  - Agroforestry for conserving and enhancing biodiversity
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The intricate relationship between biodiversity loss and human well-being is increasingly being understood in ecological and economic terms. Despite the knowledge of the multiple dimensions of this relationship and its importance, species and ecosystems are still disappearing at an alarming rate. Anthropogenic pressures are the prime reason for this trend, yet attempts to reduce such pressures and conserve species in protected areas have only achieved limited success. This has led to the realization that sustainable consumptive use approaches that can combine production and conservation functions are also important in conserving biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes. Agroforestry, as part of a multifunctional working landscape, can play a major role in conserving and even enhancing biodiversity from farms to the landscape level in both tropical and temperate regions of the world. This special issue is an attempt to bring together a collection of articles that not only explore and demonstrate the biodiversity benefits of agroforestry, but also the mechanisms by which agroforestry systems sustain such high floristic and faunal diversity. While it is important to conserve biodiversity in protected areas, the articles in the special issue reiterate the importance of agroforestry as a critical tool in conserving biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes.

TI  - A trait-based plant economic framework can help increase the value of reforestation for conservation
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - While reforestation is gaining momentum to moderate climate change via carbon sequestration, there is also an opportunity to use tree planting to confront declining global biodiversity. Where tree species vary in support of diversity, selecting appropriate species for planting could increase conservation effectiveness. We used a common garden experiment in Borneo using 24 native tree species to examine how variation among tree species in their support of beetle diversity is predicted by plant traits associated with "acquisitive" and "conservative" resource acquisition strategies. We evaluate three hypotheses: (1) beetle communities show fidelity to host identity as indicated by variation in abundance and diversity among tree species, (2) the leaf economic spectrum partially explains this variation as shown by beetle preferences for plant species that are predicted by plant traits, and (3) a small number of selected tree species can capture higher beetle species richness than a random tree species community. We found high variation among tree species in supporting three highly intercorrelated metrics of beetle communities: abundance, richness, and Shannon diversity. Variation in support of beetle communities was predicted by plant traits and varied by plant functional groups; within the dipterocarp family, high beetle diversity was predicted by conservative traits such as high wood density and slow growth, and in non-dipterocarps by the acquisitive traits of high foliar K and rapid growth. Using species accumulation curves and extrapolation to twice the original sample size, we show that 48 tree species were not enough to reach asymptote levels of beetle richness. Nevertheless, species accumulation curves of the six tree species with the highest richness had steeper slopes and supported 33% higher richness than a random community of tree species. Reforestation projects concerned about conservation can benefit by identifying tree species with a disproportional capacity to support biodiversity based on plant traits.

TI  - Variation in carbon storage among tree species: Implications for the management of a small-scale carbon sink project
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite growing evidence for an effect of species composition on carbon (C) storage and sequestration, few projects have examined the implications of such a relationship for forestry and agriculture-based climate change mitigation activities. We worked with a community in Eastern Panama to determine the average above- and below-ground C stocks of three land-use types in their territory: managed forest, agroforests and pasture. We examined evidence for a functional relationship between tree-species diversity and C storage in each land-use type, and also explored how the use of particular tree species by community members could affect C storage. We found that managed forests in this landscape stored an average of 335 Mg C ha(-1), traditional agroforests an average of 145 Mg C ha(-1), and pastures an average of 46 Mg C ha(-1) including all vegetation-based C stocks and soil C to 40 cm depth. We did not detect a relationship between diversity and C storage; however, the relative contributions of species to C storage per hectare in forests and agroforests were highly skewed and often were not proportional to species' relative abundances. We conclude that protecting forests from conversion to pasture would have the greatest positive impact on C stocks, even though the forests are managed by community members for timber and non-timber forest products. However, because several of the tree species that contribute the most to C storage in forests were identified by community members as preferred timber species, we suggest that species-level management will be important to avoiding C-impoverishment through selective logging in these forests. Our data also indicate that expanding agroforests into areas currently under pasture could sequester significant amounts of carbon while providing biodiversity and livelihood benefits that the most common reforestation systems in the region - monoculture teak plantations - do not provide.

TI  - Land-use protection for climate change mitigation
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use change, mainly the conversion of tropical forests to agricultural land, is a massive source of carbon emissions and contributes substantially to global warming(1-3). Therefore, mechanisms that aim to reduce carbon emissions from deforestation are widely discussed, A central challenge is the avoidance of international carbon leakage if forest conservation is not implemented globally'', Here, We show that forest conservation schemes, even if implemented globally, could lead to another type of carbon leakage by driving cropland expansion in non-forested areas that are not subject to forest conservation schemes (non-forest leakage). These areas have a smaller,. but still considerable potential to store carbon(5,6). We show that a global forest policy could reduce carbon emissions by 77 Gt CO2, but would still allow for decreases in carbon stocks of non-forest land by 96 Gt CO2, until 2100 due to non-forest leakage effects. Furthermore; abandonment of agricultural hand and associated carbon uptake through vegetation regrowth is hampered. Effective mitigation measures thus require financing structures and conservation investments that cover the full range of carbon-rich ecosystems. However, our analysis indicates that greater agricultural productivity increases would be needed to compensate for such restrictions on agricultural expansion.

TI  - Carbon storage and sequestration in Southeast Asian urban clusters under future land cover change scenarios (2015-2050)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use land-cover (LULC) changes are occurring rapidly in Southeast Asia (SEA), generally associated with population growth, economic development and competing demands for land. Land cover change is one of the vital factors affecting carbon dynamics and emissions. SEA is an important region to study urban-caused LULC emissions and the potential for nature-based solutions (NBS) and nature climate solutions (NCS), as it is home to nearly 15% of the world's tropical forests and has some of the world's fastest rates of urban growth. We present a fine-scale urban cluster level assessment for SEA of current (2015) and future (2050) scenarios for carbon sequestration service and climate mitigation potential. We identified 956 urban clusters distributed across 11 countries of SEA. Considering the urban expansion projected and decline in forests, this region could see a carbon loss of up to 0.11 Gigatonnes (Scenario SSP4 RCP 3.4). Comparing carbon change values to urban emissions, we found that the average offset value ranging from -2% (Scenario SSP1 RCP 2.6) to -21%. We also found that a few medium and large urban clusters could add to more than double the existing carbon emissions in 2050 in the SSP3 and SSP4 RCP 3.4 scenarios, while a minority of clusters could offset their emissions under SSP1. Our study confirms that NCS, and particularly reforestation, are in many cases able to offset the direct emissions from land cover conversion from SEA urban clusters. Hence, documenting the plausible LULC transitions and the associated impacts gains significance in the SEA region as the results can be useful for informing policy and sustainable land management.

TI  - Scenario-modelling for the sustainable management of non-timber forest products in tropical ecosystems
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystems degradation, and consequently biodiversity loss, has severe impacts on people around the world. The Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is one of the international initiatives that have emerged to inform policy makers and aid decisions to prevent further global biodiversity loss, focusing on the interdependence between natural systems and human culture. IPBES promotes the use of scenarios and modelling approaches as a fundamental tool to advance the understanding of the relationships between drivers of change, Nature's Contributions to People (NCP), and social systems. Local-scale case studies with a system approach demonstrating how current knowledge can be used to inform decision-making are still scarce. Here, we present a comprehensive conceptual model and a series of four scenarios under different policies for shea tree species management, as a case-study of applying systems thinking and the NCP concept to a local-scale socio-ecological system. We first characterized the central processes, NCP, drivers and pressures affecting the shea tree system, to investigate the impacts of the multiple uses of the shea tree species on the system as a whole. We then described potential policy options, developed four scenarios, and evaluated them by a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN). We predicted qualitative outcomes of the proposed scenarios: Business-as-usual (BAU), "Conservation and fair trade", "Agroforestry and fair trade" and "Industrial development". We found that the scenarios focussing on conservation, fair trade and agroforestry, can improve the conservation status of shea trees, and enhance well-being in the local communities. In this case study, we demonstrate that the development of a comprehensive conceptual model at a local scale can be a useful exercise to identify opportunities for effective policy strategies and social innovation. The shea tree case study can provide an example for modelling non-timber forest products in other regions around the world that face similar drivers and pressures. Species for which this model could be adapted include Central and South American species such as the Brazilian nut (Bertholletia excelsa), cocoa (Theobroma cacao), andiroba (Carapa guianensis), acai (Euterpe oleracea) and the wax palm (Ceroxylon quindiuense). The model and workflow applied here may thus be used to understand similar socio-ecological systems with local and international economic value across the Neotropical region.

AB  - In mitigating climate change and ecosystems preservation that are unique and indispensable to the life of the planet, efforts are being made to reduce current levels of deforestation and degradation of tropical forests. In the arch of deforestation of the Amazon forest, studies on the occurrence of fires and the dynamics of deforestation are frequent in the literature on several aspects such as soil management, climate and vegetation change and forest resilience.This work presents an analysis of the relationship between deforested areas and the occurrence of fire outbreaks observed from January 2007 to November 2018, in a study area of approximately 36,000 km(2), corresponding to the area covered by a Landsat-8 scene. Further, it was performed a correlation of fire outbreaks occurred in and near the forest area from the boundaries of the deforested areas from 2015 to 2018. Annual fire outbreaks data were obtained through the Queimadas Program of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) from 2007 to 2018, the deforestation polygons from the Project for Deforestation Monitoring in the Amazon Forest by Satellite (PRODES) and the INPE's Real-Time Detection System (DETER-B) from 2007 to 2018. The temporal analysis revealed an increasing of the incidence of fires with the increasing of deforestation in that period, evidencing the systematic use of fire as a means of suppressing biomass. In the last 4 years, the high occurrence of forest fires between 500 to 1000 m from the edge boundaries of the deforested areas, showed a considerable degradation of the forest and a probable decrease of forest resilience.

TI  - The potential for carbon sequestration through reforestation of abandoned tropical agricultural and pasture lands
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Approximately half of the tropical biome is in some stage of recovery from past human disturbance, most of which is in secondary forests growing on abandoned agricultural lands and pastures. Reforestation of these abandoned lands, both natural and managed, has been proposed as a means to help offset increasing carbon emissions to the atmosphere. In this paper we discuss the potential of these forests to serve as sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide in aboveground biomass and soils. A review of literature data shows that aboveground biomass increases at a rate of 6.2 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) during the first 20 years of succession, and at a rate of 2.9 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) over the first 80 years of regrowth. During the first 20 years of regrowth, forests in wet life zones have the fastest rate of aboveground carbon accumulation with reforestation, followed by dry and moist forests. Soil carbon accumulated at a rate of 0.41 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) over a 100-year period, and at faster rates during the first 20 years (1.30 Mg carbon ha(-1) yr(-1)). Past land use affects the rate of both above- and belowground carbon sequestration. Forests growing on abandoned agricultural land accumulate biomass faster than other past land uses, while soil carbon accumulates faster on sites that were cleared but not developed, and on pasture sites. Our results indicate that tropical reforestation has the potential to serve as a carbon offset mechanism both above- and belowground for at least 40 to 80 years, and possibly much longer. More research is needed to determine the potential for longer-term carbon sequestration for mitigation of atmospheric CO2 emissions.

T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Thicket vegetation may be of great importance in soil carbon (C) storage and in provision of other ecosystem services such as soil erosion control and biodiversity conservation. However, it is less studied in tropical ecosystems due to limited understanding of its ecological importance. This study reports soil C pools and nutrient concentrations [nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), exchangeable calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and potassium (K)] of unique thicket formations on Vertisol in comparison with adjacent land use types viz. rangeland, dry forest, and farmland at Kpong in the coastal Accra plains of Ghana. We also examined soil particle and nutrient distributions of termitarium associated with the thicket clumps on the Vertisols. Soils were sampled from each land use at 0-30 cm depth in addition to deep coring up to 100 cm. In the rangeland, forest and farmland, we demarcated 1600 m(2) area each and established 4 subplots measuring 20 x 20 m (400 m(2)) and selected for the thicket vegetation, 4 thicket clumps each of approximately 400 m(2) for soil sampling. The thicket clumps had greater soil total N, available P, exchangeable Ca and Mg concentrations than the rangeland and farmland but the levels in the thicket were similar (p > 0.05) to that of the adjacent dry forest. Soil C stock varied from 59 Mg ha(-1) in the rangeland to 111 Mg ha(-1) in the thicket clumps. The C stored in the silt + clay (S + C) fraction did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) in both the thicket and the dry forest, indicating similar C sequestration abilities. The S + C fraction contributed 89.6, 82.8, 81.3, and 73.7% to total soil organic C content in the rangeland, farmland, dry forest, and thickets, respectively. Soils of the termite mounds in the thickets were more clayey (ca. 38-41% clay) than the surrounding thicket soils (ca. 32% clay). We conclude that Vertisols in thicket areas store soil C and nutrients comparably as tropical dry forest, underscoring their ecological importance and the need for their conservation to enhance soil quality in the Anthropocene.

TI  - REALU vs. REDD plus : Carbon and biodiversity in the Afromontane landscapes of SW Ethiopia
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A major constraint to current REDD+ initiatives is the arbitrariness of the operational definition of 'forest'. The UN-REDD+ framework ignores the high potential of other (tree containing) land uses for carbon sequestration and the generation of co-benefits, in contrast to a whole landscape approach known as 'Reducing Emissions from All Land Uses' (REALU). To indicate this potential, carbon stocks and biodiversity were assessed at the landscape scale around Jimma, SW Ethiopia. Notwithstanding the indigenous forests' high carbon stocks per hectare (336.96 +/- 120.6 Mg C ha(-1)) 80% of the total carbon stock of the 10(6) ha assessed landscape window was found to be stored in non-forest land uses. Especially local agro-forestry systems, such as managed semi-forest coffee production fragments (179.92 +/- 38.5 Mg C ha(-1)), homegardens (106.26 +/- 16.8 Mg C ha(-1)) and pole wood plantations (112.36 +/- 23.9 Mg ha(-1)) store large amounts of carbon. Together with local maize fields (69.45 +/- 12.3 Mg C ha(-1)), teff fields (69.51 +/- 6.5 Mg C ha(-1)) and grazing lands (76.90 +/- 10.3 Mg C ha(-1)) these non-forest land uses play an important role in a prospective 'high-carbon-stock rural-development' under a REALU framework. A REDD+ approach, applying a stringent forest definition that disqualifies for agriculture and a 30% canopy cover threshold, would only account for 24 Gg C in the 10(6) ha landscape window. Applying the canopy cover threshold alone, would triple the amount to 72 Gg C, while a REALU project would account for the whole 116 Gg landscape carbon. The biodiversity assessment, based on tree community composition and Hill's diversity indices, indicated important biodiversity co-benefits under a REALU approach. Biodiversity indices such as the Hill's Ni diversity of abundant tree species showed a strong positive correlation with local carbon stocks (R-2 = 0.56). Since the cover of indigenous forest is reduced to only 7% of the landscape window's area, most of the remaining trees and biodiversity can be found within the surrounding landscape mosaic. Semi-forest coffee production fragments for example still harbour almost half of all encountered native tree species. An interesting result of the simultaneous biodiversity assessment was that a regrouping of plots based on tree biodiversity provides a more precise and cost efficient way to assess carbon stocks, reducing the number of plots needed with 23%, to achieve the same precision level.

AB  - The current study evaluates the growing stock, biomass and carbon content of Andhra Pradesh state's forest (India) along with its current status of forest degradation and loss. For this purpose, the study used the growing stock data collected by state forest department in 2010 for the calculation of biomass and carbon storage using the standard conversion and expansion factors given by IPCC. The analysis shows low biomass and carbon values for the state's forest in comparison to the mean values recorded in different studies made for Andhra Pradesh. It is also observed to be lower when compared with the average carbon and biomass for Indian forests. Overall, the analysis showed degradation and loss of forest in the state, coupled with reduction in biomass and carbon sink.

TI  - LTREB: Legacy effects of compounding disturbances in the Amazon: implications for ecosystem carbon and water cycling
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - The carbon stored in the Amazon���s forests is equivalent to ten years of current global carbon fossil-fuel emissions. This large carbon reservoir has seemingly grown over the past few decades and mitigated some of the negative effects on the global climate system associated with greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, Amazon forests transfer enough moisture to the atmosphere to influence regional precipitation patterns. Interactions between climate change, deforestation, logging, windstorms, and wildfires have threatened the carbon stocks and climate regulatory functions of Amazon forests. Growing concerns that ongoing climate change combined with human disturbances will change Amazon forests into open savannas across large regions. This long term experiment in environmental biology award focuses on a forest that lies at the edge between continuous neotropical forests and savannas. This is an area where native vegetation has been fragmented and is frequently subject to interactions between human and natural disturbances such as fires, droughts, and windstorms. This award evaluates forest resilience from seasonally dry evergreen tropical forests to multiple disturbances based on long- term ecological measurements of a highly threatened Amazon forest. The project���s outcomes could inform regional land and fire management, particularly the development of new strategies to avoid catastrophic wildfires that reduce the capacity of forests to provide ecosystem services. This award will also connect US-based research with researchers and institutions in Brazil, in the process helping to train a diverse group of US students. Finally, the award represents important benchmarks for land surface models and remote sensing techniques that have been widely used to understand potential trajectories of tropical forests This award tests the hypothesis that forests subjected to novel compounding disturbances use different pathways to recover climate services. Disturbed forests that experience minor, short-term reductions in climate functions such as ET and net carbon uptake, have high forest resilience and low probability of large-scale forest replacement by scrubland. However, repeated disturbances triggering long-term losses of forest climate functions would point to low forest resilience. This award will add a decade of ecological data to a long-term, large-scale experimental site in southeast Amazonia that has been degraded by edge effects, recurrent fires, two windthrow events, and multiple droughts. These extended data measurements will permit a comprehensive assessment of how potential future pathways of the experimentally disturbed forests affect ecosystem-level climatic functions across different successional forest pathways and as plant traits change. The experimental site is located in one of the most threatened regions of the Amazon, on the boundary between a dense evergreen rainforest and seasonally dry forests and where native vegetation has been fragmented and subjected to anthropogenic (fire, edge effects) and natural disturbances (droughts and windthrow events). How forests��� long-term climate functions change as a function of novel disturbances and climate change has direct implications for the future of the world���s largest tropical forest. This award will rely on long-term ecological measurements to build a clearer understanding of Amazon forest resilience to multiple disturbances. It will evaluate how interactions between fire legacies to trees (e.g., wounds to tree trunks) and extreme weather events (droughts, windstorms) affect forest climatic functions. In the next ten years, this award will lead to a new understanding of how forest successional pathways and plant traits influence ecosystem-level ET and carbon stocks following compounding disturbances. This award will provide new insights into the (as yet unquantified) thresholds that may lead to large-scale ecosystem change under future climate and land use changes.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

TI  - Lime and gypsum application increases biological activity, carbon pools, and agronomic productivity in highly weathered soil
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of lime and gypsum has been recognized as an important strategy for correcting soil acidity and for improving soil fertility, soil aggregation, and agronomic productivity in highly weathered soils. We hypothesized that the combined application of lime and gypsum would create favorable conditions for biological activity and result in increased SOC storage and agronomic productivity. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term (i.e., 15 years) impact of lime and gypsum application on the biological activity, SOC stocks, and agronomic productivity of plots under no-till soil management. The experiment was established in 1998 at a site with clayey Oxisol in southern Brazil, and was designed with a split-plot arrangement, completely randomized blocks, and three replicates. The main plot was subject to three lime treatments: (i) control (no lime); (ii) incorporated lime (IL):incorporation of 4.5 Mg lime ha(-1) to a depth of 0-20 cm by; and (iii) surface lime (SL): surface application of 4.5 Mg lime ha(-1), which was equally divided among three annual applications during the first three years of the experiment. The subplots were comprised by surface applications of gypsum at 0, 3, 6, or 9 Mg ha(-1). Soil samples were collected in 1998, before of the experiment, and in October 2013, in order to evaluate soil enzyme activities, SOC pool stocks, crop productivity, C-biomass input, and soil fertility attributes. Both forms of lime application significant improved the stocks of several SOC pools, crop productivity, biomass-C input rates, soil fertility attributes, and enzyme activity. The SOC stocks were positively correlated with Ca2+ content and biomass-C input, demonstrating the potential of calcium to improve C accumulation. Enzyme activities were significantly affected by both soil fertility and SOC pools, with increases in hot water extractable organic C yielding the greatest increases in enzyme activity. In addition, we also found that gypsum application significantly increased the stocks of labile SOC pools and arylsulfatase activity. However, effects of gypsum application were less apparent than those of lime application and the combination of surface lime (4.5 Mg ha(-1)) and gypsum (9 Mg ha(-1)) application yielded the greatest long-term increase in the stock of total organic C stock. Thus, the results of the present study suggest that lime and gypsum application, along with no-till management and biomass-C input, constitutes an efficient strategy for improving the biological activity, C stocks, and productivity of agricultural soils.

TI  - Simulating the potential for ecological restoration of dryland forests in Mexico under different disturbance regimes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Examining the potential for ecological restoration is important in areas where anthropogenic disturbance has degraded forest landscapes. However, the conditions under which restoration of degraded tropical dry forests (TDF) might be achieved in practice have not been determined in detail. In this study, we used LANDIS-II, a spatially explicit model of forest dynamics, to assess the potential for passive restoration of TDF through natural regeneration. The model was applied to two Mexican landscapes under six different disturbance regimes, focusing on the impact of fire and cattle grazing on forest cover, structure and composition. Model results identified two main findings. First, tropical dry forests are more resilient to anthropogenic disturbance than expected. Results suggested that under both a scenario of small, infrequent fires and a scenario of large, frequent fires, forest area can increase relatively rapidly. However, forest structure and composition differed markedly between these scenarios. After 400 years, the landscape becomes increasingly occupied by relatively shade-tolerant species under small, infrequent fires, but only species with both relatively high shade tolerance and high fire tolerance can thrive under conditions with large, frequent fires. Second, we demonstrated that different forms of disturbance can interact in unexpected ways. Our projections revealed that when grazing acts in combination with fire, forest cover, structure and composition vary dramatically depending on the frequency and extent of the fires. Results indicated that grazing and fire have a synergistic effect causing a reduction in forest cover greater than the sum of their individual effects. This suggests that passive landscape-scale restoration of TDF is achievable in both Mexican study areas only if grazing is reduced, and fires are carefully managed to reduce their frequency and intensity.

TI  - Emission savings through the COP26 declaration of deforestation could come at the expense of non-forest land conversion
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The majority of signatories to The United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2021 (COP26) made a declaration to end deforestation by 2030. Here, we quantify future changes in land use and associated CO2 emissions to examine the impact of ending deforestation by 2030 on global land dynamics and emissions using an open-source land-use model. We show that if the COP26 declaration to end deforestation is fully implemented globally, about 167 Mha of deforestation could be avoided until 2050, compared to a baseline scenario which does not have extended forest protection. However, avoided deforestation and associated emissions come at the cost of strongly increased conversion of unprotected non-forested land to agricultural land, while land-use intensification in most regions is similar compared to a baseline scenario. Global initiatives are needed to facilitate a common dialogue on addressing the possible carbon emissions and non-forest leakage effects due to the expedited loss of non-forested land under a policy aimed at halting deforestation by 2030.

TI  - Spiders in the Web: Understanding the Evolution of REDD plus in Southwest Ghana
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The implementation of the global programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in developing countries, and the role of Conservation, Sustainable Management of Forests and Enhancement of Forest Carbon Stocks (REDD+) is lacks a robust financial mechanism and is widely criticized for producing too little positive impact for climate, nature, and people. In many countries with tropical forests however, a variety of REDD+ projects continue to develop on the ground. This paper fills in some of the gaps in our understanding of the dynamic relation between global policymaking and implementation of REDD+ on the ground. Using the introduction of REDD+ in Southwest Ghana as an example, we apply a practice-based approach to analyze the different roles that local actors and global-local intermediaries played in the introduction of REDD+. Our results show a more balanced picture than polarized debates at the global levels suggest. The logic of practice explains how REDD+ was translated to the local situation. Global actors took a lead but depended on local actors to make REDD+ work. Together, they integrated elements of existing practices that helped REDD+ land' locally but also transformed REDD+ globally to resemble such local practices. REDD+ initiatives absorbed elements from established community-based conservation, forest restoration, and sustainable agro-forestry practices. The evolution of REDD+ in Ghana reflects global trends to integrate REDD+ with landscape approaches.

TI  - The political economy of net-zero transitions: Policy drivers, barriers, and justice benefits to decarbonization in eight carbon-neutral countries
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the political economy of decarbonization in eight countries over the period 2000 to 2021/ 2022 that have already achieved a national net-zero transition. These countries are Bhutan, Suriname, Panama, Guyana, Comoros, Gabon, Madagascar, and Niue. It utilizes an analytical method of a rich, interdisciplinary and systematized literature review integrated with thematic analysis. For each of these countries, the study examines the drivers and political motivation behind net-zero progress, including the timeline of events; the barriers and challenges that had to be overcome; and the benefits of decarbonization and its impacts on equity and justice. The main objectives of the study are to broaden the evidence base on low-carbon transitions beyond often and even overstudied countries that are Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democracies, or WEIRD countries, and to offer new empirical data on the strategy of energy policies in the real world, examining the first eight countries to achieve net-zero success in the modern era. It finds that all eight countries used a similar mix of nine policy interventions involving land use, renewable energy, and waste management. Common barriers included vulnerability to the effects of extreme climate events either in the form of natural disasters (i.e. landslides and floodings) or ecosystems degradation (i.e. ocean acidification, coastal erosion and forests loss). Despite these barriers, achieving net-zero emissions positively impacted marginalized communities by providing a more equitable distribution of climate benefits, mitigating adverse health effects and reducing social inequalities, particularly in low-income areas.

TI  - Functional diversity and redundancy of amphibians, ants, and dung beetles in passive and active cloud forest restoration
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest restoration practices have increased globally, with positive consequences for biodiversity conservation. However, our understanding of the variation in ecosystem functioning recovery presented among different restoration strategies remains limited, and few studies have compared the functional diversity of contrasting faunal assemblages. Here, we assessed how the functional diversities and functional redundancies of amphibian, ant, and dung beetle assemblages vary among forests of the same age (23 years) under active (native mixed plantations) and passive (natural regeneration) restoration, cattle pasture (degraded ecosystem), and mature cloud forest (reference ecosystem). We also explored how environmental variables relate to the functional diversity of each animal assemblage. We found that functional diversity (measured as functional richness, functional evenness, and functional divergence) and functional redundancy in the three faunal assemblages were similar between the two restoration strategies. However, some attributes of functional diversity did not reach the values of the reference ecosystem, especially in the amphibians and dung beetles. Environmental variables related to functional diversity also depended on the taxonomic group and the metric of functional diversity, but the most important of these variables were vegetation condition, canopy cover and tree density. In our study system, passive and active restoration produced similar recovery rates of functional diversity of the faunal assemblages. Regardless of the restoration strategy implemented, long-term adaptive management strategies must be implemented to ensure full recovery of biodiversity and functionality in Neotropical cloud forest landscapes.

TI  - Floristic diversity and carbon stocks in the periphery of Deng-Deng National Park, Eastern Cameroon
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon is continuously being removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis and stored in carbon pools (live, dead, and soil carbon) of forest ecosystems. However, carbon stock in dead wood and of trees with diameters at breast height (dbh) between 5 and 10 cm is often not considered in many studies carried out in the Congo Basin Forest. The relationship between tree diversity, life-forms and carbon stocks has received little attention. This study was carried out on the outskirts of Deng Deng National Park (DDNP) to determine tree diversity (dominant families, species richness and Shannon index), assess carbon stocks in the five carbon compartments (living tree, understory, fine roots, dead wood and litter) as well as to analyze the relationship between (1) carbon stocks and tree diversity; and, (2) between carbon stock and life-forms. The Shannon index of trees >= 10 cm dbh ranged from 2.6 in riparian forest to 4.3 in secondary forest; and for the tree between 5 and 10 cm, it ranged to 1.56 in riparian forest to 3.68 in the secondary forest. The study site housed 16 species, 7 genera and 3 families which are only found in trees of dbh between 5 and 10 cm. The average total carbon stock of the five compartments varied from 200.1 t ha(-1) in forest residues to 439.1 t ha(-1) in secondary forest. Dead wood carbon stock varied from 1.2 t ha(-1) in riparian forests to 12.51t ha(-1) in agroforests. The above ground carbon stocks for trees with diameter between 5 and 10 cm varied from 0.7 t ha(-1) in young fallow fields to 5.02 t ha(-1) in old secondary forests. This study reveals a low but positive correlation between species richness and total carbon stocks, as well as a significant positive relationship between life-forms and total carbon stocks. The findings highlight the need for more data concerning carbon content of dead wood, carbon of trees >= 5 cm < 10 cm dbh and the relationship between carbon stocks and tree diversity from other areas of the Congo Basin for a good understanding of the contribution of tropical forests to climate change mitigation.

TI  - Intra-specific patterns of δ<SUP>13</SUP>C, growth and wood density variation at sites of contrasting precipitation with implications for modelling carbon sequestration of tropical tree species
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical agroforestry practices play a crucial role in mitigating global climate change by absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and storing carbon in their biomass. Assessing the effects of water stress on carbon sequestration as well as uncertainties in measurement, are important for implementing the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) programs and carbon trading. This study aims to understand how precipitation influences carbon sequestration of Tectona grandis, Acacia mangium and Eucalyptus camaldulensis growing in agroforestry (woodlot) plantations in Bangladesh. Wood cores were collected at two different sites with contrasting (low vs high) annual precipitation and analysed for radial growth, carbon isotope abundance (delta C-13) of cellulose and wood density. Site- and species-specific variation in delta C-13 was observed with higher values (less negative) detected at the low precipitation site. Trees at the low precipitation site showed lower growth rate and higher wood (basic) density compared to the trees at high precipitation site. Trees at the low precipitation site also showed significantly lower carbon sequestration rate (CSR) than those of the high precipitation site. delta C-13 reflects site- and species-specific water stress conditions. This study characterises intra- and inter-specific CSR variations in contrasting sites and confirms the importance of considering site-specific radial variation of wood density to render more accurate accounting of carbon sequestration and storage in tropical forests.

TI  - Data from: Patterns and drivers of atmospheric nitrogen deposition retention in global forests
T2  - Dryad
M3  - Data set
AB  - Forests are the largest carbon sink in terrestrial ecosystems, and the impact of nitrogen (N) deposition on this carbon sink depends on the fate of external N inputs. However, the patterns and driving factors of N retention in different forest compartments remain elusive. In this study, we synthesized 408 observations from global forest 15N tracer experiments to reveal the variation and underlying mechanisms of 15N retention in plants and soils. The results showed that the average total ecosystem 15N retention in global forests was 63.04  1.23%, with the soil pool being the main N sink (45.76  1.29%). Plants absorbed 17.28  0.83% of 15N, with more allocated to leaves (5.83  0.63%) and roots (5.84  0.44%). In subtropical and tropical forests, 15N was mainly absorbed by plants and mineral soils, while the organic soil layer in temperate forests retained more 15N. Additionally, forests retained more 15NH4+ than 15NO3, primarily due to the stronger capacity of the organic soil layer to retain 15NH4+. The mechanisms of 15N retention varied among ecosystem compartments, with total ecosystem 15N retention affected by N deposition. Plant 15N retention was influenced by vegetative and microbial nutrient demands, while soil 15N retention was regulated by climate factors and soil nutrient supply. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of climate and nutrient supply and demand in regulating forest N retention and provides data to further explore the impacts of N deposition on forest carbon sequestration. We searched the Web of Science Database for peer-reviewed papers prior to February 22, 2023, using retention and N-15 as the keywords. The following criteria were applied to filter the peer-reviewed papers: (1) Selection of 15N tracer experiments in forest ecosystems conducted in the field, excluding laboratory incubation or greenhouse experiments; (2) Selection of the absolute value of 15N retention obtained from the 15N tracer experiment, excluding the relative value; (3) Selection of 15N tracer experiments including N addition treatments, excluding other treatments such as fire, phosphorus (P) addition, potassium addition, etc. Due to limited data on litter layers and understory vegetation components (i.e., shrubs, herbs, and grasses), the 15N retention of litter layers was combined into organic soil 15N retention. Within the entire forest ecosystem, the 15N retention of understory vegetation was not consider, focusing instead on the 15N allocation among different plant organs (i.e., leaves, branches, stems, roots). Ultimately, 408 observations were obtained from 56 peer-reviewed papers, totaling 62 sites and 92 site-years. The study sites were distributed across North America (25 sites), Europe (14 sites), Asia (14 sites), South America (3 sites), Oceania (4 sites), and Africa (2 sites), covering tropical forests (5 sites), subtropical forests (10 sites), temperate forests (42 sites), and boreal forests (5 sites). Raw data for15N retention of different ecosystem compartments were obtained from tables, figures, results, or supplementary information in the peer-reviewed papers. When data were presented in figures, specific values were extracted using Getdata software 2.22 (GetData, Kogarah, NSW, AUS). # Patterns and drivers of atmospheric nitrogen deposition retention in global forests We searched the Web of Science Database for peer-reviewed papers prior to February 22, 2023, using retention and N-15 as the keywords.

TI  - Ecuador's Mangrove Forest Carbon Stocks: A Spatiotemporal Analysis of Living Carbon Holdings and Their Depletion since the Advent of Commercial Aquaculture
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we estimate the living carbon lost from Ecuador's mangrove forests since the advent of export-focused shrimp aquaculture. We use remote sensing techniques to delineate the extent of mangroves and aquaculture at approximately decadal periods since the arrival of aquaculture in each Ecuadorian estuary. We then spatiotemporally calculate the carbon values of the mangrove forests and estimate the amount of carbon lost due to direct displacement by aquaculture. Additionally, we calculate the new carbon stocks generated due to mangrove reforestation or afforestation. This research introduces time and LUCC (land use/land cover change) into the tropical forest carbon literature and examines forest carbon loss at a higher spatiotemporal resolution than in many earlier analyses. We find that 80 percent, or 7,014,517 t of the living carbon lost in Ecuadorian mangrove forests can be attributed to direct displacement of mangrove forests by shrimp aquaculture. We also find that IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) compliant carbon grids within Ecuador's estuaries overestimate living carbon levels in estuaries where substantial LUCC has occurred. By approaching the mangrove forest carbon loss question from a LUCC perspective, these findings allow for tropical nations and other intervention agents to prioritize and target a limited set of land transitions that likely drive the majority of carbon losses. This singular cause of transition has implications for programs that attempt to offset or limit future forest carbon losses and place value on forest carbon or other forest good and services.

TI  - Effects of restoration on tree communities and carbon storage in rainforest fragments of the Western Ghats, India
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration is a leading strategy for reversing biodiversity losses and enhancing terrestrial carbon sequestration in degraded tropical forests. There have been few comprehensive assessments of recovery following restoration in fragmented forest landscapes, and the efficacy of active versus passive (i.e., natural regeneration) restoration remains unclear. We examined 11 indicators of forest structure, tree diversity and composition (adult and sapling), and aboveground carbon storage in 25 pairs of actively restored (AR; 7-15 yr after weed removal and mixed-native tree species planting) and naturally regenerating (NR) plots within degraded rainforest fragments, and in 17 less-disturbed benchmark (BM) rainforest plots in the Western Ghats, India. We assessed the effects of active restoration on the 11 indicators and tested the hypothesis that the effects of active restoration increase with isolation from contiguous and relatively intact rainforests. Active restoration significantly increased canopy cover, adult tree and sapling density, adult and sapling species density (overall and late-successional), compositional similarity to benchmarks, and aboveground carbon storage, which recovered 14-82% toward BM targets relative to NR baselines. By contrast, tree height-diameter ratios and the proportion of native saplings did not recover consistently in actively restored forests. The effects of active restoration on canopy cover, species density (adult), late-successional species density (adult and sapling), and species composition, but not carbon storage, increased with isolation across the fragmented landscape. Our findings show that active restoration can promote recovery of forest structure, composition, and carbon storage within 7-15 yr of restoration in degraded tropical rainforest fragments, although the benefits of active over passive restoration across fragmented landscapes would depend on indicator type and may increase with site isolation. These findings on early stages of recovery suggest that active restoration in ubiquitous fragmented landscapes of the tropics could complement passive restoration of degraded forests in less fragmented landscapes, and protection of intact forests, as a key strategy for conserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change.

TI  - A critical review of exploring the recent trends and technological advancements in forest biomass estimation
T2  - PLANT SCIENCE TODAY
M3  - Review
AB  - Biomass estimation is pivotal in understanding and managing global carbon stocks, offering vital insights into climate change and environmental ecology. It serves as a critical tool for evaluating carbon sequestration potential, a natural mechanism for regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Accurate estimation of forest biomass not only aids in quantifying carbon stocks but also provides a basis for sustainable forest management, conservation efforts, and policymaking to mitigate climate change impacts. This article provides a comprehensive review of various biomass estimation methods, including ground-based measurements, remote sensing technologies, and hybrid approaches. Each method's strengths, limitations, and practical applications are critically examined, highlighting their suitability for different spatial scales and ecological contexts. Traditional methods, while precise at small scales, are often labour-intensive and limited in coverage. In contrast, remote sensing technologies such as LiDAR, RADAR, and hyperspectral imaging have revolutionized biomass estimation by enabling large-scale and high-resolution assessments. Additionally, recent advancements in machine learning, data fusion, and satellite-based monitoring systems are transforming the field, offering unprecedented accuracy and efficiency. By presenting these trends and innovations, this article provides valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, emphasizing the importance of integrating advanced technologies into biomass estimation for sustainable development and climate resilience.

TI  - Rate of forest recovery after fire exclusion on anthropogenic savannas in the Democratic Republic of Congo
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation in the tropics is often followed by the creation of anthropogenic savannas used for animal husbandry. By discontinuing burning regimes, forests may recolonize the savanna and carbon stocks may recover. However, little is known about the success and speed of tropical forest recovery, while such information is vital for a better quantification of efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD +) as well as supporting Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) practices. Therefore, we designed a forest regeneration experiment within a savanna patch in the Mayombe hills (Democratic Republic of Congo), by discontinuing the annual burning regime in an 88 ha exclosure since 2005. 101 permanent inventory plots (40.4 ha) were installed in 2010 and remeasured in 2014. Tree species were classified as savanna or forest specialists. We estimate a forest specialist encroachment rate of 9 stems ha(-1) yr(-1) and a savanna specialist disappearance rate of 16 stems ha(-1) yr(-1). Average diameter of forest specialists did not change due to an increasing influx of recruits, while average diameter of savanna trees increased due to decreasing recruitment. Carbon stored by forest specialists increased from 3.12 to 5.60 Mg C ha(-1), suggesting a forest carbon recovery rate of 0.62 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Using the average carbon stock of 19 nearby mature rainforest plots as a reference, we estimate a total forest carbon recovery time of at least 150 years. The Manzonzi exclosure may potentially become an important reference experiment to quantify REDD + schemes in Central Africa. Furthermore, this natural regeneration experiment demonstrates how carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation can go hand-in-hand. However, more censuses are needed to better quantify the long-term carbon recovery trajectory within the protected area.

TI  - Mega-fires, tipping points and ecosystem services: Managing forests and woodlands in an uncertain future
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global evidence posits that we are on the cusp of fire-driven 'tipping points' in some of the world's most important woody biomes including savannah woodlands, temperate forests, and boreal forests, with consequences of major changes in species dominance and vegetation type. The evidence also suggests that mega-fires are positive feedbacks to changing climates via carbon emissions, and will be responsible for large swings in water yield and quality from temperate forests at the regional scale.Two factors widely considered to have contributed to our current proximity to tipping points are changing climates and human management - the latter most obviously taking the form of allowing fuels to build up, either through policies of fire suppression or failure to implement sufficient fuel reduction fires - to the point where wildfire intensity increases dramatically. Much of the evidence comes from Australia and the USA, but domains such as Africa and the boreal north provide additional insights.Forests adapted to regimes of low-moderate intensity fires may not face the same challenges as the iconic ash forests of Australia and the coniferous forests of Yellowstone or the west coast of the USA that are adapted to high intensity fire. However the often modest physical barriers (including distance, topography and climate) between forests adapted to more frequent, low-moderate intensity fires on the one hand, and less frequent, high intensity fires on the other, are easily overcome by confluences of continually increasing fuel loads and changing climates that serve to increase both fire frequency and intensity.For temperate forests, we can mitigate the extent of large-scale, high intensity fires and their consequences if we carefully use fuel reduction fires and other standard forest management practises such as thinning. Mitigation will require assessing impacts on biodiversity of smaller, low-intensity fires at intervals of 5-10 years (to reduce fuels and mitigate fire size and intensity), against those of large-scale, high intensity wildfires at increasing (but unknown) frequency. Mitigation will require that forests be managed contiguously, not via different agencies with different objectives according to land tenure. Managing requires that governments and the communities they serve acknowledge the limitations of fire-suppression. Mitigating the incidence and effects of large-scale, high intensity fires through embracing the use of managed fire in conjunction with judicious use of fire suppression offers opportunity to avoid potentially large changes in vegetation and biomass (e.g. abundance of dominant species, biodiversity, fuel structure and loads), as well as in water yield and quality and carbon carrying capacity.

TI  - Relationships between biodiversity and carbon stocks in forest ecosystems: a systematic literature review
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - A systematic literature review was conducted to explore the relationships between multiple measures of biodiversity (e.g. species diversity, functional divergence and dominance) and carbon (C) stocks (both aboveground and soil organic) in different forest ecosystems. A total of 47 studies, searched in Web of Science or Knowledge, were selected based on different biodiversity indices, strength of the datasets and particularly focusing on C stocks. The majority of relationships between species diversity or richness and C stocks were positive, while only few were negative. The niche complementarity and the mass ratio hypotheses are the two major hypotheses for explaining the effect of functional diversity on C stocks. These two hypotheses did not contradict each other but reflect the two different sides of functional trait attribute i.e., dominance and divergence. The majority of studies suggested that strong dominance by tall and conservative species, rather than a set of coexisting species with diverse heights and acquisitive role, results in more C stocks in various forest ecosystems. Thus, most of the studies supported mass ratio hypothesis instead of the niche complementarity hypothesis in terms of increasing C stocks in forest ecosystems. We concluded that experimental works in other forest ecosystems have shown that each measure of biodiversity often increases C stocks, although the extent to which direct causal relationships exist between biodiversity and C stocks in subtropical forests are still uncertain. Thus, a little is understood how multiple measures of biodiversity affect C stocks, when also considering the effects of biotic and abiotic components of an ecosystem.

AB  - ContextWestern Chilean Patagonia is an isolated temperate region with an important proportion of intact forest landscapes (IFL) that was subjected to large-scale fires over 60 years ago. However, there is no empirical evaluation of the land cover dynamics to establish the forest loss and recovery, and the effect on the landscape structure and function, and remnant IFL following the fires.ObjectivesThe present study addressed the following questions: (1) What have been the main trends of the land cover dynamics between 1984 and 2018 following earlier fires, and how have these trends shaped the spatial patterns and potential carbon stock of forests in western Patagonia? (2) What proportion of forest landscape remains intact following fires in this region?MethodsWe selected the Coyhaique Province (1,231,910 ha) in western Chilean Patagonia as the study area. Land cover maps for three dates (1984, 2000, 2018) were used to evaluate landscape dynamics after fires. A map of persistence and change occurrence was made to estimate the IFL area over the 1984-2018 period. Landscape metrics were used to assess landscape structure change, and potential carbon stock was estimated based on a literature review.ResultsFollowing fires, the main land cover changes between 1984 and 2018 were loss of similar to 32,600 ha of old-growth forest and a recovery of similar to 69,000 ha of second-growth forest. The increase in second-growth forest area mainly resulted from loss of agricultural cover (similar to 41% of the area). Despite these changes, similar to 61% of the area could potentially remain as IFL after fires. Over the 1984-2018 period, a slight increase in fragmentation of old-growth forest, and a decline in second-growth forest were observed. Coyhaique Province experienced a slight increase (3.6%) in overall potential carbon stock, likely as a result of second-growth forest recovery.ConclusionsOur study provides the first evidence of the western Patagonia landscape state after more than six decades since the large-scale fires. The results provide baseline information on landscape structure and function that could help to make conservation and forest management decisions on specific territory areas.

TI  - LTREB: Legacy effects of compounding disturbances in the Amazon: implications for ecosystem carbon and water cycling
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - The carbon stored in the Amazon���s forests is equivalent to ten years of current global carbon fossil-fuel emissions. This large carbon reservoir has seemingly grown over the past few decades and mitigated some of the negative effects on the global climate system associated with greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, Amazon forests transfer enough moisture to the atmosphere to influence regional precipitation patterns. Interactions between climate change, deforestation, logging, windstorms, and wildfires have threatened the carbon stocks and climate regulatory functions of Amazon forests. Growing concerns that ongoing climate change combined with human disturbances will change Amazon forests into open savannas across large regions. This long term experiment in environmental biology award focuses on a forest that lies at the edge between continuous neotropical forests and savannas. This is an area where native vegetation has been fragmented and is frequently subject to interactions between human and natural disturbances such as fires, droughts, and windstorms. This award evaluates forest resilience from seasonally dry evergreen tropical forests to multiple disturbances based on long- term ecological measurements of a highly threatened Amazon forest. The project���s outcomes could inform regional land and fire management, particularly the development of new strategies to avoid catastrophic wildfires that reduce the capacity of forests to provide ecosystem services. This award will also connect US-based research with researchers and institutions in Brazil, in the process helping to train a diverse group of US students. Finally, the award represents important benchmarks for land surface models and remote sensing techniques that have been widely used to understand potential trajectories of tropical forests This award tests the hypothesis that forests subjected to novel compounding disturbances use different pathways to recover climate services. Disturbed forests that experience minor, short-term reductions in climate functions such as ET and net carbon uptake, have high forest resilience and low probability of large-scale forest replacement by scrubland. However, repeated disturbances triggering long-term losses of forest climate functions would point to low forest resilience. This award will add a decade of ecological data to a long-term, large-scale experimental site in southeast Amazonia that has been degraded by edge effects, recurrent fires, two windthrow events, and multiple droughts. These extended data measurements will permit a comprehensive assessment of how potential future pathways of the experimentally disturbed forests affect ecosystem-level climatic functions across different successional forest pathways and as plant traits change. The experimental site is located in one of the most threatened regions of the Amazon, on the boundary between a dense evergreen rainforest and seasonally dry forests and where native vegetation has been fragmented and subjected to anthropogenic (fire, edge effects) and natural disturbances (droughts and windthrow events). How forests��� long-term climate functions change as a function of novel disturbances and climate change has direct implications for the future of the world���s largest tropical forest. This award will rely on long-term ecological measurements to build a clearer understanding of Amazon forest resilience to multiple disturbances. It will evaluate how interactions between fire legacies to trees (e.g., wounds to tree trunks) and extreme weather events (droughts, windstorms) affect forest climatic functions. In the next ten years, this award will lead to a new understanding of how forest successional pathways and plant traits influence ecosystem-level ET and carbon stocks following compounding disturbances. This award will provide new insights into the (as yet unquantified) thresholds that may lead to large-scale ecosystem change under future climate and land use changes.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

TI  - Assessment and prediction of carbon sequestration using Markov chain and InVEST model in Sariska Tiger Reserve, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Enhancing and conserving carbon pools in vegetation is a major climate change mitigation strategy. The dynamics of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems depend on processes like photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition and combustion, anthropogenic activities like emission of greenhouse gases and climatic variations in rainfall and temperature, and is stored as biomass in different forms. The quantification of biomass is necessary to understand the productivity of forests, carbon sink and source dynamics and recommend ways to aid sequestration through supply side interventions like afforestation and demand side measures that check wood consumption. In this study, carbon sequestration based on the change in total carbon in two different scenarios using Markov chain and InVEST model is evaluated for the years 2000, 2018 and predicted for 2035. The results show that 1.351 Tg carbon has already been lost from 2000 to 2018 in the forest area of Sariska Tiger Reserve and another 0.107 Tg of carbon is expected to be lost in the predicted future, when we compare the land use land cover of the year 2035 with the present scenario. The local communities extract fuel-wood by cutting down tree branches illegally, which leads to carbon loss into the atmosphere. The lower release of carbon in 2035 as compared to 2018 is because of forest management practices e.g., plantations done in the range Tehla-Talabberi, Sariska-Ganeshpura, Alwar buffer-Shoydanpura, Talvriksh-Manavaas, Akbarpur-Kalikhol, Ajabgarh-Jatwana. The study shows that the economic value of carbon lost from 2000 to 2018 is million $ 214.57 and if we see the economic value of the predicted year 2035, carbon sequestration is worth million $ 17.19. Outputs demonstrate the potential for restoration/reforestation and afforestation as the most practical carbon loss mitigation strategy and calls for improved access to cleaner energy sources where the renewable energy industry and government may pitch in.

TI  - Land cover change in low-warming scenarios may enhance the climate role of secondary organic aerosols
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Most socioeconomic pathways compatible with the aims of the Paris Agreement include large changes to land use and land cover. The associated vegetation changes can interact with the atmosphere and climate through numerous mechanisms. One of these is emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), which may lead to the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) and atmospheric chemistry changes. Here, we use a modeling framework to explore potential future global and regional changes in SOA and tropospheric ozone following idealized, large-scale vegetation perturbations, and their resulting radiative forcing (RF). Guided by projections in low-warming scenarios, we modify crop and forest cover, separately, and in concurrence with changes in anthropogenic emissions and CO2 level. We estimate that increasing global forest cover by 30% gives a 37% higher global SOA burden, with a resulting forcing of -0.13 W m(-2). The effect on tropospheric ozone is relatively small. Large SOA burden changes of up to 48% are simulated for South America and Sub-Saharan Africa. Conversely, increasing crop cover at the expense of tropical forest, yields similar changes but of opposite sign. The magnitude of these changes is strongly affected by the concurrent evolution of anthropogenic emissions. Our land cover perturbations are representative of energy crop expansion and afforestation, two key mitigation measures in 1.5 degrees C compatible scenarios. Our results hence indicate that depending on the role of these two in the underlying mitigation strategies, scenarios with similar long-term global temperature levels could lead to opposite effects on SOA. Combined with the complexity of factors that control SOA, this highlights the importance of including BVOC effects in further studies and assessments of climate and air quality mitigation involving the land surface.

TI  - Use of 3-PG and 3-PGS to simulate forest growth dynamics of Australian tropical rainforests - II. An integrated system for modelling forest growth and scenario assessment within the wet tropics bioregion
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional model analyses of forest growth are critical for capturing global aspects of tropical rainforest carbon exchange. This research presents the development of a multi-model approach for assessing forest growth and biomass accumulation within the wet tropics bioregion (WTB) based on 10 years of available data and existing model parameter sets. The Tropical Rainforest Growth (TRG) model system employs the 3-PG and 3-PGS models to account for both old-growth rainforest and forest regeneration from seedlings in response to human-induced and natural disturbances. Above-ground biomass (AGB) stocks of the mature forest throughout the WTB for 2000 were estimated to be similar to 202 t C/ha. Replacement of areas of old-growth with commercial timber plantations decreased overall AGB stocks to approximately 146 t C/ha. However, plantation carbon accumulation rates were higher than the mature rainforest, representing their potential to accumulate more biomass over a longer analysis time period. As tropical cyclones may significantly alter the carbon stocks of old-growth rainforests, the effect of tropical cyclone Rona on the WTB was assessed. The cyclone had a minimal impact on total AGB stocks within the region, yet these systems are an important factor to be considered in carbon and forest regeneration modelling activities in the tropics. The TRG system is an advanced modelling tool providing a rapid process-based assessment of biomass stocks and accumulation dynamics within Australia's tropical rainforest bioregion and has the potential for application in tropical forest ecosystems at both national and international levels.

TI  - Biomass and soil carbon stocks of indigenous agroforestry systems on the south-eastern Rift Valley escarpment, Ethiopia
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass carbon (C) and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in three indigenous agroforestry (AF) systems (Enset [Ensete ventricosum, Musaceae], Enset-Coffee and Fruit-Coffee) practiced on the Rift Valley escarpment of Ethiopia are presented and evaluated. These unique AF systems are characterised by a high proportion and diversity of trees.Data were collected from six smallholdings per AF system. Above- and belowground biomass of trees (fruit and non-fruit), enset and coffee plants were calculated using allometric equations while the biomasses of herbs, litter and fine roots (< 2 cm) were determined by destructive sampling techniques. SOC stocks (0-30 and 30-60 cm) were calculated from measured C contents and bulk density values.Smallholding total biomass C stocks averaged 67 Mg ha(-1) with trees accounting for 39-93 %. Herbs accounted for < 4 % of aboveground biomass. Coffee accounted for 11 % and enset 9 % of total biomass C on average. SOC stocks (0-60 cm) were 109-253 Mg ha(-1) (52-91 % of total C stocks) and uncorrelated to biomass C stocks. Biomass C or SOC stocks did not significantly differ between AF systems but biomass C stocks were significantly correlated to elevation.The C stocks of the three studied AF systems were found to be amongst the highest reported for tropical forests and agroforestry systems. These unique AF systems are therefore well suited to REDD+ projects. However, the C stocks were more determined by individual smallholder management practice than by AF system or climate (elevation).

TI  - Potential for Farmers' Cooperatives to Convert Coffee Husks into Biochar and Promote the Bioeconomy in the North Ecuadorian Amazon
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Featured ApplicationAgricultural wastes generated in farmers' cooperatives constitute valuable resources for the bioeconomy and can be recycled into biochar to contribute to the implementation of economically and environmentally sustainable agricultural production in the forests of the Ecuadorian Amazon.Improving the livelihoods of communities living in fragile ecosystems, such as tropical forests, is among the main strategies to promote their conservation and preserve wildlife. In the Ecuadorian Amazon, farmers' cooperatives are recognized as an important mechanism to improve the socioeconomic conditions of local communities. This study analyzes the integration of pyrolysis processes to convert agricultural waste into biochar as a way to implement the bioeconomy in these organizations. We found that post-harvesting processes in the studied farmers' cooperatives are similar, and coffee husks are a potential feedstock to produce biochar. Although the environmental policies in Ecuador consider the valorization of agricultural waste, we did not find any specific standard to regulate the operation of pyrolysis facilities. Nonetheless, conversion of agricultural waste into biochar can contribute to (i) replacement of subsidized fossil fuels used in drying processes, (ii) prevention of environmental pollution caused by accumulation of waste, (iii) emergence of new income sources linked with the provision of carbon sequestration services, and (iv) the long-term maintenance of soil fertility. Currently, demonstration projects are needed to stimulate collaboration among farmers' cooperatives, academia, the government, international cooperation agencies, and existing forest conservation initiatives.

TI  - Carbon sequestration in the bio-edaphic ecosystem of National Highway-27 in Guwahati, Assam, India
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Vehicular pollution in cities is engendering the need to enhance the sequestration of CO2 through bio-edaphic factors, such as trees and soil. Hence, this pioneering study aimed to analyze the interdependencies of the bioedaphic ecosystem during carbon sequestration on a national highway in Guwahati, Assam, India. To quantify the tree carbon stock, soil physicochemical properties, soil nutrients, bulk density, organic carbon, and soil carbon stock, trees with diameters at breast height (dbh) >= 2 cm and soil samples from different depths (0-15 cm, 15-30 cm, and 30-45 cm) were taken from six areas spread over 36 plots of equal size (2 >= 10 m) arranged in a zig-zag manner. The studied parameters were compared among the different areas. It was found that the tree and soil carbon stock, along with soil nutrients, were greater in the Garchuk-Lokhra area (sample area-4). A significantly strong correlation was observed between the soil carbon stock and the above and below-ground biomass of trees (AGB, r = 0.865; BGB, r = 0.847), which indicated the co-dependencies of the bio-edaphic ecosystem in accumulating carbon. Peltophorum ferrugineum (Decne.) Benth is recommended for planting because it has emerged as a tolerant species and has the greatest carbon storage potential. The bio-edaphic ecosystem of the national highway is now on a carbon-friendly trajectory that follows the UNFCCC guidelines and the REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) strategy. However further research on carbon budgeting is required.

TI  - Specific effects of tree species on soil carbon sequestration in a rice-tree association mesocosm experiment: Evidence from natural <SUP>13</SUP>C abundance
T2  - RHIZOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Within agroforestry systems, trees greatly contribute to soil carbon (C) sequestration. We still know little about how this contribution varies according to tree species. Here, we quantified the soil C content derived from three main tree species, Eucalyptus robusta, Coffea arabica and Citrus clementina, used in rainfed rice-based agroforestry in the Highlands of Madagascar. A fully factorial controlled mesocosm experiment was performed, with seedlings of the tree species planted with or without rice in a Ferralsol. The natural C-13 abundance in the soil was measured to assess tree-and rice-derived C. One year after planting, Eucalyptus robusta was the species exhibiting the highest tree-derived C values, with 148 g C m(-2) on average. In contrast, Citrus clementina transferred only 12 g C m(-2) to the soil. No significant contribution of Coffea arabica to the soil C stock was found. The presence of rice affected neither the growth of tree seedlings nor their abilities to provide C to the soil. The difference in soil C sequestration among tree species was significantly correlated with differential root biomass. Tree root biomass was significantly correlated with soil delta C-13. This experimental assay highlighted the contrasting contributions of tree species to ecological processes such as soil C sequestration at the early stage of agroforestry establishment. Further studies considering tree density and spatial arrangement should be conducted under field conditions to gain further insights into tree contributions to soil C sequestration in agroforestry systems.

TI  - Ghg mitigation potential and cost in tropical forestry - Relative role for agroforestry
T2  - Environment Development and Sustainability
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper summarizes studies of carbon mitigation potential (MP) and costs of forestry options in seven developing countries with a focus on the role of agroforestry. A common methodological approach known as comprehensive mitigation assessment process (COMAP) was used in each study to estimate the potential and costs between 2000 and 2030. The approach requires the projection of baseline and mitigation land-use scenarios derived from the demand for forest products and forestland for other uses such as agriculture and pasture. By using data on estimated carbon sequestration, emission avoidance, costs and benefits, the model enables one to estimate cost effectiveness indicators based on monetary benefit pert C, as well as estimates of total mitigation costs and potential when the activities are implemented at equilibrium level. The results show that about half the MP of 6.9 Gt C (an average of 223 Mt C per year) between 2000 and 2030 in the seven countries could be achieved at a negative cost, and the other half at costs not exceeding dollar sign100 pert C. Negative cost indicates that non-carbon revenue is sufficient to offset direct costs of about half of the options. The agroforestry options analyzed bear a significant proportion of the potential at medium to low cost pert C when compared to other options. The role of agroforestry in these countries varied between 6% and 21% of the MP, though the options are much more cost effective than most due to the low wage or opportunity cost of rural labor. Agroforestry options are attractive due to the large number of people and potential area currently engaged in agriculture, but they pose unique challenges for carbon and cost accounting due to the dispersed nature of agricultural activities in the tropics, as well as specific difficulties arising from requirements for monitoring, verification, leakage assessment and the establishment of credible baselines.

TI  - Data_Sheet_1_Bacuru Droa: Indigenous forest custody as an effective climate change mitigation option. A case study from Darien, Panama.pdf
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data set
AB  - Efforts to naturally remove atmospheric CO2 demand that largely intact forests be maintained. Our inter-cultural research initiative tested the hypothesis that Indigenous custody of the land is compatible with the maintenance of intact forests. Here we combined traditional knowledge, phytolith analysis, remote sensing, and tree inventories to study old-growth forests in Panama's Darien. Phytoliths served to elucidate historical vegetation, remote sensing revealed the current and past Indigenous footprints while tree stature and identity characterised the forest. Until now there has been very little to no human impact within these forests and current Indigenous footprint is both small and stable. Large trees accounted for 13% of trees in the plots that we established. For over half of the species, the measured tree height was taller than previously published maximum heights, leading us to conclude that these forests are a truly exceptional ecological refugium. Noting that the local communities are not rewarded for their custody of these exceptional forests we call to revisit the Good Practice Guidance for Land Use Land Use Change and Forestry to include intact forest land. In the context of sub-optimal carbon finance options, we also propose matching as a methodology that could prove additionality of forest conservation initiatives in climate mitigation portfolios.

TI  - Regional scale variation in forest structure and biomass in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico: Effects of forest disturbance
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aboveground biomass is a key variable in understanding the role of tropical forests in the global carbon cycle. The forests of the Yucatan Peninsula form part of the largest remaining tract of Mesoamerican forests, where the predominant land use is still slash-and-burn agriculture. Previous estimates of aboveground live phytomass of late-successional forests in this region vary almost twofold, but are derived from relatively few forest plots. We estimate aboveground forest biomass using data from 243 inventoried forest plots (totalling 58.5 ha), ranging across a disturbance gradient from nearly intact to severely degraded forests. We assess the effects of environmental and disturbance variables on forest basal area, stand-level wood specific gravity and aboveground biomass. Major differences in basal area and aboveground biomass were explained by levels of human disturbance (clear-cutting, logging, and fire disturbance), whereas edaphic factors played only a minor role. Total mean phytomass density estimates ranged from 28.8 +/- 3.8 mg ha(-1) in plots aged 10-15 years to 191.9 +/- 9.5 mg ha(-1) in undisturbed old-growth forest plots (>50 years). Severe logging and fire disturbance reduced AGB in late- successional plots (30-50 years) by 36% and 37%, respectively. Stand-level wood specific gravity increased with succession, due to an increase in the proportion of total basal area contributed by high wood density genera. Logging intensity had a small additional effect on stand-level wood specific gravity. Incorporating stand-level wood specific gravity into the algorithm explained only an additional 4% of the variation in estimates of aboveground biomass, which was largely determined by basal area. However, ignoring plot-level variation in wood specific gravity resulted in overestimates of 19% in plots aged 10-15 years. Our aboveground biomass estimates were highly comparable with previous studies using the same allometric equations, and fell within the highest range of estimates reported for tropical dry forests. Forest of this region still retains a significant carbon stock, but rates of biomass recovery (2.8 +/- 0.2S.E. mg ha(-1) year(-1)) were low compared to other neotropical forests.

TI  - Pollination partial recovery across monospecific plantations of a native tree (Inga vera, Leguminosae) in the Atlantic forest: Lessons for restoration
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decades several approaches have been adopted for tropical assisted forest restoration from monospecific plantations to the establishment of highly-diverse tree stands. However, the long-term viability of restored forest and their capacity to provide the required services demand continuous evaluation to guide future initiatives. We aimed to evaluate the existence of pollination recovery in monospecific tree plantations in a hyper fragmented landscape of the Atlantic forest in northeast Brazil. By using Inga vera as a model species, we compared several relevant aspects relative to tree reproduction such as reproductive phenology, floral structures, nectar consumption, fruit- and seed-set, between monospecific plantations and native conspecific populations. Populations of I. vera from both native forest stands and planted areas flowered in overlapping periods in the dry season, while fruiting occurred at the beginning of the rainy season. Flowers of planted populations were significantly larger (11% in the size of the calyx, corolla and androecium - staminal tube and filaments) relative to natural populations. Flowers of both planted and natural populations secrete ca. 46 mu l of nectar with concentration of 20.2% and 45.8 mg of sugars throughout the anthesis. However, the average volume of nectar consumed by visitors per flower in planted populations was 30% lower than in natural populations. The frequency of pistils with pollen tubes and the average number of seeds per fruit were similar between natural and planted populations. Nevertheless, surprisingly, the natural fruit set was 49% lower in planted relative to natural populations. Lower consumption of nectar and natural fruit set in planted populations of I. vera, in relation to the natural populations, indicate a partial recovery of the pollination process through the practice of planting single species of a tree in clusters of individuals. Our results add some doubts about the long-term viability and the ability of monospecific plantations in delivering services such as increased pollination capacity in human-modified landscapes.

TI  - Aggregate C depletion by plowing and its restoration by diverse biomass-C inputs under no-till in sub-tropical and tropical regions of Brazil
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Encapsulation of soil organic carbon (SOC) within aggregates is one of the principal mechanisms for long-term C sequestration, macroaggregate formation and stabilization. Our objectives were to quantify the changes in aggregate size distribution, aggregate-C concentrations and stocks upon conversion of native vegetation (NV) to conventional plow-based tillage (CT), and to assess the rate of aggregation and SOC recovery with no-till (NT) under diverse biomass-C inputs. The study was conducted at both sub-tropical (Ponta Grossa - PG, State of Parana) and tropical (Lucas do Rio Verde - LRV, State of Mato Grosso) sites in Brazil. The SOC content under NV was used as a baseline to evaluate the depletion rate under CT and the restoration rate under NT. A specific emphasis was given to the largest macroaggregate size class (8-19 mm) because of its importance to protecting the recently deposited labile SOC. A discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) indicated that NV soil is modified by conversion to an arable land use and that, mechanical tillage, biomass input, and their interactions drastically influence the distribution of aggregate-size classes, aggregation indices, and SOC distribution within aggregates. At both sites, soil aggregation indices were positively impacted by NT and associated with SOC concentration in the labile fractions (e.g., total polysaccharides (TPS), hot water extractable organic C (HWEOC), particulate organic C (POC)). At the PG site, the 8-19 mm aggregate size fraction was significantly affected by land use and tillage treatments and represented 54%, 43%, and 72%, under NV, CT, and NT in 0-20 cm depth, respectively. Furthermore, the 8-19 mm size fraction stored 55%, 45%, and 71% of the total SOC stock under NV (53.8 Mg C ha(-1)), CT (28.5 Mg C ha(-1)) and NT (51.2 Mg C ha(-1)), respectively. At the LRV site, the 8-19 mm aggregate size fraction decreased from 50% under Cerrado NV to 35% under CT, and ranged from 33% to 51% under diverse biomass-C input under NT in 0-20 cm depth. The 8-19 mm size fraction stored 52%, 37%, and 41% of the total SOC stock across all aggregate sizes under NV (25.4 Mg C ha(-1)), CT (11.7 Mg C ha(-1)), and NT (9.9-18.1 Mg C ha(-1)), respectively. The difference in SOC stock among land uses is largely attributed to storage in the 8-19 mm aggregate size class, indicating that NT cropping systems rebuilt the largest macroaggregates, which are crucial for stabilization of SOC.

TI  - Estimating Aboveground Biomass and Carbon Sequestration in Afforestation Areas Using Optical/SAR Data Fusion and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing population and the impacts of climate change present a major challenge to forests, which play a crucial role in regulating the carbon cycle. Pakistan, as a Kyoto Protocol signatory, has implemented afforestation initiatives such as the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) government's Billion Tree Afforestation Project (BTAP). Quantifying the environmental impacts of such initiatives is very important; however, carbon pool data for BTAP plantation regions remain unavailable and are underexplored. This study aims to quantify aboveground biomass (AGB) and carbon sequestration potential (CSP) in the BTAP plantation regions using remote sensing and field data. Random sampling of 310 circular plots (17.84 m radius) provided measurements for tree height and diameter, from which AGB was calculated using allometric equations. Remote sensing data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, combined with polarization rasters and vegetation indices, were used to train and evaluate multiple regression models including multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest regression (RFR). The RFR model outperformed the others (R2 = 0.766) when using combined optical and radar data, yielding a mean AGB of 4.77 t/ha, carbon stock of 2.24 t/ha, and CO2 equivalent of 10.36 t/ha. For BTAP plantations, the total biomass reached 1.19 million tons, with 2.06 million tons of CO2 equivalent sequestered, corresponding to an annual sequestration of 0.47 tC/ha/yr and a potential of 99.18 +/- 15 tC/ha. This research introduces innovative predictive models and a comprehensive carbon assessment framework for afforestation projects, providing critical insights for policymakers and climate change mitigation efforts.

TI  - Forest restoration enhances plant diversity and carbon stock in the sub-tropical forests of western Himalaya
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study we compared the community composition, structure, regeneration status and carbon stock of a human managed arboretum (restoration site) during three decades with a natural forest in western Himalaya. Results reveal that ecological restoration activities in the arboretum enhanced the species richness of woody plants by 66.4% with a total of 125 species as compared to 42 species in natural forest. Similarly, above ground carbon stock in the arboretum was similar to 38% higher (49.5 Mg/ha) as compared to the natural forest (30.8 Mg/ha). Plantation success in the arboretum was similar to 52% with a higher survival rate for temperate and Himalayan native species. Tree density in the arboretum was 322.6/ha with 50% higher density of small girth trees (<50 cm gbh) as compared to the natural forest with a tree density of 184/ha. Similarly, basal area was 41.5% higher in the arboretum (23.8 m(2)/ha) as compared to the natural forest (13.9 m(2)/ha). In case of the ground vegetation layer, shrubs, saplings and seedlings show a density of 23.5, 12.2 and 7.6 individuals/25 m(2) in the arboretum as compared to 10.1, 3.0 and 4.1 individuals/25 m(2) in the natural forest. Hence, our results indicate that the ecological restoration in the sub-tropical forests of the western Himalaya contribute 1.36% annual increment of above ground carbon stock in addition to improvement of the community composition, structure and regeneration in the forest. Therefore, similar institutional restoration projects have ample potential for reducing carbon emissions to mitigate the climate change impact. Such projects will aid in the implementation of the national commitment for REDD+ goals in addition to biodiversity conservation in the Himalaya.

TI  - Delivering win-wins for conservation and production in oil palm plantations: Determining links between habitat restoration, biodiversity, and yield
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Oil palm is currently grown across more than 18 million hectares of the tropics. It has the highest yield per hectare of all vegetable oil crops, and therefore forms a critical component of global food security. However, the expansion of the industry has driven large-scale loss of tropical forest, and associated declines in biodiversity and increases in carbon emissions. To minimise the environmental impacts and maximise the food security benefits of palm oil production, plantation management needs to maximise yield per hectare, but minimise negative impacts on the environment. An essential requirement for long term sustainability is to find options for ecological intensification - supporying biodiversity that delivers yield benefits within plantations. Within this, finding ways to manage plantations to maximise delivery of pest control, pollination, and healthy soil dynamics is likely to be key. Although agronomic approaches for delivering these functions are well developed by the oil palm industry, there has been little investigation of the role that biodiversity plays in these, or ways that oil palm landscapes can be managed to support ecosystem services and yield. Based within an established research programme in industrial oil palm plantations in Riau, Indonesia (the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function in Tropical Agriculture (BEFTA) Programme), this project will consider the effect of plantation management practices on delivery of key yield-supporting ecosystem functions. Working in close collaboration with oil palm industry scientists from the Sinar Mas Agro Resources and Technology Research Institute (SMARTRI), the student will travel to Indonesia to collect field-based data from a series of well-established experimental sites in which large-scale manipulations of understory vegetation complexity and tree planting have been conducted. Data collection by the student could include a range of management options, taxa, and ecosystem functions, depending on the interests of the student. As well as offering a variety of options for new field-based data collection, the well-established field sites also offer an exciting opportunity to link with >8 years of existing data sets. Available data include information on environmental conditions, biodiversity, rates of ecosystem functions, and yield. Through this highly collaborative, fieldwork- and data-based approach, the student will develop skills in tropical ecology, agronomy, experimental design, data collection, and statistical analyses, as well as developing awareness and understanding of the oil palm industry. Results from this project will give valuable new insights into landscape-scale management options for delivery of ecosystem functions and maximising yield in oil palm systems. This will not only provide novel insights into the ecological dynamics of human-modified systems, but also bring substantial sustainability and food security benefits. Through our strong existing collaborations with SMARTRI and IPB University, and oil palm sustainability organisations such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), findings from the project will be shared directly with growers and policy makers, to deliver important bioscience evidence for increased sustainability of agriculture and food security

TI  - Anthropogenic disturbance of tropical forests threatens pollination services to acai palm in the Amazon river delta
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. The acai palm Euterpe oleracea Mart. in the Amazon river delta has seen rapid expansion to meet increased demand for its fruit. This has been achieved by transforming lowland forest habitats (floodplains) into simplified agroforests and intensive plantation in upland areas. As acai palm makes an important contribution to the economy and food security of local communities, identifying management approaches that support biodiversity and ecosystem processes that underpin fruit production on acai farms is essential.2. We compared flower-visitor communities and acai fruit production in floodplain forests and upland plantations, across gradients of local management intensity (i.e. acai density per ha) and surrounding forest cover. The relative contribution of biotic pollination and degree of pollen limitation were assessed using insect exclusion and hand-pollination experiments.3. We found that acai flower visitors are highly diverse (c. 200 distinct taxa) and had variable responses to disturbance. Bee visitation was higher in floodplains and positively related to surrounding forest cover, but other flower visitors, including specialised curculionid beetles, were unresponsive to changes in surrounding forest cover. However, intensive management practices (i.e. high acai palm densities) in floodplains and uplands had contrasting effects on flower-visitor communities, with flower-visitor richness being lower on intensively managed floodplain farms and ant densities being higher on intensive upland farms.4. Pollination experiments revealed acai palm to be highly dependent on biotic pollination. Fruit set in open-pollinated inflorescences was positively related to flower-visitor richness and specialised curculionid beetle visitation, whereas the presence of ants on inflorescences had a negative effect.5. Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that pollinators are essential for acai fruit production, but that intensive farming practices have eroded the relationship between surrounding forest cover and ecosystem function in floodplains (i.e. conversion of native forest into simplified agroforests) and increased the frequency of antagonistic interactions in uplands (e.g. high ant densities). These findings underline the value of extensive management practices, such as the maintenance of other tree species within farms and adjacent unmanaged forest patches, to ensure the long-term sustainability of acai fruit production in the Amazon river delta.

TI  - Newton Fund: Novel strategies for the recovery of deforested and degraded landscapes in the Amazon region: sustainable energy-food-water services
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Enhancing food, fibre and fuel production to meet growing demand while preserving the integrity of natural ecosystems and their capacity to deliver key services, requires the widespread adoption of sustainable land use practices. The Brazilian Amazon comprises one third of the world's tropical forests and sustains 13% of the world's biota but is experiencing extensive deforestation. Around 8% of forests have been converted to other land uses with an unknown area modified by selective logging, edge effects, surface fires, and hunting. Traditional farming involves 'slash-and-burn' cultivation (for rice, cassava, maize and beans) a practice which depletes soils of nutrients so land is abandoned and new areas exploited. Population growth has placed greater demands on soil (via shorter fallow periods) and forest resources encouraging the growth of environmentally unsustainable meat and milk production practices. Planted and abandoned pastures account for 80% of all cleared lands thus there is urgent need to establish sustainable management strategies to protect ecosystem services and arrest the increase in degraded and exploited environments. Issues faced by Amazonian communities are not solely agricultural; water and energy services are virtually non-existent. Although the Amazon region is rich in natural resources, local populations are economically poor. Water is available throughout the year; however, the quantity and quality varies considerably depending on river water levels and in the dry season, family members, primarily women and children, have to walk for hours to fetch water. Communities are typically isolated from the electric grid with a lack of energy services. Bioenergy technologies such as biomass gasification are attractive in this context since they can provide energy services (via syngas for heat, power and electricity) and biochar which is nutrient-rich and can be used to improve soils, enhance crop growth and nurture sustainable agriculture. Biochar improves soil water use efficiency (retaining soil moisture for crop growth) and can be used as a filter to remove pollutants from drinking water. Biochar may also induce systemic defence against crop pathogens and may be of fundamental importance in terms of food production.    The focus of this international research partnership is to develop innovative, appropriate, sustainable waste and residue-fuelled energy systems which enhance delivery of food, water and energy services. The environmental benefits of these 'waste to energy' systems (diminished atmospheric pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, nutrient recovery, wastewater cleanup) will be examined to provide coupled energy-environment services which benefit all end-users. If residues can efficiently be converted into syngas this will provide an alternative resource for the replacement of unsustainable fossil fuels. Using our multidisciplinary expertise we will investigate the potential of wastes and residues to develop affordable and sustainable energy-water-soil-crop systems. Recent interest in the potential of regional biomass such as waste timber and acai seeds (Euterpe oleracea) for energy services shows potential but little research has been undertaken to assess the added-value benefits of these energy services within a food-water-energy nexus approach.

AB  - Assessing carbon sequestration by measuring above ground and below ground biomass with non destructive method is globally acknowledged. The studies from forest ecosystem have made a significant contribution in quantifying carbon stock. This type of study has now gaining importance in urban ecosystems. Most of the institutions and universities have natural forest and manmade plantations are now assessing carbon stocks in India and elsewhere. In the present study Kuvempu university campus which is a part of Central Western Ghats was assessed. The total area of the campus covers 326.21 acres with dry deciduous forest of Bhadra tiger reserve. A total of 5596 individuals were recorded with a carbon stock of 457.0 t ha(-1) and the dominant Terminalia paniculata contributed a total of 13% of carbon stock. The storing capacity varies with species diversity, disturbance gradient and phenology. This pilot study has made an attempt in advertising the present area in global carbon stock assessment. Therefore, every educational institutions/universities can easily contribute to global CO2 mitigation by restoring the native species in their campus and even it supports biodiversity and helps in future long term monitoring.

TI  - COST AND PERFORMANCE OF CO2 STORAGE IN FORESTRY PROJECTS
T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to include forestry projects in a possible CO2 emission reduction regime, and to compare the costs of individual projects or national programs, it is necessary to determine the rate of equivalency between carbon in fossil fuel emissions and carbon stored in different types of forestry projects. This paper presents a comprehensive and consistent methodology to account for the costs and carbon flows of different categories of forestry projects and describes the application of the methodology to a set of projects in Central America. Several estimates have been made to date of the overall potential for carbon storage through global reforestation and the costs of such efforts, based on global macroeconomic estimates and extrapolations from current forest-sector experience. However, there has yet to be a consistent analysis of the magnitude and cost of carbon savings by a "bottom-up" approach to sustainable forestry development This methodology is applied to a set of projects proposed in Costa Rica and other Central American countries under the Tropical Forest Action Plan, to estimate a sample set of national CO2 reduction cost curves. The costs of carbon savings in the forestry projects studied in Central America mostly fall between $5 and $13 ton-C1, depending on the type of project, the climate, and the opportunity cost of land. These projects also promise socio-economic benefits at the local level, provided they are adequately endowed with funding, training and institutional support. The total amount of CO2 storage potential is significant, about 100 million tons per country, but not enough to suggest that forestry can offset more than a few percent of global CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use.

TI  - Evaluation of aerial biomass accumulation and ecological sustainability in Amazonian forests: a case study of the Cotococha community
T2  - REVISTA CUBANA DE CIENCIAS FORESTALES
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazonian tropical forests have an enormous variety of species and are recognized for their great biodiversity and carbon sequestration, but they are threatened by anthropogenic pressure from land use change. Therefore, the objective of this research was to evaluate the accumulated aerial biomass and ecological sustainability of an Amazonian forest in the Cotococha community. Five 0.1 ha transects (10 x 100 m) separated at 100 m intervals were established and all tree species were recorded with D-1.30 >= 10 cm. Ecological indicators were evaluated based on vegetation, soil, biodiversity and productivity. Aerial biomass was estimated using allometric equations and the biomass importance value index (BIVF) was determined. The families Melastomataceae, Fabaceae, Euphorbiaceae and Salicaceae presented the highest number of species. The distribution of diameter classes showed an inverted J trend. The ecological su stainability diagnosis showed that not all indicators reach the sustainability threshold. An area biomass of 78.67 +/- 5.87 Mg ha(-1) and a carbon stock of 39.33 +/- 2.34 Mg ha(-1) were reported. The three families with the highest BIVF were Melastomataceae with 38.43, Annonaceae with 24.36 and Meliaceae with 22.69 These families could be recommended for restoration programs within the community, due to their high potential to accumulate aerial biomass and carbon stock, contributing to a management that allows them to improve and reach the threshold of sustainability in all ecological indicators.

TI  - Land use/land cover change-induced greenhouse gas emissions in the global biosphere reserve of tropical Afromontane forest
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) change is a prominent problem and source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in tropical forests. However, little to no evidence is available on the contribution of biosphere reserves to reversing LULC change trajectories and reducing GHG emissions, particularly in tropical Afromontane forests. The objective of this study was to quantify the LULC changeinduced GHG emissions from 1999 to 2020 in tropical Afromontane forests that were designated the Sheka Forest Biosphere Reserve (SFBR) by the MAB program of UNESCO in 2012. The IPCC Tier 1 approach was used to estimate GHG emissions. The results showed that the aggregated GHG emissions were 0.4 tonnes of CO2e ha � 1 yr � 1 in 1999, while they climbed to 1.46 tonnes of CO2e ha-1 yr � 1 in 2010 and 5.2 tonnes of CO2e ha � 1 yr � 1 in 2020. Deforestation and forest degradation, the expansion of cropland, the development of tea plantations, settlement expansion, and the forest degradation of wetlands contributed to increased emissions by 40.4%, 32.2%, 17.6%, 8.3%, and 1.5% in 2010 and by 60%, 20%, 5.2%, 14.4%, and 0.33% in 2020, respectively. As a result, compared to 9.03 tonnes of CO2e ha � 1 yr � 1 in 1999, the overall GHG mitigation potential of the SFBR decreased by 12.6% in 2010 and 40.2% in 2020. The findings suggest that the SFBR's capacity to reduce GHG emissions was neither enhanced nor maintained by its designation as a forest biosphere reserve. Therefore, regularly monitoring the effectiveness of interventions and reconciling conflicting land use priorities would be essential for maintaining Afromontane forests and reducing GHG emissions. Promoting tree planting, afforestation, reforestation, and restoring degraded forest landscapes would play a vital role to minimize GHG emissions and enhance the mitigation potential of the ecosystem.

TI  - Matrix dominance and landscape resistance affect genetic variability and differentiation of an Atlantic Forest pioneer tree
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Despite the importance of secondary forests for the maintenance of biodiversity, the impact of pioneer trees on habitat loss and fragmentation is poorly understood. Objectives We analyzed the effects of landscape structure on genetic variability (node level analyses) and genetic differentiation (link level analyses) of the pioneer tree Cecropia hololeuca in the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil. At the node level, we analyzed the effects of landscape structure (forest and pasture amount, compositional heterogeneity, number and shape of patches, and matrix dominance), topography (slope and elevation), and effective population size (Ne) on allelic richness (AR), genetic diversity (He) and inbreeding coefficient (f). At the link level, we analyzed the effect of four resistance surfaces (isolation by geographic distance, land cover, elevation, and slope) on genetic differentiation between populations (F-ST, G'(ST), Jost's D). Methods We genotyped 257 individuals of C. hololeuca using eight microsatellite loci. At the node level, we calculated landscape and topographic variables at six spatial scales. At the link level, we optimized the resistance surfaces using ResistanceGA. We used a model selection approach to select the most parsimonious models. Results At the node level, matrices dominated by pastures had higher AR than landscapes dominated by Eucalyptus at the 1500 m spatial scale. At the link level, F-ST was best explained by slope, with lower values imposing more resistance. All resistance surfaces explained G'(ST). Conclusions In addition to conserving and restoring habitats, management practices that improve matrix permeability should be adopted to favor the movement of dispersers, consequently improving natural regeneration, increasing allelic richness, and decreasing genetic differentiation of natural populations.

TI  - Revealing the spatial variation in biomass uptake rates of Brazil's secondary forests
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is essential for quantifying the carbon cycle and mitigating climate change. Tropical secondary forests are significant carbon sinks that sequester large amounts of carbon dioxide. While recent studies have attempted to estimate the AGB recovery rates in tropical forests, considerable uncertainty remains in the estimation of AGB recovery of secondary forests and the spatial variability of the effects that different environmental conditions and degrees of human use may have on AGB recovery. These knowledge gaps hinder further understanding of climate change mitigation potential of secondary forests. Remote sensing products provide spatially and temporally explicit information for understanding and monitoring secondary forest dynamics. To explore the local effects of different factors on AGB of secondary forests in Brazil, we used geographically weighted regression (GWR) models that account for spatial heterogeneity in geospatial data to estimate the AGB of secondary forests in Brazil. Secondary forest areas (29142 polygons) were extracted from Brazil's forest age maps between 1984 and 2019. The AGB of these areas was derived from the Climate Change Initiative Biomass maps. The effects of selected predictors such as forest age, climatic water deficit, the cation exchange capacity of soil and surrounding tree cover were analyzed. The two most influential factors, forest age and surrounding tree cover were utilized to estimate the AGB and the recovery rates per year. Our results show the high spatial variation of different predictors' effects on the AGB of secondary forests. Also, the GWR model (with an adjusted R2 of 0.74) showed considerable improvements regarding "goodness of fit" of models compared with the Ordinary Least Squares (with an adjusted R2 of 0.53). Our estimated average AGB recovery rate across all Brazil's biomes is 7.5 Mg ha -1 yr- 1 (using forest age) for the first 20 years. We presented the map of the spatial variation of AGB recovery rates in Brazil. The estimated AGB recovery rates range using forest age is 28.9 Mg ha -1 yr- 1. Our estimated mean AGB recovery rates of different biomes are 17.7 % on average higher than IPCC default rates. Our results provide baseline information for reducing uncertainties related to carbon sink estimation of secondary forests in Brazil, hence assisting in developing sustainable forest management and ecosystem restoration strategies.

TI  - Indigenous Sacred Forests as a Tool for Climate Change Mitigation: Lessons from Gedeo Community, Southern Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sacred forests are patches of remnant natural forests, protected through social laws by the local communities near their villages and are always dedicated to cultural purposes. They are playing a significant role in combating climate change and informal enhancing biodiversity conservation. The aim of this study was to estimate carbon stocks of sacred forests by quantifying the aboveground biomass (AGB), and belowground (BGB) carbon of trees. The estimation of carbon stocks was conducted across the three sacred forests of Bolocho sacred forest (BSF), Ejjerissa sacred forest (ESF), and Amba sacred forest (ASF). A total of 30 plots: 10 BSF, 10 ESF, and 10 ASF were sampled and trees with DBH >= 5 cm and a height of >= 3 m was considered for biomass-carbon determination. We compared tree biomass, carbon stocks, stem densities, basal area, and importance value index of trees. Nondestructive methods of woody species biomass measurement was used by using allometric equations developed for application in tropical forests and/ or agroforestry system. A total of 4216 individuals representing 87 different species and 44 families were recorded. Statistical the highest stem density was recorded. Total biomass considered as AGB+BGB, which is highest for ASF followed by ESF and BSF (one way ANOVA, F = 98.66, df, 2, p < .001). The estimated amount of AGB across the three sacred forests were (505 Mg ha(-1)), (267 Mg ha(-1)) and (202 Mg ha(-1)) in ASF, ESF, and BSF, respectively. Total biomass stored, both aboveground and belowground (AGB+BGB) significantly higher for ASF (637 Mg ha(-1)) followed by ESF (338 Mg ha(-1)) and BSF (255 Mg ha(-1)). Total biomass carbon (C) was 318.5 Mg C ha(-1) for ASF, 169 Mg C ha(-1) for ESF, and 127.5 Mg C ha(-1) for BSF. From the present study, it can be concluded that, sacred forests and indigenous way of forest protection has playing an enormous roles in carbon sequestration. Perhaps it could be accepted as best practices in climate change (CC) mitigation and reducing deforestation. Hence, it needs urge calls for an immediate attention for conservation, protections and documentation of indigenous knowledge.

TI  - A Novel Method of Boreal Zone Reforestation/Afforestation Estimation Using PALSAR-1,2 and Landsat-5,8 Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, global remote sensing studies of tropical forest parameters are relevant for assessing carbon sequestration, whereas boreal forests receive little attention. This is due to the current idea that forests with greater aboveground biomass absorb more carbon. However, new research indicates that rapidly growing young forests take up more carbon than mature ones. Therefore, it is necessary to develop universal methods of remote reforestation/afforestation monitoring. The existing reforestation methods rely on the separate analysis of multispectral optical images and radar data. Here, we propose a method for analyzing the joint dynamics of NDVI (or the Normalized Burn Ratio, NBR) and the radar vegetation index (RVI) on a 2D plot for a test reforestation site. NDVI and NBR time series were derived from Landsat-5,8 data, and the RVI was derived from ALOS-1,2 and PALSAR-1,2 for 2007-2020 using the resources of Google Earth Engine. The quantitative parameters to evaluate the degree of reforestation and changes in the species composition of young trees have been suggested. The suggested method enables a more thorough evaluation of reforestation by measuring the coupled dynamics of the projective cover of young trees and aboveground biomass.

AB  - The present study was conducted in Solan Forest Division of Himachal Pradesh covering an area of about 57,158 ha. The aim was to estimate and assess the temporal change in carbon stock of the Chil Working Circle, in two forest ranges of the Division, Solan and Dharampur, over the period of 1956-2011. The inventory data of the working plans of Solan Forest Division from 1956-1957, 1984-1985 and 2002-2003 were used in the present study while field data for biomass estimation was collected for the year 2011. The results showed a declining trend in carbon stock over 1956-1984 period, however, an increasing trend over 1984-2002 was observed, which showed a further increase for the period 2002-2011. These fluctuating trends in the forest carbon stock can be related to increasing anthropogenic pressure on forests and the subsequent introduction of a ban on green felling envisaging efficient forest management, both of which affect the forest carbon pool significantly.

TI  - Divergent patterns and determinants of resistance and resilience in short and tall forests across global drylands
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests play a crucial role in mitigating climate change, and global afforestation initiatives are in full swing, with drylands having great potential for afforestation. However, many dryland afforestation projects lead to short forests with significantly lower canopy height than their typical height. Meanwhile, the potentially increasing probability of drought threatens short forests and their tall counterparts. Yet, it remains largely unclear whether these short forests respond differently to drought compared to tall forests. Here, we used the K-means clustering method to classify global dryland forests into short and tall forests. We found significant differences in drought resistance and resilience between short and tall forests, with tall forests demonstrating higher resistance and short forests having higher resilience. Furthermore, our study indicated that in severe and extreme drought conditions, resistance and resilience of short forests were more likely influenced by climatic factors than tall forests, which were more likely affected by soil factors. These findings suggest that climatic monitoring should be intensified for short forests, and post-drought management should be strengthened for tall forests to enhance their persistence under climate change.

TI  - Collaborative Research: Links Between Long-Term Soil Carbon Storage and Canopy Properties in Tropical Forests
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) has been increasing, leading to changes in Earth's climate, but it is unclear how much of that CO2 can be drawn back down by the planet's ecosystems and stored in soils and plants. This project focuses on understanding that CO2 draw-down and storage process with particular focus on tropical forests, which are one of the most carbon-rich ecosystems on Earth. New space technologies have recently improved the ability to measure plant carbon storage using satellite remote sensing. However, a large proportion of carbon storage occurs in soils, where dead plant material can be stored for much longer periods than in live plants. This study uses new remote sensing technologies and field-based measurements to link plant and soil carbon storage. The project integrates these two types of measurements through a new predictive framework to broaden understanding across space and time. Broader impacts for this project include the training of several undergraduate students and a graduate student (UCLA) in cutting-edge geographic and ecological technologies, and creation of a Field Technician Training Program for Latin American college students and community members to expand the work force in science and technology. At the broad scale, this research will also improve predictability of carbon storage across tropical forest ecosystems, providing insights for management of carbon sequestration.Soil carbon (C) dynamics present one of the largest sources of uncertainty in global C cycle models, with tropical forest soils containing some of the largest terrestrial C stocks. The interactions between aboveground C uptake by plants, transfer of this C to the forest floor, and subsequent loss or storage of this C in soils must be better understood to predict how climate change may alter large-scale and long-term soil C storage. This research will advance understanding of humid and seasonal tropical biomes through the intersection of modeling, remote sensing, and in situ field measurements across geological and rainfall gradients, focusing on the links between canopy and soil properties. The research will include measures of the total fluxes of C into forests using remote sensing measures of canopy fluorescence, and use these measures, together with knowledge of geology and soil nutrients, to predict soil C storage. The central hypothesis is that: Spatial variation in canopy properties, which reflect geology and the availability of scarce soil nutrients, are directly linked to landscape-scale patterns of long-term soil C storage in tropical forests. Soil phosphorus, rainfall, and canopy species composition will be assessed for their roles in driving soil C storage. The approach spans scales from nanometer organo-mineral associations in soils, to 3 km2 measures of forest plant growth. The study will be conducted in a variety of tropical forests in Panama in collaboration with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. To better understand how tropical forests around the world store carbon, beyond the spatial and temporal scales of the field study, measures will also be integrated into an existing ecosystem model.

TI  - Expert review of the science underlying nature-based climate solutions
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Viable nature-based climate solutions (NbCS) are needed to achieve climate goals expressed in international agreements like the Paris Accord. Many NbCS pathways have strong scientific foundations and can deliver meaningful climate benefits but effective mitigation is undermined by pathways with less scientific certainty. Here we couple an extensive literature review with an expert elicitation on 43 pathways and find that at present the most used pathways, such as tropical forest conservation, have a solid scientific basis for mitigation. However, the experts suggested that some pathways, many with carbon credit eligibility and market activity, remain uncertain in terms of their climate mitigation efficacy. Sources of uncertainty include incomplete GHG measurement and accounting. We recommend focusing on resolving those uncertainties before broadly scaling implementation of those pathways in quantitative emission or sequestration mitigation plans. If appropriate, those pathways should be supported for their cobenefits, such as biodiversity and food security.Nature-based climate solutions are widely incorporated into climate change mitigation plans and need firm scientific foundations. Through literature review and expert elicitation, this analysis shows that for some major pathways there is strong support, while for others their efficacy remains uncertain.

TI  - The effects of the invasive species, Lantana camara, on regeneration of an African rainforest
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Invasive plants adversely affect native communities by altering ecosystem function and disrupting natural regeneration. We investigate the effect of invasive Lantana camara L. (Verbenaceae) on forest regeneration in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We appraise the efficacy of cutting and uprooting Lantana for promoting native tree recruitment. Sample plots comprised three types: (i) currently invaded by Lantana; (ii) cleared of Lantana and now managed; and (iii) forest reference plots uninvaded by Lantana. Tree species numbering 51, 19 shrubs, and 17 herb species were identified. Lantana reduced tree, shrub, and herb cover and diversity, and suppressed tree regeneration. The short-term management of Lantana did not promote tree establishment. The tree community in cleared areas was not converging on uninvaded adjacent forest. Lantana is known to allelopathically suppress tree seedling establishment, but even at sites cleared of Lantana, tree species recruitment was poor. While insufficient time may have passed for tree recruitment, we argue that an increase in shrub and herb cover and diversity arrested forest tree regeneration. Sustained follow-up clearing of dense secondary shrubs and herbs and resprouted L. camara in cleared areas is key to ensuring long-term recovery of the forest tree community.

TI  - Comparing forest structure and biodiversity on private and public land: secondary tropical dry forests in Costa Rica
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary forests constitute a substantial proportion of tropical forestlands. These forests occur on both public and private lands and different underlying environmental variables and management regimes may affect post-abandonment successional processes and resultant forest structure and biodiversity. We examined whether differences in ownership led to differences in forest structure, tree diversity, and tree species composition across a gradient of soil fertility and forest age. We collected soil samples and surveyed all trees in 82 public and 66 private 0.1-ha forest plots arrayed across forest age and soil gradients in Guanacaste, Costa Rica. We found that soil fertility appeared to drive the spatial structure of public vs. private ownership; public conservation lands appeared to be non-randomly located on areas of lower soil fertility. On private lands, areas of crops/pasture appeared to be non-randomly located on higher soil fertility areas while forests occupied areas of lower soil fertility. We found that forest structure and tree species diversity did not differ significantly between public and private ownership. However, public and private forests differed in tree species composition: 11 percent were more prevalent in public forest and 7 percent were more prevalent in private forest. Swietenia macrophylla, Cedrela odorata, and Astronium graveolens were more prevalent in public forests likely because public forests provide stronger protection for these highly prized timber species. Guazuma ulmifolia was the most abundant tree in private forests likely because this species is widely consumed and dispersed by cattle. Furthermore, some compositional differences appear to result from soil fertility differences due to non-random placement of public and private land holdings with respect to soil fertility. Land ownership creates a distinctive species composition signature that is likely the result of differences in soil fertility and management between the ownership types. Both biophysical and social variables should be considered to advance understanding of tropical secondary forest structure and biodiversity.Resumen Los bosques secundarios constituyen una proporcion importante de las tierras forestales tropicales. Dichos bosques se encuentran en tierras de propiedad publica y privada, las cuales son sujetas a diferentes formas de manejo, afectando asi el proceso de sucesion de los bosques. Este proceso ocurre durante un periodo posterior al abandonado de las tierras y afecta la estructura forestal y biodiversidad resultante. Examinamos si las diferencias en cuanto a posesion y manejo de tierras, generan desigualdad en la estructura del bosque, biodiversidad y composicion a traves de un gradiente de fertilidad en el suelo y de edad del bosque. Colectamos muestras de suelo e hicimos un estudio de todos los arboles con un diametro a la altura del pecho a 10cm en 66 parcelas forestales privadas de 0.1-ha, colocadas a lo largo de areas con diferentes edades de bosque y gradientes de fertilidad de suelo, con la finalidad de comparar los datos colectados en este estudio con la base de datos existente de 82 parceles forestales de tierras publicas en bosques secos forestales en Guanacaste, Costa Rica. Nuestros hallazgos sugieren que la fertilidad del suelo parece dirigir la estructura espacial de bosques de propiedad publica vs. privada; las tierras destinadas a la conservacion que son de propiedad publica, parecen localizarse de forma no aleatoria en suelos menos fertiles. En tierras de propiedad privada, las areas destinadas al pastoreo y cultivo parecen localizarse de forma no aleatoria en suelos mas fertiles, mientras que los bosques ocupan tierras menos fertiles. Encontramos que la estructura metrica integrada de los bosques y la biodiversidad no difieren significativamente entre las tierras publicas y privadas. Sin embargo, los bosques publicos y privados difieren en su composicion de especies de arboles. De un total de166 especies, 11 por ciento fueron mas prevalentes en bosques publicos, 7 por ciento mas prevalentes en bosques privados, 32 por ciento no exhibieron parcialidad en cuanto a su distribucion, y 49 por ciento eran muy raras como para ser clasificadas. Las especies de madera popular Swietenia macrophylla, Cedrela odorata, y Astronium graveolens fueron mas prevalentes en bosques publicos, mientras que Guazuma ulmifolia, una especie ampliamente consumida y dispersada por ganado, fue mas abundante en los bosques privados. Sugerimos que la diferencia en cuanto abundancia de la madera popular y G. ulmifolia puedo haber sido el resultado de la tala selectiva y dispersion por ganado. Ademas, algunas diferencias en composicion floral parecen ser el producto de disimilitud en cuanto a la fertilidad del suelo, debido a una seleccion no aleatoria de fertilidad del suelo en tierras publicas y privadas. Existen pocas comparaciones entre bosques secundarios tropicales de propiedad publica y privada. Sin embargo, el entendimiento de estas diferencias es clave: la extension de los bosques secundarios esta incrementandose sistematicamente en conjunto con la disminucion de los bosques maduros, y los bosques secundarios usualmente se regeneran en pastizales o tierras agricolas de propiedad privada.

TI  - Carbon storage and sequestration of re-growing montane forests in southern Ecuador
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The storage and sequestration of carbon by tropical montane forests is poorly understood. We quantified the above-ground biomass (AGB) storage in secondary tropical montane forests in southern Ecuador. The AGB in older secondary (>40 years old) forest was found to be 158 +/- 38 Mg ha(-1) of land surface at 1000 m elevation and 104 +/- 25 Mg ha(-1) of land surface at 2250 m elevation. This is less than the storage reported in a recent synthesis of AGB observations in mature tropical montane forests, potentially due to a legacy of selective logging within our study sites. The slope angle resulted in AGB being 1.5-10% greater when reported on a planimetric compared to land surface area basis. We also quantified AGB in areas of abandoned pasture where grazing and fire had been excluded. Pasture that had been recently abandoned (12 years) stored 2-18 Mg ha(-1) of AGB with the higher values due to the presence of relict trees. Regrowing secondary forests, established through natural regeneration, accumulated AGB at a rate of 10 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) at 1000 m elevation and 4 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) at 2250 m elevation, for the first 5-7 years after pasture abandonment. After 12-15 years, accumulation of AGB slowed to 1-2 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1). Net biomass accumulation rates were similar to those observed in lowland humid tropical forests, suggesting that regenerating tropical montane forests provide an important carbon sequestration. In newly regenerating forests, small trees (DBH < 10 cm) contributed up to 50% of total AGB. In the older secondary forest at high elevation coarse dead wood contributed 34% of total AGB.

TI  - A systematic map of within-plantation oil palm management practices reveals a rapidly growing but patchy evidence base
T2  - PLOS SUSTAINABILITY AND TRANSFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Although oil palm expansion has had severe environmental impacts, oil palm also has the highest yield per hectare of any vegetable oil crop. Compared to many other crops, it has the potential to support high complexity habitats, with minimal chemical input, and relatively high levels of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. However, there has been little synthesis of available research on oil palm management strategies to support delivery of more sustainable cultivation. In this paper, we provide a systematic map compiling all available evidence assessing within-plantation oil palm management practices at the cultivation stage, with a focus on practices that affect biodiversity and environmental processes. Using approaches adapted from systematic review protocols, we catalogued oil palm management publications to provide details of geographic location, year, interventions tested (i.e. agricultural practices), targeted outcomes of interventions, co-occurrences between different interventions and outcomes (including multiple outcomes), and study design. Most studies were conducted in Southeast Asia, with fewer studies conducted in South America or Africa. Twenty-six interventions were observed in the literature, across six categories: soil, understory, within-crop, landscape-level, replanting, and mixed/multiple interventions. The most common interventions tested were landscape-scale interventions, such as maintaining forest fragments/buffer zones, whereas interventions involved in replanting were the least researched. Eight outcomes were considered: soil fertility, soil erosion, water quality and availability, pest control, replanting, maintenance of biodiversity and areas of high conservation value, and reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Studies researching biodiversity were the most common, whereas comparatively few studies considered replanting and reducing emissions. Most primary studies were observational, with experimental studies being rarer, especially in biodiversity research. We match our findings to the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil's environmental sustainability criteria to illustrate how policy- makers and producers may use our map to access evidence supporting cultivation-stage oil palm sustainability management. This study provides valuable information to inform best management practices and direction for necessary future research.

TI  - UNDERSTANDING AND SCALING VULNERABILITY OF NEOTROPICAL AMAZON AND TRANSITIONAL FORESTS TO ALTERED FIRE REGIMES
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - SUMMARY The Amazon is the most important biome of South America, harbouring extraordinarily high levels of biodiversity and providing important ecosystems services. This biome is particularly notable for evolving independently from fire and in a moist, warm climate. In recent decades, altered fire regimes and an increasingly hotter and drier climate has pushed this key biome towards ecological thresholds that will likely lead to major losses in biodiversity and ecosystem services. Similarly, the ecotonal forests at the Amazon-Cerrado transition are unique ecosystems in terms of form and function, but they may be the first to suffer large-scale tree mortality and species loss due to the combined effects of increased anthropogenic disturbance, altered fire regimes and a drier climate.  Vulnerability of fire and droughts are closely intertwined in Amazonian and transitional forests because fires in this region only occur when there is water stress and a human ignition source. Thus, drought increases vulnerability to fire, but we do not yet understand the magnitude and spatial variation of these vulnerabilities. Once a forest burns there is immediate tree mortality, but recent evidence also shows a significant time-lagged mortality that can last for decades, becoming an important carbon source. However, the mechanistic processes that lead to time-lagged tree mortality in this myriad of forest ecosystems encompassing the Amazon biome and the Amazon-Cerrado transition are still poorly understood. We also lack knowledge on how these processes might vary spatially across the biome and its transition. A better understanding of the mechanisms that lead to tree mortality after fires and droughts is needed to design future policies that emphasise nature-based solutions including restoration and natural regeneration.  This proposal presents a multi-level approach that aims at deciphering the mechanisms that underly vulnerability to fire and time-lagged post-fire mortality across the tropical forests in Amazon and Amazon-Cerrado transition. To achieve this aim, we will quantify fire vulnerability at three different scales and link them through an upscaling approach. First, we will identify the ecological mechanisms, reflected through functional traits, that explain why individuals and species die after fires occur. For this, we will focus on poorly understood traits that can be related to fire and/or hydraulic functioning. Second, at the community scale, we will examine how vegetation structure, community traits and microclimate affect the probability to burn, through an intensive characterisation of different vegetation types with multispectral and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) imagery. Third, we will use our our unique ground-dataset on functional traits, vegetation structure and moisture dynamics, and the latest state-of-art remotely sensed information on structure and water stress to predict the vulnerability of the Amazon forests and Amazon-Cerrado transitional forests. This information will be directly applicable for the detection of sensitive hotspots (areas particularly vulnerable to fire) through satellite products. We will deliver quantifiable early-warning metrics of ecosystem vulnerability to fire that can be mapped and incorporated into fire management policies.  This is a revised version of a NERC proposal that was rejected with a score of 7 by the NERC Panel in July 2020, and we have carefully addressed the Panel's comments. Specifically, we have clarified the methodology and we have reformulated the hypotheses, so they address vulnerability to fire and not drought fire-interactions.

TI  - Land Use Change on Coffee Farms in Southern Guatemala and its Environmental Consequences
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in commodity prices, such as the fall in coffee prices from 2000 to 2004, affect land use decisions on farms, and the environmental services they provide. A survey of 50 farms showed a 35 % loss in the area under coffee between 2000 and 2004 below 700 m with the majority of this area (64 %) being coffee agroforest systems that included native forest species. Loss of coffee only occurred on large and medium-scale farms; there was no change in area on cooperatives. Coffee productivity declined below 1,100 m altitude for sun and Inga shade coffee, but only below 700 m altitude for agroforest coffee. Coffee productivity was 37-53 % lower under agroforests than other systems. Increases in rubber and pasture were related to low altitude large-scale farms, and bananas and timber plantations to mid-altitude farms. Average aboveground carbon stocks for coffee agroforests of 39 t C ha(-1) was similar to rubber plantations, but one-third to one half that of natural forest and timber plantations, respectively. Coffee agroforests had the highest native tree diversity of the productive systems (7-12 species ha(-1)) but lower than natural forest (31 species ha(-1)). Conversion of coffee agroforest to other land uses always led to a reduction in the quality of habitat for native biodiversity, especially avian, but was concentrated among certain farm types. Sustaining coffee agroforests for biodiversity conservation would require targeted interventions such as direct payments or market incentives specifically for biodiversity.

TI  - Soil Carbon and Nutrient Dynamics Following Cessation of Anthropogenic Disturbances in Degraded Subtropical Forests
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil carbon (C) and nutrient availability is fundamental to terrestrial biodiversity and functionality. In recent decades, the restoration of degraded forests has become a major concern worldwide, and recent studies have demonstrated that soil C and nitrogen (N) increase over time following restoration. However, our understanding of the responses of soil phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), potassium (K) and magnesium (Mg) and elemental stoichiometric ratios to restoration remains elusive. We employed a chronosequence to examine the responses of C and macronutrients in three soil layers (0-10cm, 10-20cm and 20-30cm) to the time (0 to 31years) since the cessation of anthropogenic disturbances in the degraded subtropical forests of Eastern China. We found that stand basal area, soil water content, organic matter content and C concentration and stock increased, while soil pH and bulk density decreased over time, with the most pronounced effects within the 0-10cm layer. Total and available N and K as well as available P and total Mg increased, while total P in the 20-30cm layer and Ca in all soil layers decreased over time. The mass concentration ratios of soil C to total N and available N, P and K decreased, whereas those for C to total P and Ca as well as total N to total P and available N to available P increased over time. Our results suggest that soil C accumulation and biologically driven nutrients increase, while nutrients that are driven primarily through geochemical mechanisms decrease with live biomass accumulation following restoration.

TI  - Organic matter decomposition and associated microbial communities in wetlands: insights from tropical and subtropical Melaleuca forests in Australia
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are characterised by soils rich in organic matter that accumulate carbon, providing an important pathway for carbon dioxide sequestration. Nevertheless, not all the carbon fixed can be accumulated, and a proportion will decompose through microbial consumption and be partly released into the atmosphere. Rates of organic matter decomposition in tropical wetlands and the factors associated with this process are scarce. We conducted a 2-year field study in three Melaleuca wetlands in tropical and subtropical Australia using standardised tea litter substrates (green-labile and rooibos-recalcitrant) to measure organic matter decomposition and the microbial communities associated with this process. Decomposition rates were 4-fold higher in labile litter, which was low in carbon: nitrogen, compared to recalcitrant litter. The prokaryotic communities associated with the decomposing litter were unique at each site and different from the soil. They contained taxonomic groups adapted to anaerobic, high temperatures, acidic conditions and suggestive of slow anaerobic turnover. Microbial communities changed as decomposition progressed, with the latter characterised by taxa with cellulose-degrading functions. The decomposition of recalcitrant organic matter within Melaleuca soils was relatively slow, with half of the organic matter inputs remaining after two years, supporting long-term carbon sequestration.

TI  - Synergy between land use and climate change increases future fire risk in Amazon forests
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests have been a permanent feature of the Amazon basin for at least 55 million years, yet climate change and land use threaten the forest's future over the next century. Understory forest fires, which are common under the current climate in frontier forests, may accelerate Amazon forest losses from climate-driven dieback and deforestation. Far from land use frontiers, scarce fire ignitions and high moisture levels preclude significant burning, yet projected climate and land use changes may increase fire activity in these remote regions. Here, we used a fire model specifically parameterized for Amazon understory fires to examine the interactions between anthropogenic activities and climate under current and projected conditions. In a scenario of low mitigation efforts with substantial land use expansion and climate change - Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 - projected understory fires increase in frequency and duration, burning 4-28 times more forest in 2080-2100 than during 1990-2010. In contrast, active climate mitigation and land use contraction in RCP4.5 constrain the projected increase in fire activity to 0.9-5.4 times contemporary burned area. Importantly, if climate mitigation is not successful, land use contraction alone is very effective under low to moderate climate change, but does little to reduce fire activity under the most severe climate projections. These results underscore the potential for a fire-driven transformation of Amazon forests if recent regional policies for forest conservation are not paired with global efforts to mitigate climate change.

TI  - Conversion of tropical moist forest into cacao agroforest: consequences for carbon pools and annual C sequestration
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests store a large part of the terrestrial carbon and play a key role in the global carbon (C) cycle. In parts of Southeast Asia, conversion of natural forest to cacao agroforestry systems is an important driver of deforestation, resulting in C losses from biomass and soil to the atmosphere. This case study from Sulawesi, Indonesia, compares natural forest with nearby shaded cacao agroforests for all major above and belowground biomass C pools (n = 6 plots) and net primary production (n = 3 plots). Total biomass (above- and belowground to 250 cm soil depth) in the forest (approx. 150 Mg C ha(-1)) was more than eight times higher than in the agroforest (19 Mg C ha(-1)). Total net primary production (NPP, above- and belowground) was larger in the forest than in the agroforest (approx. 29 vs. 20 Mg dry matter (DM) ha(-1) year(-1)), while wood increment was twice as high in the forest (approx. 6 vs. 3 Mg DM ha(-1) year(-1)). The SOC pools to 250 cm depth amounted to 134 and 78 Mg C ha(-1) in the forest and agroforest stands, respectively. Replacement of tropical moist forest by cacao agroforest reduces the biomass C pool by approximately 130 Mg C ha(-1); another 50 Mg C ha(-1) may be released from the soil. Further, the replacement of forest by cacao agroforest also results in a 70-80 % decrease of the annual C sequestration potential due to a significantly smaller stem increment.

TI  - Age, extent and carbon storage of the central Congo Basin peatland complex
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands are carbon-rich ecosystems that cover just three per cent of Earth's land surface(1), but store one-third of soil carbon(2). Peat soils are formed by the build-up of partially decomposed organic matter under waterlogged anoxic conditions. Most peat is found in cool climatic regions where unimpeded decomposition is slower, but deposits are also found under some tropical swamp forests(2,3). Here we present field measurements from one of the world's most extensive regions of swamp forest, the Cuvette Centrale depression in the central Congo Basin(4). We find extensive peat deposits beneath the swamp forest vegetation (peat defined as material with an organic matter content of at least 65 per cent to a depth of at least 0.3 metres). Radiocarbon dates indicate that peat began accumulating from about 10,600 years ago, coincident with the onset of more humid conditions in central Africa at the beginning of the Holocene(5). The peatlands occupy large interfluvial basins, and seem to be largely rain-fed and ombrotrophic-like (of low nutrient status) systems. Although the peat layer is relatively shallow (with a maximum depth of 5.9 metres and a median depth of 2.0 metres), by combining in situ and remotely sensed data, we estimate the area of peat to be approximately 145,500 square kilometres (95 per cent confidence interval of 131,900-156,400 square kilometres), making the Cuvette Centrale the most extensive peatland complex in the tropics. This area is more than five times the maximum possible area reported for the Congo Basin in a recent synthesis of pantropical peat extent(2). We estimate that the peatlands store approximately 30.6 petagrams (30.6 x 10(15) grams) of carbon belowground (95 per cent confidence interval of 6.3-46.8 petagrams of carbon)-a quantity that is similar to the above-ground carbon stocks of the tropical forests of the entire Congo Basin(6). Our result for the Cuvette Centrale increases the best estimate of global tropical peatland carbon stocks by 36 per cent, to 104.7 petagrams of carbon (minimum estimate of 69.6 petagrams of carbon; maximum estimate of 129.8 petagrams of carbon(2)). This stored carbon is vulnerable to land-use change and any future reduction in precipitation(7,8).

TI  - Climate change mitigation policy in Ecuador: Effects of land-use competition and transaction costs
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper develops an econometric model to estimate the economic determinants of forest land conversion in Esmeraldas, Ecuador and evaluates the effect that transaction costs have on incentive-based climate change mitigation activities. Using a logistic share model, the results show a high extent of competition for the use of land between agricultural production for palm oil processing and land-based carbon mitigation through avoided emissions from deforestation. Our results show that the current policy of introducing conservation payments in Ecuador is not sufficient to significantly reduce deforestation, but that payment levels based on a plausible international carbon price would make an appreciable difference in the net sequestration contribution of forests in northern Ecuador. Knowledge generated from this research can inform site-specific land use policy design aimed at addressing the opportunity costs of tropical forest conservation as an important component of climate mitigation strategies.

TI  - Close-to-nature management of tropical timber plantations is economically viable and provides biodiversity benefits
T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reforestation of tropical forests is crucial to mitigate the climate crisis and restore ecosystems. However, past efforts have been criticized for establishing monoculture timber plantations with exotic tree species. Close-to-nature (CTN) practices aim to minimize negative forest management impacts on forests ecosystems by mimicking natural dynamics. So far, CTN management practices are rarely applied in tropical plantation forestry. This study evaluates the economic, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity potential of CTN management in tropical mixed-species plantations in Central America using a simulation-optimization approach. To our knowledge, this study is the first to assess the potential of tropical CTN-managed plantations on the basis of detailed process-based forest growth simulations. CTN practices such as selective harvesting, retention forestry, and shelterwood cutting of mixed-species stands were compared to even-aged mixtures and conventional monoculture practices. Results showed that CTN management was economically viable for certain species mixtures and management practices at an 8 % discount rate and had the potential to increase carbon storage and biodiversity in the modeled plantations. At current carbon prices, CTN-managed plantations may only become financially competitive with monocultures, if monocultures are excluded from carbon certification schemes that increasingly aim at co-producing non-carbon benefits like biodiversity conservation. If carbon prices increase, the sale of carbon credits could finance the transformation of monocultures to CTN-managed mixed-species stands. The competitiveness of CTN management could also be improved through performance-based biodiversity payments, such as the sale of biodiversity credits.

TI  - Image3_Carbon storage and sequestration in Southeast Asian urban clusters under future land cover change scenarios (2015-2050).TIFF
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data set
AB  - Land-use land-cover (LULC) changes are occurring rapidly in Southeast Asia (SEA), generally associated with population growth, economic development and competing demands for land. Land cover change is one of the vital factors affecting carbon dynamics and emissions. SEA is an important region to study urban-caused LULC emissions and the potential for nature-based solutions (NBS) and nature climate solutions (NCS), as it is home to nearly 15% of the worlds tropical forests and has some of the worlds fastest rates of urban growth. We present a fine-scale urban cluster level assessment for SEA of current (2015) and future (2050) scenarios for carbon sequestration service and climate mitigation potential. We identified 956 urban clusters distributed across 11 countries of SEA. Considering the urban expansion projected and decline in forests, this region could see a carbon loss of up to 0.11 Gigatonnes (Scenario SSP4 RCP 3.4). Comparing carbon change values to urban emissions, we found that the average offset value ranging from 2% (Scenario SSP1 RCP 2.6) to 21%. We also found that a few medium and large urban clusters could add to more than double the existing carbon emissions in 2050 in the SSP3 and SSP4 RCP 3.4 scenarios, while a minority of clusters could offset their emissions under SSP1. Our study confirms that NCS, and particularly reforestation, are in many cases able to offset the direct emissions from land cover conversion from SEA urban clusters. Hence, documenting the plausible LULC transitions and the associated impacts gains significance in the SEA region as the results can be useful for informing policy and sustainable land management.

TI  - The first report of composition and occurrence of myxomycete assemblages in protected and unprotected plantation forests: a comparative study in Thai Nguyen City, Northern Vietnam
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and aims - In spite of the cosmopolitan distributions of myxomycetes, relatively few studies have been conducted in subtropical forests of Southeast Asia particularly in Northern Vietnam, where comprehensive reports of myxomycetes are lacking up to this date. Hence. a rapid biodiversity assessment was conducted in protected and unprotected plantation forests of Thai Nguyen City to compare the species composition of myxomycete communities between the two different forest management types.Methods - A total of 360 substrate samples were haphazardly collected within 5 m x 5 m plots established within three protected and three unprotected forests. The moist chamber cultures prepared from these samples were regularly checked for myxomycete fructifications over a period of 12 weeks. Analyses of diversity (species richness) and community composition were performed using the software EstimateS and the vegan package in R.Key results - The study yielded a total of 505 records representing 54 species belonging to 17 genera. All species recorded herein were new records for Northern Vietnam:, among them five were new for the entire country. The rarefaction curves showed higher numbers of myxomycete species to be expected for protected forest (43.0) in comparison to unprotected forests (39.4). However, calculations of species diversity indices showed higher values in unprotected forest than in protected forest. The species composition between the two forest types showed clear overlaps with many shared (56%) species.Conclusions - Forest conservation strategies do not affect freely dispersing myxomycetes implicating that spore dispersal of myxomycetes is caused not only by natural factors but also by anthropogenic activities. The production of high number of myxomycete species for this study seems to point out that the subtropical forests of Vietnam harbours many undiscovered myxomycete species for Southeast Asia.

TI  - CARBON MITIGATION SCENARIOS FOR MEXICAN FORESTS - METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND RESULTS
T2  - INTERCIENCIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines three future scenarios for carbon emissions and sequestration in Mexican forests. The first is a Reference scenario that incorporates low and high emission estimates derived from different assumptions of deforestation rates in Mexico; the second is a Policy scenario that incorporates seven carbon mitigation options for reducing future net car bon emissions from the forest sector; and the third is a Technical Potential scenario that shows the maximum technically-feasible carbon sequestration achievable in Mexican forests by the year 2030. A consistent method for estimating the net unit carbon sequestration associated with different carbon mitigation options in the forest sector provides the basis for estimating the carbon implications of the different scenarios. The study suggests that cumulative carbon sequestration ranges from 2.2 to 4.4 gigatons of cal bon (GtonC) by the year 2030, depending on the scenario. Realizing this carbon sequestration potential could significantly offset emissions from the energy sector. Management of native temperate and tropical forests, and restoration of degraded forest lands, particularly when linked to energy plantations, offer the most promising alternatives for carbon sequestration.

TI  - Carbon Storage and Land-Use Strategies in Agricultural Landscapes across Three Continents
T2  - CURRENT BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The loss of carbon stocks through agricultural landuse change is a key driver of greenhouse gas emissions [1-4], and the methods used to manage agricultural landwill havemajor impacts on the global climate in the 21 st century [4-9]. It remains unresolvedwhether carbon losses would be minimized by increasing farm yields and limiting the conversion of natural habitats (''landsparing''), ormaximizingon-farmcarbonstocks, even at the costof reduced yields andtherefore greater habitat clearance (''landsharing''). In thispaper, weuse field surveys of over 11,000 trees, in-depth interviews with farmers, and existing agricultural data, to evaluate the potential impacts of these contrastingapproaches, and plausible intermediate strategies, on aboveground carbon stocks across a diverse range of agricultural and natural systems. Our analyses include agroforestry and oil palm plantations in the humid tropics of Ghana; cattle ranching in dry tropical forest in Mexico; and arable cropping in temperate wetlands and forests in Poland. Strikingly, despite the range of systems investigated, land sparing consistently had a higher potential to sustain regional above-ground carbon stocks than any other strategy. This was the case in all three regions and at all plausible levels of food production, including falls in demand. However, if agricultural production increases to meet likely future demand levels, we project large decreases in aboveground carbon stocks, regardless of land-use strategy. Our results strongly suggest that maintaining above-ground carbon stocks will depend on both limiting future food demand and minimizing agricultural expansion through linking high-yield farming with conserving or restoring natural habitats.

M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - This project focuses on the process of secondary forest regeneration following agricultural abandonment. Current independent studies conducted in Central Amazonia (Manaus, Brazil), northeastern Costa Rica, and Chiapas, Mexico reveal that observed vegetation changes within forests often deviate from predictions based on single-time studies of forests of different age since abandonment. This project unites four existing projects in wet tropical forests of Latin America. Coordinated annual vegetation censuses in long-term study plots will be conducted to test specific chronosequence predictions for a range of dependent variables including stem density, size distributions, basal area, biomass, species richness, species composition, and life-form composition. Observed rates of change in dependent variables will be compared with predicted rates from chronosequence studies within each region, based on the best-fit statistical models. By understanding how stand-level dynamics conform to or deviate from overall chronosequence patterns within each of these regions, the researchers will identify key ecological factors, processes, and mechanisms that influence successional pathways. The long-term data gathered will provide essential information to guide forest restoration, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity conservation in the Neotropics. Ultimately, results from the study will enable development of more predictive and more widely applied models of successional vegetation dynamics in today's complex tropical landscapes.

TI  - Phylogenetic patterns of Atlantic forest restoration communities are mainly driven by stochastic, dispersal related factors
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Phylogenetic ecology complements trait-based analysis on community assembly by considering that species are not independent units but are related to each other by their evolutionary history. Phylogenetic patterns clustered when there are more close relatives than expected by chance or overdispersed with less close relatives than expected. Patterns among species in a community indicate underlying biotic and abiotic processes acting on species functional traits. However, phylogenetic ecology has seldom been applied to forest restoration. We used floristic and abundance data from six forest restoration sites of different ages and four old-growth reference forests in the Brazilian Atlantic forest to evaluate similarities in phylogenetic patterns between restoration and reference forests as a measure of restoration success. The presence of an initial tree canopy in restoration forests conducted by planting species increases seed dispersal. Nevertheless, we expected random phylogenetic patterns early in restoration due to dispersal limitation in a highly fragmented landscape. As time since planting increases and in reference forests, we expected less of an effect of dispersal on community composition and more of an effect of negative biotic interactions among close relatives to lead to overdispersed patterns. We did not find a clear trajectory showing that restoration sites would resemble the phylogenetic patterns of reference sites with age since planting. We found significant clustering patterns in two sites, the oldest restoration site and one reference forest. The other reference forests showed, non-significant yet clustering tendencies. The functional traits studied were less conserved than expected by chance, therefore, we cannot relate clustering to be solely the result of environmental filters leading to the presence of close relatives with similar habitat requirements. The presence of closely related species in the Meliaceae family in reference forests and in the oldest restoration site, which was next to a forest remnant, points toward dispersal as the main factor driving phylogenetic patterns in the sites studied. Despite the use of a high number of planted species, differences in the composition of planted species among sites also affected the observed phylogenetic structure. We believe that phylogenetic ecology complements floristic studies by providing information on trait conservatism and shedding light on community assembly processes that affect the successional trajectory of restoration forest.

TI  - A systematic review on the aboveground biomass and carbon stocks of Indian forest ecosystems
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Tropical forests play a crucial role as source and sink in global carbon cycle. Development and other anthropogenic activities have led to degradation of forest land, and ultimately, it results in loss of biodiversity and increases concentration of CO2 in atmospheres. Therefore, there is urgent need to estimate regional and national level carbon stock for making forest-based policies and strategies for mitigation of CO2. Patchy and sporadic information is available on biomass and carbon stock of Indian forests. The paper presents a systematic review and comprehensive account of studies conducted in different forest types in India.Result: There are six major forest types found in India consisting of 15 groups and other subgroups with peculiar characteristics. Methodologies used by researchers for biomass/carbon stock estimation are destructive, nondestructive, tree inventories data, species-specific biomass estimation, and remote sensing. Majority of estimates are based on nondestructive allometric equation approach. Studies showed positive correlation between tree species, diameter at breast height, and biomass/carbon stock. Small-and medium-sized growing trees, invasive species, mixed forest, Agroforestry, and Agrosilviculture also play an important role in atmospheric carbon assimilation. The results of diverse forest carbon stock studies are broadly categorized in North, Central, and Southern India. Present review will be helpful for developing conservation policies and decision to increase carbon stock and also REDD+ program for particular forest ecosystem.Conclusion: The systematic literature review was carried out to gather and summarize information from different studies conducted on forest ecosystems and quantification methods used for biomass estimation and carbon stock in different forests types and states of India. In general, great variability occurs in aboveground biomass and carbon stock on account of climatic and geographic differences. To obtain good and accurate estimations, following nondestructive approach, species-specific density-based equations are required from different habitats and also in relation to degradation status of forests. As such regional volume equations would increase error of estimations. The comprehensive account of data would be helpful to formulate strategies based on carbon sequestration in Indian forests for CO2 mitigation.

TI  - Table2_Carbon storage and sequestration in Southeast Asian urban clusters under future land cover change scenarios (2015-2050).DOCX
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data set
AB  - Land-use land-cover (LULC) changes are occurring rapidly in Southeast Asia (SEA), generally associated with population growth, economic development and competing demands for land. Land cover change is one of the vital factors affecting carbon dynamics and emissions. SEA is an important region to study urban-caused LULC emissions and the potential for nature-based solutions (NBS) and nature climate solutions (NCS), as it is home to nearly 15% of the worlds tropical forests and has some of the worlds fastest rates of urban growth. We present a fine-scale urban cluster level assessment for SEA of current (2015) and future (2050) scenarios for carbon sequestration service and climate mitigation potential. We identified 956 urban clusters distributed across 11 countries of SEA. Considering the urban expansion projected and decline in forests, this region could see a carbon loss of up to 0.11 Gigatonnes (Scenario SSP4 RCP 3.4). Comparing carbon change values to urban emissions, we found that the average offset value ranging from 2% (Scenario SSP1 RCP 2.6) to 21%. We also found that a few medium and large urban clusters could add to more than double the existing carbon emissions in 2050 in the SSP3 and SSP4 RCP 3.4 scenarios, while a minority of clusters could offset their emissions under SSP1. Our study confirms that NCS, and particularly reforestation, are in many cases able to offset the direct emissions from land cover conversion from SEA urban clusters. Hence, documenting the plausible LULC transitions and the associated impacts gains significance in the SEA region as the results can be useful for informing policy and sustainable land management.

TI  - Sparing land for secondary forest regeneration protects more tropical biodiversity than land sharing in cattle farming landscapes
T2  - CURRENT BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Effectively managing farming to meet food demand is vital for the future of biodiversity.(1,2) Increasing yields on existing farmland can allow the abandonment (sparing) of low-yielding areas that subsequently recover as secondary forest.(2-5) A key question is whether such "secondary sparing" conserves biodiversity more effectively than retaining wildlife-friendly habitat within farmland ("land sharing"). Focusing on the Colombian Choco-Andes, a global hotspot of threatened biodiversity,(6) and on cattle farming, we examined the outcomes of secondary sparing and land sharing via simulated scenarios that maintained constant landscape-wide production and equal within-pasture yield: (1) for species and functional diversity of dung beetles and birds; (2) for avian phylogenetic diversity; and (3) across different stages of secondary forest regeneration, relative to spared primary forests. Sparing older secondary forests (15-30 years recovery) promotes substantial species, functional, and phylogenetic (birds only) diversity benefits for birds and dung beetles compared to land sharing. Species of conservation concern had higher occupancy estimates under land-sparing compared to land-sharing scenarios. Spared secondary forests accumulated equivalent diversity to primary forests for dung beetles within 15 years and within 15-30 years for birds, highlighting the need for longer term protection to maximize the biodiversity gains of secondary sparing. Promoting the recovery and protection of large expanses of secondary forests under the land-sparing model provides a critical mechanism for protecting tropical biodiversity, with important implications for concurrently assisting in the delivery of global targets to restore 350 million hectares of forested landscapes.(7,8)

TI  - Carbon sequestration via wood burial.
T2  - Carbon balance and management
M3  - Journal Article
AB  -  To mitigate global climate change, a portfolio of strategies will be needed to keep the atmospheric CO2 concentration below a dangerous level. Here a carbon sequestration strategy is proposed in which certain dead or live trees are harvested via collection or selective cutting, then buried in trenches or stowed away in above-ground shelters. The largely anaerobic condition under a sufficiently thick layer of soil will prevent the decomposition of the buried wood. Because a large flux of CO2 is constantly being assimilated into the world's forests via photosynthesis, cutting off its return pathway to the atmosphere forms an effective carbon sink.It is estimated that a sustainable long-term carbon sequestration potential for wood burial is 10 +/- 5 GtC y-1, and currently about 65 GtC is on the world's forest floors in the form of coarse woody debris suitable for burial. The potential is largest in tropical forests (4.2 GtC y-1), followed by temperate (3.7 GtC y-1) and boreal forests (2.1 GtC y-1). Burying wood has other benefits including minimizing CO2 source from deforestation, extending the lifetime of reforestation carbon sink, and reducing fire danger. There are possible environmental impacts such as nutrient lock-up which nevertheless appears manageable, but other concerns and factors will likely set a limit so that only part of the full potential can be realized.Based on data from North American logging industry, the cost for wood burial is estimated to be $14/tCO2($50/tC), lower than the typical cost for power plant CO2 capture with geological storage. The cost for carbon sequestration with wood burial is low because CO2 is removed from the atmosphere by the natural process of photosynthesis at little cost. The technique is low tech, distributed, easy to monitor, safe, and reversible, thus an attractive option for large-scale implementation in a world-wide carbon market.

TI  - Thinning Effects on the Tree Height-Diameter Allometry of Masson Pine (Pinus massoniana Lamb.)
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The stem height-diameter allometric relationship is fundamental in determining forest and ecosystem structures as well as in estimating tree volume, biomass, and carbon stocks. Understanding the effects of silvicultural practices on tree height-diameter allometry is necessary for sustainable forest management, though the impact of measures such as thinning on the allometric relationship remain understudied. In the present study, the effects of thinning on tree height-diameter allometry were evaluated using Masson pine height and diameter growth data from a plantation experiment that included unthinned and thinned treatments with different intensities. To determine whether thinning altered the height-diameter allometry rhythm, the optimal height-diameter model was identified and dummy variable methods were used to investigate the differences among model parameters for different thinning treatments. Periodic (annual) allometric coefficients were calculated based on height and diameter increment data and were modeled using the generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) to further illustrate the response of tree height-diameter allometry to different thinning treatments over time. Significant differences were detected among the parameters of the optimal height-diameter model (power function) for different thinning treatments, which indicated that the pattern of the height-diameter allometry relationship of Masson pine was indeed altered by thinning treatments. Results also indicated a nonlinear trend in the allometric relationship through time which was significantly affected by thinning. The height-diameter allometric coefficient exhibited a unimodal convex bell curve with time in unthinned plots, and thinning significantly interfered with the original trend of the height-diameter allometric coefficient. Thinning caused trees to increase diameter growth at the expense of height growth, resulting in a decrease of the ratio of tree height to diameter, and this trend was more obvious as the thinning intensity increased.

TI  - Data from: Limited biomass recovery from gold mining in Amazonian forests
T2  - Dryad
M3  - Data set
AB  - Gold mining has rapidly increased across the Amazon Basin in recent years, especially in the Guiana shield, where it is responsible for >90% of total deforestation. However, the ability of forests to recover from gold mining activities remains largely unquantified. Forest inventory plots were installed on recently abandoned mines in two major mining regions in Guyana, and re-censused 18 months later, to provide the first ground-based quantification of gold mining impacts on Amazon forest biomass recovery. We found that woody biomass recovery rates on abandoned mining pits and tailing ponds are amongst the lowest ever recorded for tropical forests, with close to no woodybiomass recovery after 3-4 years. On the overburden sites (i.e. areas not mined but where excavated soil is deposited), however, aboveground biomass recovery rates (0.4 - 3.5 Mg ha-1yr-1) were within the range of those recorded in other secondary forests across the Neotropics following abandonment of pastures and agricultural lands. Our results suggest that forest recovery is more strongly limited by severe mining-induced depletion of soil nutrients, especially nitrogen, than by mercury contamination, due to slowing of growth in nutrient-stripped soils. We estimate that the slow recovery rates in mining pits and ponds currently reduce carbon sequestration across Amazonian secondary forests by ~21,000 t C yr-1, compared to the carbon that would have accumulated following more traditional land uses such as agriculture or pasture. Synthesis and applications. To achieve large-scale restoration targets, Guyana and other Amazonian countries will be challenged to remediate previously mined lands. The recovery process is highly dependent on nitrogen availability rather than mercury contamination, affecting woody biomass regrowth. The significant recovery in overburden zones indicates that one potential active remediation strategy to promote biomass recovery may be to back-fill mining pits and ponds with excavated soil. Plots were installed in two central gold mining areas in Guyana, namely Mahdia (5°16'0.01"N 59°08'60.00"W) and Puruni (6°00'0.00"N 59°11'60.00"W), from January to March, 2016, and re-censused approximately 18 months (June to August, 2017) later. Both sites are currently mined by artisanal and small-scale miners. At each study site, measurement plots were established on previously mined vegetation patches, ranging in age from 0.6 to 3 years since abandonment of mining activity at the time of establishment. Nine 0.25 ha (50 m x 50 m) plots and a control old-growth forest plot (100 m x 100 m) were established at each location. However, approximately half of all plots (five in Mahdia and four in Puruni) were re-mined before the 2017 re-census and thus were excluded in this study. Each plot was positioned to include all three mining zones, i.e. the mining pit, the mine tailings and the overburden. Within each plot and within each mining zone, three nested subplots of 3m x 3m and 1m x 1m were established. All trees >2 cm DBH (diameter at reference height of 1.3m) were measured and tagged with a unique number in the larger 0.25 ha plot and identified to species level where possible. All tree saplings 25-200 cm tall and all tree seedlings 5-25 cm tall were identified and counted in the 3m x 3m and 1m x 1m subplots respectively. Nested subplots were also established in the 1-ha control plot, where all trees >10 cm DBH were measured and recorded and standard RAINFOR protocols applied to map, measure and identify trees (Phillips, Baker, Feldpausch, & Brienen, 2015). Tree species in all plots were identified by a local botanist. Heights of larger trees were measured using a laser rangefinder, whereas a tape measure was used to measure the height of saplings and seedlings. In the re-census in 2017, the diameter of all individuals still standing from the first census was re-measured, along with all new recruits >2 cm DBH in each 0.25 ha plot and >25 cm and >5 cm tall in our nested 3m x 3m and 1m x 1m subplots respectively. Trees not present in the second census but present in the first census were assumed to have died. Vouchers were only collected for non-woody species which were unknown and logged at the Centre for Biodiversity, University of Guyana. This dataset contains plot data for abandoned gold mining sites in Guyana (Mahdia and Puruni) along with respective coordinates, description of header titles and vegetation to bareland cover ratio.Highlighted plots were sites which were not re-mined in 2017 (Census II) and therefore used in the analysis of the paper. Data for control plots at both Mahdia and Puruni were deposited within the ForestPlots.net/RAINFOR network (https://www.forestplots.net).

TI  - Estimation of carbon stock under different management regimes of tropical forest in the Terai Arc Landscape, Nepal
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon (C) stocks in the forests of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) participating countries have to be estimated and monitored to determine accurate financial incentives and compensation. The research estimated the distribution of C stock across the different pools and management regimes of tropical Sal forest in the Terai Arc Landscape of Nepal. It applied a field measurement-based forest inventory method combined with the best predictive allometric model available, to increase accuracy and precision. Shrub and litter C were estimated by destructive method and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) up to a depth of 30 cm. Biomass data and samples were collected from 113 plots distributed throughout four different management regimes on 1.1 million ha of forest in the landscape. The estimated average C stock in aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, shrub, litter, SOC and total were 105.58 +/- 17.05, 24.92 +/- 4.15, 0.23 +/- 0.06, 1.49 +/- 0.25, 96.53 +/- 8.76 and 228.76 +/- 19.61 Mg ha(-1) respectively. The mass of total C stock varied from 291.55 +/- 42.51 Mg ha(-1) in protected areas to 237.15 +/- 32.54 Mg ha(-1) in community forests to 189.16 +/- 26.46 Mg ha(-1) in government-managed forests and to 126.76 +/- 56.36 Mg ha(-1) in other forests. These estimates of carbon stocks differed from earlier estimates based on biome-average datasets. They are consistent with those from similar forest type and site-specific earlier studies. Evidence of strong association of C stock with management regime provides valuable information for policy makers to make informed choice of management regime for the landscape. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Theory and application of medium-term successional dynamics in secondary tropical forest
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - There is a growing need to restore extensive areas of degraded habitat in tropical areas to forest in order to conserve biodiversity, mitigate the impacts of climate change (through carbon sequestration), reduce erosion and loss of topsoil, and provide for human livelihoods, yet little is known about how well tropical forest restoration strategies work beyond the first few years of establishment. This long-term experiment aims to address two key questions about tropical forest recovery.  First, the research compares natural forest recovery to two different forest restoration approaches (a low and high intensity approach) to assess how the degree of human intervention affects the rate of tropical forest recovery.  Second, the study evaluates the importance of the proximity of restored sites to remnant forest patches, which can serve as a source for colonizing plants and animals.  Results of this study will provide critical guidance to land managers and policy makers on how to most effectively invest limited resources to improve the outcomes of the millions of hectares of tropical forest restoration being undertaken globally. The study will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students, and new inquiry-based learning program will actively engage high school students in the research. Over a decade ago, 13 experimental sites were established over a 100 square kilometer area in southern Costa Rica, each site with a range of surrounding forest cover. Each site has three experimental treatments: 1. no tree planting and natural recovery; 2. planting tree islands of three sizes (low intensity); and 3. planting the entire plot with trees (high intensity). Researchers will collect data on metrics to assess the next phase of forest succession, including measuring soil nutrients, local microclimate, seed dispersal, tree growth, and the establishment and survival of forest seedlings.  In addition, plots will be used by collaborating scientists to study other facets of forest recovery such as insect community dynamics, and bird and bat behavior. The data will be used to address several questions about mid-stage forest recovery and how the pattern of recovery can change over time including: the effect of restoration interventions on within- and across-site biodiversity; the degree to which manipulations of initial conditions result in convergent or divergent successional trajectories from reference forest; and the relative importance of local- versus landscape-scale processes on forest recovery.

TI  - Tree species controls over nitrogen and phosphorus cycling in a wet tropical forest
T2  - Dryad
M3  - Data set
AB  - Wet tropical forests play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle, but given current rates of land-use change, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) limitation could reduce productivity in regenerating forests in this biome. Whereas the strong controls of climate and parent material over forest recovery are well known, the influence of vegetation can be difficult to determine. We addressed species-specific differences in plant traits and their relationships to ecosystem properties and processes, relevant to N and P supply to regenerating vegetation in experimental plantations in a single site in lowland wet forest in Costa Rica. Single tree species were planted in a randomized block design, such that climate, soil (Oxisol), and land-use history were similar for all species. In Years 15-25 of the experiment, we measured traits regarding N and P acquisition and use in four native, broad-leaved, evergreen tree species, including differential effects on soil pH, in conjunction with biomass and soil stocks and fluxes of N and P. Carbon biomass stocks increased significantly with increasing soil pH (P = 0.0184, previously reported) as did biomass P stocks (P = 0.0011). Despite large soil N pools, biomass P stocks were weakly dependent on traits associated with N acquisition and use (N2 fixation and leaf C:N, P < 0.09). Mass-balance budgets indicated that soil organic matter (SOM) could supply the N and P accumulated in biomass via the process of SOM mineralization. Secondary soil P pools were weakly correlated with biomass C and P stocks (r = 0.47, P = 0.08), and were large enough to have supplied sufficient P in these rapidly growing plantations, suggesting that alteration of soil pH provided a mechanism for liberation of soil P occluded in organo-mineral soil complexes, and thus supply P for plant uptake. These results highlight the importance of considering species effect on soil pH for restoration projects in highly weathered soils. This study demonstrates mechanisms by which individual species can alter P availability, and thus productivity and C cycling in regenerating humid tropical forests, and the importance of including traits into global models of element cycling. How was the data set collected? We addressed the relationships between tree species and accrual of C, N, and P, using a long-term, replicated field experiment containing four native tree species grown in plantations under similar climate, parent material and land-use history in a tropical wet forest in Costa Rica. Our approach was to identify mechanisms that had two main criteria: (1) the potential to influence availability of N and P for plants, and thus productivity (as indicated by their biomass accumulation) and (2) a direct connection to traits that could differ among species in their attributes, and thus drive species-specific differences in ecosystem properties. We used various approaches to evaluate several mechanisms in relation to specific traits, while also considering that plant species differ in a plethora of traits that could interact to result in a non-significant correlation between a particular mechanism and trait. Field measurements The field experiment was established on a 12-ha site that had been mature wet tropical forest until deforestation in 1955, planted to pasture, and grazed until abandonment in 1987. In 1988, a stratified randomized complete block experiment was established with individual species planted within each plot. The design contained twelve 0.25-ha (50 m * 50 m) plots in each of four blocks. Each plot was divided into four quadrants to facilitate random sampling within plots. Eleven of the 12 plots within a block were planted with a single tree species, with a tree spacing of 3 * 3 m. The 12th plot was left unplanted as a Control, with those plots receiving the same management, except that no trees were planted. We established a fifth block (150 x 200 m in size) in Mature Forest, <150 m from the experimental site, such that soils, climate, and historical vegetation were similar to the adjacent experiment. By the time of this study, only four of the 11 tree species planted had survived with complete canopy coverage across at least 3 of the 4 blocks (four-letter codes in parentheses): Hieronyma alchorneoides Allemao (Hial); Pentaclethra macroloba (Willd.) Ktze, (Pema); Virola koschnyi Warb., (Viko); and Vochysia guatemalensis Donn. Sm. (Vogu). To evaluate differences among species related to N and P acquisition, use, and storage, we measured C, N, and P concentrations and stocks of these compartments: plant biomass (above- and belowground), surface litter, and mineral soil (five depth intervals, 0-100 cm). Components of the planted (overstory) biomass included: canopy (leaves, flowers and fruits); twigs (diameters <1 cm); branches (diameters 1-10 cm); large branches and boles (diameters > 10 cm); stumps; stump-roots; woody roots (>2 mm diameter); and fine roots (≤ 2 mm diameter). Components for the regenerating (unplanted, understory) vegetation included the same components. See Metadata sheet for full details. We measured above- and belowground fluxes of organic matter, C, N, and P of the planted species and the vegetation regenerating on its own, referred to as the overstory and understory respectively. Components measured included: fine litterfall; branchfall; aboveground biomass increments (Delta biomass) of the overstory and understory, coarse-root and stump root biomass increments and fine-root growth (overstory + understory). We assayed asymbiotic N2 fixation in surface soil (0-5 cm) and surface litter. Turnover time was calculated as the quotient of biomass and NPP within each component, expressed in years. Soil respiration was measured in-situ approximately monthly for two years (Nov 2011-Oct 2013) in 3-4 quadrats per plot. Sampling Laboratory methods Organic C and total N for both plants and soil were analyzed by dry combustion (DC) using a Thermo-Finnigan EA Flash (Series 1112, EA Elantech, Lakewood, NJ). Duplicates were run on all samples. Plant tissue P was measured by microwave-assisted acid digestion and analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (Kingston and Haswell 1997). In total, 2704 plant samples wereanalyzed for C, N, and P.  We used the acetylene reduction assay to estimate nitrogenase activity and thus evaluate asymbiotic N2 fixation. Gas analysis was conducted on a Tracor 540 gas chromatograph (GC) fitted with a carbosphere column (Alltech, 5' * 1/8" SS COL P/W ALUMINA F-1 60/80 1 EA, 5664PC). The oven and FID temperatures were 100 °C and 175 °C respectively. Regarding the incubation period, analysis of ethylene results gave no evidence of substrate depletion within 24 h, nor inhibition of activity over 7 d. Nitrogenase activity was low enough that a 7-d period was needed to detect activity; thus, data presented are for the 7-d incubation period. The C2H2 reduced by the sample over the incubation period was calculated as: DeltaC2H4 (mumol C2H4 L-1 g-1 hr-1) * headspace (ml/1000) / incubation period (hrs) / sample mass (g dry wt). Potential N2 fixation was calculated using a molar ratio of 3:1 ethylene produced per N fixed. For soil, total P was extracted in HCl:HNO3 (4:1 by volume) (Crosland et al. 1995) and P in the digests was measured using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). For measurement of total organic P, we used the ignition method (Kuo 1996), in which organic P in the soil was converted to inorganic P by oxidation at 550° C. Phosphorus in ignited and unignited subsamples was then extracted with 0.5N H2SO4 for 16 h. ICP-AES was used to measure P in the extracts. Organic P in the soil was calculated by subtracting P concentration in the unignited sample from P concentration in the ignited sample. Modified Olsen-extractable P was determined by extraction with NaHCO3 and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Kuo, 1996). Sequential P extractions were conducted to target secondary minerals following Chadwick et al. (1994) to quantify the P associated with these phases, and to determine whether they were altered by the experimental tree species. Following an initial extraction of labile nutrients with unbuffered 1 M ammonium acetate, we extracted soils with acid ammonium oxalate, which dissolves SRO Fe and Al phases, and then with citrate-dithionite, which dissolves most crystalline Fe oxyhydroxides (as well as substituted or co-precipitated Al). These extractions have long been used for assessing secondary mineralogy of highly weathered soils (Chadwick et al. 1994, Torn et al. 1997). The sum of Poxalate and Pdithionite quantified in this procedure is hereafter referred to as secondary soil P. It is important to note that the organic and secondary pools partially overlap because a portion of the organic P that is liberated by combustion will also likely be solubilized by the oxalate or dithionite extraction; that is, secondary mineral-bound P includes organic P that is bound with these  How has the dataset been processed? Field and laboratory data were either immediately entered into Excel spreadsheets from hand-written field data sheets, or from data-capturing apparati (e.g., LICOR 8100). Datasets were then formatted for analyses in SAS and R. All data sets were regularly backed up on storage devices. To confirm species variation in traits and better understand the relationships among traits, we summarized and visualized these multivariate traits with PCA. We used 40 traits for which we had data for every plot in the experiment. Data were centered and scaled data prior to principle components analysis. We also ran permanova as a mixed model with species, block, and their interaction using Type III sums of squares with residual randomization permutation procedures. For factorial analyses, the experimental unit was the plot. For variables with multiple measurements per plot, the mean was used in the analysis. The treatment consisted of the vegetation type; for most variables, this consisted of the four planted tree species, but for some it included the Mature Forest and/or the Control. For variables in which measurements included only the four planted species, the design was a randomized complete block (n = 15, with 4 species * 4 blocks, minus oneVochysia plot). For analyses including the Mature Forest, the design was an incomplete block design (n = 23 if it also included the Control). Blocks were considered a random effect. We tested for homogeneity of variances and normality of distributions. ANOVA was used to evaluate differences among vegetation types in element (C, N, and P) concentrations, stoichiometries, and stocks in vegetation (by component), surface litter (by component), soil (5 depth intervals, including a vegetation type * depth interaction term), N2 fixation (by substrate, including a vegetation * substrate interaction. We first conducted a MANOVA to determine whether all elements could be evaluated in one test for a given response variable. In tests for all variables, the interactions among elements were significant, thus individual ANOVAs were done for each element. To assess redistribution of N and P within the soil profile, we compared changes in N and P stocks within the rooting zone (0-30 cm) and below (30-100 cm) over the 8-y period of the project. Procedures were conducted in SAS (Littell et al. 1996). Multiple regression models were used to evaluate the relative effects of explanatory variables, i.e., species traits that could influence N and P acquisition and use, on the response variables of stocks of biomass C, N, and P. # Tree species controls over nitrogen and phosphorus cycling in a wet tropical forest Give a brief summary of dataset contents, contextualized in experimental procedures and results. ## Description of the data and file structure This data set is organized as follows.

AB  - Land-use land-cover (LULC) changes are occurring rapidly in Southeast Asia (SEA), generally associated with population growth, economic development and competing demands for land. Land cover change is one of the vital factors affecting carbon dynamics and emissions. SEA is an important region to study urban-caused LULC emissions and the potential for nature-based solutions (NBS) and nature climate solutions (NCS), as it is home to nearly 15% of the worlds tropical forests and has some of the worlds fastest rates of urban growth. We present a fine-scale urban cluster level assessment for SEA of current (2015) and future (2050) scenarios for carbon sequestration service and climate mitigation potential. We identified 956 urban clusters distributed across 11 countries of SEA. Considering the urban expansion projected and decline in forests, this region could see a carbon loss of up to 0.11 Gigatonnes (Scenario SSP4 RCP 3.4). Comparing carbon change values to urban emissions, we found that the average offset value ranging from 2% (Scenario SSP1 RCP 2.6) to 21%. We also found that a few medium and large urban clusters could add to more than double the existing carbon emissions in 2050 in the SSP3 and SSP4 RCP 3.4 scenarios, while a minority of clusters could offset their emissions under SSP1. Our study confirms that NCS, and particularly reforestation, are in many cases able to offset the direct emissions from land cover conversion from SEA urban clusters. Hence, documenting the plausible LULC transitions and the associated impacts gains significance in the SEA region as the results can be useful for informing policy and sustainable land management.

TI  - Conservation set-asides improve carbon storage and support associated plant diversity in certified sustainable oil palm plantations
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Maintaining forest conservation set-asides is a key criterion of sustainability certification of many crops that drive tropical deforestation, but their value for carbon storage and associated biodiversity is unclear. We conducted vegetation measurements to examine the benefits of set-asides for aboveground carbon stocks (AGC) in certified oil palm plantations on Borneo, and whether their AGC is positively associated with plant diversity. The mean estimated AGC of live trees and palms >= 10 cm diameter in set-asides in certified oil palm plantations (52.8 Mg ha(-1)) was > 1.5-times that of oil palm (30.3 Mg ha(-1)), with some plots supporting similar AGC to primary forest. For lowland Borneo, we estimate that the average AGC of oil palm plantations with 10% coverage of set-asides is up to 20% greater than the average AGC of oil palm plantations without set-asides, newly demonstrating carbon storage as a benefit of conservation set-asides. We found positive relationships between AGC and plant diversity, highlighting the carbon-biodiversity co-benefits of set-asides. However, set-asides had a lower density of tree seedlings than continuous primary forest, indicating potential suppression of future tree regeneration and AGC. Our findings support the application of zero-deforestation during agricultural development to conserve areas of remaining forest with high AGC and high biodiversity. We recommend management practices that boost regeneration in existing set-asides (e.g. enrichment planting), which would be most effective in larger set-asides, and could substantially increase the AGC of agricultural landscapes without removing land from production, and help conserve forest-dependent biodiversity.

TI  - Termite diversity is resilient to land-use change along a forest-cocoa intensification gradient in Ghana, West Africa
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Cocoa is an important crop for Ghana's economy, contributing 25% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The crop, however, is mainly cultivated on forest-derived soils and is a major cause of land-use change. Termites are an important biological component of tropical ecosystems providing numerous ecosystem services. Previous studies have indicated that termites are sensitive to forest disturbance and decrease in richness and abundance across land-use intensification gradients, with consequences for the essential services that they provide. Native shade trees are often used to improve cocoa cultivation and may reduce the detrimental effects of land-use change on some aspects of biodiversity. The aim of this study was therefore to explore how termites respond to land-use change along a shade-tree gradient in Kakum National Park and surrounding cocoa farms in Ghana (from forest at 80% tree cover to cocoa with no shade cover, to the extreme of cultivated arable crop land). It was predicted that termite richness and abundance would decrease with decreasing shade cover, and with increasing distance from the forest edge. Thirty-four species from 29 genera were sampled, with Ancistrotermes crucifer being found in all the locations (47% of all encounters). Species richness and abundance differed marginally across the land-use gradient, as well as the distance from the forest edge; however, species richness did not show any significance with distance. All the same, termite communities were robust to the disturbance. Our findings suggest that though site influenced species richness and abundance, cocoa trees can play a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity and environmental quality in an agricultural landscape by providing a habitat for forest species that are not found in pastures or farm fields. However, we caution that the relatively low forest baseline of existing forest diversity may inflate the value of cocoa land, with those forests no longer representing undisturbed natural habitats: this highlights that shifting baselines may need to be accounted for when interpreting findings in the Anthropocene.

TI  - Do tree plantations or cultivated fields have the same ability to maintain soil quality as natural forests?
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activities, such as tree cutting and land-use change, have significantly altered the forests of Iran's Zagros Mountains. In plantation projects within these forests, maintaining soil structure and fertility is necessary for sustainable forest management. Ideally, the soil quality of tree plantations should be as good as that of natural forests. In this study, we investigated the long-term impact of land-use change, i.e. conversion of natural oak forest to tree plantations or cultivated fields, on soil quality (i.e., physicochemical, biological and biochemical soil properties) in the forests of the Zagros Mountains. We found that the conversion of natural oak forest to tree plantations (in this case Cupressus arizonica, Cedrus libani, Elaeagnus angustifolia, Quercus brantii (persica), Robinia pseudoacacia and Fraxinus rotundifolia) and agriculture caused declines in soil organic carbon content, especially in the cultivated fields where it fell by around 60%. Overall, the lowest contents of soil nutrients, except Cu, were measured in agricultural soils. Interestingly, the plantation of a non-native tree (Cedrus libani) sequestrated more atmospheric carbon and nitrogen than native Persian oak forests. The impact on soil biological activity remains unclear: the conversion of natural forests into cultivated fields reduced soil biological activity, while conversion from forest to tree plantations had little influence. Finally, the conversion of natural forest to tree plantations had less impact on soil properties than conversion to cultivated fields. In conclusion, to maintain soil fertility, forest managers should avoid forest conversion to agriculture. Moreover, we do not recommend plantation of Cupressus arizonica in the Zagros region for the purpose of carbon and nitrogen sequestration and the increase of soil productivity.

TI  - Pathways to win-wins or trade-offs? How certified community forests impact forest restoration and human wellbeing
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Certified community forests combine local governance with forest certification and aim to serve multiple objectives including forest protection, restoration, human wellbeing and equitable governance. However, the causal pathways by which they impact these objectives remain poorly understood. The ability of protected area impact evaluations to identify complex pathways is limited by a narrow focus on top-down theoretical, quantitative perspectives and inadequate consideration of local context. We used a novel mixed-methods research design that integrates the perspectives of multiple actors to develop a generalized conceptual model of the causal pathways for certified community forests. We tested the model using a combination of statistical matching, structural equation modelling and qualitative analyses for an agroforestry landscape in Tanzania. We found certified community forests positively impacted human wellbeing, equitable governance and forest restoration. Equitable governance had the largest impact on wellbeing, followed by crop yield and forest resource availability. Timber revenues varied widely between villages and the average effect of financial benefits did not impact wellbeing due to the immature stage of the certified timber market. We identified positive interactions and trade-offs between conservation and agriculture. Our findings suggest that no simple solution exists for meeting multiple objectives. However, developing understanding of the pathways linking social and conservation outcomes can help identify opportunities to promote synergies and mitigate negative impacts to reconcile competing objectives.This article is part of the theme issue 'Understanding forest landscape restoration: reinforcing scientific foundations for the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration'.

TI  - The potential of agricultural soils of the upper St. Joseph river watershed to sequester carbon
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper assesses the potential to sequester C in soils under different land use systems in the Upper St. Joseph River Watershed by evaluating land use and management options that lead to an increase in soil C concentration above the Current levels. Under the present land use systems, the Current soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration rate calculated for different, soil/crop management practices, ranges between 37.8 and 56.0 Gg yr(-1) (I Gg = 10(9) g = one thousand metric ton). Losses of SOC are primarily due to plow tillage estimated at 12.8 to 20.2 Gg C. The SOC sequestration potential is estimated at 67.8 to 102.0 Gg C yr(-1) through adoption of improved land use and soil/crop management practices. Conversion from plow till to no-till with continuous or rotational cropping system contributes 52% of the total SOC sequestration potential. Restoration of wetlands, incorporation of pasture/hay into the rotation cycle, and conversion to Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) contribute about 48% of the total sequestration potential.

TI  - Satellite based integrated approaches to modelling spatial carbon stock and carbon sequestration potential of different land uses of Northeast India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aims to estimate and predict the aboveground biomass, carbon stock and carbon sequestration potential of different land uses of Northeast India and relate these estimates with the land use changes. Many applications such as carbon stock and sequestration monitoring, forest degradation monitoring, and climate change mitigation, require precise and timely estimation of forest biomass. Although traditional field inventory can reliably estimate forest biomass, remote sensing is emerging as an alternate and fast approach to cover larger area with relative precision for biomass estimation. In this study, a combined approach of field inventory and Landsat OLI derived vegetation indices were used in spatial modelling of aboveground biomass and carbon stock in different land uses. A stepwise multilinear regression algorithm was used to derive the model that used Landsat derived NDVI, SAVI and ARVI as predicators. The predicted AGB ranged from 14.32 to 185.95 Mg ha(-1) with an average of 148.78 Mg ha(-1). The developed model that used combined vegetation indices showed correlation of R-2 = 0.79 with an RMSE of 51.04 Mg ha(-1). The present study also applied the empirical model (CO2FIX) to simulate the future scenario of carbon stock and carbon sequestration potential of the different land uses. The carbon stock potential of different land uses were 182.31 Mg ha(-1), 158.91 Mg ha(-1), 134.98 Mg ha(-1), 169.26 Mg ha(-1), 133.84, 89.95 Mg ha(-1), 128.3 Mg ha(-1) and 61.36 Mg ha(-1) in Tropical forest, Subtropical forest, Temperate forest, Tropical plantation, Subtropical plantation, Temperate plantation, Shifting fallows and Agricultural land, respectively.

M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the economic and environmental significance of the world's forests, we have limited data about them. Estimates of deforestation in tropical countries and rates of reforestation or afforestation in boreal and temperate countries are inconsistent. Accordingly, estimates of emissions released in deforestation vary widely and range from 7% to 17% of all sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The lack of good data severely hampers efforts to shape climate policy because it is difficult to model the role of forests both in the physical global carbon (C) cycle and in cost-effective regimes to abate GHG. Data limits strain the capacity of even the best models to estimate marginal cost functions for forest carbon (C) sequestration. It is technically possible to obtain better information, but for institutional and economic reasons these technologies have not yet been fully deployed. The emergence of carbon (C) trading or tax policy in which forest carbon (C) storage becomes valued would strengthen incentives to supply better data, as would nonmarket regulation if it elicited a shadow value of forest carbon (C) in substituting for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. "Geo-wiki" may provide a short-term solution to at least part of the data problem. The ultimate solution is the development of a comprehensive forest monitoring system involving remote sensing and on-the-ground truthing. This paper briefly discusses the role of forests in climate policy and then describes data gaps, the capability of technology to fill them, the limits of institutions and budgets in realizing this capability, and possible near-term solutions.

TI  - Cross-scale spatial variability and associations of carbon pools provide insight into regulating carbon sequestration in tropical montane rainforests
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution of plant, soil, and microbial carbon pools, along with their intricate interactions, presents a great challenge for the current carbon cycle research. However, it is not clear what are the characteristics of the spatial variability of these carbon pools, particularly their cross-scale relationships. We investigated the crossscale spatial variability of microbial necromass carbon (MNC), soil organic carbon (SOC) and plant biomass (PB), as well as their correlation in a tropical montane rainforest using multifractal analysis. The results showed multifractal spatial variations of MNC, SOC, and PB, demonstrating their adherence to power-law scaling. MNC, especially low MNC, exhibited stronger spatial heterogeneity and weaker evenness compared with SOC and PB. The cross-scale correlation between MNC and SOC was stronger than their correlations at the measurement scale. Furthermore, the cross-scale spatial variability of MNC and SOC exhibited stronger and more stable correlations than those with PB. Additionally, this research suggests that when SOC and PB are both low, it is advisable for reforestations to potentiate MNC formation, whereas when both SOC and PB are high some thinning can be advisable to favour MNC formation. Thus, these results support the utilization of management measures such as reforestation or thinning as nature-based solutions to regulate carbon sequestration capacity of tropical forests by affecting the correlations among various carbon pools.

TI  - Influence of afforestation, reforestation, forest logging, climate change, CO2 concentration rise, fire, and insects on the carbon sequestration capacity of the forest ecosystem.
T2  - Acta Ecologica Sinica
M3  - Article
AB  - Controlling the rising levels of atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG, especially CO2) concentration to mitigate global climate change is arguably the most challenging environmental issue encountered by China and many other countries. Forest ecosystem, which is an integral part of terrestrial ecosystems, can play a significant role in absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere and aiding global climate change mitigation, subsequently contributing to meet the national commitment and demand of carbon emission reduction and carbon sink enhancement. Afforestation and reforestation, as recognized in the Kyoto Protocol, provide relatively low-cost and effective solutions to enhance forest ecosystem carbon sink. Meanwhile, the carbon sequestration capacity of a forest ecosystem is enormously affected by various natural and anthropogenic factors, which may convert the forest ecosystem from a carbon sink to a source. Therefore, the understanding of the influence of afforestation, reforestation, and those factors on the carbon sequestration capacity of the forest ecosystem is important for the accurate estimation of global and regional forest ecosystem carbon budget. In this study, the recent research progresses on the effect of afforestation and reforestation on carbon sequestration capacity of global and regional forest has been reviewed, along with the influence of several natural and anthropogenic disturbances (i.e., forest logging, climate change, CO2 concentration enhancement, fire, and insect). It was indicated that the carbon sequestration capacity of global afforestation and reforestation was in the range of 148 to 2400 TgC/a, varying regionally as follows: tropical forest (1700 TgC/a) > boreal forest (700 TgC/a) > temperate forest (27-500 TgC/a). Furthermore, besides climate change and CO2 concentration rise, other factors that caused carbon emissions in the forest have been summed up and listed below. Forest logging caused the highest carbon emissions (900 TgC/a), followed by forest fire (300 TgC/a), and insects caused the lowest carbon emissions (2-107 TgC/a). Henceforth, more attention should be paid on the influence of carbon sequestration measures and integrated effects of multiple forms of disturbance on the carbon sequestration capacity of forest ecosystems, especially carbon sequestration capacity of forest soil. Furthermore, controlling forest logging and fire, along with reducing or avoiding additional carbon leakage due to afforestation and reforestation would also greatly contribute to forest carbon sequestration.

TI  - Termite diversity is resilient to land-use change
T2  - Dryad
M3  - Data set
AB  - Cocoa is an important crop for Ghanas economy, contributing 25% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The crop, however, is mainly cultivated on forest-derived soils and is a major cause of land-use change. Termites are an important biological component of tropical ecosystems providing numerous ecosystem services. Previous studies have indicated that termites are sensitive to forest disturbance and decrease in richness and abundance across land-use intensification gradients, with consequences for the essential services that they provide. Native shade trees are often used to improve cocoa cultivation and may reduce the detrimental effects of land-use change on some aspects of biodiversity. The aim of this study was therefore to explore how termites respond to land-use change along a shade-tree gradient in Kakum National Park and surrounding cocoa farms in Ghana (from forest at 80% tree cover to cocoa with no shade cover, to the extreme of cultivated arable crop land). It was predicted that termite richness and abundance would decrease with decreasing shade cover, and with increasing distance from the forest edge. Thirty-four species from 29 genera were sampled, with Ancistrotermes crucifer being found in all the locations (47% of all encounters). Species richness and abundance differed marginally across the land-use gradient, as well as the distance from the forest edge, however, species richness did not show any significance with distance. All the same, termite communities were robust to the disturbance. Our findings suggest that though site influenced species richness and abundance, cocoa trees can play a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity and environmental quality in an agricultural landscape by providing a habitat for forest species that are not found in pastures or farm fields. However, we caution that the relatively low forest baseline of existing forest diversity may inflate the value of cocoa land, with those forests no longer representing undisturbed natural habitats: this highlights that shifting baselines may need to be accounted for when interpreting findings in the Anthropocene. Termites were sampled along a single belt transect at each site using the standardized transect method as described by Jones and Eggleton (2000). Transects were 100 m long and 2 m wide, divided into 20 sections of 5 x 2 m each. Transects were geo-referenced, with GPS coordinates taken at the beginning and the end of each transect. One person-hour of sampling effort per section was used to search for and collect termites from the soil (12 pits of approximately 12 cm x 12 cm x 10 cm (depth) were dug per section), accumulations of litter and humus at the base of trees, the inside of dead wood, tree stumps, soil within and beneath very rotten logs, subterranean nests, mounds, runways on vegetation and arboreal nests up to a height of 2 m above ground level. Termites were searched for within each transect section, and samples were collected for each encounter and placed in separate vials. When possible, termite samples for each encounter consisted of two to three soldiers and five to seven workers: in total, seven to ten individuals. Termites were placed in vials filled with 70 @ ethanol and labelled according to the section of the transect they were collected. N/A Copyright: CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication

TI  - Influence of Plot Size on Efficiency of Biomass Estimates in Inventories of Dry Tropical Forests Assisted by Photogrammetric Data from an Unmanned Aircraft System
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Applications of unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) to assist in forest inventories have provided promising results in biomass estimation for different forest types. Recent studies demonstrating use of different types of remotely sensed data to assist in biomass estimation have shown that accuracy and precision of estimates are influenced by the size of field sample plots used to obtain reference values for biomass. The objective of this case study was to assess the influence of sample plot size on efficiency of UAS-assisted biomass estimates in the dry tropical miombo woodlands of Malawi. The results of a design-based field sample inventory assisted by three-dimensional point clouds obtained from aerial imagery acquired with a UAS showed that the root mean square errors as well as the standard error estimates of mean biomass decreased as sample plot sizes increased. Furthermore, relative efficiency values over different sample plot sizes were above 1.0 in a design-based and model-assisted inferential framework, indicating that UAS-assisted inventories were more efficient than purely field-based inventories. The results on relative costs for UAS-assisted and pure field-based sample plot inventories revealed that there is a trade-off between inventory costs and required precision. For example, in our study if a standard error of less than approximately 3 Mg ha(-1) was targeted, then a UAS-assisted forest inventory should be applied to ensure more cost effective and precise estimates. Future studies should therefore focus on finding optimum plot sizes for particular applications, like for example in projects under the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, plus forest conservation, sustainable management of forest and enhancement of carbon stocks (REDD+) mechanism with different geographical scales.

AB  - Tropical forest recovery is fundamental to addressing the intertwined climate and biodiversity loss crises. While regenerating trees sequester carbon relatively quickly, the pace of biodiversity recovery remains contentious. Here, we use bioacoustics and meta-barcoding to measure forest recovery post-agriculture in a global biodiversity hotspot in Ecuador. We show that the community composition, and not species richness, of vocalizing vertebrates identified by experts reflects the restoration gradient. Two automated measures - an acoustic index model and a bird community derived from an independently developed Convolutional Neural Network - correlated well with restoration (adj-R2 = 0.62 and 0.69, respectively). Importantly, both measures reflected composition of non-vocalizing nocturnal insects identified via meta-barcoding. We show that such automated monitoring tools, based on new technologies, can effectively monitor the success of forest recovery, using robust and reproducible data. Crucially, this will help ensure that forest restoration efforts result in resilient, biodiverse tropical forests and not simply carbon farms. DNA was extracted from 200-L aliquots using the DNEasy blood & tissue kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturers instructions. Multiplex PCR was performed using 5 L of extracted genomic DNA, Plant MyTAQ (Bioline, Luckenwalde, Germany) and high-throughput sequencing (HTS)-adapted mini-barcode primers targeting the mitochondrial CO1-5P region (mlCOIintF - 5- GWACWGGWTGAACWGTWTAYCCYCC-3; dgHCO2198-5-TAAACTTCAGGGTGACCAAARAAYCA-3; following Leray et al., 2013 - also see Moriniere et al.; Moriniere et al.. Amplification success and fragment length were determined using gel electrophoresis. The amplified DNA was cleaned and each sample was resuspended in 50 L of molecular water. Illumina Nextera XT (Illumina Inc., San Diego, USA) indices were ligated to the samples in a second PCR, conducted at the same annealing temperature as in the first but with only seven cycles. Ligation success was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. DNA concentrations were measured using a Qubit fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA), and the samples were then combined into 40-L pools containing equimolar concentrations of 100 ng each. The pooled DNA was purified using MagSi-NGSprep Plus beads (Steinbrenner Laborsysteme GmbH, Wiesenbach, Germany). The final elution volume was 20 L. HTS was performed on an Illumina MiSeq using v3 chemistry (2*300bp, 600 cycles, maximum of 25 mio paired-end reads). # DNA Metabarcoding RAW FASTQ data for "Soundscapes and artificial intelligence provide powerful tools to track biodiversity recovery in tropical forests" [this dataset contains demultiplexed Illumina FASTQ files along with a samplesheet to process these files and an excel file listing all of the detected BINs with identification success rate and taxonomy retreived from sequence BLAST on BOLD (www.boldsystems.org)] **Demultiplexed RAW FASTQ Illumina sequence data files used for analysis of the dataset.** Use the "*BIOINFORMATIC\_INFORMATION.xlsx*" file for your bioinformatic pipeline to run primer trimming. Each FASTQ file is listed within the *BIOINFORMATIC\_INFORMATION.xlsx* with its corresponding primer sequences used. Follow the methods described in the material & methods section (described below) in order to generate an annotated OTU table. Primer used CO1 Leray et al., 2013 - https://frontiersinzoology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-9994-10-34 **Excel File containing detected BINs** Within the file "Nocturnal\_Arthropod\_Communities.xlsx" all of the detected BINs (Barcode Index Numbers) along with Hit-%-identity scores and taxonomy are listed. Presence of each BIN in the samples is indicated by read numbers. **Bioinformatics methods:** Paired-ends were merged using the *-fastq\_mergepairs* utility of the USEARCH suite v11.0.667\_i86linux32 (Edgar, 2010) with the following parameters: *-fastq\_maxdiffs* 99, *-fastq\_pctid* 75, *-fastq\_trunctail* 0\. Adapter sequences were removed using CUTADAPT75 (single-end mode, with default parameters). All sequences that did not contain the appropriate adapter sequences were filtered out in this step using the *--discard-untrimmed* parameter. The remaining pre-processing steps (quality filtering, dereplication, chimera filtering, and pre-clustering) were carried out using the VSEARCH suite v2.9.176. Quality filtering was performed using the *--fastq\_filter* VSEARCH utility (parameters: *--fastq\_maxee* 1, *--minlen* 300). Sequences were dereplicated with *--derep\_fulllength* (parameters: *--sizeout, --relabel Uniq*), first at the sample level, and then at the combined dataset level after concatenating all sample files into one large FASTA file, which was also filtered for singletons (sequences occurring only once in the entire dataset and *a priori* considered as noise; parameters: *--minuniquesize* 2, *--sizein*, *--sizeout*, *--fasta\_width* 0). To save processing power, a pre-clustering step (at 98% identity) was employed before chimera filtering using the *--cluster\_size* VSEARCH utility with the centroids algorithm (parameters: *--id* 0.98, *--strand plus*, *--sizein*, *--sizeout*, *--fasta\_width* 0, *--centroids*). Chimeric sequences were then detected and filtered out from the resulting file using the VSEARCH *--uchime\_denovo* utility (parameters: *--sizein*, *--sizeout*, *--fasta\_width* 0, *--nonchimeras*). A custom perl script obtained from the authors of VSEARCH (see [https://github.com/torognes/vsearch/wiki/VSEARCH-pipeline](https://github.com/torognes/vsearch/wiki/VSEARCH-pipeline)) was then used to regenerate the concatenated FASTA file, but without the previously detected chimeric sequences. The resulting chimera-filtered file was then used to cluster the reads into OTUs using SWARM v.3.1.077 (parameters: *-d* 13 *-z*). The value for the *d* parameter was chosen based on the experiments of Antich *et al.*78. The OTU representative sequences were then sorted using VSEARCH (parameters: *--fasta\_width* 0 *--sortbysize*) and an OTU table was constructed from the resulting FASTA file using the VSEARCH utility *--usearch\_global* (parameters: *--strand plus* *--sizein* *--sizeout* *--fasta\_width* 0). To reduce the risk of false-positives, a cleaning step was employed that excluded read counts in the OTU table constituting < 0.01% of the total number of reads in the sample. OTUs were additionally removed from the results based on negative control samples, i.e. if the number of reads for the OTU in any sample was less than the maximum among negative controls, those reads were excluded from further analysis. OTU representative sequences were blasted (parameters: program: Megablast; maximum hits: 1; scoring (match mismatch): 1-2; gap cost (open extend): linear; max E-value: 10; word size: 28; max target seqs 100) against (1) a custom database downloaded from GenBank (a local copy of the NCBI nucleotide database downloaded from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/), and (2) a custom database built from data downloaded from BOLD ([www.boldsystems.org](http://www.boldsystems.org)79,80) including taxonomy and BIN information, by means of Geneious (v.10.2.5 - Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand). All available Animalia data was downloaded from the BOLD database on 29 July 2022 using the available public data API (http://www.boldsystems.org/index.php/resources/api) in a combined TSV file format. The combined TSV file was then filtered to keep only the records that: (1) had a sequence (field 72, nucleotides); (2) had a sequence that did not hold exclusively one or more - (hyphens); had a sequence that did not contain non-IUPAC characters; (3) belonged to COI (the pattern COI-5P in either field 70 (markercode) or field 80 (marker\_codes)); (5) had an available BIN (field 8, bin\_uri). In (5), an exception was made in cases where the species belonging to that record did not occur with a BIN elsewhere in the dataset. In other words, BIN-less records were kept if their species were also completely BIN-less in the dataset. The dataset was then filtered to include only South American records, and in the following way: (1) records were kept that contained, in field 55 (country), the South American country names: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Falkland Islands, French Guiana, Guiana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela; (2) records were additionally kept if their latitude (field 47, lat) was between -58.4 and 17 and their longitude (field 48, lon) was between -85.8 and -30.3. These values were found by taking the extreme north (Punta Gallinas), south (Cape Forward), east (Ponta do Seixas), and west (Punta Parinas) points of the continent. As a buffer, 500 km were added due north, south, east, and west, respectively of those geographic points using the Measure on Map function of SunEarthTools.com. It was then noted that a large part of the dataset, thus filtered, held also records from several Central American countries, in particular Costa Rica, whose biodiversity on BOLD dwarfs all other South American countries. Thus, a decision was made to additionally include all remaining records from Costa Rica. Finally, a FASTA file annotated with a Process ID (field 1, processid), BIN (field 8), taxonomy (fields 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 - phylum\_name, class\_name, order\_name, family\_name, subfamily\_name, genus\_name, species\_name), geo location data (fields 47, 48, 55), and GenBank ID (field 71, genbank\_accession) was created from the filtered combined TSV file, and then converted into a BLAST database using Geneious v10.2.6 (Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand). The results were exported and further processed according to methods described by Uhler *et al.*65. Briefly, the resulting csv files, which included the OTU ID, BOLD Process ID, BIN, Hit-%-ID value (percentage of overlap similarity (identical base pairs) of an OTU query sequence with its closest counterpart in the database), Grade-%-ID value (combining query coverage, E-value and identity values for each hit with weights of 0.5, 0.25 and 0.25 respectively, allowing determination of the longest, highest-identity hits), the length of the top BLAST hit sequence, as well as the phylum, class, order, family, genus and species information for each detected OTU were exported from Geneious and combined with the OTU table generated by the bioinformatic pre-processing pipeline. As an additional measure of control other than BLAST, the OTUs were classified into taxa using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) naive Bayesian classifier81 trained on a cleaned COI dataset of Arthropods and Chordates (plus outgroups; see Porter & Hajibabei82. OTUs were also annotated with the taxonomic information from the NCBI (downloaded from https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/"), followed by the creation of a taxonomic consensus between BOLD, NCBI and RDP.

TI  - Cost benefits of forest restoration in a tropical grazing landscape: Thiaki rainforest restoration project
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global forest restoration is vital to mitigate climate change. Tropical forests are under the greatest threat from clearing while offering significant potential for restoration. Forest carbon credits through trading schemes have the potential to enable restoration, providing landholders with incentives to restore forests. Impediments to restoration are numerous, with one of the main ones being the unknown costs of forest restoration and uncertain returns from payment schemes, such as carbon trading programs. Many research and modeling papers on the potential of carbon markets to stimulate reforestation in agricultural landscapes rely on general estimates of reforestation. The reality, though, is that the benefits, returns, and break-even points of the reforestation costs and carbon price are highly sensitive to actual costs. Few papers actually investigate the real costs of farm-level restoration. Nearly all recent papers have used modeled scenarios in calculating Net Present Value (NPV), and so estimates of restoration cost and a return from carbon vary widely depending on modeled assumptions. Real data from a demonstration project in the Wet Tropics of Australia are provided in this paper. Three land use scenarios are compared: carbon only, cattle only, and a combination of carbon and cattle using on-ground data for restoration. Not surprisingly, scenarios of the highest carbon prices generate the highest net benefits in both carbon only and mixed carbon and cattle scenarios. A minimum carbon price of AUD$37 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent is required to match income derived from cattle. The current policy environment that rewards the lowest cost abatement runs counter to Australia playing its role in the urgent need to limit global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius and preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius.

TI  - Oil palm cultivation enhances soilpH, electrical conductivity, concentrations of exchangeable calcium, magnesium, and available sulfur and soil organic carbon content
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The land area under oil palm (Elaeis guineensisJacq.) cultivation (OPC) is increasing in different parts of world. Assessment of the soil parameters of oil palm plantations (OPP) is essential to judge the sustainability of land use for maintaining soil fertility and avoiding land degradation. The effects of OPC in India on soil parameters are poorly understood. Therefore, we evaluated the impact of OPC over the years (by considering oil palm plantations of 6, 12, and 18 years age) on soil properties, nutrient availability, soil organic carbon (SOC) pools, and SOC stock in comparison with those parameters in adjacent fallow land (FL) of southern India. Soils of OPP showed enhanced soil pH value, electrical conductivity, the concentrations of exchangeable calcium and magnesium and available sulfur, and SOC content in 0-20, 20-40, and 40-60 cm depths of soil compared with those parameters in FL. Available phosphorus concentration in soil increased with plantation age revealing the need for rational phosphorus management. However, the concentration of available nitrogen, potassium, exchangeable calcium and magnesium, and available sulfur and boron did not change with plantation age. The contents of SOC and very labile carbon were higher in surface soil layers of OPP than that in FL. Oil palm cultivation led to 20, 18, and 45% enhancement in SOC stock in 6, 12, and 18 years-old OPP, respectively, compared with SOC stock in FL indicating C sequestration due to OPC. The very labile and less labile C stock in FL, 6 and 12 years-old OPP were similar, whereas the values of these parameters were higher in 18 years-old OPP. Positive correlation (p < .01) of SOC with very labile, labile, and less labile carbon pools indicated their inter-relatedness. This information will be utilized in devising rational nutrient management options for the existing as well as ensuing OPP due to variations in soil properties and available nutrients.

T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data set
AB  - Land-use land-cover (LULC) changes are occurring rapidly in Southeast Asia (SEA), generally associated with population growth, economic development and competing demands for land. Land cover change is one of the vital factors affecting carbon dynamics and emissions. SEA is an important region to study urban-caused LULC emissions and the potential for nature-based solutions (NBS) and nature climate solutions (NCS), as it is home to nearly 15% of the worlds tropical forests and has some of the worlds fastest rates of urban growth. We present a fine-scale urban cluster level assessment for SEA of current (2015) and future (2050) scenarios for carbon sequestration service and climate mitigation potential. We identified 956 urban clusters distributed across 11 countries of SEA. Considering the urban expansion projected and decline in forests, this region could see a carbon loss of up to 0.11 Gigatonnes (Scenario SSP4 RCP 3.4). Comparing carbon change values to urban emissions, we found that the average offset value ranging from 2% (Scenario SSP1 RCP 2.6) to 21%. We also found that a few medium and large urban clusters could add to more than double the existing carbon emissions in 2050 in the SSP3 and SSP4 RCP 3.4 scenarios, while a minority of clusters could offset their emissions under SSP1. Our study confirms that NCS, and particularly reforestation, are in many cases able to offset the direct emissions from land cover conversion from SEA urban clusters. Hence, documenting the plausible LULC transitions and the associated impacts gains significance in the SEA region as the results can be useful for informing policy and sustainable land management.

TI  - Shifting trait coordination along a soil-moisture-nutrient gradient in tropical forests
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil nutrients and water availability are strong drivers of tropical tree species distribution across scales. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying environmental filtering along these gradients remain incompletely understood. Previous studies mostly focused on univariate variation in structural traits, but a more integrative approach combining multiple physiological traits is needed to fully portray species functional strategies. We measured nine leaf functional traits related to trees' resource capture and hydraulic strategies for 552 individuals belonging to 21 tropical tree species across an environmental gradient in Amazonian forests. Our sampling included generalist and specialist species from terra firme (TF) and seasonally flooded (SF) forests. We tested the influence of the topographic wetness index, a proxy for soil moisture and nutrient gradients, on each trait separately and on the trait integration through multivariate indices computed from the eigenvalues of a principal component analysis on the traits of the species. Finally, we evaluated intraspecific trait variability (ITV) for generalists and specialists by calculating the coefficient of variation for each trait. Results showed that (1) the environment had a greater influence on trait syndromes than single trait variation. Moreover, (2) SF specialist species expressed a stronger leaf trait coordination than TF specialist species. Furthermore, (3) the ability of generalist species to occupy a broader range of environments was not reflected by a larger ITV than specialist species but by the capacity to change trait coordination across environments. Our work highlights the need to investigate functional strategies as multidimensional syndromes in physiological trait space to fully understand and predict species distribution along environmental gradients.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.Les nutriments du sol et la disponibilit & eacute; de l'eau sont des facteurs importants de la distribution des esp & egrave;ces d'arbres tropicaux & agrave; diff & eacute;rentes & eacute;chelles.

TI  - Preservation of labile organic compounds is the pathway for carbon storage in a 23-year continuous no-till system on a Ferralsol in southern Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - No-till (NT) system has the potential to sequester soil organic carbon (SOC) in the topsoil and increase soil quality. However, SOC accumulation in the soil profile and the mechanisms for SOC stabilization in NT are still a matter of debate, especially for soils of the tropics. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the long-term effects of two tillage systems (conventional tillage - CT and no-till - NT) on chemical and physical mechanisms of SOC stabilization and how these are related to the accumulation of SOC in the soil profile. Soils were sampled (0-100 cm depth) from a long-term experiment (23 years) established on a Rhodic Ferralsol in southern Brazil. Soils under native vegetation (NV) were used as a baseline. Results showed that conversion of NV to agriculture decreased on average the SOC stock by 70.8 Mg ha-1 (-33%) in the 0-100 cm soil layer. Between tillage systems, higher SOC stock was observed under NT than that under CT in the 0-5 and 5-10 cm soil layers, resulting in higher SOC stock in the entire topsoil (0-20 cm) in the conservation system. In the subsoil (20-100 cm), SOC was similar for both tillage systems. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy showed differ-ences in the C composition between the tillage systems; an accumulation of labile compounds in the uppermost layer was observed under NT, which resulted in a lower SOM aromaticity index under this treatment than that in soil under CT management. Adoption of NT increased the proportion of large macroaggregates (> 2.0 mm) in 0-5 cm soil layer, resulting in a greater mean weight diameter (MWD) than under CT. Principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation analysis of data for 0-20 cm soil layer showed that SOC stock is positively associated with labile compounds, the proportion of large macroaggregates, and MWD, and negatively with small macroaggregates, aromatic compounds, and aromaticity index. These results indicated that the pathway for SOC accumulation in the topsoil of NT is influenced less by selective preservation but driven by the maintenance of labile organic compounds, a process achieved by the low turnover of large macroaggregates in the NT system.

CP  - 3rd International Conference on Carbon Dioxide Removal (ICCDR-3)
CL  - CAMBRIDGE, MA
AB  - Reforestation has a great potential to fix carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere through photosynthesis of biomass and biomass energy conversion. The magnitude of CO2 fixation depends on the potential land area. We have proposed a potential area of about 350 Mha for reforestation in tropical and semi-tropical areas. If such land is used for energy plantation aimed at substitutive energy production by power generation, the CO2 mitigation effect can be evaluated on the assumption of short rotation energy plantation (6-year rotation), plantation area (1Mha), biomass productivity (10.5 dry ton/ha/y), energy efficiency of power generation (0.27), etc. Assuming these factors, the net carbon dioxide mitigation effect is 1.4 billion t-C on 340 Mha.

TI  - Addressing the unintended consequences of tropical forest restoration for people and biodiversity.
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Earlier this year, the media reported on a major new report (endorsed by most governments) that drew attention to the decline in natural ecosystems on our planet, and why this matters for human wellbeing. There are now growing calls for governments and society to address environmental issues - for example, the support for Greta Thunberg's climate strikes. Some governments are now working towards this: for example, by committing to restore natural ecosystems and reforest degraded lands. This is based on evidence suggesting that dangerous global warming could be stopped if greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation (and fossil fuel use) are halted, and if forest restoration locked up carbon. The growing interest in restoration sounds like a good thing, but it could have unintended consequences if not carefully planned. Natural ecosystems, agriculture, the world economy, and patterns of consumption and trade are connected in a global system. So, for example, taking pasture land out of production to plant forests might indirectly drive deforestation somewhere else, if the demand for pasture is not addressed. This makes designing successful policies about the environment very difficult. It is now a huge and urgent challenge to incorporate our understanding of how social, economic and ecological systems interact, and to develop tools that integrate our understanding and allow us to make informed decisions.  I am applying for this fellowship to learn from experts in systems analysis at The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), and UK scientists who study how the interactions between people and forests can best be understood and modelled. Systems analysis is a research approach generally defined as: the science of objectively formulating and solving complex problems, typically with many feedbacks. Understanding land use change is a typical example where system analysis is helpful, as there are many drivers of change (agriculture, energy, infrastructure, conservation), many linked policies, and complex feedbacks between them all. During the fellowship I will do three things. Firstly, I will bring together two approaches for modelling future land use change (e.g. forest conversion to agriculture). This will enable a much better understanding of how different policies could affect future land use change. Thanks to my prior experience and training, and the expertise of experienced scientists at IIASA and in the UK who will help me develop the relevant skills, this is achievable. I will test whether these models are a real improvement over what was available before by comparing model results to observations of real land use change in the past. Secondly, I will apply my model to the real case study of Colombia, a leader in forest restoration (with a national restoration plan) which has exceptional unique wildlife and ecosystems. I will use the model to predict what might happen by 2040 if forest restoration occurs as planned. I will ask if restoring forests changes other patterns of land use relative to no restoration. In particular, does this actually cause increased deforestation elsewhere? I will then assess the expected effect of future land use on biodiversity (especially endemic species that only live in Colombia) and ecosystem services (carbon draw down and storage, water quality and quantity). I will also ask if different government policies would have different outcomes, and assess the relative importance of global trade. It is my goal that the outputs of this research are used to directly inform policies that result in better outcomes for nature and people. Finally, I will build collaborations between experts at IIASA and scientists here in the UK, who are all interested in these complex, interconnected questions of great global importance. The aim is for this fellowship to kick start a range of collaborations which will outlast my three years of funding, and help me build my future research career.

TI  - Evaluating the Role of Community-Managed Forest in Carbon Sequestration and Climate Change Mitigation of Tripura, India
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Community-based forest management provides an opportunity to build a sustainable link with ecology for meeting future needs. A study was carried out to understand the effect of management strategies on the biodiversity, soil nutrient, and carbon stock of two community forests practiced by Jamatia (JCF) and Halam (HCF) tribes of Tripura, northeast India. The forest managed by Jamatia is community conserved, whereas the Joint Forest Management (JFM) regulation issued by the Government of India was implemented in Halam community-based forest. JCF showed higher tree diversity (2.741) than HCF (2.176), while there was no significant variation in the total number of species in these forests. Anogeissus acuminata, Schima wallichii, and Terminalia bellirica were the most dominant species in JCF and HCF. A relatively higher amount of organic matter, nitrogen, and phosphorus content was found in JCF soils. JCF showed higher carbon stock (342.9 Mg C ha(-1)) than HCF (158.7 Mg C ha(-1)). A positive and significant correlation of SOC concentration was observed with soil moisture, SOM, and soil nutrient content. The results show that both stands were at developmental stages; however, regular extraction of biomass from HCF was attributable to lower carbon stock. We found that the Jamatia communities are proactively involved in the conservation of forests and sustainable management of biodiversity under their control. The results reveal that the agent of management can play a vital role in enhancing tree diversity, soil properties, and carbon stock in community forests.

TI  - Trade-offs between biodiversity conservation and economic development in tropical forests
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Biodiversity conservation and poverty alleviation are two of humanity's most significant challenges. Historically these problems have been tackled in isolation, yet it is becoming increasingly clear that they are inextricably linked and need to be dealt with together. Human well-being depends not only on the provision of food and water, but also on the preservation of other ecosystem services, including the conservation of species and ecosystems and the many benefits we derive from them. Nevertheless, balancing environmental and economic goals is difficult, and win-win solutions (where economic development and biodiversity conservation can occur in the same place) are very rare. Progress towards a sustainable economy requires meeting two challenges; first that we stand up to the problem of combining development and conservation goals, and second that we maximise our efficiency in devising strategies that satisfy both goals. In areas where there is strong competition for land it is vital that we understand the social and economic cost of taking conservation action. By embracing the human dimension of land-use planning this project will help provide the piece of the jigsaw necessary to lift conservation away from being an academic exercise to address real-world issues. Arguably the greatest cost of conservation action is the cost to society when protecting wildlife means lost economic opportunities / what economists call 'opportunity costs'. Yet how incompatible are different economic land-uses with the protection of native species? How much more money could potentially be made in any given landscape? Providing answers to these questions is an urgent task in the Brazilian Amazon, where aggressive economic growth and high rates of deforestation threaten the chance of sustainable development in the remaining forest. Understanding the overlap between biodiversity and economic land value is therefore key to developing more sustainable forest management, and is the primary aim of this research. During my earlier work in the Brazilian Amazon I showed that dung beetles and birds were both excellent indicators of human disturbance in forest ecosystems. I shall combine existing data on these species with new field studies, to understand the conservation value of different agricultural (e.g. soybean, cattle pastures, perennial crops) and forestry (e.g. selective logging and plantation forestry) land-uses. Work will be conducted in five areas of the Amazon, and will help determine the importance of different ecological and social factors that may influence economic land-use choices. I will also collect information on the potential increase in profits that could be gained from each area of land if it was put to a more productive use. These potential improvements in income are the opportunity costs to society by interventions to conserve wildlife (e.g. reserves and parks) and/or inefficient land-uses. Comparing conservation value with the cost of foregoing economic opportunities (e.g. moving from shade to sun coffee plantations) will allow me to quantify the trade-offs between immediate human needs and nature conservation. A range of outcomes are possible: some forms of land-use may incur limited ecological losses but allow significant economic gains, while other forms of intensification may be less compatible with conservation goals. The results of this project will provide a very practical step in addressing the call by the international community, articulated in the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity, for a unified approach to managing entire ecosystems. Specifically I will develop a tool for guiding strategic land-use planning that is able to identify both inefficiencies in current and planned land-uses, as well as methods of income generation that require minimal additional deforestation or habitat degradation.

TI  - Forest resilience and tipping points at different spatio-temporal scales: approaches and challenges
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - 1. Anthropogenic global change compromises forest resilience, with profound impacts to ecosystem functions and services. This synthesis paper reflects on the current understanding of forest resilience and potential tipping points under environmental change and explores challenges to assessing responses using experiments, observations and models.2. Forests are changing over a wide range of spatio-temporal scales, but it is often unclear whether these changes reduce resilience or represent a tipping point. Tipping points may arise from interactions across scales, as processes such as climate change, land-use change, invasive species or deforestation gradually erode resilience and increase vulnerability to extreme events. Studies covering interactions across different spatio-temporal scales are needed to further our understanding.3. Combinations of experiments, observations and process-based models could improve our ability to project forest resilience and tipping points under global change. We discuss uncertainties in changing CO2 concentration and quantifying tree mortality as examples.4. Synthesis. As forests change at various scales, it is increasingly important to understand whether and how such changes lead to reduced resilience and potential tipping points. Understanding the mechanisms underlying forest resilience and tipping points would help in assessing risks to ecosystems and presents opportunities for ecosystem restoration and sustainable forest management.

TI  - Data_Sheet_1_Ancient fires enhance Amazon forest drought resistance.PDF
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data set
AB  - Drought and fire reduce productivity and increase tree mortality in tropical forests. Fires also produce pyrogenic carbon (PyC), which persists in situ for centuries to millennia, and represents a legacy of past fires, potentially improving soil fertility and water holding capacity and selecting for the survival and recruitment of certain tree life-history (or successional) strategies. We investigated whether PyC is correlated with physicochemical soil properties, wood density, aboveground carbon (AGC) dynamics and forest resistance to severe drought. To achieve our aim, we used an Amazon-wide, long-term plot network, in forests without known recent fires, integrating site-specific measures of forest dynamics, soil properties and a unique soil PyC concentration database. We found that forests with higher concentrations of soil PyC had both higher soil fertility and lower wood density. Soil PyC was not associated with AGC dynamics in non-drought years. However, during extreme drought events (10% driest years), forests with higher concentrations of soil PyC experienced lower reductions in AGC gains (woody growth and recruitment), with this drought-immunizing effect increasing with drought severity. Forests with a legacy of ancient fires are therefore more likely to continue to grow and recruit under increased drought severity. Forests with high soil PyC concentrations (third quartile) had 3.8% greater AGC gains under mean drought, but 33.7% greater under the most extreme drought than forests with low soil PyC concentrations (first quartile), offsetting losses of up to 0.68 Mg C ha-1yr-1 of AGC under extreme drought events. This suggests that ancient fires have legacy effects on current forest dynamics, by altering soil fertility and favoring tree species capable of continued growth and recruitment during droughts. Therefore, mature forest that experienced fires centuries or millennia ago may have greater resistance to current short-term droughts. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - Effects of silvicultural intensification on timber yields, carbon dynamics, and tree species composition in a dipterocarp forest in Kalimantan, Indonesia: An individual-tree-based model simulation
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Nature conservation through sustainable forest management is challenged in the tropics by unnecessarily destructive but selective logging and diminishing timber yields. Silvicultural treatments beyond reduced impact logging are often recommended to increase timber stocking, tree growth, and profits. Despite lack of large-scale and long-term scientific support, Indonesia has embarked on large-scale silvicultural intensification, To fill this information gap, we assessed the timber, carbon, and tree species composition consequences of different silvicultural practices in dipterocarp forests in Kalimantan, Indonesia.With data from 30 1-ha sample plots monitored for up to 20 years after silvicultural intervention coupled with a new forest growth and yield model simulation (SILFOR), we evaluated the long-term consequences of the following silvicultural practices: once logged with a minimum cutting diameter (MCD) of 60 cm (L60); once logged followed by under-planting with seedlings of commercial timber species (L6OUP); twice logged with MCDs of 60 cm and then 40 cm (L60L40); and, twice logged followed by strip planting along cleared lines (L60L4OSP).The results indicate that timber yields will not be sustained by L60 or L60L40 even if cutting cycles are extended from the current minimum of 30 years to 60 years. In contrast, yields from enrichment planted logged-over forests will recover to levels higher than the first cut if cutting cycles are extended to 50 years for 1.60UP and to 40 years for L60L4OSP. Under these intensive silvicultural regimes, biomass carbon stocks also recover to primary forests levels, but with increased representation of commercial species. Although silviculturally successful, the financial consequences of these approaches to management intensification remain to be scrutinized. ( C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Contribution of terrestrial ecosystems to carbon sequestration. This article focuses on the contribution of natural ecosystems (forests, grasslands) and agrosystems to carbon sequestration either in biomass or in soil. Carbon stocks are important (650 Gt in biomass, 1500 to 2000 Gt in soils as compared with 750 for atmospheric CO2), and also fluxes that led to CO2 emissions in the past (due to deforestation or cultivation) and which now turn to carbon sequestration (2 Gt(C)/year). This article shows great spatial variations in stocks and fluxes and great measurement difficulties, especially for stock variations. Anthropic actions such as reforestation (mainly in the North), changes in land use or in crop management, can increase carbon sequestration in biomass or soil, with a residence time of several decades, which is not insignificant with respect to the Kyoto protocol and which also has other environmental (C) 2003 Academie des sciences.

TI  - Reassessing the environmental impacts of sugarcane ethanol production in Brazil to help meet sustainability goals
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - The potential for sugarcane ethanol from Brazil to mitigate GHG emissions is undeniable, but the way that ethanol is produced during the agricultural and industrial phases will ultimately determine its benefits to society. In this paper, we evaluate the environmental impacts of sugarcane agriculture and ethanol production in Brazil as management practices continue to change and production expands to new frontiers. We focused our evaluation on the impacts on water, atmosphere, and soils, including how the application of organic and inorganic fertilizers and the accumulation of crop residue in the field affect emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). We also addressed the impacts of land use changes on threatened biomes and discussed some of the present obstacles regarding conservation and restoration efforts. We concluded that, since a similar assessment was put forth in 2008, our knowledge about the environmental impacts of sugarcane ethanol in Brazil has advanced with regard to soil degradation, nitrogen dynamics, and soil carbon stocks. However, more information is still needed about the impacts of the increasing use of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers in sugarcane agriculture, especially on water resources. Furthermore, without a better understanding about how landscape fragmentation affects the biodiversity of terrestrial and aquatic tropical ecosystems and the services they provide, policies created to protect and restore them may be ineffective. On the other hand, the use of presently available scientific information to end unsustainable farming and the implementation of conservation strategies proposed by the Brazilian Forest Code could be a first step to guarantee that ethanol is produced more sustainably in Brazil.

TI  - Vegetation ecology and carbon sequestration potential of shrubs in tropics of Chhattisgarh, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests are well known to have great species diversity and contribute substantial share in terrestrial carbon (C) stocks worldwide. Shrubs are long-neglected life form in the forest ecosystem, playing many roles in the forest and human life. Shrub has great impact on vegetation attributes which in turn modify the C storage and capture. In the present investigation, an attempt has been made to explore the dynamics of shrub species in four fire regimes, viz. high, medium, low, and no fire zones of Bhoramdeo Wildlife Sanctuary of Kawardha forest division (Chhattisgarh), India. The variations in structure, diversity, biomass, productivity, and C sequestration potential in all the sites were quantified. The density and basal area of shrub varied from 1250 to 3750 individuals ha(-1) and 2.79 to 4.92 m(2) ha(-1), respectively. The diversity indices showed that the value of Shannon index was highest in medium fire zone (3.77) followed by high, low, and no fire zones as 3.25, 3.12, and 2.32, respectively. The value of Simpson's index or concentration of dominance (Cd) ranged from 0.08 to 0.20, species richness from 0.56 to 1.58, equitability from 1.41 to 1.44, and beta diversity from 1.50 to 4.20, respectively. The total biomass and C storage ranged from 6.82 to 15.71 and from 2.93 to 6.76 t ha(-1), respectively. The shrub density, importance value index (IVI), and abundance to frequency ratio (A/F) significantly correlated between high fire and medium fire zone. The basal area was found to be significantly positively correlated between high fire and medium fire, and low and no fire zones, respectively. Two-way cluster analysis reflected various patterns of clustering due to influence of the forest fire which showed that some species have distant clustering while some have smaller cluster. Principal component analysis (PCA) reflects variable scenario with respect to shrub layer. Ventilago calyculata and Zizyphus rotundifolia showed higher correlation between themselves in terms of basal area (BA). The total shrub production was 1.59-3.53 t ha(-1) year(-1) while the C sequestration potential of 0.71-1.57 t ha(-1) year(-1) under different fire regimes. Shrub community in the medium fire zone reflected higher productivity and higher C sequestration in comparison to other fire zone. Among the different plant parts, the biomass accumulation ratio was highest in the root of shrub community among various fire regimes. Screening of species for restoration and different land-use pattern on the basis of biomass accumulation and carbon sequestering potential would be an effective strategy for decision-making in sustainable forest management.

TI  - Change in soil carbon following afforestation
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Quantifying changes in soil C may be an important consideration under large-scale afforestation or reforestation. We reviewed global data on changes in soil C following afforestation, available from 43 published or unpublished studies, encompassing 204 sites. Data were highly variable, with soil C either increasing or decreasing, particularly in young (<10-year) forest stands. Because studies varied in the number of years since forest establishment and the initial soil C content, we calculated change in soil C as a weighted-average (i.e. sum of C change divided by sum of years since forest establishment) relative to the soil C content under previous agricultural systems at <10, >10 and <30 cm sampling depths. On average, soil C in the <10 cm (or <30 cm) layers generally decreased by 3.46% per year (or 0.63% per year) relative to the initial soil C content during the first 5 years of afforestation, followed by a decrease in the rate of decline and eventually recovery to C contents found in agricultural soils at about age 30. In plantations older than 30 years, C content was similar to that under the previous agricultural systems within the surface 10 cm of soil, yet at other sampling depths, soil C had increased by between 0.50 and 0.86% per year. Amounts of C lost or gained by soil are generally small compared with accumulation of C in tree biomass.The most important factors affecting change in soil C were previous land use, climate and the type of forest established. Results suggest that most soil C was lost when softwoods, particularly Pinus radiata plantations, were established on ex-improved pastoral land in temperate regions. Accumulation of soil C was greatest when deciduous hardwoods, or N-2-fixing species (either as an understorey or as a plantation), were established on ex-cropped land in tropical or subtropical regions. Long-term management regimes (e.g. stocking, weed control, thinning, fertiliser application and fire management) may also influence accumulation of soil C. Accumulation is maximised by maintaining longer (20-50 years) forest rotations. Furthermore, inclusion of litter in calculations reversed the observed average decrease in soil C, so that amount of C in soil and litter layer was greater than under preceding pasture.

TI  - Developing Cost-Effective Field Assessments of Carbon Stocks in Human-Modified Tropical Forests
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Across the tropics, there is a growing financial investment in activities that aim to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, such as REDD+. However, most tropical countries lack on-the-ground capacity to conduct reliable and replicable assessments of forest carbon stocks, undermining their ability to secure long-term carbon finance for forest conservation programs. Clear guidance on how to reduce the monetary and time costs of field assessments of forest carbon can help tropical countries to overcome this capacity gap. Here we provide such guidance for cost-effective one-off field assessments of forest carbon stocks. We sampled a total of eight components from four different carbon pools (i.e. aboveground, dead wood, litter and soil) in 224 study plots distributed across two regions of eastern Amazon. For each component we estimated survey costs, contribution to total forest carbon stocks and sensitivity to disturbance. Sampling costs varied thirty-one-fold between the most expensive component, soil, and the least, leaf litter. Large live stems (>= 10 cm DBH), which represented only 15% of the overall sampling costs, was by far the most important component to be assessed, as it stores the largest amount of carbon and is highly sensitive to disturbance. If large stems are not taxonomically identified, costs can be reduced by a further 51%, while incurring an error in aboveground carbon estimates of only 5% in primary forests, but 31% in secondary forests. For rapid assessments, necessary to help prioritize locations for carbon-conservation activities, sampling of stems >= 20cm DBH without taxonomic identification can predict with confidence (R-2 = 0.85) whether an area is relatively carbon-rich or carbon-poor-an approach that is 74% cheaper than sampling and identifying all the stems >= 10cm DBH. We use these results to evaluate the reliability of forest carbon stock estimates provided by the IPCC and FAO when applied to human-modified forests, and to highlight areas where cost savings in carbon stock assessments could be most easily made.

TI  - An Amazonian rainforest and its fragments as a laboratory of global change
T2  - BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - We synthesize findings from one of the world's largest and longest-running experimental investigations, the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP). Spanning an area of similar to 1000 km(2) in central Amazonia, the BDFFP was initially designed to evaluate the effects of fragment area on rainforest biodiversity and ecological processes. However, over its 38-year history to date the project has far transcended its original mission, and now focuses more broadly on landscape dynamics, forest regeneration, regional- and global-change phenomena, and their potential interactions and implications for Amazonian forest conservation. The project has yielded a wealth of insights into the ecological and environmental changes in fragmented forests. For instance, many rainforest species are naturally rare and hence are either missing entirely from many fragments or so sparsely represented as to have little chance of long-term survival. Additionally, edge effects are a prominent driver of fragment dynamics, strongly affecting forest microclimate, tree mortality, carbon storage and a diversity of fauna.Even within our controlled study area, the landscape has been highly dynamic: for example, the matrix of vegetation surrounding fragments has changed markedly over time, succeeding from large cattle pastures or forest clearcuts to secondary regrowth forest. This, in turn, has influenced the dynamics of plant and animal communities and their trajectories of change over time. In general, fauna and flora have responded differently to fragmentation: the most locally extinction-prone animal species are those that have both large area requirements and low tolerance of the modified habitats surrounding fragments, whereas the most vulnerable plants are those that respond poorly to edge effects or chronic forest disturbances, and that rely on vulnerable animals for seed dispersal or pollination.Relative to intact forests, most fragments are hyperdynamic, with unstable or fluctuating populations of species in response to a variety of external vicissitudes. Rare weather events such as droughts, windstorms and floods have had strong impacts on fragments and left lasting legacies of change. Both forest fragments and the intact forests in our study area appear to be influenced by larger-scale environmental drivers operating at regional or global scales. These drivers are apparently increasing forest productivity and have led to concerted, widespread increases in forest dynamics and plant growth, shifts in tree-community composition, and increases in liana (woody vine) abundance. Such large-scale drivers are likely to interact synergistically with habitat fragmentation, exacerbating its effects for some species and ecological phenomena. Hence, the impacts of fragmentation on Amazonian biodiversity and ecosystem processes appear to be a consequence not only of local site features but also of broader changes occurring at landscape, regional and even global scales.

TI  - Carbon and nitrogen in a temperate agroforestry system: Using stable isotopes as a tool to understand soil dynamics
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural exchanges of carbon (C) between the atmosphere, the oceans, and terrestrial ecosystems are currently being modified through human activities as a result of fossil fuel burning and the conversion of tropical forests to agricultural land. These activities have led to a steady increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) over the last two Centuries. The goal of this study was to determine the potential of temperate agroforestry systems to sequester C in soil. Therefore, changes in the soil organic C (SOC) and nitrogen (N) pools were quantified and the delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotope technique was applied to assess soil C and N dynamics in a 13-year old hybrid poplar alley cropping system in Southern Canada. Results from this study showed that after 13 years of alley cropping the SOC and N pools did not differ significantly (p = 0.01) with distance from the tree row, although a trend of a larger SOC and N pool near the tree row could be observed. Soil organic C after 13 years of alley cropping, was 19 mg C g(-1) compared to 11 mg C g(-1) upon initiation of agroforestry. Soil organic C and N were not evenly distributed throughout the plow layer. The largest C and N pool occurred in the top 20 cm, which is due to the accumulation of organic material in the upper horizons as a result of no-till cultivation. The entire soil, to a 40 cm depth, showed a delta(13) C shift to that of C-3 residue. This shift reflects the greater input of residues from C3 plants such as that derived from beans, wheat, and hybrid poplar leaf litterfall. The proportion of C derived from a C-3 source ranged from 64 to 69% to a 40 cm depth. The soil delta N-15 signature of this study is similar to that of mineral soil, and reflect values characteristic of N mineralization processes. However, the entire soil shows a positive shift in delta N-15 as a result of historical additions of manure and current use of mineral fertilizers, and ongoing processes of denitrification and nitrate leaching, which leads to an enrichment of the soil.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing food production and mitigating climate change are two primary but seemingly contradictory objectives for tropical landscapes. This special feature examines synergies and trade-offs among these objectives. Four themes emerge from the papers: the important roles of both forest and agriculture sectors for climate mitigation in tropical countries; the minor contribution from deforestation-related agricultural expansion to overall food production at global and continental scales; the opportunities for synergies between improved food production and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions through diversion of agricultural expansion to already-cleared lands, improved soil, crop, and livestock management, and agroforestry; and the need for targeted policy and management interventions to make these synergistic opportunities a reality. We conclude that agricultural intensification is a key factor to meet dual objectives of food production and climate mitigation, but there is no single panacea for balancing these objectives in all tropical landscapes. Place-specific strategies for sustainable land use emerge from assessments of current land use, demographics, and other biophysical and socioeconomic characteristics, using a whole-landscape, multisector perspective.

TI  - Priority science can accelerate agroforestry as a natural climate solution
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of agroforestry could provide substantial climate change mitigation (up to 0.31 Pg C yr-1), comparable to other prominent natural climate solutions such as reforestation. Yet, climate-focused agroforestry efforts grapple with ambiguity about which agroforestry actions provide mitigation, uncertainty about the magnitude of that mitigation and inability to reliably track progress. In this Perspective, we define agroforestry as a natural climate solution, discuss current understanding of the controls on farm-scale mitigation potential and highlight recent innovation on emergent, high-resolution remote sensing methods to enable detection, measurement and monitoring. We also assess the status of agroforestry in the context of global climate ambitions, highlighting regions of underappreciated expansion opportunity and identifying priorities for policy and praxis.In this Perspective, the authors highlight agroforestry as a natural climate solution, discussing definitional refinements, controls on mitigation potential and remote sensing innovations. They assess the status of agroforestry in the context of climate ambitions, identifying key areas and opportunities.

TI  - Carbon, Fossil Fuel, and Biodiversity Mitigation With Wood and Forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Life-cycle analyses, energy analyses, and a range of utilization efficiencies were developed to determine the carbon dioxide (CO2) and fossil fuel (FF) saved by various solid wood products, wood energy, and unharvested forests. Some products proved very efficient in CO2 and FF savings, while others did not. Not considering forest regrowth after harvest or burning if not harvested, efficient products save much more CO2 than the standing forest; but wood used only for energy generally saves slightly less. Avoided emissions (using wood in place of steel and concrete) contributes the most to CO2 and FF savings compared to the product and wood energy contributions. Burning parts of the harvested logs that are not used for products creates an additional CO2 and FF savings. Using wood substitutes could save 14 to 31% of global CO2 emissions and 12 to 19% of global FF consumption by using 34 to 100% of the world's sustainable wood growth. Maximizing forest CO2 sequestration may not be compatible with biodiversity. More CO2 can be sequestered synergistically in the products or wood energy and landscape together than in the unharvested landscape. Harvesting sustainably at an optimum stand age will sequester more carbon in the combined products, wood energy, and forest than harvesting sustainably at other ages.

AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive and consistent methodology to account for the incremental costs and net changes in carbon stocks for different categories of forestry and biomass energy projects. The methodology allows consistent comparisons of the costs and quantities of carbon stored in different types of projects and/or national programs, facilitating the inclusion of forestry and biomass energy projects in a possible CO2 emission reduction regime. The framework presented includes guidelines for defining a reference case against which carbon-storage projects are compared, a carbon-storage accounting method based on simple analytic techniques for one-time terrestrial sinks, an endowment approach to incremental costing, and a discussion of local benefits and risk factors.

TI  - Agroforestry as a strategy for the recovery and conservation of carbon stocks in Amazon forests
T2  - BOSQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous changes in land use in the Amazon in recent years, mainly due to the conversion of forests through agricultural and extractive practices, have resulted in serious alterations in the structure and functioning of ecosystems with impacts at regional and global scales. The replacement of tropical forests by itinerant agricultural systems is one of the main reasons contributing to carbon emissions into the atmosphere and becoming one of the most important environmental impacts. However, there are documented mechanisms for reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD+), i) controlling the emission reduction sources through conservation and sustainable management of the forest, and ii) recovering and increasing plant biomass as important sinks through forest restoration strategies. In order to increase efficiency in the recovery and conservation of carbon in vulnerable deforested and degraded forest areas of the Amazon, our objective was to develop an analysis of the potential environmental impacts of agroforestry as a REDD+ alternative, through i) rehabilitation of degraded areas subjected to successive fire and crop cycles, ii) passive restoration of secondary forests, and iii) implementation of improved fallows managing agroforestry species. Agroforestry is an important alternative to recover and conserve carbon stocks through REDD+ activities against the shifting cultivation in the Amazon.

TI  - A network to understand the changing socio-ecology of the southern African woodlands (SEOSAW): Challenges, benefits, and methods
T2  - PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET
M3  - Article
AB  - Societal Impact StatementThe sustainable management of the southern African woodlands is closely linked to the livelihoods of over 150 M people. Findings from the Socio-Ecological Observatory for the Southern African Woodlands (SEOSAW) will underpin the sustainability of two of the largest industries on the continent: woodfuels and timber. SEOSAW will also improve our understanding of how human use shapes the biogeography and functioning of these ecosystems.SummaryHere we describe a new network of researchers and long-term, in situ, measurements that will characterize the changing socio-ecology of the woodlands of southern Africa. These woodlands encompass the largest savanna in the world, but are chronically understudied, with few long-term measurements. A network of permanent sample plots (PSPs) is required to: (a) address management issues, particularly related to sustainable harvesting for energy and timber; (b) understand how the woodlands are responding to a range of global and local drivers, such as climate change, CO2 fertilization, and harvesting; and (c) answer basic questions about biogeography, ecosystem function, and the role humans play in shaping the ecology of the region. We draw on other successful networks of PSPs and adapt their methods to the specific challenges of working in southern African woodlands. In particular we suggest divergences from established forest monitoring protocols that are needed to (a) adapt to a high level of ecosystem structural diversity (from open savanna to dry forest); (b) quantify the chronic disturbances by people, fire, and herbivores; (c) quantify the diversity and function of the understory of grasses, forbs, and shrubs; (d) understand the life histories of resprouting trees; and (e) conduct work in highly utilized, human-dominated landscapes. We conclude by discussing how the SEOSAW network will integrate with remote sensing and modeling approaches. Throughout, we highlight the challenges inherent to integrating work by forest and savanna ecologists, and the wide range of skills needed to fully understand the socio-ecology of the southern African woodlands.

TI  - Derivation and validation of a pedotransfer function for estimating the bulk density of tropical forest soils
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Bulk density (rho(b)), a soil physical property critical for estimating soil carbon storing potentials, is often under-reported in many tropical soil databases because of the difficulty and tedious nature of its measurement in the field. In this study, a pedotransfer function was developed to estimate the bulk density of topsoils (0-30 cm) of Nimbia Forest Reserve, Nigeria. Easily measured soil variables including sand content, total organic carbon and moisture contents were used as predictor variables. A pedotransfer function (PTF) was derived based on multiple linear regression model. Bulk density values for the forest soils varied from 0.78 to 1.28 g/cm(3) with a mean value of 1.03 g/cm(3). All the metrics used for the validation of the pedotransfer function show the model is statistically significant confirming its usefulness. The RMSE, R-squared and MAE of the pedotransfer function are 0.07498, 0.42231 and 0.058934, respectively. Given that this is the first PTF developed for bulk density estimation in the study area, we recommend a comparison of this new model with others that can be developed using machine learning algorithms and other statistical techniques. The PTF developed in this study will find application in the calculation of the soil organic carbon stocks in the Nimbia Forest Reserve to provide baseline estimates-a decision support tool for sustainable soil management and possible climate change mitigation.

TI  - Linking above and belowground carbon sequestration, soil organic matter properties, and soil health in Brazilian Atlantic Forest restoration
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest restoration mitigates climate change by removing CO2 and storing C in terrestrial ecosystems. However, incomplete information on C storage in restored tropical forests often fails to capture the ecosystem's holistic C dynamics. This study provides an integrated assessment of C storage in above to belowground subsystems, its consequences for greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes, and the quantity, quality, and origin of soil organic matter (SOM) in restored Atlantic forests in Brazil. Relations between SOM properties and soil health indicators were also explored. We examined two restorations using tree planting ('active restoration'): an 8-year-old forest with green manure and native trees planted in two rounds, and a 15-year-old forest with native-planted trees in one round without green manure. Restorations were compared to reformed pasture and primary forest sites. We measured C storage in soil layers (0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm), litter, and plants. GHG emissions were assessed using CH4 and CO2 fluxes. SOM quantity was evaluated using C and N, quality using humification index (HLIFS), and origin using & delta;13C and & delta;15N. Nine soil health indicators were interrelated with SOM attributes. The primary forest presented the highest C stocks (107.7 Mg C ha-1), followed by 15- and 8-year-old restorations and pasture with 69.8, 55.5, and 41.8 Mg C ha-1, respectively. Soil C stocks from restorations and pasture were 20% lower than primary forest. However, 8- and 15-year-old restorations stored 12.3 and 28.3 Mg ha-1 more aboveground C than pasture. The younger forest had & delta;13C and & delta;15N values of 2.1 and 1.7 & PTSTHOUSND;, respectively, lower than the 15-year-old forest, indicating more C derived from C3 plants and biological N fixation. Both restorations and pasture had at least 34% higher HLIFS in deeper soil layers (10-30 cm) than primary forest, indicating a lack of labile SOM. Native and 15-year-old forests exhibited higher soil methane influx (141.1 and 61.9 & mu;g m-2 h-1). Forests outperformed pasture in most soil health indicators, with 69% of their variance explained by SOM properties. However, SOM quantity and quality regeneration in both restorations approached the pristine forest state only in the top 10 cm layer, while deeper soil retained agricultural degradation legacies. In conclusion, active restoration of the Atlantic Forest is a superior approach compared to pasture reform for GHG mitigation. Nonetheless, the development of restoration techniques to facilitate labile C input into deeper soil layers (>10 cm) is needed to further improve soil multifunctionality and long-term C storage.

TI  - Aboveground Carbon Storage and Its Links to Stand Structure, Tree Diversity and Floristic Composition in South-Eastern Tanzania
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - African savannas and dry forests represent a large, but poorly quantified store of biomass carbon and biodiversity. Improving this information is hindered by a lack of recent forest inventories, which are necessary for calibrating earth observation data and for evaluating the relationship between carbon stocks and tree diversity in the context of forest conservation (for example, REDD+). Here, we present new inventory data from south-eastern Tanzania, comprising more than 15,000 trees at 25 locations located across a gradient of aboveground woody carbon (AGC) stocks. We find that larger trees disproportionately contribute to AGC, with the largest 3.7% of individuals containing half the carbon. Tree species diversity and carbon stocks were positively related, implying a potential functional relationship between the two, and a 'win-win' scenario for conservation; however, lower biomass areas also contain diverse species assemblages meaning that carbon-oriented conservation may miss important areas of biodiversity. Despite these variations, we find that total tree abundance and biomass is skewed towards a few locally dominant species, with eight and nine species (5.7% of the total) accounting for over half the total measured trees and carbon, respectively. This finding implies that carbon production in these areas is channelled through a small number of relatively abundant species. Our results provide key insights into the structure and functioning of these heterogeneous ecosystems and indicate the need for novel strategies for future measurement and monitoring of carbon stocks and biodiversity, including the use for larger plots to capture spatial variations in large tree density and AGC stocks, and to allow the calibration of earth observation data.

TI  - Greenhouse Gas Mitigation on Marginal Land: A Quantitative Review of the Relative Benefits of Forest Recovery versus Biofuel Production
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Decisions concerning future land-use/land cover change stand at the forefront of ongoing debates on how to best mitigate climate change. In this study, we compare the greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation value over a 30-year time frame for a range of forest recovery and biofuel production scenarios on abandoned agricultural land. Carbon sequestration in recovering forests is estimated based on a statistical analysis of tropical and temperate studies on marginal land. GHGs offset by biofuel production are analyzed for five different production pathways. We find that forest recovery is superior to low-yielding biofuel production scenarios such as oil palm and corn. Biofuel production scenarios with high yields, such as sugarcane or high-yielding energy grasses, can be comparable or superior to natural forest succession and to reforestation in some cases. This result stands in contrast to previous research suggesting that restoring degraded ecosystems to their native state is generally superior to agricultural production in terms of GHG mitigation. Further work is needed on carbon stock changes in forests, soil carbon dynamics, and bioenergy crop production on degraded/abandoned agricultural land. This finding also emphasizes the need to consider the full range of social, economic, and ecological consequences of land-use policies.

AB  - Ecological restoration is a leading strategy for reversing biodiversity losses and enhancing terrestrial carbon sequestration in degraded tropical forests. There have been few comprehensive assessments of recovery following restoration in fragmented forest landscapes, and the efficacy of active versus passive (i.e., natural regeneration) restoration remains unclear. We examined 11 indicators of forest structure, tree diversity and composition (adult and sapling), and aboveground carbon storage in 25 pairs of actively restored (AR; 7-15 yr after weed removal and mixed-native tree species planting) and naturally regenerating (NR) plots within degraded rainforest fragments, and in 17 less-disturbed benchmark (BM) rainforest plots in the Western Ghats, India. We assessed the effects of active restoration on the 11 indicators and tested the hypothesis that active restoration effects increase with isolation from contiguous and relatively intact rainforests. Active restoration significantly increased canopy cover, adult tree and sapling density, adult and sapling species density (overall and late successional), compositional similarity to benchmarks, and aboveground carbon storage, which recovered 14-82% toward BM targets relative to NR baselines. By contrast, tree height-diameter ratios and the proportion of native saplings did not recover consistently in actively restored forests. The effects of active restoration on canopy cover, species density (adult), late successional species density (adult and sapling), and species composition, but not carbon storage, increased with isolation across the fragmented landscape. Our findings show that active restoration can promote recovery of forest structure, composition, and carbon storage within 7-15 yr of restoration in degraded tropical rainforest fragments, although the benefits of active over passive restoration across fragmented landscapes would depend on indicator type and may increase with site isolation. These findings on early stages of recovery suggest that active restoration in ubiquitous fragmented landscapes of the tropics could complement passive restoration of degraded forests in less fragmented landscapes, and protection of intact forests, as a key strategy for conserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change.

AB  - In order to fulfill their commitments to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the industrialized countries started searching for cost-effective alternatives for reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. This has led to a rising interest in forestry-based carbon (C) offsets. Tree planting or silvicultural treatments can be used to actively remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Alternatively, conservation practices or improved forest management can be used to prevent or reduce current trends of carbon release from existing forests. In this paper, we describe a series of carbon offset projects that have been initiated using these approaches. A project involving planting of degraded forests in Sabah, Malaysia, is described in more detail. It is estimated that this project will offset 183 Mg C ha(-1) after a 60-yr rotation, or an average of 100 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) during the same rotation period.

TI  - Cost-effective restoration for carbon sequestration across Brazil's biomes
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical ecosystems are central to the global focus on halting and reversing habitat destruction as a means of mitigat-ing carbon emissions. Brazil has been highlighted as a vital part of global climate agreements because, whilst ongoing land-use change causes it to be the world's fifth biggest greenhouse gas emitting country, it also has one of the greatest potentials to implement ecosystem restoration. Global carbon markets provide the opportunity of a financially viable way to implement restoration projects at scale. However, except for rainforests, the restoration potential of many major tropical biomes is not widely recognised, with the result that carbon sequestration potential maybe squandered. We synthesize data on land availability, land degradation status, restoration costs, area of native vegetation remaining, carbon storage potential and carbon market prices for 5475 municipalities across Brazil's major biomes, including the savannas and tropical dry forests. Using a modelling analysis, we determine how fast restoration could be implemented across these biomes within existing carbon markets. We argue that even with a sole focus on carbon, we must restore other tropical biomes, as well as rainforests, to effectively increase benefits. The inclusion of dry forests and savannas doubles the area which could be restored in a financially viable manner, increasing the potential CO2e sequestered >40 % above that offered by rainforests alone. Importantly, we show that in the short-term avoiding emissions through conservation will be necessary for Brazil to achieve it's 2030 climate goal, because it can sequester 1.5 to 4.3 Pg of CO2e by 2030, relative to 0.127 Pg CO2e from restoration. However, in the longer term, restoration across all biomes in Brazil could draw down between 3.9 and 9.8 Pg of CO2e from the atmosphere by 2050 and 2080.

TI  - Opportunities for Small-Scale Forestry in Carbon Markets
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an explanatory framework of how greenhouse gas emissions offsets produced from natural and planted forests ('carbon forestry') feature in voluntary and regulated carbon markets. An introduction to the convoluted policy malaise surrounding the use of forests in regulated carbon markets is also presented. Whilst there are many opportunities and potential benefits of using forests to produce offsets, relatively few carbon forestry projects currently exist, particularly in regulated carbon markets. This seems due to financial, institutional and administrative obstacles, with prohibitive transaction costs often cited as the most prominent constraint to expanded carbon forestry development. The papers in this special issue present a wide coverage of carbon forestry development policy issues. The special issue provides a unique insight into the state of carbon forestry globally and highlights the pressing need for policy and market reform to facilitate more sustainable carbon forestry development.

T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - TOBON W, MARTINEZ-GARZA C & CAMPO J. 2011. Soil responses to restoration of a tropical pasture in Veracruz, south-eastern Mexico. Investigations were carried out on litter nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), and soil carbon (C), N and P in an active pasture, a mature tropical rainforest, and two treatments of restoration (cattle exclusion alone and combined with planting of tree seedling) in Veracruz, Mexico. The aim was to outline how the two treatments of restoration affect the recovery of soil nutrient status in the short-term (one year). Thirty years of cattle ranching activities decreased the litter N and P pools by a factor of 72 in the former and Si in the latter, largely reflecting differences in litter mass between pasture and mature forest. Pasture soils consistently had lower pools of organic C and total N and ammonium (NH4+) than forest soils. However, landuse did not affect the pool of soil nitrate (NO3-), and total and extractable P. Exclusion of grazing and exclusion of grazing plus planted tree seedlings increased N and P pools in the litter. In contrast, restoration treatments did not consistently affect soil C, N and P. The main response to restoration practices was a decrease of NO3- and extractable P pools in soils. Overall, we observed that, subsequent to these practices, there

TI  - Characterization of soil ecosystems in Costa Rica using microbial community metrics
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The goals of the research presented in this issue of Tropical Ecology were to demonstrate that differences in soil DNA-based microbial community characteristics, biomass, microbial activity, and C and N nutrient dynamics can be used as indicators of environmental change, specifically to show how land management, restoration strategies and climate change may be impacting the soil ecosystems of lowland forests and montane cloud forests of Costa Rica. In the studies conducted in lowland secondary forests, the bacterium Frankia was found to be critical for nitrogen-fixation in the soils associated with nitrogen-fixing tree Pentaclethra macroloba, but Frankia, Rhizobium, Archaea, and Type II methanotrophs were also collectively important in recuperation of the soil N and in enhancing microbial biomass C via more efficient use of organic C. These same secondary forest soils had greater levels of inorganic P and N, organic carbon, and microbial activity, and were more fungal-dominant soil ecosystem than grasslands of the same age. In. an adjacent,primary forest, the bromeliad Bromelia pinguin was found to demonstrate significant antifungal effects on the forest soil, resulting in decreases in fungal abundance, microbial biomass, and efficiency of organic C use. Lastly, in the Monteverde cloud forests, microbial metrics were used to show that habitats with the greatest soil moisture had more fungal-dominated soils, and unique fungal and bacterial population compositions. Given the importance of tropical soils in global C storage, their degradation, and current restoration efforts in these forests, as well as the very clear threat of decreases in precipitation due to climate change, belowground metrics should be considered as early indicators of the effects of forest restoration and/or further environmental disturbances. We hope that these articles will stimulate future studies in these important areas of Costa Rica.

TI  - Evaluating the role of plantations as carbon sinks: An example of an integrative approach from the humid tropics
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite their fast growth, tropical plantations are a small sink of atmospheric carbon because they occupy only a small area in relation to other land uses world-wide. Proper design and management of plantations can increase biomass accumulation rates, making them more effective C sinks. However, fast-growing plantations can extract large amounts of nutrients from the soil, and site fertility declines may limit sustained plantation forestry after a few rotations. We measured aboveground biomass accumulation, carbon sequestration, and soil chemistry in three young plantations of 12 indigenous tree species in pure and mixed designs in the humid lowlands of Costa Pica. Annual biomass increments for the three mixed plantations ranged from 10-13 Mg/ha. The mixtures of four species gave higher biomass per hectare than that obtained by the sum of one fourth hectare of each species in pure plots. At this early age of the plantations, estimated annual C sequestration values were comparable to other reports from young plantations of exotic species commonly grown in the tropics. Four years after planting, decreases in soil nutrients were apparent in pure plots of some of the fastest growing species, while beneficial effects on soils were noted under other species. The mixed plots showed intermediate values for the nutrients examined and, sometimes, improved soil conditions. A mixture of fast and slower growing species yields products at different times, with the slower growing species constituting a longer term sink for fixed carbon. Examination of the role of tropical plantations as C sinks necessitates integrative approaches that consider rates of C sequestration, potential deleterious effects on ecosystem nutrients, and economic, social, and environmental constraints.

TI  - Indigenous livelihoods, slash-and-burn agriculture, and carbon stocks in Eastern Panama
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Improved crop-fallow systems in the humid tropics can simultaneously sequester atmospheric carbon emissions and contribute to sustainable livelihoods of rural populations. A study with an indigenous community in eastern Panama revealed a considerable biophysical potential for carbon offsets in small-scale slash-and-burn agriculture through longer fallow periods, improved fallow management, secondary forest development, and agricultural intensification. Based on soil and biomass carbon measurements, estimated annual sequestration rates amount to 0.3-3.7 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). Despite such potential, the economic benefits of initiatives aimed at sequestration of carbon in the community are likely to be rather unequally distributed within the community. Heterogeneity in livelihood strategies and uneven asset endowments among households factors often overlooked in the ongoing carbon and sustainable development debate - are expected to strongly affect household participation. Indeed, only the better-endowed households that have also managed to diversify into more lucrative farm and non-farm activities are likely to be able to participate in and thus benefit from improved crop-fallow systems that capture carbon. Economic, ethical, institutional, and technical concerns need to be taken into account when designing community carbon management and investment plans. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impacts of a large-scale reforestation program on carbon storage dynamics in Guangdong, China
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the early 1980s, the province of Guangdong, China implemented a 10-year, large-scale reforestation program to counter environment degradation as a result of rapid economic development. Quantification of the contribution of this forest restoration program to carbon storage will provide critical information and guidance for designing future forest restoration and management strategies at the provincial level. The Guangdong Provincial Forest Inventory Database, together with our field sampling data was used to estimate carbon storage dynamics over the 10-year period of 1994-2003 for key restoration forest types as well as OBPA (open forest, bamboo forest, production forest and ambient trees). Various layers of forests were considered in calculating carbon storage: tree layers, understory vegetation and litterfall layers for the key forest types and bamboo forests; tree layers and litterfall layers for production forests; and only tree layers for open forest and ambient trees. Our results show that over the 10-year period, the reforestation program has increased total carbon storage by 41.67 Tg and forest carbon density by 1.58 Mg C ha(-1). Carbon storage in tree layers was the greatest among all layers studied. Carbon storage in litterfall and understory layers amounted to approximately 38%-44% of the total carbon storage, demonstrating that litter-fall and understory layers can not be neglected in estimating regional forest vegetation carbon storage in the sub-tropical forests. It was determined that coniferous forests provided the greatest contribution to total carbon, followed by broadleaved forests, OBPA, and mixed coniferous and broadleaved forests in decreasing order of magnitude. Among all key forest types, stands of P. massoniana had the greatest amount of carbon storage (from 59.65 to 65.87Tg) while Albizia falcataria (Linn.) Fosberg forest stands had the lowest (from 0.05 to 0.37 Tg). Over the 10-year period, carbon storage pools in maturescent forests, mature forests and post-mature forests were on the increasing trend, while those in young forests and middle-aged forests were declining and relatively stable, respectively. Our analysis also shows that the carbon accumulation rate in broadleaved forests (0.19-1.36 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) was the highest among the key forest types in Guangdong, which has important implications for selection of future forest restoration species.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variation of carbon stocks in a lowland tropical forest in West Africa
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the nature and cause of spatial and temporal variation in forest carbon is critical for implementation of climate mitigation strategies such as REDD. Such knowledge is lacking and hard to acquire in resource poor regions such as West Africa's Upper Guinea where benefits of such schemes for forest conservation could have great impact.We undertook a systematic and representative survey of an entire Upper Guinea forest - Gola Forest in southeast Sierra Leone - by measuring over 600 plots (0.125 ha) in order to quantify the level of spatial variation in C that might exist within a discrete forest type and relate this to historic and contemporary impacts on the forest. We modelled current C stocks and compared these with values calculated from historic surveys. Mean C content in above ground biomass was c. 160 Mg ha(-1). The southern part of the forest which was subject to heavier logging in the 1980s had a lower C content (121-144 Mg ha(-1)) compared to the less disturbed central areas (186 Mg ha(-1)). Volumes of extracted timber and distance to settlements around the forest explained 42% of the variation in C content. Elevation, slope and other metrics of human impact such as distance to roads did not explain significant additional variation. A survey from the 1950s recorded much higher carbon content than currently found in the south of the forest. This accords with evidence that commercial logging in this area was destructively high. However, old surveys from the late 1960s/early 1970s in less disturbed areas recorded lower carbon content than present. Most of the past surveys were in areas that had not yet been commercially logged so the accumulation in biomass in the last 40 years implies recovery from a much older disturbance event, or a change in environmental conditions promoting growth.As a typical Upper Guinean forest, our results from Gola demonstrate the long term impacts of disturbance events on carbon stocks and how these can vary greatly at small scales, highlighting the need for representative and regionally relevant empirical data to inform REDD type initiatives. Nonetheless these forests remain important for carbon sequestration and storage in the region despite this history and the parts of the forest with no recorded logging activity that increased in carbon in recent decades with levels now akin to undisturbed plots reported from elsewhere in the region demonstrate the sequestration potential these forests provide once adequately protected.

TI  - Important role of Pinus massoniana mixed forests in enhancing soil carbon stocks in degraded forests in southern China
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest degradation, including low-function forest (LFF), native forest destruction or transformation (NFDT), and subsequent soil erosion (SE), has occurred. Historically, single-species plantations rather than mixed forests have been used to offset forest losses. However, the important role of Pinus massoniana mixed forests (PMFs) at degraded sites in enhancing soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in southern China remains untested. Our meta- analysis included 1840 paired observations from 136 studies. The results demonstrated that converting P. massoniana pure forests (PPFs) to PMFs at degraded sites increased SOC stocks (0-100 cm) by 46.55%, which was 7.03 times greater than that at nondegraded sites. The PMFs at the SE sites sequestered significantly higher SOC stocks (2.40 and 4.35 times) than did those at the LFF and NFDT sites. At the LFF and SE sites, SOC stock increases were attributed to significant increases in litter biomass, root biomass, tree biomass, and tree OC stock. At the SE sites, converting bare lands to PMFs increased SOC stocks (0-100 cm) by 274.30%. At the NFDT sites, converting natural evergreen broadleaved forests (NEBFs) to PPFs significantly decreased the SOC stocks. However, SOC stocks remained unchanged after the conversion of NEBFs to PMFs. At the NFDT sites, the conversion of PPFs to PMFs increased SOC stocks by significantly increasing the contribution of soil microbial residue accumulation and microbial residue-carbon to SOC. The transformation of NEBFs into PMFs and PPFs significantly reduced soil microbial residue retention and microbial residue-carbon. Nevertheless, only PPFs significantly decreased the proportion of microbial residues in SOC to reduce SOC stocks. Together, transforming PPFs to PMFs in degraded areas significantly enhances SOC stocks but needs plant species richness not exceeding 20. Thus, PMF cannot replace NEBF, and NEBF requires adequate protection.

TI  - Peasants' Motivations to Maintain Vegetation of Tropical Dry Forests in Traditional Agroforestry Systems from Cuicatlan, Oaxaca, Mexico
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The ways traditional rural communities conduct activities to meet their livelihoods commonly contribute to conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Traditional agroforestry systems (TAFS) are expressions of management that deliberately retain wild vegetation coexisting with crops to obtain multiple socio-ecological contributions. However, processes enhancing productive intensification endanger their permanence. This study aimed to 1) identify the peasants' motivations to maintain the vegetation of tropical dry forest within their agricultural fields, 2) analyze the capacity of TAFS to provide contributions to people's well-being, and 3) identify factors and processes limiting conservation capacities and possible alternatives. The study was conducted in three communities of the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan Valley, Oaxaca, Mexico. We performed a qualitative analysis with information from two workshops with local people, 10 semi-structured interviews with managers of TAFS, participant observation, complementary informal talks, and fieldwork notes. For analyzing the data, we: 1) generated a list of central themes based on the data collected, 2) established preliminary categories of such themes, 3) coded all information through the Atlas. ti software, 4) adjusted the classification of categories and codes to the data, 5) grouped codes and analyzed their relationships. We found that the peasants' motivations to maintain the wild vegetation are the provision of multiple beneficial contributions: material (edible fruit, medicinal plants, fodder, firewood), regulating (shade, soil fertility, humidity keeping, rain attraction), and nonmaterial (regional flavors, ornamental, ritual), among others, which meet some of their fundamental needs (primarily subsistence, identity, and protection). The main reasons for keeping the wild vegetation were material contributions (62%). Also, we observed that TAFS safeguarding a higher forest cover and species diversity provide a broader range of socio-ecological contributions and potential to satisfy human needs than those with lower cover. Peasant agriculture may allow maintaining biodiversity while satisfying fundamental human needs. However, it needs to be revitalized, made more efficient, profitable, and dignified. The agroecological management implemented by peasants in TAFS is crucial for ensuring the continuity of essential environmental functions and people's well-being.

TI  - Effects of syn-pandemic fire reduction and reforestation in the tropical Americas on atmospheric CO2 during European conquest
T2  - PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - A new reconstruction of Late Holocene biomass burning in the tropical Americas is consistent with the expansion of fire use by Mesoamerican and Amazonian agriculturalists and a subsequent period of fire reduction beginning similar to 500 years BP. The marked reduction of biomass burning after similar to 500 years BP, a unique feature of the fire history of the tropical Americas relative to other regions of the globe, is synchronous with the collapse of the American indigenous population during pandemics accompanying European conquest. We predict that fire reduction contemporaneous with pandemics in the tropical Americas was associated with massive forest regeneration on similar to 5 x 10(5) km(2) of land and sequestration of 5-10 Gt C into the terrestrial biosphere, which contributed to the similar to 2% global reduction in atmospheric CO2 levels and the 0.1%. increase in delta C-13 of atmospheric CO2 from 1500 to 1750 A.D. This study 1) builds upon prior fire history reconstructions by synthesizing a substantially greater number of stratigraphic charcoal accumulation records and soil charcoal 14 C dates to resolve features of the Late Holocene biomass burning record in the tropical Americas; and 2) corroborates the hypothesis advanced by Ruddiman [Ruddiman, W.F., 2003. The Anthropogenic Era began thousands of years ago. Climatic Change 61, 261-293, Ruddiman, W.F., 2005. Plows, Plagues, and Petroleum.

T2  - MADERA Y BOSQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Attributes of the shrub and tree species components of the tropical deciduous forest within the Municipality of Queretaro, Queretaro are described. We used a random sampling of 36 sites of natural vegetation with exclusion criteria. Sites were delimited to a 25 m x 25 m quadrant. Within the quadrant, the species of all individuals of the tree and shrub species greater than 150 cm were identified, not taking into account the Cactaceae and Succulents. Measurements were made of the trees: basal diameter, diameter at breast height, total tree height, canopy height and diameter; carbon capture by species was estimated taking into account the climatic site variables, where they grow. Twenty-two species of shrubs and trees were observed, with Acacia schaffneri, Bursera fagaroides, Forestiera phillyreoides, Karwinskia humboldtiana, Dodonaea viscosa and Ipomea murucoides being the most abundant, while the ones with the highest carbon content are species such as: Prosopis laevigata and Leucaena leucocephala and the less abundant were Randia thurberi and Erytrina coralloides. These results are indispensable for developing and designing proposals for reforestation and conservation of the tropical deciduous forest.

TI  - CARBON SEQUESTRATION, BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT - INTEGRATED FOREST MANAGEMENT
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical deforestation provides a significant contribution to anthropogenic increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration that may lead to global warming. Forestation and other forest management options to sequester CO2 in the tropical latitudes may fail unless they address local economic, social, environmental, and political needs of people in the developing world. Forest management is discussed in terms of three objectives: carbon sequestration, sustainable development, and biodiversity conservation. An integrated forest management strategy of land-use planning is proposed to achieve these objectives and is centered around: preservation of primary forest, intensified use of nontimber resources, agroforestry, and selective use of plantation forestry.

TI  - Restoration of Pasture to Forest in Brazil's Mata Atlantica: The Roles of Herbivory, Seedling Defenses, and Plot Design in Reforestation
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, seedling growth and herbivory were monitored during the first 4 years of plot development in a large-scale reforestation experiment in Brazil's Atlantic Rainforest (Mata Atlantica). Seedlings were planted in a factorial design testing two levels of density, three levels of diversity, and the presence or absence of pioneer species at the Reserva Natural Vale in the Brazilian state of Espirito Santo. In addition, we studied the effect of herbivory on seedling growth and the potential for plant defenses to limit herbivory. Seedling growth was higher in the low-density plantings, and seedlings attained the greatest height in the low-diversity plots, which had a higher density of fast-growing species. The inclusion of pioneer species resulted in a significant decrease in the growth of neighboring seedlings. Interactions between herbivory, plant defenses, and seedling growth were complex. In general, defenses such as saponins and leaf toughness reduced herbivory, but when herbivory was high, seedling growth was reduced. Across treatments, mean height without herbivore damage was 240.8 cm, and with 50% herbivory mean height was 101.5 cm. Overall, to limit insect damage and promote seedling success, plant defense characteristics and ecological interactions should be carefully considered in reforestation projects.

TI  - Carbonated tiger-high above-ground biomass carbon stock in protected areas and corridors and its observed negative relationship with tiger population density and occupancy in the Terai Arc Landscape, Nepal
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Healthy natural forests maintain and/or enhances carbon stock while also providing potential habitat and an array of services to wildlife including large carnivores such as the tiger. This study is the first of its kind in assessing relationships between above-ground biomass carbon stock, tiger density and occupancy probability and its status in protected areas, corridors, and forest connectivity blocks. The dataset used to assess the relationship were: (1) Converged posterior tiger density estimates from camera trap data derived from Bayesian- Spatially Explicit Capture-Recapture model from Chitwan National Park; (2) Site wise probability of tiger occupancy estimated across the Terai Arc Landscape and (3) Habitat wise above-ground biomass carbon stock estimated across the Terai Arc Landscape. Carbon stock maps were derived based on eight habitat classes and conservation units linking satellite (Landsat 7 ETM+) images and field collected sampling data. A significant negative relationship (r = -0.20, p<0.01) was observed between above-ground biomass carbon stock and tiger density in Chitwan National Park and with tiger occupancy (r = -0.24, p = 0.023) in the landscape. Within protected areas, we found highest mean above-ground biomass carbon stock in high density mixed forest (similar to 223 tC/ha) and low in degraded scrubland (similar to 73.2 tC/ha). Similarly, we found: (1) highest tiger density similar to 0.06 individuals per 0.33 km(2) in the riverine forest and lowest estimates (similar to 0.00) in degraded scrubland; and (2) predictive tiger density of 0.0135 individuals per 0.33 km(2) is equivalent to mean total of 43.7 tC/ha in Chitwan National Park. Comparatively, we found similar above-ground biomass carbon stock among corridors, large forest connectivity blocks (similar to 117 tC/ha), and within in tiger bearing protected areas (similar to 119 tC/ha). Carbon conservation through forest restoration particularly in riverine habitats (forest and grassland) and low transitional state forests (degraded scrubland) provides immense opportunities to generate win-win solutions, sequester more carbon and maintain habitat integrity for tigers and other large predators.

TI  - Carbon sequestration potential in natural forests of Himachal Pradesh, India
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural forests play a key role in the mitigation of atmospheric carbon dioxide by sequestering it in their biological system as well as in the soil. In the present study we have assessed the carbon sequestration potential of different natural forests of Bilaspur district, Himachal Pradesh, India, which were subjected to different levels of anthropogenic activities. Above-and below-ground carbon stock present in standing vegetation was analysed at six different forest sites of subtropical forests utilizing the non-destructive method. The stem density in the present study ranged from 474.75 to 799.75 trees/ha. The result shows that carbon stock was highest at site II (131.95 t C/ha) and lowest at site I (70.34 t C/ha), although highest tree density was observed at site I and lowest at site V. The average carbon stock of the study area was recorded as 107.35 t C/ha. The results suggest that tree density and carbon stock in these subtropical forests differ significantly and with proper management strategies and afforestation of the degraded areas, the potential of carbon storage can be enhanced further.

TI  - Carbon sequestration in tropical Asia: An assessment of technically suitable forest lands using geographic information systems analysis
T2  - Climate Research
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forest lands hold the greatest promise for sequestering large quantities of carbon. In this study, an analysis was performed to produce a first order map of the technical suitability of present-day forest lands to sequester additional carbon in the continental part of tropical Asia. The analysis used a geographic information system (GIS) approach to assess the difference between 2 indices of potential and actual carbon sequestration of forests on a regional scale. This difference represents the degree to which forest biomass has been reduced (degraded) from its potential maximum caused by the long history of human impacts on the landscape. The difference indicates the relative amount of new biomass carbon which could be added to particular areas of land if they were protected, free from human disturbance, so that they could accumulate biomass up to their potential with no social, economic, or political constraints. A potential carbon sequestration index (PCSI) map was derived from a GIS model based on climatic and geomorphological factors. The actual carbon sequestration index map was derived via 2 methods: a degradation approach based on population densities and climate zones, and a remote sensing approach based on a 4 yr mean of the normalized difference global vegetation index derived from NOAA AVHRR satellite imagery. Despite limitations, the methods provided reasonable maps of regional technical suitability on which to build as data quality and methodologies improve. Areas of highest technical suitability included the lowland moist and lowland seasonal ecofloristic zones, closed forests, and Peninsular Malaysia and India. On average, the technically suitable present forest lands could sequester an additional ca 90 Mg C ha-1 in aboveground biomass.

TI  - Estimation of aboveground net primary productivity in secondary tropical dry forests using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although tropical dry forests (TDFs) cover roughly 42% of all tropical ecosystems, extensive deforestation and habitat fragmentation pose important limitations for their conservation and restoration worldwide. In order to develop conservation policies for this endangered ecosystem, it is necessary to quantify their provision of ecosystems services such as carbon sequestration and primary production. In this paper we explore the potential of the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) for estimating aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) in a secondary TDF located at the Santa Rosa National Park (SRNP), Costa Rica. We calculated ANPP using the CASA model (ANPP(CASA)) in three successional stages (early, intermediate, and late). Each stage has a stand age of 21 years, 32 years, and 50+ years, respectively, estimated as the age since land abandonment. Our results showed that the ANPP(CASA) for early, intermediate, and late successional stages were 3.22 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), 8.90 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), and 7.59 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, which are comparable with rates of carbon uptake in other TDFs. Our results indicate that key variables that influence ANPP in our dry forest site were stand age and precipitation seasonality. Incident photosynthetically active radiation and temperature were not dominant in the ANPP(CASA). The results of this study highlight the potential of the use of remote sensing techniques and the importance of incorporating successional stage in accurate regional TDF ANPP estimation.

TI  - Vertical distribution of aboveground biomass in a seasonal deciduous forest
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS AGRARIAS-AGRARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of aboveground biomass stock in Seasonal Deciduous Forests is imperative for the implementation of mechanisms to reduce emissions from deforestation, forest degradation and land reclamation. The present study analyzed the vertical distribution of aboveground biomasses in a Seasonal Deciduous Forest in Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. Seven 12 x 12 m plots were established, and all trees inside the plots were weighed directly in the field. Subplots of 5 x 5 m and 1 x 1 m were marked within the main plots to quantify the remaining vegetation. Average dry aboveground biomass was 316.5 Mg ha-1, trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) greater than 10 cm accounting for over 89% of this biomass. Therefore, biomass determination of large trees deserves special attention, since they represent a large part of the biomass of this forest ecosystem. Biomass of plants taller than 1.3 m and with diameter at breast height < 5 cm was 6.9 Mg ha-1, and that of plants lower than 1.3 m was 1.5 Mg ha-1. Average litter mass was 15.6 Mg ha-1. Trees of large diameters must be analyzed very carefully for quantify the biomass and carbon in the forests, because few individuals might represent a large part of the biomass of a forest ecosystem.

TI  - How effective are perches in promoting bird-mediated seed dispersal for natural forest regeneration? A systematic review protocol
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundForest landscape restoration (FLR), often through tree planting, is one of the priorities in many global and national initiatives for carbon offsetting as part of climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation. However, active efforts to meet FLR objectives entail substantial costs for the procurement of planting stocks and require an experienced workforce for planting and nurturing tree seedlings. Alternatively, restoration projects can be more cost-effective and potentially may have greater biodiversity gain through assisting and accelerating natural forest regeneration. The use of perches is one of the strategies under Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR) and is used to attract avian seed dispersers to degraded habitats for increased tree seed supply and seedling establishment. This systematic review and potential meta-analysis aim to determine the effectiveness of artificial and natural perches in promoting natural forest regeneration. Specifically, we will evaluate their effectiveness in driving seed richness, seed density, seedling richness, and seedling density. The results will synthesize available evidence on the topic, identify knowledge gaps we need filling to upscale the strategy, and inform their use in concert with other ANR strategies.MethodsThe search strategy was informed through a literature scan and discussions with stakeholders and experts. A total of eight databases, which include an organizational library and a web-based search engine, will be searched using the refined search string in English. The search string was formed using keywords corresponding to the PICO structure of the research question, and its comprehensiveness was evaluated using 10 benchmark articles. The search results will be screened by the review team (composed of a primary and at least two secondary reviewers) using the set eligibility criteria at the title and abstract level, followed by the full-text screening. The screened studies will then undergo critical appraisal using the assessment criteria based on risk of bias and methods. Data from the accepted studies will be extracted to the standard data sheet for meta-analysis. Effect size (Hedges' g) will be computed to determine whether perches are effective in increasing seed dispersal and seedling establishment in degraded sites. The effect of potential modifiers relating to the landscape will be explored via mixed models.

TI  - Which forests could be protected by corporate zero deforestation commitments? A spatial assessment
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The production of palm oil, soy, beef and timber are key drivers of global forest loss. For this reason, over 470 companies involved in the production, processing or distribution of these commodities have issued commitments to eliminate or reduce deforestation from their supply chains. However, the effectiveness of these commitments is uncertain since there is considerable variation in ambition and scope and there are no globally agreed definitions of what constitutes a forest. Many commitments identify high conservation value forests (HCVFs), high carbon stock forests (HCSFs) and forests on tropical peatland as priority areas for conservation. This allows for mapping of the global extent of forest areas classified as such, to achieve an assessment of the area that may be at reduced risk of development if companies comply with their zero deforestation commitments. Depending on the criteria used, the results indicate that between 34% and 74% of global forests qualify as either HCVF, HCSF or forests on tropical peatland. However, we found that the total extent of these forest areas varies widely depending on the choice of forest map. Within forests which were not designated as HCVF, HCSF or forests on tropical peatland, there is substantial overlap with areas that are highly suitable for agricultural development. Since these areas are unlikely to be protected by zero-deforestation commitments, they may be subject to increased pressure resulting from leakage of areas designated as HCVF, HCSF and tropical peatland forests. Considerable uncertainties around future outcomes remain, since only a proportion of the global market is currently covered by corporate commitments. Further work is needed to map the synergies between corporate commitments and government policies on land use. In addition, standardized criteria for delineating forests covered by the commitments are recommended.

AB  - Substantial areas of available forest lands in Asia could be managed for conservation and sequestration of carbon (C). These include 133 Mha for establishment of plantations and agroforests, 33.5 Mha for slowed tropical deforestation, and 48 Mha for natural and assisted regeneration of tropical forests. The potential quantity of C conserved and sequestered on these lands was conservatively estimated to be 24 Pg C (1 Pg = 10(15) g) by 2050. Establishment of plantations and agroforests could account for 58% of the total mitigation potential on Asian forest lands. The amount of C that could be conserved and sequestered by all forest sector practices by 2050 under baseline conditions is equivalent to about 4% of the global fossil fuel emissions over the same time period. The uncertainties in estimates of mitigation potential presented in this paper are likely to be high, particularly with respect to the land area available for forestation projects and the rate at which deforestation could be slowed. The uncertainty terms are compounded in making global estimates of the mitigation potential, perhaps to large proportions, but to what extent is presently unknown. An example of a forestry project in China whose main goal was to rehabilitate degraded lands and at the same time provide biomass fuel for the local rural inhabitants is presented to demonstrate that C sequestration, and thus mitigation, is an added benefit to more traditional uses of forests. This forestry project is currently mitigating CO2 emissions (up to about 1.4 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) and, with a change in management, an almost two-fold increase in the current reduction of net C emissions would occur.

TI  - Global forest fragmentation change from 2000 to 2020
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest losses and gains are highly dynamic processes. Here, the authors present a forest fragmentation index to map distribution and temporal changes of forest fragments globally, revealing major trends and patterns during the first two decades of the 21st century.A comprehensive quantification of global forest fragmentation is urgently required to guide forest protection, restoration and reforestation policies. Previous efforts focused on the static distribution patterns of forest remnants, potentially neglecting dynamic changes in forest landscapes. Here, we map global distribution of forest fragments and their temporal changes between 2000 and 2020. We find that forest landscapes in the tropics were relatively intact, yet these areas experienced the most severe fragmentation over the past two decades. In contrast, 75.1% of the world's forests experienced a decrease in fragmentation, and forest fragmentation in most fragmented temperate and subtropical regions, mainly in northern Eurasia and South China, declined between 2000 and 2020. We also identify eight modes of fragmentation that indicate different recovery or degradation states. Our findings underscore the need to curb deforestation and increase connectivity among forest fragments, especially in tropical areas.

M3  - Article
AB  - The planted forest area and carbon sequestration have increased significantly in China, because of large-scale reforestation and afforestation in the past decades. In this study, we developed an age-based volume-to-biomass method to estimate the carbon storage by planted forests in China in the period of 1973-2003 based on the data from 1209 field plots and national forest inventories. The results show that the total carbon storage of planted forests was 0.7743 Pg C in 1999-2003, increased by 3.08 times since the early 1970s. The carbon density of planted forests varied from 10.6594 Mg/ha to 23.9760 Mg/ha and increased by 13.3166 Mg/ha from 1973-1976 to 1999-2003. Since the early 1970s, the planted forests in China have been always a carbon sink, and the annual rate of carbon sequestration was 0.0217 Pg C/yr. The carbon storage and densities of planted forests varied greatly in space and time. The carbon storage of Middle South China was in the lead in all regions, which accounted for 23%-36% of national carbon storage. While higher C densities (from 17.79 Mg/ha to 26.05 Mg/ha) were usually found in Northeast China. The planted forests in China potentially have a high carbon sequestration since a large part of them are becoming mature and afforestation continues to grow.

TI  - Mainstreaming Smart Agroforestry for Social Forestry Implementation to Support Sustainable Development Goals in Indonesia: A Review
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - The increasing need for forest resources and cultivated land requires a solution in forest management to realize sustainable land use. Smart agroforestry (SAF) is a set of agriculture and silviculture knowledge and practices that is aimed at not only increasing profits and resilience for farmers but also improving environmental parameters, including climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity enhancement, and soil and water conservation, while assuring sustainable landscape management. SAF, a solution for land management systems to reduce the rate of deforestation, is a smart effort to overcome the food crisis and mitigate climate change that is prospectively applied mainly in the social forestry area. Optimized forest land utilization could be achieved by implementing SAF and applying silvicultural and crop cultivation techniques to optimize productivity and meet sustainability and adaptability goals. This paper reviews the existing conditions, opportunities, and challenges in the mainstreaming of SAF in social forestry implementation to support the Sustainable Development Goals in Indonesia. Mainstreaming SAF should include policy innovation and regulation implementation, the use of appropriate technology, and compromises or trade-offs among benefits, risks, and resources. SAF is a strategy to revive the rural economy and community prosperity through the optimal use of local resources as well as a form of smart landscape and land-use management that has significant roles in soil and water conservation, bioenergy, climate change responses, and enhanced biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Ecological and social drivers of coffee pollination in Santander, Colombia
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Bees and other insects provide pollination services that are key to determining the fruit set on coffee plantations. These pollination services are influenced by local ecology as well as human factors, both social and economic. To better understand these different factors, we assessed their effect on pollinators and coffee pollination services in Santander, Colombia. We quantified the effect of key ecological drivers on pollinator community composition, such as the method of farm management (either conventional or organic) and the surrounding landscape composition, specifically the proximity to forest.We found that ambient levels of pollination services provided by the local pollinator fauna (open pollination) accounted for a 10.5 +/- 2.0% increase in final coffee fruit set, and that the various pollinators are affected differently by the differing factors. For example, our findings indicate that conventional farm management, using synthetic inputs, can promote pollinators, especially if they are in close proximity to natural forest fragments. This is particularly true for stingless bees. Honeybee visitation to coffee is also positively influenced by the conventional management of farms. Factors associated with greater numbers of stingless bees on farms include greater shade cover, lower tree densities, smaller numbers and types of trees in bloom, and younger coffee plantations. A forested landscape close to farms appears to enhance these factors, giving increased stability and resilience to the pollinating bees and insects. However we found that organic farms also support diverse pollinator communities, even if distant from forest fragments.The contribution of honeybees to pollination value (US$129.6/ha of coffee) is greater than that of stingless bees (US$16.5/ha of coffee). Since the method of farm management has a major impact on the numbers and types of pollinators attracted to farms, we have analysed the statistically significant social factors that influence farmers' decisions on whether to adopt organic or conventional practices. These include the availability of technology, the type of landowner (whether married couples or individual owners), the number of years of farmers' formal education, the role of institutions, membership of community organizations, farm size, coffee productivity and the number of coffee plots per farm. It is hoped that the use of our holistic approach, which combines investigation of the social as well as the ecological drivers of pollination, will help provide evidence to underpin the development of best practices for integrating the management of pollination into sustainable agricultural practices.

TI  - Tree plantations on farms: Evaluating growth and potential for success
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Interest in native species is growing across the tropics as reforestation of degraded lands becomes more widespread. In this study four tree species native to Panama - Cedrela odorata, Pachira quinata, Samanea saman, and Tabebuia rosea - were grown on rural farms at two dry tropical sites in Panama for up to five years. Survivorship and growth data at these "on-farm" trials are compared to data recorded from nearby experimental or "species selection" trial sites and evaluated in terms of soil fertility and management. Participant farmers were also asked about their interest in planting trees in general as well as their interest in 61 species grown in the species selection trial.Although, on-farm survivorship was variable and generally lower than that found on the species selection trial, one species (S. saman) experienced high and consistent survivorship. High survivorship combined with growth data from farms at both sites for this species suggests it would be a good candidate for extension projects working with rural farmers. Survivorship of other species appears more sensitive to farmer management and/or local site conditions. Generally lower growth on the Los Santos farms as compared to the species-selection trial is attributed to the lower soil fertility (plant available P) at the on-farm sites compared to the species selection trial. In contrast, only one species - P. quinata - had a growth variable found to be significantly lower between the on-farm and species selection trial sites in Rio Hato. C. odorata, P. quinata T. rosea can all be used in on-farm conditions with consideration to specific site and management conditions.By 2009, approximately 80% of the farmers planting trees still wished to participate in tree planting activities. All of the farmers no longer wishing to continue with the project expressed slow growth rates of trees as a principal reason. All but one of these farmers had growth rates for his/her trees markedly below those of the species selection trial nearby. Some farmers wishing to continue had very high mortality rates (>70% for all species), suggesting non-tangible benefits for participating in project activities. Other species that were not tested on-farm but grew well in the species-selection trials and were of interest to local farmers are discussed.As long as specific site and management conditions are carefully considered, data from species selection trials can be useful in informing tree planting projects with rural farmers; however, care should be taken to manage expectations.

TI  - Using the CENTURY model to assess the impact of land reclamation and management practices in oasis agriculture on the dynamics of soil organic carbon in the arid region of North-western China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale reclamation of arid land in North-western China over the past 50 years has converted the natural desert landscape into anthropogenic oasis, particularly in the lower part of watersheds. Drastic human activities may have caused the change of soil organic carbon (SOC) in anthropogenic oasis. This study employs the CENTURY model (Version 4.0) to investigate the effects of land reclamation and management practices in oasis agriculture on the dynamic of SOC at the lower part of Sangong river watershed, a typical anthropogenic oasis reclaimed at 50 years ago. Based on field investigation, history of crop rotations, and past farm practices in study area, land management practices were divided into five categories, corresponding five periods, 0-1958, 1959-1984, 1985-1992, 1993-1998 and 1999-2008. The model successfully simulated the SOC dynamics of the top layer soil (0-20 cm) in the different periods. The state of equilibrium of total SOC and the active, slow, and passive carbon pools were built by CENTURY model in 0-1959. Over the 50 years' cultivation (1959-2008), the mean change in total SOC exhibited complex ways. SOC increased rapidly in the first 2 years (1959-1960) after shrubland reclamation, and declined slowly during the period 1961-1984 and then decreased rapidly from 1985 to 1992. Between 1993 and 1998, it remained relatively stable, and climbed rapidly again during 1999-2008. The trend in total SOC showed "N" shape, i.e., increase, decrease, then increase. Finally, total SOC is greater (8.2%) in 2008 than the original level of SOC under the natural desert shrub. The improvements of land management practices such as ploughing being replaced with no tillage, straw being crushed before returning it to soil, and reasonable application of fertilizers, played a key role in the change in total SOC. Especially, soil carbon sequestration was obviously increased since protective management practices were implemented in 1993, such as no tillage, straw returning to soil, and the balanced fertilization technique. The results were different from the conclusions that loss of soil organic carbon would happen due to reclamation and continuous farming in tropical forests, semiarid grasslands of northern China and Nigerian semiarid Savannah.

TI  - Getting the message right on nature-based solutions to climate change
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Nature-based solutions (NbS)-solutions to societal challenges that involve working with nature-have recently gained popularity as an integrated approach that can address climate change and biodiversity loss, while supporting sustainable development. Although well-designed NbS can deliver multiple benefits for people and nature, much of the recent limelight has been on tree planting for carbon sequestration. There are serious concerns that this is distracting from the need to rapidly phase out use of fossil fuels and protect existing intact ecosystems. There are also concerns that the expansion of forestry framed as a climate change mitigation solution is coming at the cost of carbon rich and biodiverse native ecosystems and local resource rights. Here, we discuss the promise and pitfalls of the NbS framing and its current political traction, and we present recommendations on how to get the message right. We urge policymakers, practitioners and researchers to consider the synergies and trade-offs associated with NbS and to follow four guiding principles to enable NbS to provide sustainable benefits to society: (1) NbS are not a substitute for the rapid phase out of fossil fuels; (2) NbS involve a wide range of ecosystems on land and in the sea, not just forests; (3) NbS are implemented with the full engagement and consent of Indigenous Peoples and local communities in a way that respects their cultural and ecological rights; and (4) NbS should be explicitly designed to provide measurable benefits for biodiversity. Only by following these guidelines will we design robust and resilient NbS that address the urgent challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss, sustaining nature and people together, now and into the future.

TI  - Design of complex agroecosystems: traditional and formal knowledge to conserve agrobiodiversity in the Santa Marta Mountains, Veracruz, Mexico
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of globalization, two major human challenges are global warming and the loss of biological and cultural diversity. Solving the latter problem can help reduce greenhouse gases, diversify production, and maintain agrobiodiversity. The objective was to propose a design of complex agroecosystems based on indigenous and scientific knowledge. In 66 agroecosystems from seven ejidos (communal lands used for agriculture), the tree species were determined in 400 square meter plots, considering three layers: high (up to 35 m), middle (up to 25 m), and low (< 17.5 m), estimating carbon sequestration using allometric equations. Three participatory workshops were carried out with 36 peasants to corroborate the species observed in the field and create lists of attributes (foliage production, cover, growth speed, and flowering and fruiting periods). With these attributes, as well as carbon sequestration capacity, melliferous and nectar potential, a proposal for an agroecosystem design was developed. The species that sequestered the largest amount of carbon was: Pouteria sapota, Manilkara sapota, Brosimum alicastrum, and Calophyllum brasiliense. The highest valued species were: Spondias mombin, Citrus limon, and Psidium guajava, Guazuma ulmifolia, Trema micrantha, Inga spp., Bursera simaruba, Mangifera indica, Pouteria sapota, and Tabebuia rosea; in the shrub and understory layer Musa paradisiaca, Coffea arabica, Chamaedorea tepejilote, and Chamaedorea spp. The combination of indigenous and western scientific knowledge allows the structuring of complex agroecological matrices to diversify coffee agroecosystems. This can be the basis for reducing poverty, conserving, or restoring different trophic relationships, and reducing global warming. Section 1 presents the literature reviewed. Section 2 presents a description of the study area with the main biological and social characteristics, also, the main methods used to characterize coffee agroecosystems, the estimation of carbon sequestration and valuation of tree species by peasants and the attributes used for the proposal of design of agroecosystems. Sections 3 and 4 present the discussion of results and finally in Sect. 5, the conclusions.

TI  - Carbon sequestration potential of Indian forests
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The forestry sector can not only sustain its carbon but also has the potential to absorb carbon from the atmosphere. India has maintained approximately 64 Mha of forest cover for the last decade. The rate of afforestation in India is one of the highest among the tropical countries, currently estimated to be 2 Mha per annum. The annual productivity has increased from 0.7 m(3) per hactare in 1985 to 1.37 m(3) per hectare in 1995. Increase in annual productivity directly indicates an increase in forest biomass and hence higher carbon sequestration potential. The carbon pool for the Indian forests is estimated to be 2026.72 Mt for the year 1995. Estimates of annual carbon uptake increment suggest that our forests and plantations have been able to remove at least 0.125 Gt of CO2 from the atmosphere in the year 1995. Assuming that the present forest cover in India will sustain itself with a marginal annual increase by 0.5 Mha in area of plantations, we can expect our forests to continue to act as a net carbon sink in future.

AB  - It may be possible to sequester carbon in forests and forest products, but to date global trends in land management have resulted in a release of terrestrial carbon to the atmosphere. Over 100 PgC were released between 1850 and 1980, and during the 1980s global changes in land use (predominantly deforestation) caused a net release of 1.6 PgC yr(-1), about 25% of the total emissions of carbon dioxide from human activities and about 15% of the enhanced radiative forcing. Management practices that could change this release of terrestrial carbon to an accumulation include (i) a halt to deforestation; (ii) an expansion in the land area of forests; (iii) an increase in the stocks of carbon in existing forests; (iv) more efficient harvest and greater use of wood in long-lasting products; and (v) the substitution of wood fuels for fossil fuels. However, the rate of global warming needs management as well. Unless the warming is gradual enough to avoid widespread mortality of forests, the additional releases of carbon caused by the warming itself, through increased respiration, decay, and fires, may cancel the intended effects of forest management.

TI  - Tree species diversity and its relationship with carbon stock in the parkland agroforestry of Northern Ethiopia
T2  - COGENT BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Parkland agroforestry can store carbon and conserves biodiversity. Studying the relationship between carbon stock and biodiversity is crucial in understanding the tradeoff between major benefits of the parkland agroforestry system, and way to achieve the optimum balance between them. Therefore, this study aims to estimate the biomass and SOC in community type, and explore the relationship between carbon stocks and diversity. Tree with DBH (Diameter at breast height) > 2 cm was measured and species were identified in 75 (50x100m) randomly located plots. Species richness (S), Species evenness (J), Shannon-weiner diversity index (H') and Simpson diversity index (D) of the study area were 3.02, 0.81, 0.82 and 0.46 respectively. Similarly, the mean aboveground (AGC), belowground (BGC) and soil organic (SOC) carbon were 7.9, 3.03 and 20.07 Mg C ha-1 respectively. There was a liner and weakly significant correlation between AGC and tree J in plant community 2 (r = -0.558, P < 0.05) and 3 (r = -0.451, P < 0.05), and there was a negative correlation between J (r = -0.552, P < 0.05), D (r = -0.646, P < 0.05) and H' (r = -0.643, P < 0.05) with TC (Total carbon) in plant community 2. However, there was no significant relationship between J, D and H' with TC in plant communities 1 and 3. In these parkland agroforestry systems, the relationship tree species diversity with AGC and TC appeared to be highly variable; it indicates that parkland agroforestry systems have significantly improved the vegetation and SOC. However, forest carbon enhancement cannot assure the biodiversity conservation and promotion in a parkland agroforestry system.

TI  - Soil Fungal Community Characteristics and Mycelial Production Across a Disturbance Gradient in Lowland Dipterocarp Rainforest in Borneo
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The rainforests of Southeast Asia are a global biodiversity hotspot under increasing pressure from human activity. Selective logging and forest conversion to oil palm plantation has major implications for biogeochemical cycling and carbon storage that are underpinned by plant-soil interactions. Soil fungi are key regulators of carbon and mineral nutrient flows between above- and below-ground organisms, yet understanding of fungal community-productivity relationships in hyper-diverse tropical forests is lacking. Recent studies suggest sensitivity of soil fungal communities to land-use change, although impacts on fungal productivity remain largely unresolved. To address this gap, we installed hyphal in-growth bags for 6 months in old-growth (OG) and selectively logged (SL) forest and oil palm plantation (OP) in Bornean lowland rainforest. Mycelial (actively foraging) fungal communities were characterized by ITS amplicon sequencing, and mycelial production estimated by measurement of fungal hyphae. Mycelial fungal community compositions were similar in OG and SL forest, whereas OP had significantly different communities of saprotrophic, mycorrhizal, and pathogenic fungi. In particular, total mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungal relative abundances, total mycorrhizal richness and mycelial production was reduced. However, due to restricted sampling replication in OP, effects associated with site could not be excluded. In forest plots (OG & SL), we further explored the broader drivers of mycelial fungal communities using tree community, structure and productivity data, and soil and environmental properties. Forest mycelial community dissimilarities were related to soil and vegetation characteristics, while mycelial production was broadly independent of these as well as fungal community attributes. An increase in arbuscular mycorrhizal relative abundance was also found with selective logging, which may have implications for carbon storage capacity in these forests, while an apparent retention of mycorrhizal mycelium in SL forest may act as a reservoir of inoculum that could aid forest restoration. Our results show that conversion of rainforest to oil palm plantation has significant consequences for fungal diversity-productivity relationships with implications for nutrient and carbon dynamics and restoration over large spatial scales.

TI  - Nutrient dynamics during decomposition of the residues from a sown legume or ruderal plant cover in an olive oil orchard
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spanish olive oil groves are undergoing a marked change in the way that inter-row land is managed. The current recommendation encourages the use of plant cover to increase plant residue input to the soil to improve fertility and reduce erosion. However, there is no quantitative information on the temporal trend and magnitude of nutrient release during decomposition of plant cover residues after the annual topping of vegetation. Decomposition rates and nutrient dynamics (C, N, P and K) were examined for aboveground residues from two types of plant cover (a sown legume and ruderal plant species) and in fine roots. Litterbag experiments were designed to evaluate the effects of the type and location of plant residues (above- or belowground) by placing litterbags of aboveground plant residues on the soil surface or within the soil, which were sampled over a whole year. The highest decomposition rates for above- or belowground residues were found in spring, and were higher for buried plant residues, regardless of plant cover type. After one year, the remaining C, K and P in the soil was about 30%, 20% and 30% of that added, respectively and therefore plant cover could be a useful strategy to improve C sequestration and increase soil nutrient content in olive groves. Decomposition of plant residues left on the soil surface immobilised N, whereas this was not the case when they were buried. The remaining C, N, P and K content in belowground residues was similar to aboveground samples with around 21%, 27%, 23% and 15%, respectively. This study highlighted the importance of plant cover for retaining nutrients when tree demand was low, but releasing a significant proportion of the nutrients in early spring when tree demand was high, especially when residues were incorporated into the soil.

TI  - The enduring world forest carbon sink
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) by terrestrial ecosystems is critical for moderating climate change1. To provide a ground-based long-term assessment of the contribution of forests to terrestrial CO2 uptake, we synthesized in situ forest data from boreal, temperate and tropical biomes spanning three decades. We found that the carbon sink in global forests was steady, at 3.6 +/- 0.4 Pg C yr-1 in the 1990s and 2000s, and 3.5 +/- 0.4 Pg C yr-1 in the 2010s. Despite this global stability, our analysis revealed some major biome-level changes. Carbon sinks have increased in temperate (+30 +/- 5%) and tropical regrowth (+29 +/- 8%) forests owing to increases in forest area, but they decreased in boreal (-36 +/- 6%) and tropical intact (-31 +/- 7%) forests, as a result of intensified disturbances and losses in intact forest area, respectively. Mass-balance studies indicate that the global land carbon sink has increased2, implying an increase in the non-forest-land carbon sink. The global forest sink is equivalent to almost half of fossil-fuel emissions (7.8 +/- 0.4 Pg C yr-1 in 1990-2019). However, two-thirds of the benefit from the sink has been negated by tropical deforestation (2.2 +/- 0.5 Pg C yr-1 in 1990-2019). Although the global forest sink has endured undiminished for three decades, despite regional variations, it could be weakened by ageing forests, continuing deforestation and further intensification of disturbance regimes1. To protect the carbon sink, land management policies are needed to limit deforestation, promote forest restoration and improve timber-harvesting practices1,3.Data from boreal, temperate and tropical forests over the past three decades reveal that the global forest carbon sink has remained steady during that time, despite considerable regional variation.

TI  - Secondary forests as temporary carbon sinks?: The economic impact of accounting methods on reforestation projects in the tropics
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forestry is often not competitive with agricultural land uses such as pasture for cattle ranching. Additional revenues from carbon sequestration generated by the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol can change this situation. In three different zones of north-western Ecuador, minimum compensation payments for carbon sequestration were determined, which would make reforestation a feasible land-use alternative. Based on our findings that these minimum prices depend on the net benefit of the respective land-use alternatives, and on the accounting regimes for CDM sink projects, we applied the accounting rules for temporary and long-term Certified Emission Reductions (CER) to two reforestation projects: forest plantation and natural regrowth of secondary forest. A comparison of these alternatives showed that secondary forest is an attractive alternative under both accounting regimes because of its low establishment costs and relative early timber revenues. After identifying the zone most suitable for carbon sink projects, we calculated net benefits of land-use changes in the event that certain prices for emission reductions were actually paid. We found that secondary forest becomes economically attractive, if the price of permanent credits is above $4.5/tCO(2), whereas forest plantations require permanent CER prices of $7.0/tCO(2). In both cases, the results are within the price margins forecasted by various institutions for the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. The presented methodology is meant to support the decision making process on the supply side of a future CER market. Opportunity costs of land-use changes have to be analyzed carefully before deciding in favor of long binding forestry projects. Assigning temporary credits to naturally regrown secondary forests could-although excluded from CDM during the first commitment period-combine the advantages of a flexible accounting regime with the positive economic and ecological effects of this competitive land use.

TI  - Data on arthropod abundance in tropical forest restoration plots with high or low plant phylogenetic diversity
T2  - Dryad
M3  - Data set
AB  - Consideration of plant phylogenetic diversity in ecological restoration carries substantial potential, as communities with a greater diversity of lineages with older evolutionary histories can increase the diversity of niches and thus are likely to recover larger species networks than communities clustered in specific clades with reduced variation in functional traits. In this study, we experimentally assessed how arthropod communities were affected by the phylogenetic diversity of a set of tropical tree species. We established 12 experimental restoration plots with either high or low plant phylogenetic diversity, while maintaining constant the number of plant species. After one and three years, arthropods with different feeding habits (herbivores, predators, pollinators, and detritivores) were collected and identified as morphospecies or operational taxonomic units using metabarcoding techniques. We provide insights on the influence of plant phylogenetic diversity on arthropod abundance and species diversity, particularly among predator, pollinator, and detritivore common and dominant species, which increased with plant phylogenetic diversity. The trend, however, was the opposite for the diversity of herbivore common and dominant species, which decreased as plant phylogenetic diversity increased. These findings highlight the importance of considering plant species richness when designing restoration strategies, but also their evolutionary histories, as the same number of plant species can produce different outcomes for higher trophic levels, as a function of their phylogenetic relationships. Between July 2018 and January 2019, we established 12 restoration plantings (15 * 15 m) within the active cattle pastures, with a minimum distance of 50 m among the plots. To manipulate the phylogenetic diversity of the plantings, we used a total of 43 tropical tree species. In half of the plots, we established plant assemblages with high phylogenetic diversity (HPD), incorporating 27 phylogenetically distant species from 23 families, widely distributed across the phylogeny of the regional pool of species (see below). In the remaining plots, we established plantings with low plant phylogenetic diversity (LPD), with 27 species from 10 families clustered within the phylogeny and with more recent common ancestors. We collected arthropods from the experimental plots in September 2019 and 2021 (~ 1 and 3 years after establishment of restoration plots), using distinct methods for each arthropod guild. To capture pollinators, we used pan traps comprising three plastic containers painted in blue, yellow, and white, each filled with 200 ml of soapy water. This variety of colors is recommended to attract the greatest diversity of pollinators, as different taxa have distinct preferences for different colors (Leong, et al., 1999, Padron, et al., 2020). Two sets of traps were placed on each plot, one in the middle of the upper right quadrant and the other at the plots center. To collect adult lepidopterans, we used one Van Someren- Rydon trap with a bait made with a mixture of pineapple fermented with beer, positioned at the plots center. Sweep nets and manual surveys were employed along four perpendicular transects positioned every two meters within each plot to collect herbivores and predators from the canopies of saplings and surrounding vegetation. For detritivores and other crawling arthropods, two pitfall traps were placed in the middle of the lower left quadrant, as well as in the center of each plot. These diverse traps enabled the collection of resident organisms colonizing the plots but also those passing through the vegetation islands. After 72 hours, specimens were collected from all traps and stored with 70% undenatured ethanol, except for lepidopterans which were collected after 24 hours in the Van Someren-Rydon traps. These specimens were subsequently frozen and stored in glassine paper bags. After taxonomic and/or molecular identification (see below), organisms were classified based on their feeding habits, using available ecological literature for the most specific taxonomic level. We classified organisms that consumed any part of plants (including seeds) as herbivores, except for adult Lepidoptera specimens and other floral visitors, which were classified as pollinators. Organisms that feed on other animals were classified as predators, and those involved in the consumption of decomposing organic matter or associated with the cycling of soil nutrients were classified as detritivores. Organisms that could not be classified were excluded from subsequent analyses. We systematically grouped all collected organisms based on their respective order, family, and when feasible, assigned them to genus and species. In cases where precise taxonomic identification was unattainable, we categorized the specimens as morphospecies. For molecular identification, we sorted specimens into two distinct groups: i) those obtained from color and Van Someren-Rydon traps, and ii) those captured with pitfall traps, manual surveys, and sweep nets. Specimens were categorized into small (< 3 mm), medium (> 3 mm and < 15 mm) and large (> 15mm) size classes, according to the criteria outlined by Galvez-Reyes, et al. (2021). Whereas the entire body was used for small arthropods, medium-sized arthropods were dissected to select the thorax (including the head), and only two legs were selected for large arthropods. After placing specimens or their parts in falcon tubes according to their size class, we extracted DNA from the composite arthropod samples of each size category and group, to perform a metabarcoding analysis (i.e. sensu Yu et al., 2012), following a modified protocol by Galvez-Reyes, et al. (2021) using a DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen). We used primers B_F 5 CCIGAYATRGCITTYCCICG 3' (Shokralla, et al., 2015) and Fol-degen-R 5 TANACYTCNGGRTGNCCRAARAAYCA 3' (Yu, et al., 2012) to amplify a 418-base pair region located at the 5 end of the mitochondrial COI gene. This specific region is part of the standard barcode region for metazoans. For the construction of metabarcoding libraries, individual samples (n =104) were pooled and grouped in equimolar proportions based on their designated category (pollinators or crawling arthropods), resulting in the generation of 60 final libraries (one library per sample). DNA samples, along with negative control, were sequenced using an Illumina Miseq 2x300 bp platform at Illumina (RTL Genomics).

The climate in this area is warm and humid with mean temperatures ranging from 24 to 26°C and total precipitation ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 mm (Soto, 2004). The vegetation in this region includes evergreen tropical forest with a high level of fragmentation surrounded by an agricultural and cattle ranching landscape (Von Thaden, et al., 2018). The ranch itself has cattle pastures, bordered by remnants forests Between July 2018 and January 2019, we established 12 restoration plantings (15 * 15 m) within the active cattle pastures, with a minimum distance of 50 m among the plots. To manipulate the phylogenetic diversity of the plantings, we used a total of 43 tropical tree species. In half of the plots, we established plant assemblages with high phylogenetic diversity (HPD), incorporating 27 phylogenetically distant species from 23 families, widely distributed across the phylogeny of the regional pool of species (see below). In the remaining plots, we established plantings with low plant phylogenetic diversity (LPD), with 27 species from 10 families clustered within the phylogeny and with more recent common ancestors (Supplementary information Table S1). In each plot we planted between 1 and 7 seedlings (between 30 - 70 cm tall) from each species in a 1 * 1 m grid, resulting in a total of 196 individuals per plot. However, due to plant mortality, between 21 and 28 species (15 to 19 non-pioneer species and 10 to 12 pioneer species) remained in each plot, but contrasts in phylogenetic diversity between both treatments were maintained (Supplementary information Table S1, Santos-Gally and Boege, 2022). We collected arthropods from the experimental plots in September 2019 and 2021 (~ 1 and 3 years after establishment of restoration plots), using distinct methods for each arthropod guild. To capture pollinators, we used pan traps comprising three plastic containers painted in blue, yellow, and white, each filled with 200 ml of soapy water.

DNA samples, along with negative control, were sequenced using an Illumina Miseq 2x300 bp platform at Illumina (RTL Genomics).

TI  - An amazon perspective on the forest-climate connection: Opportunity for climate mitigation, conservation and development?
T2  - Environment Development and Sustainability
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazonia contains more carbon (C) than a decade of global, human-induced CO2 emissions (60-80 billion tons). This C is gradually being released to the atmosphere through deforestation. Projected increases in Amazon deforestation associated with investments in road paving and other types of infrastructure may increase these C emissions. An increase of 25-40% in Amazon deforestation due to projected road paving could counterbalance nearly half of the reductions in C emissions that would be achieved if the Kyoto Protocol were implemented. Forecasted emission increases could be curtailed if development strategies aimed at controlling frontier expansion and creating economic alternatives were implemented. Given ancillary benefits and relative low costs, reducing deforestation in Amazonia and other tropical areas could be an attractive option for climate mitigation. Projects that help contain deforestation and reduce frontier expansion can play an important role in climate change mitigation but currently are not allowed as an abatement strategy under the climate regime. Creating incentives for forest conservation and decreased deforestation can be a unique opportunity for both forest conservation and climate mitigation.

T2  - HOLOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Neotropical biomass burning reconstructions synthesized from soil and sedimentary charcoal records indicate a period of reduced biomass burning sustained for several centuries after similar to 500 cal. yr BP. Proxy records of solar irradiance, El Nino events, temperature, and precipitation document regionally variable climate-related trends that do not account for the uniform reduction in burning across the Neotropics. Decreased human ignition resulting from pandemic-induced mortality offers an alternative, geographically comprehensive explanation. In addition, natural (solar-volcanic) factors can explain only similar to 1.3 ppm out of the rapid 6-10 ppm CO2 decrease between ad 1525 and the early 1600s. Reforestation following land abandonment due to population collapse has the potential to account for the rest of this CO2 decline, and variations in the C-13/C-12 of atmospheric CO2 and CH4 are consistent with both a major reduction in Neotropical landscape management by fire and massive reforestation. Our findings are demonstrative of the scale at which pre-industrial human activities influenced Earth's atmospheric greenhouse gas budget.

TI  - Ecosystem carbon storage considering combined environmental and land-use changes in the future and pathways to carbon neutrality in developed regions
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the carbon storage capacity of terrestrial ecosystems is crucial for land management and carbon reduction policymaking. There is still a knowledge gap regarding how ecosystem carbon storage will be impacted by combined environmental and land-use factors and their spatial-temporal changes, especially in developed regions where urbanization has slowed down. This study investigated how developed regions in subtropical and tropical areas might increase carbon storage and achieve carbon neutrality, using Guangdong Province in South China as an example. Based on the sustainable development assumption, three land-management scenarios were developed and simulated for 2020-2060 using the Patch-generating Land Use Simulation model. Without considering disturbance and natural losses, carbon storage was estimated by net ecosystem productivity (NEP)-the difference between net primary productivity (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration (HR). NPP was predicted using an artificial neural network model trained by historical NPP data and 16 environmental and land-use variables. HR was predicted using soil respiration models from previous research. Based on the balance between carbon storage and emissions, we predicted the allowable fossil fuel consumption to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions in 2060. The results show that Guangdong's total carbon storage changes from 73.7 MtC in 2020 to 70.6-74.8 MtC in 2060 under different scenarios. Nonlinear relationships exist between the carbon stored and the areas of different land-use types. Topography, temperatures, and land-use configurations jointly lead to significantly varied carbon storage between croplands and between forests in space and time. Protecting and regenerating forests in subtropical areas and forest edges is more effective than afforestation in lowland tropical areas for storing carbon. Net-zero CO2 emissions rely more on reducing emissions than land management. To achieve this, the proportion of fossil energy in total energy consumption should be lowered from 75.5 % in 2020 to similar to 25 % in 2060.

TI  - It is not just about time: Agricultural practices and surrounding forest cover affect secondary forest recovery in agricultural landscapes
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural regeneration of forests has significantly led to increased native forest cover in some regions. Several studies have explored the spatial drivers of forest cover increase, yet little is known about their effects on forest structure and species richness and diversity. We quantified the effects of local (forest age, remnant Eucalyptus basal area, slope, soil fertility, and clay content) and landscape drivers (surrounding land use, distance from streams, and surrounding forest cover and its change over time) on the aboveground biomass, species density, and phylogenetic diversity of native trees in second-growth forests. We sampled 44 naturally regenerating forests established on former pastures and abandoned Eucalyptus plantations for 11-46 years in agricultural landscapes of the southeastern Atlantic Forest, Brazil. We used generalized linear mixed effect models to quantify the effect drivers on forest attributes. While only Eucalyptus basal area and proximity to sugarcane plantations had a consistent negative effect on forest biomass, other drivers were among the best models to explain forest attributes, but their effect was variable. Age increased tree biomass but the effect was not consistent. Similarly, species richness and phylogenetic diversity were mainly affected by landscape drivers such as surrounding forest cover. In tropical agricultural landscapes, effective forest recovery requires more than just time, as forest age can be less important in determining forest attributes than human land uses and surrounding native forest cover. Crucially, forest recovery can be improved through interventions and policies that promote less impactful human activities and enhance existing forest cover.Abstract in Portuguese is available with online material.

TI  - Climate and socioeconomic drivers of biomass burning and carbon emissions from fires in tropical dry forests: A Pantropical analysis
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Global burned area has declined by nearly one quarter between 1998 and 2015. Drylands contain a large proportion of these global fires but there are important differences within the drylands, for example, savannas and tropical dry forests (TDF). Savannas, a biome fire-prone and fire-adapted, have reduced the burned area, while the fire in the TDF is one of the most critical factors impacting biodiversity and carbon emissions. Moreover, under climate change scenarios TDF is expected to increase its current extent and raise the risk of fires. Despite regional and global scale effects, and the influence of this ecosystem on the global carbon cycle, little effort has been dedicated to studying the influence of climate (seasonality and extreme events) and socioeconomic conditions of fire regimen in TDF. Here we use the Global Fire Emissions Database and, climate and socioeconomic metrics to better understand long-term factors explaining the variation in burned area and biomass in TDF at Pantropical scale. On average, fires affected 1.4% of the total TDF' area (60,208 km(2)) and burned 24.4% (259.6 Tg) of the global burned biomass annually at Pantropical scales. Climate modulators largely influence local and regional fire regimes. Inter-annual variation in fire regime is shaped by El Nino and La Nina. During the El Nino and the forthcoming year of La Nina, there is an increment in extension (35.2% and 10.3%) and carbon emissions (42.9% and 10.6%). Socioeconomic indicators such as land-management and population were modulators of the size of both, burned area and carbon emissions. Moreover, fires may reduce the capability to reach the target of "half protected species" in the globe, that is, high-severity fires are recorded in ecoregions classified as nature could reach half protected. These observations may contribute to improving fire-management.

TI  - Land cover changes and carbon dynamics in Central India's dry tropical forests: A 25-year assessment and nature-based eco-restoration approaches
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic land use and land cover changes are major drivers of environmental degradation and declining soil health across heterogeneous landscapes in Central India. To examines the land cover changes and spatiotemporal variations in forest carbon stock and soil organic carbon (SOC) over the past 25 years in central India. Geospatial techniques, coupled with ground measurements were employed to detect changes in land cover, carbon stocks in vegetation, and soil carbon in various vegetation types. The results indicate that forested areas have decreased, while agriculture and habitation have expanded between 1997 and 2022. Vegetation C stocks varied significantly (P < 0.05) from 39.42 to 139.95 Mg ha(-1) and the SOC varied from 7.02 to 17.98 Mg ha(-1) under different soil profiles across vegetation types, which decreased with soil depth, while the pH and bulk density increased. The maximum bulk density in the soil was found at a depth of 40-60 cm (lower profile) in Bamboo Brake, while the minimum was observed under Dense Mixed Forest at a depth of 0-20 cm (top profile). The topsoil profile contributed 33.6%-39%, the middle profile (20-40 cm) was 33.6%-34.4%, and the lower profile was 26.5%-30.8% of soil organic carbon. The study site has experienced rapid carbon losses due to changes in land cover, such as illegal expansion of agriculture, encroachments into forest fringes, and activities like selective logging and overgrazing, which have degraded dense forests. The ecological engineering of degraded ecosystems poses a great challenge and application of complex biological, mechanical and engineering measures is highly cumbersome, expensive, uneconomical and practically not feasible for upscaling. Nevertheless, proposed nature-based solutions mimic natural reparation and processes provide sustainable interventions for the reclamation of ruined landscapes besides improving ecological integrity and rendering many co-benefits to ecosystems and human societies.

TI  - The biodiversity cost of carbon sequestration in tropical savanna
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical savannas have been increasingly viewed as an opportunity for carbon sequestration through fire suppression and afforestation, but insufficient attention has been given to the consequences for biodiversity. To evaluate the biodiversity costs of increasing carbon sequestration, we quantified changes in ecosystemcarbon stocks and the associated changes in communities of plants and ants resulting from fire suppression in savannas of the Brazilian Cerrado, a global biodiversity hotspot. Fire suppression resulted in increased carbon stocks of 1.2 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) since 1986 but was associated with acute species loss. In sites fully encroached by forest, plant species richness declined by 27%, and ant richness declined by 35%. Richness of savanna specialists, the species most at risk of local extinction due to forest encroachment, declined by 67% for plants and 86% for ants. This loss highlights the important role of fire in maintaining biodiversity in tropical savannas, a role that is not reflected in current policies of fire suppression throughout the Brazilian Cerrado. In tropical grasslands and savannas throughout the tropics, carbon mitigation programs that promote forest cover cannot be assumed to provide net benefits for conservation.

AB  - Forests can play an important role in climate change mitigation. However, limited information is available worldwide regarding forest carbon and biomass stocks. Financial mechanisms such as 'reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and the role of conservation of forest carbon, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks' (REDD+) also emphasize the quantification of forest biomass and carbon. This study aimed to estimate the forest biomass in two forests of Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP): Sub-tropical Chir Pine Forest (SCPF) and Sub-tropical Broadleaved Evergreen Forest (SBEF). For this, circular sampling plots of a 20 m radius were used for the collection of the variables, "diameter at breast height (DBH) and height". Statistical analysis was done for exploring regression relationships between the variables. We found a mean Aboveground Carbon (AGC) of 73.36 +/- 32.55 Mg C ha(-1) in SCPF and a mean AGC of 16.88 +/- 25.81 Mg C ha(-1) in SBEF. The mean Aboveground Biomass (AGB) for SCPF was recorded as 146.73 +/- 65.11 Mg ha(-1), while for SBEF it was 33.77 +/- 51.63 Mg ha(-1). It was therefore concluded that the SCPF had higher mean AGB and mean AGC than the SBEF. Similar differences were also noticed in the structural characteristics of the two forests. These could be valuable information while designing sustainable management plans and afforestation programmes for the future and also for accessing nature-based funding such as REDD+.

TI  - Delineation of secondary succession mechanisms for tropical dry forests using LiDAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Research suggests that secondary forest structure and composition subsequent to human disturbance could be related to wind or vertebrate dependent seed dispersal mechanisms. This paper examines the capability of a waveform LiDAR system (LVIS: LiDAR Vegetation Imaging System) to detect the location of wind-dispersed or vertebrate-dispersed forest patches in a mosaic of a secondary Tropical Dry Forest in the Santa Rosa National Park, Guanacaste, Costa Rica. Canopy-height estimations derived from LVIS data were used to identify and locate two types of dispersal-dependent arrangements of canopy heights: flat-topped (windborne seed dispersed) or dome-shaped (vertebrate-dispersed) fragments. Following identification, a Ripley's K indicator was used to compare the locations for each confirmed canopy type to those reported in existing maps. Results indicated that dome-shaped patches tended to be arranged in clusters at the middle of former pastures (far from older forests), and that flat-topped patches tended to be located adjacent to older forests, forming extensions from the old growth patches and at the downwind side of the slope. Such characteristics agree with the theoretical observation of the spatial configuration of vertebrate- and wind-dispersed fragments reported in the study site. Our findings demonstrate that processes controlling forest regeneration in the TDF can be successfully identified through LiDAR data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Potential carbon sequestration and nitrogen cycling in long-term organic management systems
T2  - RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The fertility and soil health of organic agroecosystems are determined in part by the size and turnover rate of soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools. Our research contrasts the effects of best management practices (BMP) (reduction in soil disturbance, addition of organic amendments) on C and N cycling in soils from two field sites representing five organic agroecosystems. Total soil organic C (SOC), a standard measure of soil health, contains equal amounts of biologically and non-biologically active C that is not associated with release of mineral N. A three-pool first-order model can be used to estimate the size and turnover rates of C pools but requires data from a long-term incubation. Our research highlights the use of two rapid C fractions, hydrolysable and permanganate (0.02 M) oxidizable C, to assess shifts in biologically active C. Adoption of BMP in organic management systems reduced the partitioning of C to the active pool while augmenting the slow pool C. These pools are associated with potentially mineralizable N supplied by residues, amendments and soil organic matter affecting the concentration and release of mineral N to crops. Our data show that minimizing disturbance (no tillage, pasture) and mixed compost additions have the potential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions while enhancing slow pool C and or its turnover, a reservoir of nutrients available to the soil biota. Use of these rapid, sensitive indicators of biological C activity will aid growers in determining whether a BMP fosters nutrient loss or retention prior to shifts in total SOC.

TI  - OPTIONS FOR MITIGATING GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS IN VENEZUELA FOREST SECTOR - A GENERAL OVERVIEW
T2  - INTERCIENCIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this paper is to analyze alternatives within the forest sector for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing carbon sinks in Venezuela. Forest clearing represents a major source of carbon emissions in the country, accounting for more than 40% of carbon dioxide and 33% of carbon monoxide emissions.The first section of the paper provides a general description of the forest resources and the forest sector in Venezuela and a brief summary of the estimated greenhouse gas emissions associated with forest clearing. The second section presents a detailed analysis of two case studies based on ongoing forest projects, an industrial plantation and a managed protected area. Our analysis assesses the value of these two projects as mitigation options. The third section provides an overview of Venezuela's potential for conserving and sequestering carbon based on technically available land where several options could be implemented The results of the case studies are used here to provide a very rough estimate of the carbon sequestration potential at a national level, based on native forest management, plantations, agroforestry, and forestry protection. Our preliminary results indicate that forest management and forest protection might be the most promising mitigation options for Venezuela. However, given the broad scope of the study and the data uncertainties, the results of our analysis should be viewed as a first attempt to evaluate the carbon benefits derived from the adoption of such measures.

TI  - Forest fragmentation affects early successional patterns on shifting cultivation fields near Indian Church, Belize
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines whether vegetation and soils sampled in slash-and-burn fields in an agricultural landscape near Indian Church, Belize varied as a function of cropping status (in use, 1-2 year fallow, 3-10 year fallow) and distance to older forest (adjacent to or >150 m from forest). Multi-response permutation procedures (MRPPs) indicated that species composition (woody species density, herbaceous species cover) differed significantly among all treatments (woody: P = 0.006; herbaceous: P = 0.0001) and between distance classes (woody: P = 0.03; herbaceous: P = 0.002). The frequency of herbaceous life forms also differed between distance classes (MANOVA: P = 0.04), with lianas (P = 0.03) and legumes (P = 0.008) being more common at greater distances from forest. Soil macronutrients (P, K) were significantly lower in long-term fallows than in use fields due to sequestration by the regenerating vegetation but ammonium nitrogen was significantly lower far from older forests (two-way ANOVA: P < 0.05). Despite these differences in vegetation and soil characteristics, there were no significant differences in species diversity (richness, evenness) or vegetation structure (woody density, frequency, basal area) as a function of distance to forest (two-way ANOVA: P > 0.05), most likely due to seed inputs from surrounding early successional habitats. This study indicates that changes in landscape structure may influence ecological processes such as succession in fragmented tropical landscapes and underscores the need to reject a conceptualization of the landscape matrix as a featureless, inhospitable habitat in favor of one that recognizes and incorporates the influence of matrix quality and heterogeneity.

M3  - Article
AB  - This review places into context the role that forest ecosystems play in the global carbon cycle, and their potential interactions with climate change. We first examine the natural, preindustrial carbon cycle. Every year forest gross photosynthesis cycles approximately one-twelfth of the atmospheric stock of carbon dioxide, accounting for 50% of terrestrial photosynthesis. This cycling has remained almost constant since the end of the last ice age, but since the Industrial Revolution it has undergone substantial disruption as a result of the injection of 480 PgC into the atmosphere through fossil-fuel combustion and land-use change, including forest clearance. In the second part of this paper we review this 'carbon disruption', and its impact on the oceans, atmosphere and biosphere. Tropical deforestation is resulting in a release of 1.7 PgC yr(-1) into the atmosphere. However, there is also strong evidence for a 'sink' for carbon in natural vegetation (carbon absorption), which can be explained partly by the regrowth of forests on abandoned lands, and partly by a global change factor, the most likely cause being 'fertilization' resulting from the increase in atmospheric CO2. In the 1990s this biosphere sink was estimated to be sequestering 3.2 PgC yr(-1) and is likely to have substantial effects on the dynamics, structure and biodiversity of all forests. Finally, we examine the potential for forest protection and afforestation to mitigate climate change. An extensive global carbon sequestration programme has the potential to make a particularly significant contribution to controlling the rise in CO2 emissions in the next few decades. In the course of the whole century, however, even the maximum amount of carbon that could be sequestered will be dwarfed by the magnitude of (projected) fossil-fuel emissions. Forest carbon sequestration should only be viewed as a component of a mitigation strategy, not as a substitute for the changes in energy supply, use and technology that will be required if atmospheric CO2 concentrations are to be stabilized.

TI  - Effects of vegetation restoration on soil carbon dynamics in Karst and non-karst regions in Southwest China: a synthesis of multi-source data
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Backgrounds A large-scale ecological restoration project was initiated in the 1990s in southwest China, which is one of the largest areas of rocky desertification globally. However, the influence and potential mechanisms of vegetation restoration on soil carbon(C) sequestration in karst and non-karst regions remains unclear. Methods Based on field investigation and multi-source data synthesis, the mechanisms of soil C sequestration were investigated to determine the most important variables affecting the rate of soil C change (Rs) in southwest China. Results Our results show significant differences in soil C sequestration between karst and non-karst regions with faster and longer C sequestration occurring in karst regions. In these areas, Rs was approximately 31% higher than in non-karst soils. The Rs of shrubland, grassland and cropland sites in karst areas was significantly higher than that observed in non-karst areas. We found that temperatures were the primary factor inhibiting soil C sequestration instead of precipitation. The total effect of nitrogen (N) on Rs was positive in both karst and non-karst regions. Conclusions Phosphorus was the dominant factor limiting the use of N by vegetation in karst regions and then resulting in limitation of C sequestration. The results indicated that soil C storage may increase intermittently due to combination of karst environment and climate change in southwest China in future.

TI  - Dynamics of land use land cover and its impact on carbon stocks in Sub-Saharan Africa: an overview
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Land use land cover change (LULCC) is a global environmental trend that plays a key role in worldwide environmental change and sustainable development. Substantial disturbance resulting from natural and anthropogenic activities has been witnessed in sub-Sahara Africa (SSA) over the last four decades, which is mostly due to the increasing population being experienced in Africa. One-third of emitted greenhouse gases (GHG) are attributable to LULCC and agricultural activities most especially deforestation. Soil carbon sequestration has been considered as a possible strategy to counterbalance carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and mitigate global climate change, driven by rising concentrations of GHG in the atmosphere and global increase in temperature. The role of tropical Africa's forests in mitigating climate change has been widely acknowledged under the global treaties' Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) initiatives. More than two-thirds of the SSA population rely on forests and woodlands for their livelihoods. Despite the importance of forests, Sub-Saharan Africa, and even the entire African continent, is experiencing an acceleration in deforestation, leading to diminished ecosystem resilience. Subsistence and commercial agriculture accounted for 10% of total forest land loss in Africa (approximately 75 million ha) between 1990 and 2010. As a result, agricultural expansion alone accounts for 70-80% of Africa's total forest loss. The challenges of implementing a policy to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and foster conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks (REDD +) in the SSA includes interactions between a number of anthropogenic-induced factors and challenges. These factors, which are of various types (economic, institutional, etc.), cause loss of forest and forest degradation; and the challenges arising from finance, institutional and technical expertise hinder the appropriate design and implementation of national forest monitoring schemes. These challenges must be adequately addressed in order to accurately quantify the carbon budgets and implement an appropriate forest and carbon monitoring system for REDD + in SSA. Therefore, in meeting the REDD + initiatives in SSA, integrated land use management approach that enhances soil carbon sequestration potential should be given considerable systematic and scientific attention. In addition, political, socioeconomic and institutional factors that hinder sustainable forest management and land use system management must be addressed collectively.

TI  - Contribution of the land sector to a 1.5 °C world
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Review
AB  - The Paris Agreement introduced an ambitious goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. Here we combine a review of modelled pathways and literature on mitigation strategies, and develop a land-sector roadmap of priority measures and regions that can help to achieve the 1.5 degrees C temperature goal. Transforming the land sector and deploying measures in agriculture, forestry, wetlands and bioenergy could feasibly and sustainably contribute about 30%, or 15 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO(2)e) per year, of the global mitigation needed in 2050 to deliver on the 1.5 degrees C target, but it will require substantially more effort than the 2 degrees C target. Risks and barriers must be addressed and incentives will be necessary to scale up mitigation while maximizing sustainable development, food security and environmental co-benefits.

TI  - Achieving sustainable development goals through participatory forest management: Examples from South-Eastern Bangladesh
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests managed through peoples' participation can help to achieve a number of sustainable development goals (SDGs). This paper, drawing data from four participatory forest management (PFM) projects in south-eastern Bangladesh, explored: (a) the factors that influenced the outcomes of PFM; and (b) contribution of PFM towards achieving selected SDGs. The research used observation, semi-structured household interviews, group discussions, vegetation survey and Ostrom & apos;s design principles for data collection, Divergent forest conditions and factors in four PFM sites have had differential contribution to SDGs. Heterogeneity of user groups, insufficient coordination, absence of motivation, and land tenure conflicts had affected the attainment of SDGs. The PFM helped to achieve 9-11 SDGs comprising poverty reduction (Goal 1), improving food security (Goal 2), maintaining health and well-being (Goal 3), enhancing childrens & apos; education (Goal 4), fair access to jobs and committees (Goals 5 and 10), sources of clean drinking water (Goal 6), affordable energy for cooking (Goal 7), increased household economy (Goal 8), climate change through carbon sequestration (Goal 13), forest conservation (Goal 15), and partnerships with relevant institutions (Goal 16). In order to achieve SDGs, PFM could be viewed as an integral part of government development strategies, which needs sectoral coordination and integration of relevant policies.

TI  - THE CARBON-SEQUESTRATION POTENTIAL OF A GLOBAL AFFORESTATION PROGRAM
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Review
AB  - We analyzed the changes in the carbon cycle that could be achieved with a global, large-scale afforestation program that is economically, politically, and technically feasible. We estimated that of the areas regarded as suitable for large-scale plantations, only about 345 million ha would actually be available for plantations and agroforestry for the sole purpose of sequestering carbon. The maximum annual rate of carbon fixation (1.48 Gt/yr) would only be achieved 60 years after the establishment of the plantations - 1.14 Gt by above-ground biomass and 0.34 Gt by below-ground biomass. Over the period from 1995 to 2095, a total of 104 Gt of carbon would be sequestered. This is substantially lower than the amount of carbon required to offset current carbon emissions (3.8 Gt/yr) in order to stabilize the carbon content of the atmosphere.

TI  - Emission Removal Capability of India's Forest and Tree Cover
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - India is the world's tenth most forested nation with 76.87 M ha of forest and tree cover occupying 23.4% of its geographical area. Forests-with their intrinsic of carbon sequestration and storage values-are in the front line of India's climate change mitigation strategies. This paper provides estimates of sequestered carbon in India's forest and tree cover for the years 1995 and 2005 as per the IPCC good practice guidelines method. It is based on the primary data for the soil carbon pool through collecting soil samples by laying out quadrats across the country and secondary data for the growing stock of all forest and tree cover in the country. The estimates are compared with current and future projected emissions. It is found that conservation policies have resulted in increase of the country's forest carbon stocks from 6244.8 to 6621.6 Mt with an annual increment of 37.7 Mt of the carbon from 1995 to 2005. Annual CO2 removal by the forests is enough to neutralise 9.3% of the country's 2000 level emissions. Continued removals by the forest and tree cover would offset 6.5 and 4.9% of India's projected annual emissions in 2010 and 2020 respectively. Economically, the annual value of this forest carbon in the international market is about US $188 million. The result is of use in the REDD and REDD+ context for India.

TI  - Baseline assessment for environmental services payments from satellite imagery: A case study from Costa Rica and Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we evaluate the accuracy of four global and regional forest cover assessments (MODIS, IGBP, GLC2000, PROARCA) as tools for baseline estimation. We conduct this research at the national scale for Costa Rica and for two tropical dry forest study sites in Costa Rica (Santa Rosa) and Mexico (Chamela-Cuixmala). We found that at the national level, the total forest cover accuracy of the four land cover maps was inflated due to an overestimation of forest in areas with an evergreen canopy. However, the four maps greatly underestimated the extent of the deciduous forest (dry forest); an ecosystem that faces high deforestation pressure and poses complications to the mapping of its extent from remotely sensed data. For the tropical dry forest sites, all maps have low forest cover accuracies (mean for Santa Rosa: 27%; mean for Chamela-Cuixmala: 56%). This has implications for policy implementation.

TI  - Logging emissions from a Forest Stewardship Council certified forest in Guyana
T2  - CARBON MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Logging is a dominant land-use activity across the tropics and a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. This study quantifies emissions from selective logging in a Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified concession in Guyana that includes carbon in extracted logs, tree carbon left in the forest, and incidental tree mortality caused by felling and logging infrastructure. We also estimate carbon emissions from sawmilling of round logs. Emissions from harvested trees from stump to mill gate were 8.44 Mg CO2 m-3 (131.96 Mg CO2 ha-1). The main sources of emissions were from trees killed during felling (34%) and unextracted biomass of harvested trees (32%). On average, 15.5% of the harvested tree biomass and 43% of the log biomass was converted to sawn lumber (0.78 Mg CO2 m-3 of round log volume). We find similar levels of logging emissions in our study with those reported for non-FSC concessions in Guyana (8.54 Mg CO2 m-3) and Suriname (8.94 Mg CO2 m-3) but higher in two FSC-certified concessions in Suriname (6.65 Mg CO2 m-3). Adopting forest management practices that reduce residual stand mortality from felling and improved milling technology to reduce wood waste will help meet future demand for wood products and support climate mitigation goals.

TI  - The cost of restoring carbon stocks in Brazil's Atlantic Forest
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowing which restoration approach provides the best returns on investment for accumulating carbon is essential to foster restoration planning, financing, and implementation. Here, we explored the cost-effectiveness and drivers of aboveground and soil carbon accumulation in restored forests across an agricultural landscape of Brazil's Atlantic Forest. The recovery of aboveground and soil carbon stocks, as well as the implementation and land opportunity costs, was assessed across chronosequences (10-60 years) of second-growth forests and mixed-species tree plantings and old growth, reference forest remnants. Plantations accumulated approximately 50% more aboveground carbon than second-growth forests throughout the chronosequence. When controlling for soil clay content, soil carbon stocks were higher in reference than in restored forests, but they were comparable between plantations and second-growth forests. After 60 years of stand development, recovery of total carbon stocks in both restoration approaches reached only half of the average stocks of reference forests. Total cost-effectiveness for carbon accumulation, including both implementation and land opportunity costs, was on average 60% higher for second-growth forests than for plantations (15.1 and 9.4 kgC US$(-1), respectively). Although tree plantations initially showed higher rates of carbon storage than second-growth forests, their higher implementation and land opportunity costs make them less cost-effective for carbon farming. Our results further suggest that, at current pricing levels, carbon markets alone have a limited potential to up-scale restoration efforts in Brazil's Atlantic Forest.

AB  - Using a quasi-experimental approach and spatial modelling, this project will test the influence of natural and anthropogenic factors on the success of natural forest restoration in an expansive landscape dominated by oil palm production (Northern Borneo). Southeast Asia has experienced some of the highest rates of land-use and land cover change globally, with 65% of the terrestrial land surface now covered by human-modified tropical forests .Unlike monoculture timber or oil palm plantations, logged forests often retain a large proportion of their endemic biodiversity and ecosystem functions. If managed appropriately, they hold tremendous potential for biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration. This PhD project will resolve key uncertainties surrounding this appropriate management by identifying the biological, environmental and anthropogenic constraints on tree re-establishment in logged forest ecosystems. Using a combination of field-, desk-and greenhouse-based techniques, the PhD student will examine the role of human management (such as reduced impact logging, liana removal), biotic processes (dispersal, competition, herbivory, mycorrhizas) and abiotic factors(topography, microclimate, soil properties, landscape connectivity) in regulating tree establishment and growth in the Murum region in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo. We expect the PhD student to use a blend of greenhouse studies, manipulative field experiments, remote sensing and advanced, 'big data' spatial modelling. Full training will be provided from world experts in these fields. Working with our CASE Partner, the PhD will be able to feed those findings into management plans detailing actions that pave the way for successful forest restoration activities in the future.

AB  - Throughout the world forestry programmes are often promoted for their environmental, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, bio-fuel, timber production, amenity and social benefits. Not always are the water resource costs taken into account. This paper discusses the need for an improved forest impact assessment framework to assist policymakers and planners in making evidence-based decisions on forest and land use policy. Although forest hydrology has made major advances in recent years science findings have not always reached the policy domain. Examples of the need for the improved connection of science and policy are given for China, India, Panama, UK and Japan. New tools and approaches are suggested for helping to bridge the research to policy gap and to ensure that forest programmes are set in the context of lone-term sustainable land and water management. The paper echoes the call by the International Union of Forest Research Organisations for a task force on forest and water interactions to address these issues. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Tropical mixed-species plantations can outperform monocultures in terms of carbon sequestration and economic return
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical reforestation is an important strategy to mitigate the global climate crisis through the sequestration of CO2. Together with increasing CO2 prices, carbon storage becomes increasingly relevant for commercial re-forestations. Due to higher productivity, mixed-species reforestations have been suggested for carbon plantings. Yet, current studies comparing mixtures and monocultures lack an in-depth comparison of economic and carbon sequestration potentials. Moreover, their economic valuations do not consider carbon payments and differences in forest management. Using a simulation-optimization approach, we compared the economic and carbon sequestration performance of commercial mixed-species stands and monocultures in Costa Rica. Mixed-species stands outperformed their monoculture peers by net present value (NPV) up to 3135 USD/ha if only timber sales were considered, or 3500-16,800 USD/ha if carbon payments were also considered (at a discount rate of 8%). When managed solely for carbon sequestration, the best-performing mixture achieved a mean stand carbon 7% above the best-performing monoculture. The results were sensitive to the comparison baseline applied. The results of this study suggest that tropical mixed-species plantations can be a competitive alternative to mono-cultures. Forest investors could benefit from establishing mixed-species plantations when reforesting plantation sites where species-specific site suitability is uncertain, or when working with lesser-studied tree species.

TI  - Tree cover increase mitigation strategy: implications of the "replacement approach" in carbon storage of a subtropical ecosystem
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Worldwide tree cover increase (TCI) is one the most important climate change mitigation strategies, given the role of the ecosystems as carbon (C) reservoirs. Reforestation could be key to achieving TCI. However, there is still a knowledge gap about its real mitigation effects when it is applied through its replacement approach (REP-app). We evaluate the REP-app effects (replace native forest cover-NFC-by forestry plantation cover-FPC) on magnitude and direction of ecosystem C stock changes. By means of a field study, we quantified the C stock through a space-for-time substitution method, using eight paired sites (NFC/FPC) in a northern Argentinian subtropical forest (SAY). We studied C in saplings, lianas, above and belowground biomass, dead organic biomass, and soil. Through a metaanalysis, we evaluated the reliableness within the response of C sequestration (gain or loss) in international study cases and, therefore, the robustness of outcomes analyzing some main moderator variables that may influence the result. A significant effect of C loss was revealed by both, the field study (- 50%) and the metaanalysis (- 20.4%), and this response was consistent through stands of ages and species different. SAY sequestered 285 MgC ha(-1). Only 35-year-old Eucalyptus stand reached similar values, but they are reservoirs of doubtful permanence with functional attributes that could affect long-term ecosystem functioning. Given that the TCI strategy seek to achieve interconnected efforts in relation to climate, biodiversity, and sustainable development, the REP-app must not be considered a mitigation strategy in subtropical ecosystems. Global programs promoting TCI must be redirected urgently.

TI  - Quantifying mammal biodiversity co-benefits in certified tropical forests
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Financial incentives to manage forests sustainably, such as certification or carbon storage payments, are assumed to have co-benefits for biodiversity conservation. This claim remains little studied for rain forest mammals, which are particularly threatened, but challenging to survey.Location Sabah, Malaysia, Borneo.Methods We used photographic data from three commercial forest reserves to show how community occupancy modelling can be used to quantify mammalian diversity conservation co-benefits of forest certification. These reserves had different management histories, and one was certified by the Forest Stewardship Council.Results Many threatened species occupied larger areas in the certified reserve. Species richness, estimated per 200x200-m grid cell throughout all reserves, was higher in the certified site, particularly for threatened species. The certified reserve held the highest aboveground biomass. Within reserves, aboveground biomass was not strongly correlated with patterns of mammal richness (Spearman's rho from 0.03 to 0.32); discrepancies were strongest along reserve borders.Main conclusions Our approach provides a flexible and standardized tool to assess biodiversity and identify winners of sustainable forestry. Inferring patterns of species richness from camera-trapping carries potential for the objective designation of high conservation value forest. Correlating species richness with aboveground biomass further allows evaluating the biodiversity co-benefits of carbon protection. These advantages make the present approach an ideal tool to overcome the difficulties to rigorously quantify biodiversity co-benefits of forest certification and carbon storage payments.

TI  - Secondary Succession under a Slash-and-burn Regime in a Tropical Montane Cloud Forest: Soil and Vegetation Characteristics
T2  - BIODIVERSITY LOSS AND CONSERVATION IN FRAGMENTED FOREST LANDSCAPES: THE FORESTS OF MONTANE MEXICO AND TEMPERATE SOUTH AMERICA
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF) areas in southern Mexico are commonly used for growing maize and companion crops under slash-and-burn agriculture. As a result, the landscape is being transformed into a mosaic of crop fields, secondary forest and primary forests. Despite being a widespread process, very little is known about forest regeneration in TMCF areas. This chapter describes secondary succession in the TMCF of El Rincon Alto, Oaxaca, Mexico, with particular reference to soil and vegetation characteristics, taking advantage of successional chronosequences spanning a century of forest development. Cultivation practices cause severe losses of soil and carbon; the original vegetation and soil organic horizons vanish. Such effects are reversed, in part, during earlier stages of secondary succession. Soil layers, including those with organic horizons, begin to accumulate. Epiphytes, low-stature plants and shrubs begin to colonize very early during succession. Species richness of shrubs, geophytes and low-stature plants peak within the first 15 years after abandonment. The largest recorded decline in concentration of soil cations, and the highest annual rates of soil carbon sequestration also characterize this period. A pine-dominated community characterizes the first 10-75 years. Early successional species do not prosper under this forest canopy and an emergent stratum of broadleaf trees eventually replaces the former pine forest. Colonization of trees, lianas and climbing plants exceeds local extinction rates during the first century of forest development. The dominant groups of terrestrial and epiphytic plants are trees and liverworts, respectively, during all studied stages of forest development. Self-thinning of the first colonizing trees took place between 45 and 75 years after abandonment and coincided with a second increase in abundance of shrubs and other low-stature plants, but tree basal area did not decline significantly. Species of terrestrial plants typical of early stages are rare or absent in late successional stages. Thus, disturbances generated by autogenic processes such as natural tree fall are different from allogenic disturbances such as fires and landslides. Soil becomes increasingly acidic and infertile during forest development, a problem that is aggravated by the presence of soluble aluminium. Such acidity fosters mineral hydrolysis, releasing cations to the soil. Soil N/P ratios steadily decrease during forest development. We conclude that environmental changes derived from slash-and-burn processes increase landscape and species diversity under the long fallow regimes observed.

TI  - COMMUNITY FOREST MANAGEMENT AND CARBON SEQUESTRATION - A FEASIBILITY STUDY FROM CHIAPAS, MEXICO
T2  - INTERCIENCIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Although forestry and agroforestry are recognized as promising land-use alternatives for reducing the increasing levels of global atmospheric carbon, the viability of carbon sequestration projects at the land-user level has rarely been evaluated We present the results of a feasibility study to: (1) evaluate the interest of local communities in a carbon sequestration project and how they would organize themselves for the proposed forestry project; (2) identify the Carbon sequestration potential of the agroforestry/forestry systems that are both ecologically viable and preferred by local farmers (3) determine the social constraints of and potential for, such projects; and (4) assess the economic potential of the carbon offsets estimated for such systems. This project was carried out by an interdisciplinary team of scientists and farmers in two ecological regions: the Tojolabal and Tzeltal zones of Chiapas, Mexico.Five systems with high carbon sequestration potential were considered technically and socially viable for each region. Initially, all participants will plant trees on an individual basis in their coffee plantation, fallow, and pasture lands, or in their maize fields. The estimated amount of carbon sequestered ranged from 46.7 to 236.7 tons of carbon per hectare (tC/ha). Net income benefits due to converting fields from maize cultivation to farm forestry ranged from $500-1000/ha depending on the value assigned to the sequestered carbon.(1)Forests and farm woodlands that are sustainably managed have substantial economic and carbon sequestration potential. The principal barrier to communal forest management appears to be sociopolitical rather than economic. Because forest management requires longterm investments, good planning is essential and includes community control of projects, selection of appropriate tree species, and management techniques that are specific to the ecological and social conditions of the area.

TI  - Soil Respiration in Planted and Naturally Regenerated Castanopis carelesii Forests during Three Years Post-Establishment
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reforestation through assisted natural regeneration usually accumulates more biomass carbon than through tree planting, but its effects on soil respiration (Rs) and its components, autotrophic respiration (Ra) and heterotrophic respiration (Rh), are poorly understood despite the importance in forest carbon cycling. In this study, we clear-cut part of a 35-year-old secondary Castanopsis carelesii (C. carelesii) forest and reforested the logged land with C. carelesii via two approaches-active tree planting and assisted natural regeneration-and measured Rs, Ra, and Rh as well as soil temperature and moisture in these forests. In the first two years following reforestation, Rs, Ra and Rh rates were mostly reduced in the two young forests compared to the secondary forest, likely due to reduced photosynthate production and thus carbon substrate input associated with the clear-cut. However, the Rh:Rs ratio was significantly greater in the young plantation than in the other two forests in the first two years, suggesting a greater loss of soil organic carbon from the young plantation. In the third year, the mean Rs, Rh, and Ra rates of the young forest established via assisted natural regeneration were similar to those of the secondary forest, but significantly greater than those of the young plantation. The rates of Rs, Rh, and Ra mostly increased exponentially with increasing soil temperature in all forests, but mostly lack significant relationships with soil moisture. These findings indicate that, compared with reforestation via tree plantation, assisted natural regeneration not only reduced the loss of soil organic carbon via soil respiration, but also had a more rapid recovery of soil respiration to the level of the secondary forest. Our study highlights that, in addition to temperature, carbon substrate availability is also important in regulating soil respiration following reforestation.

TI  - The Changes in China's Forests: An Analysis Using the Forest Identity
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in forest carbon stocks are a determinant of the regional carbon budget. In the past several decades, China has experienced a pronounced increase in forest area and density. However, few comprehensive analyses have been conducted. In this study, we employed the Forest Identity concept to evaluate the changing status of China's forests over the past three decades, using national forest inventory data of five periods (1977-1981, 1984-1988, 1989-1993, 1994-1998, and 1999-2003). The results showed that forest area and growing stock density increased by 0.51% and 0.44% annually over the past three decades, while the conversion ratio of forest biomass to growing stock declined by 0.10% annually. These developments resulted in a net annual increase of 0.85% in forest carbon sequestration, which is equivalent to a net biomass carbon uptake of 43.8 Tg per year (1 Tg = 10(12) g). This increase can be attributed to the national reforestation/afforestation programs, environmentally enhanced forest growth and economic development as indicated by the average gross domestic product.

TI  - Is enrichment planting worth its costs? A financial cost-benefit analysis
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A strategy for enhancing natural forests' economic value is to increase their concentration of economically important, indigenous tree species by planting seeds or seedlings for future harvest, which can be accomplished with enrichment planting (EP). EP may help make forest management financially attractive and thereby reduce forest conversion to other uses but many factors deter landholders from EP, including a lack of reliable information about its costs and benefits. A financial appraisal of an eastern Amazon EP case study is presented with 7 alternate scenarios: high and low financial costs, low timber yield, carbon sequestration payments, higher timber prices, free seedlings, and reduced discount rates. A sensitivity analysis of carbon payment amounts, timber prices, and discount rates is explored. The net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and benefit cost ratio (BCR) are reported for each scenario. Results showed that start-up costs must be kept low, and site maintenance must not only be sustained but also kept minimal to prevent costs from exceeding financial benefits of EP. Scenarios with the best NPV and BCR were those with carbon sequestration sales, higher timber prices, and a low discount rate. Carbon sequestration and high timber sale prices resulted in the best IRRs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - CARBON DYNAMICS OF MEXICAN TROPICAL EVERGREEN FORESTS - INFLUENCE OF FORESTRY MITIGATION OPTIONS AND REFINEMENT OF CARBONFLUX ESTIMATES
T2  - INTERCIENCIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical evergreen forests (TEF) of Mexico were deforested al a rate of approximately 206,000 ha/yr with a carbon (C) efflux of nearly 21 Tg/yr between 1980 and 1993. Land formerly occupied by these forests have potential to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, we model two management scenarios in southeast Mexico and their effects on CO2 flux. We also model two scenarios to examine possible adjustments to the region's net C-flux estimate by accounting for regrowth of degraded forests and increase of C stocks in mature forests. Potential TEF distribution in the study area and current forest inventory data from Mexico's National Periodic Forest Inventory are compared to calculate areas available for modeling land-based C flux. The CO2FIX model was used to evaluate potential C sequestration of mahogany plantations. Possible C conservation through reduced deforestation in TEF is evaluated by a simple spreadsheet model, as are improvements to the region's C-flux estimates from degraded land regrowth and C accretion in mature forests. Total C sequestration modeled in the four scenarios accounted for up to 31 Tg/yr. This illustrates the significant impacts that land management may have on carbon balance estimates and accounting for a portion of the missing global carbon sink.

TI  - EFFECT OF THE SEASONAL BURNING ON TREE SPECIES IN THE GUINEA SAVANNA WOODLAND, GHANA: IMPLICATIONS FOR CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The indiscriminate burning of vegetation is a common practice in the Guinea savanna of Ghana. Burning begins at the onset of the dry season (November) and lasts until the end (April). This study investigated the effects of time of burning on tree diversity and density in the Mole National Park, Ghana. A total of 36 (10 m x 10 m) quadrats were randomly demarcated in three treatments of early and late dry season burning and non-burning study plots. Samples were taken in March, a few weeks after the late burning period. Twenty seven different species belonging to fourteen families were recorded in all the treatments. Most of the species identified belonged to the families Combretaceae, Fabaceae and Leguminoceae. Vitellaria paradoxa, Terminalia avicennioides, Combretum adenogonium and Combretum molle were the most common and abundant in all treatments. Late burning plots recorded the lowest diversity amongst the three treatments. Non-burning plots had higher tree density than burnt plots. Early burning treatment recorded more diverse individual species but had the lowest density. Higher tree densities would enhance carbon sequestration. However, ecosystem resilience is also dependent on the diversity of biotic communities among other factors. Sustainable land use practices including protections of trees on farms and prescribed early dry season burns could be an option to contribute to the mitigation of climate change in the region. Late dry season fires are a threat to tree species populations and should be discouraged.

TI  - Shade tree diversity, carbon sequestration, and epiphyte presence in coffee agroecosystems: A decade of smallholder management in San Ramon, Nicaragua
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coffee smallholder management practices have received attention for their potential to conserve biodiversity and sequester carbon by maintaining structural complexity, high canopy diversity, and minimal external inputs. We conducted shade tree surveys on 95 1000 m(2) research plots over a 10-year period to identify patterns of shade tree density and diversity, epiphyte presence, and carbon stocks within smallholder shade coffee systems of northern Nicaragua. We also analyzed each of these parameters with respect to management by comparing collectively-and individually-managed farms. Our results indicate that the overall shade tree density has decreased over time (F = 42.597, p < 0.001), but that diversity remained constant. Carbon stocks in coffee systems also showed a decreasing trend over time (F = 2.981, p = 0.056), most likely due to the decreasing tree densities. Epiphytic plant presence increased over time despite decreased host tree densities, suggesting either a change in management or improved habitat conditions for epiphytes. Research plots on individually-managed coffee farms generally had higher shade tree densities than those on collectively managed farms (t = 2.141, p = 0.037), but we found no differences in shade tree species richness or carbon stocks (t = 0.573, p = 0.568). We conclude that smallholder coffee farmers continue to conserve both shade tree diversity and epiphyte communities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Changes in litter decomposition and soil organic carbon in a reforested tropical deciduous cover (India)
T2  - ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) up to 1 m depth originates from contemporary vegetation cover dating from past millennia. Deforestation and reforestation with economically important species is influencing soil carbon sequestration. An attempt has been made in this study to evaluate the impact of vegetation cover change (due to replacement of natural heterogeneous cover by teak and bamboo) on SOC using carbon isotopes (delta C-13, C-14) in a tropical system (India). A litter decomposition study was carried out to understand the impact of differences in vegetation characteristics (specifically of leaves) on decomposition. Both experiments were carried out to look at the impact of changes in vegetation characteristics (specifically of leaves) on litter decomposition, and how these influence near term litter decomposition rates (k values) and long-term SOC content of the soil system beneath. Leaves of teak, bamboo and eight other species were selected for this study. The proportion of structural carbohydrates (lignin and cellulose) in leaves significantly (at 5 % level) influenced k values. The SOC and carbon isotope data collected in this study indicate that C-3 vegetation cover in the study area could be contemporary and dominant for the past few centuries. This can be extended up to 2,200 years from the recorded C-14 values of teak cover. The study confirms that k values of leaf litter influence SOC present beneath the vegetation cover at the decadal/century time scale.

TI  - Estimating woody aboveground biomass in an area of agroforestry using airborne light detection and ranging and compact airborne spectrographic imager hyperspectral data: individual tree analysis incorporating tree species information
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Until now, there have been only a few studies that have made estimates of the woody aboveground biomass (AGB) in an area of agroforestry using remote sensing technology. The woody AGB density was estimated using individual tree analysis (ITA) that incorporated tree species information using a combination of airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and compact airborne spectrographic imagery acquired over a typical agroforestry in northwestern China. First, a series of improved LiDAR processing algorithms was applied to achieve individual tree segmentation, and accurate plot-level canopy heights and crown diameters were obtained. The individual tree species were then successfully classified using both spectral and shape characteristics with an overall accuracy of 0.97 and a kappa coefficient of 0.85. Finally, the tree-level AGB (kg) was estimated based on the ITA; the AGB density (Mg/ha) was then upscaled based on the tree-level AGB values. It is concluded that, compared with the commonly used area-based method combining LiDAR and spectral metrics [root mean square error (RMSE) = 19.58 Mg/ha], the ITA method performs better at estimating AGB density (RMSE = 10.56 Mg/ha). The tree species information also improved the accuracy of the AGB estimation even though the species are not well diversified in this study area.

TI  - Impacts of Future Crop Tree Release Treatments on Forest Carbon as REDD+ Mitigation Benefits
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable forest management activities, such as future crop tree (FCT) release treatments, became part of the REDD+ strategy to avoid carbon emissions from forests. FCT release treatments are intended to achieve increased growth of FCTs by removing competitor trees. This initially leads to a reduction of the forest carbon pool and represents a carbon debt. We estimated that the time it takes for FCTs to offset the carbon debt through increased growth on experimental sites of 10 km(2) in Belize, Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. We further investigated whether the costs of treatment can be compensated by the generated financial carbon benefits. An average of 2.3 FCT per hectare were released through the removal of an average of 3.3 competitors per hectare. This corresponds to an average above ground biomass (AGB) deficit of 2.3 Mg FCT-1. Assuming a 30% increase in growth, the FCT would need on average 130 years to offset the carbon loss. For carbon prices from US$ 5 to 100 Mg CO(2)e(-1) an additional increment between 0.6 and 22.7 Mg tree(-1) would be required to cover the treatment costs of US$ 4.2 to 8.4 FCT-1. Assuming a carbon price of US$ 10 Mg CO(2)e(-1), the additional increment required would be between 5.8 and 11.4 Mg tree(-1), thus exceeding the biological growth potential of most individual trees. The release of FCTs does not ensure an increase in forest carbon stocks, and refinancing of treatment costs is problematic.

TI  - Modeling and Mapping Agroforestry Aboveground Biomass in the Brazilian Amazon Using Airborne Lidar Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry has large potential for carbon (C) sequestration while providing many economical, social, and ecological benefits via its diversified products. Airborne lidar is considered as the most accurate technology for mapping aboveground biomass (AGB) over landscape levels. However, little research in the past has been done to study AGB of agroforestry systems using airborne lidar data. Focusing on an agroforestry system in the Brazilian Amazon, this study first predicted plot-level AGB using fixed-effects regression models that assumed the regression coefficients to be constants. The model prediction errors were then analyzed from the perspectives of tree DBH (diameter at breast height)height relationships and plot-level wood density, which suggested the need for stratifying agroforestry fields to improve plot-level AGB modeling. We separated teak plantations from other agroforestry types and predicted AGB using mixed-effects models that can incorporate the variation of AGB-height relationship across agroforestry types. We found that, at the plot scale, mixed-effects models led to better model prediction performance (based on leave-one-out cross-validation) than the fixed-effects models, with the coefficient of determination (R-2) increasing from 0.38 to 0.64. At the landscape level, the difference between AGB densities from the two types of models was similar to 10% on average and up to similar to 30% at the pixel level. This study suggested the importance of stratification based on tree AGB allometry and the utility of mixed-effects models in modeling and mapping AGB of agroforestry systems.

TI  - Carbon stocks in tropical evergreen broadleaf forests in Central Highland, Vietnam
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This is the first study on carbon stock estimation in the tropical evergreen broadleaf forests in Central Highland, Vietnam. As result of selective logging and shifting cultivation, remaining forests are silviculturally classified to five categories by governmental standard basing on standing volume (V), including very poor forest (V <= 10 m(3)/ha), poor forest (10 < V <= 100 m(3)/ha), medium forest (100 < V <= 200 m(3)/ha), rich (200 < V <= 300 m(3)/ha), and very rich forest (V > 300 m(3)/ha). Carbon stock of four pools including big trees (diameter at breast height/dbh >= 5 cm), short vegetation layer (dbh < 5 cm), necromass, and soil was measured by using 150 plots of 50 m x 50 m each. Soil carbon stock was assessed from soil samples taken to 30 cm depth. The results indicated total carbon stock increased from 75 tons C/ha in very poor forest to 199 tons C/ha in medium forest, and to 255 tons C/ha in very rich forest. Carbon stock in necromass was significant different (ANOVA; F-(4,F- 145) = 61.70, p < 0.001) among forest categories (from 4 to 8 tons C/ha). Meanwhile, there were no differences of carbon stock in soil and short vegetation layer among forest categories, which ranged 59-64 tons C/ha and 3-4 tons C/ha, respectively. There was a linear positive relationship between carbon in big trees and that in necromass (R-(149) = 0.61, p < 0.01). It is concluded that the degree of human disturbance had significant impacts on carbon sink in the present study forests.

TI  - Medium and large-sized mammals in a premontane moist forest fragment, Atenas, Costa Rica
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Medium and large-sized mammals are threatened globally due to habitat loss and fragmentation. In Costa Rica, forest fragments that remain outside protected areas may serve as a refuge or corridor for these animals. Mammal presence in fragmented landscapes may be influenced by resource availability, which varies greatly in seasonal regions. Objective: To determine the species richness of medium and large-sized mammals in a forest fragment, and to examine if species diversity and detectability varied between the wet and dry season. Methods: We established 26 camera trap stations throughout the Municipal Forest of Atenas (Alajuela, Costa Rica), a 26.4 ha forest fragment that provides water to about 1 800 people. From August 2021 to April 2022, one camera trap was active at each station for 12-21 days throughout each season (dry and wet), for a total of 810 camera trap days. We applied rarefaction and extrapolation curves to characterize mammal's species diversity and compare it between seasons. Results: We detected 19 species of mammals. The most frequently detected species were the White-nosed Coati (Nasua narica; 0.254 detections/camera trap day), and the Central American Agouti (Dasyprocta punctata; 0.163 detections/camera trap day). We also registered four species considered as endangered in Costa Rica, three felines: Puma concolor, Herpailurus yagouaroundi, Leopardus pardalis, and the Neotropical River Otter, Lontra longicaudis. Seasonality did not affect species diversity, but it influenced dominant species and detectability, which was greater during the wet season. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates how protecting small forest fragments, can help conserve endangered medium and large-sized mammals in human-dominated landscapes.

TI  - Integrating national forestry initiatives in India with international climate change policy
T2  - CLIMATE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Policy initiatives in India, such as the Social Forestry Program and later the Joint Forest Management, were introduced for their co-benefits, including forest protection, employment opportunities, and added income for communities living in and around the forests. The evolution of these forest policies is critically reviewed. It is argued that India is perfectly positioned to benefit from climate change mitigation efforts, due to a rich, albeit chequered, history in forest management. National forestry policies are examined to assess how they can complement international climate change mitigation instruments, such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and the more recent Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD or REDD+ with conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) and aid national sustainable development objectives. There is a need to heed the experiences from India's evolving forest policies, particularly those concerning land tenure and resource rights, which lack specificity within international mechanisms. The active engagement of rural communities must be integral to any programmes that make any claim to development and to environmental integrity as a whole. Policy relevance India's forestry programmes are examined for their effectiveness in informing international initiatives such as the CDM and REDD+. Forestry policies in India can evolve to complement international climate mitigation tools. By examining current and historical forest legislation, and their subsequent impacts, it is shown how communities can sustain their system of forest management and retain/obtain rights to land and resources under the CDM and REDD+. Looking for such synergies within existing national policies to implement newer international initiatives can greatly facilitate and increase the momentum of global environmental change.

TI  - Assessment of Above-Ground Biomass in Pakistan Forest Ecosystem's Carbon Pool: A Review
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Climate change is acknowledged as a global threat to the environment and human well-being. Forest ecosystems are a significant factor in this regard as they act both as a sink and a source of carbon. Forest carbon evaluation has received more attention after the Paris Agreement. Pakistan has 5.1% forest cover of its total land area, which comprises nine forest types. This study covers the studies conducted on above-ground biomass and carbon stock in various forest types of Pakistan. Most of the studies on biomass and carbon stock estimation have been conducted during 2015-2020. The non-destructive method is mostly followed for carbon stock estimation, followed by remote sensing. The destructive method is used only for developing allometric equations and biomass expansion factors. The information available on the carbon stock and biomass of Pakistan forest types is fragmented and sporadic. Coniferous forests are more important in carbon sequestration and can play a vital role in mitigating climate change. Pakistan is a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol and still lacks regional and national level studies on biomass and carbon stock, which are necessary for reporting under the Kyoto Protocol. This study will help researchers and decision-makers to develop policies regarding Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+), conservation, sustainable forest management and enhancement of forest carbon stocks

TI  - Quantifying aboveground biomass in African environments: A review of the trade-offs between sensor estimation accuracy and costs
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Increased global recognition of the role of forests in regulating the biosphere-atmospheric carbon cycle through carbon sequestration, has resulted in a wide range of scientific studies on estimation, mapping, monitoring and the prediction of Aboveground Biomass (AGB) on various scales in sub-Saharan Africa. In many parts of the developing world, specifically in sub-Saharan Africa, the accurate quantification of AGB, although still a challenge, is important for national carbon accounting, REDD+ project payments, sustainable forest management and strategic policy-making. In this review, an overview of remote sensing applications in AGB estimation in sub-Saharan Africa, including research challenges and basic information related to the trade-offs between sensor estimation accuracy and costs, is provided. It is assumed that this review is timely, due to a relative increase in the number of remotely sensed forests carbon studies in the recent years (specifically the period between 1998 and 2013). Remotely sensed data is particularly appealing, due to its robustness, instantaneity and repeated spatio-temporal coverage and hence the ability to successful estimate and map AGB. However, estimation accuracy and image acquisition cost vary with sensor resolution and type. It is assumed that this study will provide guidance in future national carbon accounting studies, which is one of the main objectives of the Kyoto Protocol and the REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) project, housed under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), particularly for the developing world.

TI  - Carbon storage, mitigation and sequestration potential of Haldina cordifolia and Mitragyna parvifolia in tropical dry deciduous environment of Chhattisgarh, India
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The current research explored the storage, mitigation, and sequestration of carbon in two age groups of Haldina cordifolia and Mitragyna parvifolia grown on entisols of tropical dry deciduous environment of Chhattisgarh, India. The random sampling technique was used for measuring the various ecological attributes of the stands. The average girth increment for both the species was more in site-I (6 year old plantation). H. cordifolia and M. parvifolia reflected increment of 2.3-5 cm yr- 1 and 2.5-5 cm yr-1, respectively. The NPP (net primary production) values for both the sites viz., site-I (6 year old plantation) and site-II (4 year old plantation) were 10.32 t ha-1 yr- 1 and 8.92 t ha-1 yr- 1, respectively for H. cordifolia plantation and 11.08 t ha- 1 yr- 1 and 9.63 t ha-1 yr-1 for M. parvifolia plantation. The carbon (C) storage, mitigation, and carbon sequestration (Cseq.) values for the two sites ranged from 19.22-24 t ha- 1, 70.54-88.08 t ha- 1, and 3.08-3.81 t ha-1 yr- 1, respectively. It is evident that site-I (6 year old plantation) and M. parvifolia perform better than site-II (4 year old plantation) and H. cordifolia, respectively. Both the species belong to family Rubiaceae and among both the species M. parvifolia reflected comparatively better growth traits over H. cordifolia. Thus, M. parvifolia can be effectively utilized for afforestation, reforestation, and other plantation programs in this region as well as other places with similar environmental conditions.

TI  - Effects of landscape fragmentation of plantation forests on carbon storage in the Loess Plateau, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree plantation and forest restoration are the major strategies for enhancing terrestrial carbon sequestration and mitigating climate change. The Grain for Green Project in China has positively impacted global carbon sequestration and the trend towards fragmentation of plantation forests. Limited studies have been conducted on changes in plantation biomass and stand structure caused by fragmentation, and the effect of fragmentation on the carbon storage of plantation forests remains unclear. This study evaluated the differences between carbon storage and stand structure in black locust forests in fragmented and continuous landscape in the Ansai District, China and discussed the effects of ecological significance of four landscape indices on carbon storage and tree density. We used structural equation modelling to explore the direct and indirect effects of fragmentation, edge, abiotic factors, and stand structure on above-ground carbon storage. Diameter at breast height (DBH) in fragmented forests was 53.3% thicker, tree density was 40.9% lower, and carbon storage was 49.8% higher than those in continuous forests; for all given DBH>10 cm, the trees in fragmented forests were shorter than those in continuous forests. The patch area had a negative impact on carbon storage, i.e., the higher the degree of fragmentation, the lower the density of the tree; and fragmentation and distance to edge (DTE) directly increased canopy coverage. However, canopy coverage directly decreased carbon storage, and fragmentation directly increased carbon storage and tree density. In non-commercial forests, fragmentation reduces the carbon storage potential of plantation, and the influence of patch area, edge, and patchy connection on plantation should be considered when follow-up trees are planted and for the plantation management. Thus, expanding the area of plantation patches, repairing the edges of complex-shaped patches, enhancing the connectivity of similar patches, and applying nutrients to plantation forests at regular intervals are recommended in fragmented areas of the Loess Plateau.

TI  - Forest biomass recovery after different anthropogenic disturbances: relative importance of changes in stand structure and wood density
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoring the functions of disturbed forest to mitigation climate change is a main topic of policy makers. Better understanding of factors that directly influence post-disturbance forest biomass recovery is urgently needed to guide forest restoration and management. In this study, we examine changes in forest stand structure, wood density and biomass of forests recovering from different anthropogenic disturbances that represent forest land-use types in subtropical China: plantation, twice-logged and once-logged secondary forests, and compare them with undisturbed old-growth forest. Stand structure and wood density in all disturbed forests were evidently different from that of old-growth forest, even after 50-year regrowth. Forest biomass increased along plantation, twice-logged, once-logged and old-growth forests, with total living biomass (TLB) ranging from 150.8 +/- A 4.6 to 278.4 +/- A 1.5 Mg ha(-1), aboveground biomass from 111.8 +/- A 4.2 to 204.1 +/- A 1.5 Mg ha(-1) and coarse-root biomass from 33.0 +/- A 0.9 to 71.0 +/- A 0.8 Mg ha(-1). However, fine-root biomass was highest in plantation (5.99 +/- A 0.52 Mg ha(-1)) and lowest in once-logged forest (3.35 +/- A 0.19 Mg ha(-1)). Both changes in stand structure and functional trait (wood density) directly determine forest biomass recovery according to the result that 10.6, 35.5 and 8.2 % of variation in TLB over the disturbance gradient were independently explained by basal area (< 20 cm diameter), basal area (a parts per thousand yen20 cm diameter) and wood density, respectively. Our results suggest that recovery forest structure to the state associated with undisturbed forests will lead to large carbon sink in disturbed forests. In addition, trait-based managing approach should not be overlooked when maximizing carbon storage is a major management objective.

TI  - New estimates of carbon storage and sequestration in China's forests: Effects of age-class and method on inventory-based carbon estimation
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Workshop on Quantifying Terrestrial Carbon Sinks
CL  - Wengen, SWITZERLAND
AB  - We developed a volume-to-biomass method based on age groups representative of forest development stages to estimate live tree biomass, C, and biomass and C accumulation rates of China's forests between 1973 and 1993. The data were from plot-level forest inventory, national-level inventory statistics, and ecological site studies specified to estimate biomass in different tree components. Our results indicate that carbon storage in China's forests was 4.34 Pg C in the early 1990s, an increase of 13% since the early 1970s. The annual forest C sequestration rate front the late 1980s to early 1990s was 0.068 Pg C/yr and approximately four- to five-times higher than in the 1970s and 1980s. The large C sink in China's forests in the early 1990s was likely related to age structure changes that had developed to more productive stages, a consequence of reforestation and afforestation programs front the 1960s. The results were compared with other C store estimates, which were based on the same inventory data. Various methods can produce estimates that differ in the direction of C flux as well as its magnitude. Separating age groups with the volume-biomass method could cause a 27% difference in estimated carbon pools but an 89% difference in C sequestration rates whereas the biomass density method would provide an estimate that differs by 65% in the C pools.

TI  - Re-evaluation of forest biomass carbon stocks and lessons from the world's most carbon-dense forests
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - From analysis of published global site biomass data (n = 136) from primary forests, we discovered (i) the world's highest known total biomass carbon density (living plus dead) of 1,867 tonnes carbon per ha (average value from 13 sites) occurs in Australian temperate moist Eucalyptus regnans forests, and (ii) average values of the global site biomass data were higher for sampled temperate moist forests (n = 44) than for sampled tropical (n = 36) and boreal (n = 52) forests (n is number of sites per forest biome). Spatially averaged Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change biome default values are lower than our average site values for temperate moist forests, because the temperate biome contains a diversity of forest ecosystem types that support a range of mature carbon stocks or have a long land-use history with reduced carbon stocks. We describe a framework for identifying forests important for carbon storage based on the factors that account for high biomass carbon densities, including (i) relatively cool temperatures and moderately high precipitation producing rates of fast growth but slow decomposition, and (ii) older forests that are often multiaged and multilayered and have experienced minimal human disturbance. Our results are relevant to negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change regarding forest conservation, management, and restoration. Conserving forests with large stocks of biomass from deforestation and degradation avoids significant carbon emissions to the atmosphere, irrespective of the source country, and should be among allowable mitigation activities. Similarly, management that allows restoration of a forest's carbon sequestration potential also should be recognized.

TI  - Biochar and forest restoration: a review and meta-analysis of tree growth responses
T2  - NEW FORESTS
M3  - Review
AB  - "Biochar", or charcoal intended for use as a soil amendment, has received great attention in recent years as a means of enhancing carbon sequestration and soil properties in agricultural systems. Here we address the potential for biochar use in the context of forest restoration, reviewing relevant experimental studies on biochar use in forest ecosystems, the properties of chars generated from wood waste material, and available data on tree growth responses to biochar. To our knowledge the earliest mention of char use as a soil amendment is actually specifically in the context of forest restoration (in the 1820s in Scotland). Wood waste biochars have an unusual set of properties that suggest their applicability in a forest restoration context: namely, high recalcitrance promoting long-lasting effects, retention of cations, anions, and water, in the soil, sorptive properties that can reduce bioavailability of a wide range of toxic materials, and relative ease of production from locally available feedstocks. A meta-analysis of recent studies on biochar responses of woody plants indicates a potential for large tree growth responses to biochar additions, with a mean 41 % increase in biomass. Responses are especially pronounced at early growth stages, and appear to be higher in boreal and tropical than in temperate systems, and in angiosperms than conifers; however, there is high variability, and field studies are few. The properties of biochars also vary greatly depending on feedstock and pyrolysis conditions; while this complicates their use, it provides a means to design biochars for specific restoration situations and objectives. We conclude that there is great promise for biochar to play an important role in a wide variety of forest restoration efforts, specifically as a replacement product for other forms of organic matter and liming agents.

TI  - Management effects on carbon stocks and fluxes across the Orinoco Savannas
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Across the physiognomic types of the Orinoco llanos, periodic inventories and changes in land-use between 1982-1992 are estimated. Results indicate that the area under pastures and forest plantations is increased by 0.005337 x 10(6) km(2), whilts reducing the area of croplands by 0.000119 x 10(6) km(2). This is a net increase of 0.005218 x 10(6) km(2). The gross carbon release is 174.66 Tg C per year to the atmosphere and transferring from cultivated and native vegetation to wood products (1.62 Tg C per year) and slash (1.18 Tg C per year). The processes of land preparation contribute 1.40 Tg C per year to the atmosphere. From the tree savannas, woodlands and forests 0.73 Tg C per year are estimated to have been transferred to the soil following clearance and burning over this period, and 1.05 Tg C per year from herbaceous savannas when were buried and decomposed at 0.84 Tg C per year. The estimate of carbon balance here by inventories and changes in land-use approach indicates that the Orinoco llanos is a sink of -17.53 Tg C per year. The carbon turnover time in the Orinoco system is 68 years, which provides a limited route for carbon sequestration. The calculated potential of the Orinoco Ilanos for storing carbon is 8300 Tg C. Ecological options to achieve this potential value are addressed. However, nutrient deficiency and seasonal water supply are serious drawbacks to take into account for increasing carbon accretion. These results are particular for the Orinoco llanos, even though described processes could be similar to world-wide savannas, where a gradient of carbon heterogeneity exists.

TI  - Negative emissions technologies: A complementary solution for climate change mitigation
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main greenhouse gas (GHG) and its atmospheric concentration is currently 50% higher than pre-industrial levels. The continuous GHGs emissions may lead to severe and irreversible consequences in the climate system. The reduction of GHG emissions may be not enough to mitigate climate change. Consequently, besides carbon capture from large emission sources, atmospheric CO2 capture may be also required. To meet the target defined for climate change mitigation, the removal of 10 Gt.yr(-1) of CO2 globally by mid-century and 20 Gt.yr(-1) of CO2 globally by the end of century. The technologies applied with this aim are known as negative emission technologies (NETs), as they lead to achieve a negative balance of carbon in atmosphere. This paper aims to present the recent research works regarding NETs, focusing the research findings achieved by academic groups and projects. Besides several advantages, NETs present high operational cost and its scale-up should be tested to know the real effect on climate change mitigation. With current knowledge, no single process should be seen as a solution. Research efforts should be performed to evaluate and reduce NETs costs and environmental impact.

TI  - Selecting exceptional tropical tree species to increase long-term carbon storage
T2  - Dryad
M3  - Data set
AB  - With rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, strategies for greater carbon sequestration and long-term storage are urgently needed. Current reforestation schemes typically use fast-growing tree species with low wood density, limiting the amount of carbon stored. In most tropical forests, there are native species with relatively fast growth rates, high wood density, and low mortality rates that also achieve large adult size  exceptional species. We present a simulated assessment of the carbon sequestration potential using these exceptional species selected based on a given set of criteria in assisted secondary succession in the Neotropics. In our example, our selected exceptional species could addup to 16.2 Mg C/ha of sequestered carbon in secondary wet forests at maturity. Synthesis and applications. By increasing the representation of exceptional species in reforestation efforts, we could potentially boost long-term carbon storage in reforestation projects focused on carbon sequestration. However, our approach is not a substitute for protecting existing old primary forests and reforested lands plus reducing deforestation and emissions. # Selecting exceptional tropical tree species to increase long-term carbon storage ### Journal name: Journal of Applied Ecology ### Corresponding Author Name: Anna Sugiyama Email address: a.sugiyama@landlifecompany.com Affiliation when the work was conducted: Yale University Present affiliation: Land Life Company **Abstract**: Two data files associated with the article "Planting exceptional tropical tree species to increase long-term carbon storage in assisted secondary succession" by Anna Sugiyama, Edward T.

TI  - A meta-analytical global comparison of aboveground biomass accumulation between tropical secondary forests and monoculture plantations
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary forests and monoculture plantations are widespread in the tropics and are the two most common forms of reforestation. To assess the value of both systems for CO2 mitigation, we performed a systematic analysis of the two systems comparing growth rates and potential to store carbon. The increasing involvement of these forest types in carbon trading makes a pertinent issue. We used a meta-analytical approach to evaluate relative rates of aboveground growth (biomass accumulation) in secondary forests and monoculture plantations, controlling for climate and site characteristics. We find a general tendency for aboveground biomass accumulation (ABA) to be marginally higher in plantations than secondary forests. Three recorded site factors were significantly associated with ABA, but differed between reforestation types. Plantation growth rates were negatively correlated with precipitation seasonality, while growth rates of secondary forest were positively correlated with surrounding tree cover and negatively correlated with duration of prior land use. It is noteworthy that poor reporting of site history such as prior land-use duration, particularly in monoculture plantations, and a strong bias in studies towards measuring young forest plots obfuscates evaluation of some ecological drivers and long-term processes. We conclude that the difference in ABA between tropical secondary forests and monoculture plantations is smaller than previously assumed, emphasising the potential of secondary forests for low-cost carbon storage and biomass production, particularly in landscapes with high existing tree cover or highly seasonal rainfall.

TI  - Carbon content and allometric models to estimate aboveground biomass for forest areas under restoration
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Maximizing carbon sequestration is crucial to mitigate climate change and indicates that the restoration technique used was effective. To quantify carbon stock over time on areas being restored, suitable allometric equations are needed. These equations are lacking for the Atlantic forest, lacking even more for restoration sites, and rare for restoration areas implemented with the active method, technique often used to restore Atlantic forest areas. Thus, the objective of this study was 3-fold. First, to provide an equation to estimate aboveground biomass for 5-year-old Atlantic forest under restoration implemented with the active method. Second, to determine carbon content for the branch, stem, and foliage pools for those areas. Third, to present biomass, carbon content, and carbon stock benchmarks for 5-year-old areas under restoration implemented with the active method. Three sites were sampled with nine plots each, measuring tree height and diameter. One subplot was established in each plot, and all trees within it were harvested and had fresh weight measured and samples were taken to the laboratory to dry weight and carbon content determination. Ten models estimating biomass were fitted and tested. Mean carbon content in foliage, branch, stem, and the weighted average were 44.8, 44.5, 45.8, and 45.3%, respectively. Mean biomass and carbon stock were 20.19 +/- 0.146 Mg/ha and 9.73 Mg C/ha. We concluded that the equation that we provide is precise, and very necessary to estimate biomass for young restoration areas at the Atlantic forest.

TI  - Does the Introduction of N2-Fixing Trees in Forest Plantations on Tropical Soils Ameliorate Low Fertility and Enhance Carbon Sequestration via Interactions Between Biota and Nutrient Availability? Case Studies From Central Africa and South America
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Plant and/or crop growth rely on nutrient dynamics driven by specific soil biota in different environments. This mini-review aims to provide an overview of interactions between soil organisms, nutrient dynamics, and C sequestration. To this end, we investigated published results from three forest plantations (eucalyptus monocultures and mixed plantations with N-2-fixing acacia) on tropical nutrient-poor soils. One case study is located in Central Africa (Congolese coastal plains) and two others in South America (Southeastern Brazil). Overall, the studies showed that soil biota activity exerted positive effects on (i) C accretion, as both soil carbon and belowground and aboveground biomass are driven and enhanced by soil biota; and (ii) on nutrient dynamics and biogeochemical cycles in nutrient-poor soil of tropical ecosystems, which are boosted following C accumulation. On the other hand, the pedoclimatic environment may potentially impact soil functioning of mixed-species plantations through its influence on the composition and activity of bacterial communities. Regardless of the potential risk of acacia invasiveness, benefits such as pulp, fuelwood, electric pole and non-timber products supply, have been reported in Central Africa. We, therefore, conclude that including N-2 fixing trees in forestry plantations as reported in this mini-review helps strengthen the links between soil biota, nutrient and SOC dynamics in mixed-species plantations on tropical nutrient-poor soils.

TI  - Nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment accelerates soil organic carbon loss in alpine grassland on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic activities have substantially increased soil nutrient availability, which in turn affects ecosystem processes and functions, especially in nutrient-limited ecosystems such as alpine grasslands. Although considerable efforts have been devoted to understanding the responses of plant productivity and community composition to nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) enrichment, the nutrient enrichment effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) and microbial functions are not well understood. A four-year field experiment was established to evaluate the influence of continuous N and P enrichment on plant growth and SOC content in an alpine grassland of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The study included four treatments: Control without addition, N addition, P addition, and N plus P addition. N addition strongly increased aboveground plant biomass and decreased species richness by promoting growth of the dominant grasses species. In contrast, N and P enrichment significantly decreased SOC, especially the recalcitrant organic C content in the surface layer (0-10 cm) by reducing the slow C pool and enlarging the active C pool. Microbial biomass and activities of C-degrading enzymes (beta-glucosidase, cellulase and polyphenol oxidase) and an N-degrading enzyme (chitinase) increased with nutrient inputs. The CO2 emissions during a 300 d incubation period were positively correlated with the cellulase and chitinase activities, while the slow C pool was negatively correlated with the cellulase and polyphenol oxidase activities. Consequently, N and P enrichment accelerated decomposition of the recalcitrant C by stimulating microbial growth and increasing enzyme activities, leading to negative impacts on soil C sequestration. Overall, the results indicate that alpine grassland soils of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau may be changing from a C sink to a C source under increasing N and P availability, and improvement of alpine grassland management through nutrient inputs should consider not only the aboveground biomass for grazing, but also the soil C sequestration and ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Spatial distribution of phytomass carbon in Indian forests
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A spatial analysis of phytomass carbon (C) in Indian forests for the period (1988-94) at the district-level is reported. District-level forest phytomass C (1988,1994) was computed by combining remote sensing-based forest area inventories on 1:250 000 scale, field inventories of growing stock volume by the Forest Survey of India (FSI), and crown density-based biomass expansion factors. The estimates of forest area inventory, forest phytomass C density, and forest phytomass C pools (1988-94) were linked to the district boundary coverage of India in ARC/INFO Geographic Information System (GIS). Of the total 386 districts examined, only 17 districts had more than 75% forest cover (as percent of their geographic area) in 1988. Estimated district-level forest phytomass C densities ranged from 4.3 to 206.8 MgC ha(-1)*. At the national level, forest phytomass C pool was estimated to be 3871.2 and 3874.3 TgC# in 1988 and 1994, respectively. Although the aggregated national estimates were similar, the district-level change analysis indicated a decrease of 77.8 TgC and an increase of 81 TgC (1988-94). The highest decrease of 10.4 TgC was observed in Vishakapatnam district (Andhra Pradesh) while largest increase of 9.8 TgC in Bastar district (Madhya Pradesh) resulting from deforestation and afforestation activities, respectively. At the national level, the total forest cover decreased by similar to0.6 Mha, however, the district-level spatial analysis indicated an increase of 1.07 Mha, and decrease of 1.65 Mha forest cover during 1988-94 period. Although, this is the first district level phytomass C analysis of Indian forests, the aggregated results at state-level were close to the earlier estimates. The spatial analysis identified the districts that have undergone significant changes in their forest phytomass C during the study period. This improved understanding of forest phytomass C pools is important to sustainable development and conservation of forests, mitigation strategies for C sequestration, and accurate estimation of contribution of land use changes to C emission in India.

TI  - Managing reforestation to sequester carbon, increase biodiversity potential and minimize loss of agricultural land
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reforestation will have important consequences for the global challenges of mitigating climate change, arresting habitat decline and ensuring food security. We examined field-scale trade-offs between carbon sequestration of tree plantings and biodiversity potential and loss of agricultural land. Extensive surveys of reforestation across temperate and tropical Australia (N = 1491 plantings) were usedto determine how planting width and species mix affect carbon sequestration during early development (< 15 year). Carbon accumulation per area increased significantly with decreasing planting width and with increasing proportion of eucalypts (the predominant over-storey genus). Highest biodiversity potential was achieved through block plantings (width > 40 m) with about 25% of planted individuals being eucalypts. Carbon and biodiversity goals were balanced in mixed-species plantings by establishing narrow belts (width <20 m) with a high proportion (>75%) of eucalypts, and in monocultures of mallee eucalypt plantings by using the widest belts (ca. 6-20 m). Impacts on agriculture were minimized by planting narrow belts (ca. 4m) of mallee eucalypt monocultures, which had the highest carbon sequestering efficiency. A plausible scenario where only 5% of highly-cleared areas (<30% native vegetation cover remaining) of temperate Australia are reforested showed substantial mitigation potential. Total carbon sequestration after 15 years was up to 25 Mt CO2-e year(-1) when carbon and biodiversity goals were balanced and 13 Mt CO2-e year(-1) if block plantings of highest biodiversity potential were established. Even when reforestation was restricted to marginal agricultural land (<$2000 ha(-1) land value, 28% of the land under agriculture in Australia), total mitigation potential after 15 years was 17-26 Mt CO2-e year(-1) using narrow belts of mallee plantings. This work provides guidance on land use to governments and planners. We show that the multiple benefits of young tree plantings can be balanced by manipulating planting width and species choice at establishment. in highly-cleared areas, such plantings can sequester substantial biomass carbon while improving biodiversity and causing negligible loss of agricultural land.

TI  - Carbon accumulation in agroforestry systems is affected by tree species diversity, age and regional climate: A global meta-analysis
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Agroforestry is a globally practised system of land use for achieving greater and more diverse biomass production, but it has other ecological benefits, such as mitigation of climate change. Despite this, long-term carbon (C) accumulation in different components of agroforestry systems, the drivers for C accumulation and the linkages between tree biomass and soil C stocks remain unclear. Location Global. Time period From 1989 to 2019. Major taxa studied Trees. Methods Here, we report on a global meta-analysis based on 141 studies to identify patterns of C accumulation in tree-based agroforestry systems compared with sole cropland and pasture. Results We found that agroforestry systems had, on average, 46.1 Mg/ha (95% confidence interval, 36.4-55.8 Mg/ha) more C in tree biomass compared with sole cropland- or pasture-based land uses without trees. Furthermore, agroforestry systems with multiple tree species contained greater biomass C stocks and accumulated biomass C faster than systems with a single tree species. The effect of agroforestry practices on soil C stock increased with tree age, although such increases varied among climatic zones. Agroforestry systems in tropical zones had the ability to increase soil C to peak levels quickly, whereas soil C in temperate zones increased at a slower rate but peaked at a greater overall soil C level. Our structural equation model did not detect a direct linkage between biomass C and changes in total soil C stock in agroforestry systems. Main conclusions Our results demonstrate that planting multiple tree species in agroforestry systems is an important strategy to increase biomass C sequestration, with regional climate affecting the temporal change of soil C in response to agroforestry practices.

TI  - Evidence of Incipient Forest Transition in Southern Mexico
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Case studies of land use change have suggested that deforestation across Southern Mexico is accelerating. However, forest transition theory predicts that trajectories of change can be modified by economic factors, leading to spatial and temporal heterogeneity in rates of change that may take the form of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). This study aimed to assess the evidence regarding potential forest transition in Southern Mexico by classifying regional forest cover change using Landsat imagery from 1990 through to 2006. Patterns of forest cover change were found to be complex and nonlinear. When rates of forest loss were averaged over 342 municipalities using mixed-effects modelling the results showed a significant (p< 0.001) overall reduction of the mean rate of forest loss from 0.85% per year in the 1990-2000 period to 0.67% in the 2000-2006 period. The overall regional annual rate of deforestation has fallen from 0.33% to 0.28% from the 1990s to 2000s. A high proportion of the spatial variability in forest cover change cannot be explained statistically. However analysis using spline based general additive models detected underlying relationships between forest cover and income or population density of a form consistent with the EKC. The incipient forest transition has not, as yet, resulted in widespread reforestation. Forest recovery remains below 0.20% per year. Reforestation is mostly the result of passive processes associated with reductions in the intensity of land use. Deforestation continues to occur at high rates in some focal areas. A transition could be accelerated if there were a broader recognition among policy makers that the regional rate of forest loss has now begun to fall. The changing trajectory provides an opportunity to actively restore forest cover through stimulating afforestation and stimulating more sustainable land use practices. The results have clear implications for policy aimed at carbon sequestration through reducing deforestation and enhancing forest growth.

TI  - Sapling biomass allometry and carbon content in five afforestation species on marginal farmland in semi-arid Benin
T2  - NEW FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Allometric equations are routinely used in the estimation of biomass stocks for carbon accounting within forest ecosystems. However, generic equations may not reflect the growth trajectories of afforestation species that are introduced to degraded farmland characterized by water and nutrient limitations. Using sequential measurements of the height, basal diameter, and above- and belowground biomass of juvenile trees, we developed allometric equations for five woody species (Moringa oleifera Lam., Leucaena leucocephala Lam., Jatropha curcas L., Anacardium occidentale L. and Parkia biglobosa Jacq.) subjected to a gradient of water and nutrient availability in an afforestation trial on degraded cropland in the semi-arid zone of Benin, West Africa. For three of the species studied, the allometric relationships between basal diameter and biomass components (i.e. leaves, stems and roots) were described best by a simple power-law model (R-2 > 0.93). The incorporation of species-specific height-diameter relationships and total height as additional predictors in the power-law function also produced reasonable estimates of biomass. Fifteen months after planting, roots accounted for 10-58% of the total biomass while the root-to-shoot ratio ranged between 0.16 and 0.73. The total biomass of the saplings ranged between 1.4 and 10.3 Mg ha(-1), yielding 0.6-4.3 Mg C ha(-1), far exceeding the biomass in the traditional fallow system. The rate of stem carbon sequestration measured ca. 0.62 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). Overall, the allometric equations developed in this study are generally useful for assessing the standing shoot and root biomass of the five afforestation species during the juvenile growth stage and can help in reporting and verifying carbon stocks in young forests.

TI  - Contribution of glomalin to dissolve organic carbon under different land uses and seasonality in dry tropics
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Glomalin related soil protein (GRSP) is a hydrophobic glycoprotein that is significant for soil organic carbon (SOC) persistence and sequestration, owing to its large contribution to SOC pool and long turnover time. However, the contribution of GRSP to dissolve OC (DOC) leach from soil is not yet comprehensively explored, though it could have implication in understanding SOC dynamics. We, therefore, aim to measure the contribution of GRSP to DOC, in a range of land uses and climatic seasons in the dry tropical ecosystem. Our results demonstrated that a significant proportion of GRSP (water soluble GRSP; WS-GRSP) leached with DOC (7.9-21.9 mg kg(-1)), which accounts for 0.2-0.23% of soils total GRSP (T-GRSP). Forest exhibited significantly higher WS-GRSP and DOC leaching than fallow and agriculture. WS-GRSP and DOC accumulations were higher in the dry season (summer and winter) than in rainy. The extent of seasonal variations was higher in forest than in other two land uses, indicating the role of vegetation and biological activity in soil dissolve organic matter (DOM) dynamics. The regression analysis among WS-GRSP, T-GRSP, DOC and SOC prove that the accumulations and leaching of GRSP and other soil OM (SOM) depend on similar factors. The ratio of WS-GRSP-C to DOC was higher in agriculture soil than in forest and fallow, likely a consequence of altered soil chemistry, and organic matter quantity and quality due to soil management practices. Multivariate analysis reflects a strong linkage among GRSP and SOC storage and leaching, soil nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and other important soil properties (pH and bulk density), suggesting that improving GRSP and other SOM status is an urgent need for the both SOC sequestration and soil health in dry tropical agro-ecosystems.

TI  - Allometric equations for estimating above- and belowground biomass in Tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) agroforestry system of Barak Valley, Assam, northeast India
T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) agroforestry has widespread implications for the earnings and food security for a large fraction of population in NorthEast India. It also has immense potentiality to act as a considerable reservoir of biomass carbon providing climate change mitigation options. In the present study an attempt was made to develop allometric equations for above-and belowground biomass estimation specific to Tea [C. sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze] in Barak Valley of northeast India. Relationships were developed through destructive sampling and regressing diameter alone and along height, wood density, crown area, branch count with biomass. Allometric power function equation and linear equivalents have been developed. Diameter singly could predict significantly aboveground biomass (AGB) root biomass (BGB) and total Tea biomass (TB) with over 95% accuracy. Whereas incorporation of height, crown area, wood density, branch count with diameter influenced the model in terms of modified coefficient of determination and minimized estimation errors. Branches, stem and leaves accounted 50, 21 and 6% of AGB respectively. Root biomass (BGB) contributed 23% of the total Tea bush biomass. The samples exhibited overall BGB/AGB ratio of 0.30 +/- 0.08 and biomass expansion factor (BEF) by 4.23 +/- 1.6. Biomass of different components significantly differs in varied diameter sizes.

TI  - Co-production of agroecological innovations to improve sustainability in South American fruit farms
T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural intensification and expansion are the main drivers of biodiversity loss that continue to increase this century, especially in South America. International markets and global policy provide incentives and frameworks to address this, but these are unlikely to be effective unless farmers on the ground are enabled and motivated to respond to them by developing long-term solutions that fit their production systems and local contexts. Here, we use a multi-actor transdisciplinary approach to co-design and test agroecological innovations suitable for intensive, exporting South American fruit farms. We focus on highly biodiverse regions experiencing habitat loss in the Mediterranean and dry tropical forest regions of Chile and Brazil, respectively. The innovations were designed to support local biodiversity without compromising productivity or quality. Fourteen farmers participated throughout the project, covering a total of 4178 ha of intensive table grape, mango and cherry production. All were under pressure from buyers to report action on biodiversity. Farmers worked with researchers and industry representatives through an iterative process of dialogues and workshops to select, co-design and implement three agroecological innovations: perches for birds of prey, cover crops and native hedgerows. Farmers became engaged in monitoring their effectiveness and redesigning them to suit local contexts. We develop an extensive set of resources for ongoing dissemination, including an online sustainability metric to report the practices carried out. Eight farms continued to implement at least one agroecological innovation beyond the end of the project, motivated by its fit to their management system and their ability to report positive actions in their supply chains. Policy implications. Our model of knowledge co-production demonstrates how transdisciplinary research in agriculture, fully localised in a particular food-producing context, can enable farmers in the global South to engage with biodiversity conservation in response to top-down market signals incentivising sustainability. We argue that many top-down effort to enhance the sustainability of food supply chains, whether through market incentives, voluntary codes or trade regulations, requires locally based knowledge co-production, in which multiple stakeholders from agriculture and the food industry can benefit from working with locally based researchers.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.La intensificacion y expansion de la agricultura son los principales motores de la perdida de biodiversidad durante este siglo, especialmente en Sudamerica. Los mercados internacionales y la politica global ofrecen incentivos y marcos para abordar esto, pero es poco probable que sean efectivas a menos que los agricultores esten capacitados y motivados para responder a ellos, desarrollando soluciones a largo plazo que se adapten a sus sistemas de produccion y contextos locales. En este trabajo, utilizamos un enfoque transdisciplinario de multiples actores para co-disenar y probar innovaciones agroecologicas adecuadas para predios de produccion fruticola intensivas y exportadoras de Sudamerica. Nos enfocamos en regiones de gran biodiversidad que experimentan perdida de habitat, en las regiones mediterranea y de bosque tropical seco de Chile y Brasil, respectivamente. Las innovaciones se disenaron para apoyar la biodiversidad local sin comprometer la productividad o calidad de la produccion. Catorce agricultores participaron en todo el proyecto, abarcando un total de 4.178 ha de produccion intensiva de uva de mesa, mango y cereza. Todos estaban mandatados por los compradores para que informaran de las medidas adoptadas en materia de biodiversidad. Los agricultores trabajaron con investigadores y representantes de la industria a traves de un proceso iterativo de dialogos y talleres para seleccionar, co-disenar e implementar tres innovaciones agroecologicas: perchas para aves rapaces, cultivos de cobertura y setos nativos. Los agricultores se involucraron en monitorear su efectividad y redisenarlos para adaptarlos a los contextos locales Desarrollamos un amplio conjunto de recursos para la difusion continua, incluida una metrica de sostenibilidad en linea para informar sobre las practicas implementadas. Ocho predios siguieron aplicando al menos una innovacion agroecologica una vez finalizado el proyecto, motivadas por su adecuacion a su sistema de gestion y su capacidad para informar de acciones positivas en sus cadenas de suministro.

Nuestro modelo de coproduccion de conocimiento demuestra como la investigacion transdisciplinar en agricultura, localizada en un contexto particular de produccion de alimentos, puede permitir a los agricultores del Sur comprometerse con la conservacion de la biodiversidad en respuesta a las senales del mercado que incentivan la sostenibilidad. Sostenemos que muchos esfuerzo de arriba hacia abajo para mejorar la sostenibilidad de las cadenas de suministro de alimentos, ya sea a traves de incentivos de mercado, codigos voluntarios o regulaciones comerciales, requiere una coproduccion de conocimientos basado en el lugar, en la que multiples partes interesadas de la agricultura y la industria alimentaria pueden beneficiarsr al trabajar con investigadores locales.A intensificacao e a expansao agricola sao os principais fatores relacionados a perda de biodiversidade, que continua a aumentar neste seculo, especialmente na America do Sul. Os mercados internacionais e o cenariopolitico global fornecem incentivos e estrutura para lidar com este problema, mas e improvavel que estes sejam eficazes a menos que os agricultores estejam capacitados e motivados a desenvolver solucoes de longo prazo que se adaptem aos seu sistema de producao e contexto local. Aqui, utilizamos a abordagem transdisciplinar envonvedo multiplos atores para co-desenvolver e testar inovacoes agroecologicas adequadas a fazendas de fruticultura intensiva e exportadoras da America do Sul. Nos enfocamos areas com elevada biodiversidade, atingidas por perda de habitat, situadas em regiao mediterranea ede floresta tropical seca no Chile e no Brasil, respetivamente. As inovacoes foram concebidas para apoiar a biodiversidade local sem comprometer a produtividade ou a qualidade. Catorze agricultores participaram do projeto, abrangendo area total de 4.178 ha com producao intensiva de uva de mesa, manga e cereja. Todos estavam sob pressao dos compradores para apresentarem acoesrelacionadas a biodiversidade. Os agricultores trabalharam com pesquisadores e representantes da industria atraves de um processo iterativo de dialogo e grupo de trabalho, para selecionar, co-desenvolver e implementar tres inovacoes agroecologicas: poleiros para aves de rapina, cultivo de cobertura e faixas com plantas nativas. Os agricultores empenharam-se em monitorar a eficacia e desenvolver adaptacoes para adequa-las ao contexto local. Desenvolvemos um conjunto amplo de recursos para divulgacao continua, incluindo uma metrica de sustentabilidade online para comunicar as praticas realizadas. Oito agricultores continuaram a implementar pelo menos uma inovacao agroecologica apos a finalizacao do projeto, motivados pela sua adequacao ao sistema demanejo e por representar acao positiva para a cadeia de abastecimento. Implicacoes para as politicas. O nosso modelo de coproducao de conhecimento demonstra como a pesquisatransdisciplinar na agricultura, situada totalmente em um contexto particular de producao de alimentos, pode permitir que os agricultores do Sul global se envolvam na conservacao da biodiversidade em resposta a sinais de mercado, de cima para baixo, que incentivam a sustentabilidade. Argumentamos que muitos esforcos, de cima para baixo, para melhorar a sustentabilidade das cadeias de abastecimento alimentar, seja atraves de incentivos de mercado, codigos voluntarios ou regulamentos comerciais, requer a coproducao de conhecimentos de base local, na qual varios tomadores de decisao, da agricultura e da industria alimentar, podem se beneficiar trabalhando com pesquisadores locais.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

TI  - An assessment of carbon stock for various land use system in Aravally mountains, Western India
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation in developing countries is of the central importance in efforts to combat climate change. A study was conducted to measure carbon stocks in various land-use systems including forms and reliably estimates the impact of land use on carbon (C) stocks in the forest of Rajasthan, western India (23 degrees 3'-30 degrees 12'N longitude and 69 degrees 30'-78 degrees 17'E). 22.8% of India is forested and 0.04% is the deforestation rate of India. In Indian forest sector of western India of Aravally mountain range covered large area of deciduous forest and it's very helpful in carbon sequestration at global level. The carbon stocks of forest, plantation (reforestation) and agricultural land in aboveground, soil organic and fine root within forest were estimated through field data collection. Results revealed that the amount of total carbon stock of forests (533.64 +/- 37.54 Mg.ha(-1), simplified expression of Mg (carbon) .ha(-1)) was significantly greater (P<0.05) than the plantation (324.37 +/- 15.0 Mg.ha(-1)) and the agricultural land (120.50 +/- 2.17 Mg.ha(-1)). Soil organic carbon in the forests (172.84 +/- 3.78 Mg.ha(-1)) was also significantly greater (P<0.05) than the plantation (153.20 +/- 7.48 Mg.ha(-1)) and the agricultural land (108.71 +/- 1.68 Mg.ha(-1)). The differences in carbon stocks across land-use types are the primary consequence of variations in the vegetation biomass and the soil organic matter. Fine root carbon was a small fraction of carbon stocks in all land-use types. Most of the soil organic carbon and fine root carbon content was found in the upper 30-cm layer and decreased with soil depth. The aboveground carbon (ABGC): soil organic carbon (SOC): fine root carbon ratios (FRC), was 8:4:1, 4:5:1, and 3:37:1 for the forest, plantation and agricultural land, respectively. These results indicate that a relatively large proportion of the C loss is due to forest conversion to agricultural land.

TI  - Trees outside forest (TOFs) aids in mitigating global climatic change through carbon sequestration: Example from academic institutional landscapes
T2  - ACTA ECOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - TOF including urban and other plantations like road side, homestead gardens, residential areas or in various institutional or academic landscapes make positive contribution to living conditions of different towns and cities. The present work reports the amount of biomass and its contribution to carbon stock of different woody perrennials in the campus of Uttar Banga Krishi Viswavidyalaya, West Bengal, India. The study was carried out by enumerating the entire study area for volume estimation and further calculation was done through validated methodologies. A total of 1816 numbers of individuals with dbh >= 10 cm of 95 woody perennials species belonging to 79 genera and 38 families were enlisted. Out of 95 species, the contribution was dominated by 52 forestry tree species followed by road side plantation (21) and fruit crops (14). A total of 812.211 Mg ha- 1 of biomass was recorded from the woody tree species with 79.40% contribution from above ground biomass (AGB) and 20.60% (BGB) below ground biomass. In the AGB forestry tree species showed dominance in terms of contribution (322.95 Mg ha -1) followed by plantation crops (169.695 Mg ha -1), road side plantation (107.069 Mg ha -1) and least by fruit crops (45.190 Mg ha-1). The overall carbon stock found was 403.176 Mg Cha- 1 with highest contribution from forestry tree species (200.53 Mg Cha- 1) followed by plantation crops (106.720 Mg C ha -1) and least by fruit crops (28.470 Mg Cha- 1). The study recommends plantaion of more and more woody species across the academic landscapes especially with threatened category flora for conservation and carbon sequestration for mitigating global climate change. TOFs will have to play an important role for sustaining future generations due to shrinking of other forest landuse systems.

TI  - Growth, carbon sequestration, and management of native tree plantations in humid regions of Costa Rica
T2  - NEW FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Costa Rican government has provided incentives for reforestation programs since 1986 and initiated a Payment for Environmental Services program in 1996. These incentives yielded native species reforestation programs throughout the country. This research aims to provide information about growth, carbon sequestration, and management of seven native tree species (Vochysia guatemalensis, Vochysia ferruginea, Hyeronima alchorneoides, Calophyllum brasiliense, Terminalia amazonia, Virola koschnyi, and Dipteryx panamensis) growing in small and medium- sized plantations in the Caribbean and Northern lowlands of Costa Rica. A total of 179 plots were evaluated in 32 farms. Overall, I found that V. guatemalensis, V. ferruginea, H. alchorneoides, and T. amazonia were the species with the fastest diameter, total height, and volume growth; and T. amazonia and D. panamensis sequestered more carbon. Moreover, I found that the plantations that had been thinned before this assessment had the best growth. The results of the present research enhance the criteria elaborated in previous research findings to improve species choices for reforestation and silvicultural management in Costa Rica and in other regions with similar ecological features. Furthermore, they support the concept that tropical plantations can serve diverse economic, social, and ecological functions that may ultimately help reduce atmospheric CO2 accumulation.

TI  - Biomass and carbon storage of Eucalyptus and Acacia plantations in the Pearl River Delta, South China
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest plantations represent an important carbon sink. In the Pearl River Delta (PRD) in Southern China, fast-growing Eucalyptus and Acacia are favoured plantation species, but little is known regarding their efficiency with respect to biomass production, partitioning and dynamics with stand age, or the contribution made by the understory, litter and coarse woody debris (CWD) to the volume of biomass and fixed carbon. Here, a set of 21 plantations of various ages were monitored for the pattern of biomass accumulation and partitioning. A continuous biomass expansion factor (BEF) method was applied to a set of forest inventory data (FID) over the periods 1989-2003 to estimate biomass accumulation, carbon storage and its pattern of change over time. The accumulation of biomass increased with stand age, reaching, respectively, 207.45 and 189.35 t ha(-1) in mature Eucalyptus and Acacia plantations. The contribution of secondary biomass from the understory, litter layer and CWD accounted for, respectively, up to 10.2% and 20.3% of the total biomass in the two types of plantation, highlighting the significance of secondary biomass. At a similar growth stage, the ranking of the contribution to secondary biomass in the Eucalyptus plantations was litter > herbaceous plants > shrubs > CWD, while in the Acacia plantations, it was litter > CWD > shrubs > herbaceous plants. The Eucalyptus and Acacia plantations in the PRD accumulated some 2.66-7.84 Mt of biomass and sequestered 1.33-3.92 Mt of carbon. For both species, the bulk of the plantations (Eucalyptus 82.1%, Acacia 89.3%) were at the young to middle-aged stage. The Acacia plantations generated a higher biomass density than the Eucalyptus plantations. Forest management intensification and reforestation programmes, especially targeting Acacia or mixed Eucalyptus/Acacia forests, offer good potential for future carbon sequestration.

TI  - Proximity to rainforest enhances pollination and fruit set in orchards
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Tropical rainforests are potential reservoirs of insects that could enhance crop pollination, but only a few instances of the provision of such services by tropical rainforest insects have been reported. Our field study aimed to determine the relative importance of such insects to the pollination of macadamia Macadamia integrifolia and longan Dimocarpus longan crops on the Atherton Tableland, north Queensland, Australia.2. We quantified initial fruit set, a measure of pollination success, in treatments designed to assess the relative importance of the possible modes of pollination. The treatments were applied in orchards that varied in distance from rainforest, in order to compare the effects of the contrasting pools of available pollen vectors. We also recorded the insect species present and estimated the number of visits each made to flowers in crops near and far from rainforest.3. For both crops there was an interaction between pollination treatment and distance from rainforest. Maximum fruit set was only achieved when pollen vectors had access to flowers and orchards were close to rainforest. Exclusion of pollinators near rainforest reduced initial fruit set to a greater extent than exclusion of pollinators far from rainforest.4. We confirmed that pollen transfer in macadamia is by autogamous self-pollination and by pollen vectors, but our design did not distinguish among pollen vectors. The only abundant insects in macadamia orchards were honeybees Apis mellifera. There were more honeybee visits to macadamia flowers in orchards near rainforest than far from rainforest, but we detected no relationship between honeybee visits and initial macadamia fruit set in our sample of observations on a per raceme basis. More detailed studies are needed to identify the pollen vector responsible for enhanced pollination of macadamia near rainforest.5. We established for the first time that pollen transfer in longan is by a combination of autogamous self-pollination, wind and bees. Longan flowers were visited by stingless bees and honeybees but only stingless bees had a positive relationship with initial longan fruit set and higher visitation rates near rainforest than far from rainforest. This suggests that enhanced pollination in longan near rainforest resulted primarily from a more abundant supply of stingless bees from the rainforest.6. Synthesis and applications. By demonstrating that tropical rainforest can act as a reservoir of pollen vectors that benefit crops, our study highlights the existence of a largely unrecognized resource available to agriculture. At the same time our results make a significant contribution to the growing database of studies that underscore the importance of tropical rainforest conservation. Policy and management aimed at sustainable use of this resource would satisfy the goals both of agriculturalists, to improve crop yields, and conservationists, to conserve tropical rainforest.

TI  - Biomass carbon stocks of different land use management in the forest vegetative zone of Nigeria
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover change tends to play a more critical role in controlling CO2 emissions and annual storage. Despite the fact that the majority of the deforestation and forest degradation and consequent emissions have been occurring in tropical developing countries, little or no direct quantifications of the effects of land use change on the Carbon pools of these land use systems have been done. Taking into consideration four (4) land use systems in Ekiti State, South-western Nigeria, we quantified the magnitude of biomass and biomass carbon stocks in the following carbon pools: trees, non-woody vegetation, litter, coarse woody debris and roots. Total biomass carbon stocks of the different land use land cover types decreased in the order: Natural forests (NF) (155.61 Mg C ha(-1)) > Plantations (TP) (80.37 Mg C ha(-1)) > Woodlands (WD) (41.17 Mg C ha-1) > Croplands (CP) (35.33 Mg C ha(-1)). Approximately 50% of the total vegetation carbon stocks are contained in natural forests in the study. Estimation of C stocks in Necromass pools is important for carbon quantification most especially in the croplands and agroforestry ecosystems. Natural forest of all the land use types has the greatest biomass carbon storage potential with an estimated standing stock of 155.61 Mg C ha(-1) while cropland has the least carbon storage with a measured standing stock of 35.33 Mg C ha-1. We observed a reduction of 120.28 Mg C ha(-1) and 75.24 Mg C ha(-1) of the total biomass carbon stocks as a result of a change of natural forest to croplands and plantations, suggesting important C loses in the ecosystems. Improving our knowledge of terrestrial sources and sinks of CO2 and other greenhouse gases (GHGs), and their spatiotemporal variability is a key action to better understand and predict the global change and enhance human capacity to undertake mitigation and adaptation strategies.

TI  - Assessment of major pools and fluxes of carbon in Indian forests
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The major pools including phytomass, soil, litter, and fluxes of carbon (C) due to litterfall and landuse changes were estimated for Indian forests. Based on growing stock-volume approach at the state and district levels, the Indian forest phytomass was estimated in the range of 3.8-4.3 PgC. The total soil organic pool in the top 1m depth was estimated as 6.8 PgC, using estimated soil organic carbon densities and Remote Sensing (RS) based area by forest types. Based on 122 published Indian studies and RS-based forest area, the total litterfall carbon flux was estimated as 208.8 MgC ha(-1) yr(-1). The cumulative net carbon flux (1880-1996) from Indian forests (1880-1996) due to landuse changes (deforestation, afforestation and phytomass degradation) was estimated as 5.4 PgC, using a simple book-keeping approach. The mean annual net C flux due to landuse changes during 1985 1996 was estimated as 9.0 TgC yr(-1). For the recent period, the Indian forests are nationally a small source with some regions acting as small sinks of carbon as well. The improved quantification of pools and fluxes related to forest carbon cycle is important for understanding the contribution of Indian forests to net carbon emissions as well as their potential for carbon sequestration in the context of the Kyoto protocol.

TI  - A landscape approach for cost-effective large-scale forest restoration
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Achieving global targets for forest restoration will require cost-effective strategies to return agricultural land to forest, while minimizing implementation costs and negative outcomes for agricultural production.2. We present a landscape approach for optimizing the cost-effectiveness of large-scale forest restoration. Across three different landscapes within Brazil's Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot, we modelled landscape scenarios based on spatially explicit data on the probability of natural regeneration, restoration costs, land opportunity costs, and forest restoration outcomes for increasing carbon stocking and landscape connectivity. We compare benefits of our cost-reduction approach to the legally mandated riparian restoration and randomly distributed approaches.3. Compared with riparian prioritization and considering both implementation and opportunity costs, our cost-reduction scenario produced the greatest savings (20.9%) in mechanized agricultural landscapes.4. When only considering implementation costs, our cost-reduction scenario led to the highest savings (38.4%) in the landscape with highest forest cover where natural regeneration potential is highest and enables cost-effective carbon stocking and connectivity.5. Synthesis and applications. We present a guide for forest restoration planning that maximizes specific outcomes with minimal costs and reduction of agricultural production. Furthermore, we show how policies could encourage prioritization of low-cost restoration via natural regeneration, increasing cost-effectiveness. While our study focuses on Brazil's Atlantic Forest, the approach can be parameterized for other regions.

TI  - Loss of labile organic carbon from subsoil due to land-use changes in subtropical China
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Topsoil carbon (C) stocks are known to decrease as a consequence of the conversion of natural ecosystems to plantations or croplands; however, the effect of land use change on subsoil C remains unknown. Here, we hypothesized that the effect of land use change on labile subsoil organic C may be even stronger than for topsoil due to upward concentration of plantations and crops root systems. We evaluated soil labile organic C fractions, including particulate organic carbon (POC) and its components [coarse POC and fine POC], light fraction organic carbon (LFOC), readily oxidizable organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and microbial biomass down to 100 cm soil depth from four typical land use systems in subtropical China. Decrease in fine root biomass was more pronounced below 20 cm than in the overlying topsoil (70% vs. 56% for plantation and 62% vs. 37% for orchard. respectively) driving a reduction in subsoil labile organic C stocks. Land use changes from natural forest to Chinese fir plantation, Chinese chestnut orchard, or sloping tillage reduced soil organic C stocks and that of its labile fractions both in top and subsoil (20-100 cm). POC reduction was mainly driven by a decrease in fine POC in topsoil, while DOC was mainly reduced in subsoil. Fine POC, LFOC and microbial biomass can be useful early indicators of changes in topsoil organic C. In contrast, LFOC and DOC are useful indicators for subsoil. Reduced proportions of fine POC, LFOC, DOC and microbial biomass to soil organic C reflected the decline in soil organic C quality caused by land use changes. We conclude that land use changes decrease C sequestration both in topsoil and subsoil, which is initially indicated by the labile soil organic C fractions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A global review of rubber plantations: Impacts on ecosystem functions, mitigations, future directions, and policies for sustainable cultivation
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The growing global need for latex is driving rubber plantation (RP) expansion since the last century, with >2 Mha of cultivation area being established in the last decade. Southeast Asia is the hotspot for rubber cultivation at other land-use costs. Although rubber cultivation has improved the economic status of farmers, it has altered the habitat's ecology and ecosystem functions (EF). However, studies on the impacts of RP on EF are limited, and a clear overview is not available. To bridge this gap, we conducted an inclusive review of the EF of RP, includ-ing soil carbon storage, aboveground biomass (AGB) and belowground biomass (BGB), litter production and de-composition, respiration, and biodiversity (plants, animals, soil fauna, and microbes). We compared the EF in RP (monoculture) with those in forests because the conversion of forests to RP is prevalent in the tropics and be-cause most RP studies used forests as reference ecosystems. We found RP generally have lower EF than forests. The impacts of RP on some EF are more severe (e.g., AGB, BGB, and plant diversity), causing decreases of >55%, and the effects are consistently negative irrespective of plantation age. However, including agroforestry or polyculture, integrated pest management, cover cropping, mulching, and composting can improve the EF in RP to some extent. We highlighted research gaps, particularly substantial research gaps concerning the influence of plant diversity treatments (i.e., agroforestry) performed in RP on EF. Additionally, more empirical data on the significance of spatial and temporal levels are required, such as how the impact on EF could vary with climate and RP age, as we showed some examples where EF differs spatially and temporally. More importantly, further research on plantation management to offset EF losses is needed. Finally, we emphasized knowledge gaps and suggested future directions and policies for improving EF in RP.

TI  - Interactive effects of land use history and natural disturbance on seedling dynamics in a subtropical forest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Human-impacted forests are increasing in extent due to widespread regrowth of secondary forests on abandoned lands. The degree and speed of recovery from human disturbance in these forests will determine their value in terms of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem function. In areas subject to periodic, severe natural disturbances, such as hurricanes, it has been hypothesized that human and natural disturbance may interact to either erase or preserve land use legacies. To increase understanding of how interactions between human and natural disturbance influence forest regeneration and recovery, we monitored seedlings in a human-and hurricane-impacted forest in northeastern Puerto Rico over a; 10-yr period and compared seedling composition and dynamics in areas that had experienced high-and low-intensity human disturbance during the first half of the 20th century. We found that land use history significantly affected the composition and diversity of the seedling layer and altered patterns of canopy openness and seedling dynamics following hurricane disturbance. The area that had been subject to high-intensity land use supported a higher density, but lower diversity, of species. In both land use history categories, the seedling layer was dominated by the same two species, Prestoea acuminata var. montana and Guarea guidonia. However, seedlings of secondary-successional species tended to be more abundant in the high-intensity land use area, while late-successional species were more abundant in the low-intensity area, consistent with patterns of adult tree distributions. Seedlings of secondary-forest species showed greater increases in growth and survival following hurricane disturbance compared to late-successional species, providing support for the hypothesis that hurricanes help preserve the signature of land use history. However, the increased performance of secondary-forest species occurred predominantly in the low-intensity land use area, suggesting that hurricanes act to homogenize differences in species composition between areas with differing land use histories by increasing secondary-forest species regeneration in areas that experienced little direct human disturbance. Our results suggest that, through effects on seedling dynamics, hurricanes may extend the signature of land use history beyond the average recovery time of forests not subject to intense natural disturbance events.

TI  - Does tree species composition affect soil CO2 emission and soil organic carbon storage in plantations?
T2  - TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mixed tree plantations are potential silvicultural systems to increase soil carbon storage through altering litter and root inputs and soil physiochemical properties.Afforestation and reforestation are major strategies for global climate change mitigation. Different tree species composition can induce diverse changes in soil CO2 emission and soil carbon sequestration in tree plantation. This study employed three plantations of monoculture and mixed Pinus yunnanensis and Eucalyptus globulus to estimate the effect of tree species composition on soil CO2 emission and soil organic carbon storage in subtropical China. We found that tree species composition had a significant effect on the soil CO2 emission and soil organic carbon storage. Soil CO2 emission was lower in the mixed plantation than in the P. yunnanensis plantation, whereas it was higher than in the E. globulus plantation. Differences in soil CO2 emission among the three plantations were determined by leaf litterfall mass, fine root biomass, soil available nitrogen, pH, soil bulk density, and soil C:N ratio. Soil organic carbon storage was 34.5 and 23.2 % higher in the mixed plantation than in the P. yunnanensis and E. globulus plantations, respectively. Higher soil organic carbon stock in the mixed plantation was attributed to lower C/N ratio of leaf litter and soil, greater fine root biomass and soil organic carbon content, and lower soil CO2 emission. We conclude that mixed tree plantation can enhance soil carbon sequestration, but can decrease or increase soil CO2 emission through altering litter and root inputs and soil physiochemical properties.

TI  - Allometric equations for estimating tree biomass in restored mixed-species Atlantic Forest stands
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoration of Atlantic Forests is receiving increasing attention because of its role in both biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration for global climate change mitigation. This study was carried out in an Atlantic Forest restoration project in the south-central region of Sao Paulo State - Brazil to develop allometric equations to estimate tree biomass of indigenous tree species in mixed plantations. Above and below-ground biomass (AGB and BGB, respectively), stem diameter (DBH: diameter at 1.3 m height), tree height (H: total height) and specific wood density (WD) were measured for 60 trees of 19 species. Different biomass equations (linear and nonlinear-transformed) were adjusted to estimate AGB and BGB as a function of DBH, H and WD. For estimating AGB and BGB, the linear biomass equation models were the least accurate. The transformed nonlinear biomass equation that used log DBH2, log H and log WD as predictor variables were the most accurate for AGB and the transformed nonlinear biomass equations that used log DBH2*WD as predictor variables were the most accurate for BGB. It is concluded that these adjusted equations can be used to estimate the AGB and BGB in areas of the studied project. The adjusted equations can be recommended for use elsewhere in the region for forest stands of similar age, tree size ranges, species composition and site characteristics.

TI  - Do the impact of organic residues on soil quality extend beyond the deposition area under oil palm?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recycling empty fruit bunches (EFBs) in mature oil palm stands usually consists in distributing them over a limited area representing 3%-10% of the plot. The impact of this practice on soil quality, including soil biodiversity, is not well known at the plot scale. We analysed soil physical, chemical, and biological variables. Five zones were defined around the palm tree to assess spatial heterogeneity due to plant cover and application of organic and inorganic fertilisers. Each zone was analysed separately. Our study revealed marked variations in mineral contents around the palm tree, ranging from deficiency to excess or nutrient imbalance in adjacent zones, particularly in available P and K, Mg and pH. Similar variations in macrofauna were observed both in the litter and the soil. Our results demonstrate that the changes caused by plant cover and applications of fertiliser are mainly limited in space, but that earthworm communities move as a function of variations in nutrient availability or stress associated with EFB deposition over time. The Amacher index, adapted to the soil nutrient status for oil palm, indicated that average mineral fertility at the plot scale was rather good. The average density of soil macrofauna and nematofauna was low compared to other tropical ecosystems, but reference data from Indonesia are lacking. Application of EFBs on the harvest path mainly improved the homogeneity of soil quality within the elementary plot around the palm. However these data did not show that recycling EFB stimulates soil fauna communities or carbon sequestration at the plot scale. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sustainable intensification of dairy production can reduce forest disturbance in Kenyan montane forests
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing demand for food and the shortage of arable land call for sustainable intensification of farming, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa where food insecurity is still a major concern. Kenya needs to intensify its dairy production to meet the increasing demand for milk. At the same time, the country has set national climate mitigation targets and has to implement land use practices that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from both agriculture and forests. This study analysed for the first time the drivers of forest disturbance and their relationship with dairy intensification across the largest montane forest of Kenya. To achieve this, a forest disturbance detection approach was applied by using Landsat time series and empirical data from forest disturbance surveys. Farm indicators and farm types derived from a household survey were used to test the effects of dairy intensification on forest disturbance for different farm neighbourhood sizes (r = 2-5 km). About 18% of the forest area was disturbed over the period 2010-2016. Livestock grazing and firewood extraction were the dominant drivers of forest disturbance at 75% of the forest disturbance spots sampled. Higher on-farm cattle stocking rates and firewood collection were associated with 1-10% increased risk of forest disturbance across farm neighbourhood sizes. In contrast, higher milk yields, increased supplementation with concentrated feeds and more farm area allocated to fodder production were associated with 1-7 % reduced risk of forest disturbance across farm neighbourhood sizes. More intensified farms had a significantly lower impact on forest disturbance than small and resource-poor farms, and large and inefficient farms. Our results show that intensification of smallholder dairy farming leads to both farm efficiency gains and reduced forest disturbance. These results can inform agriculture and forest mitigation policies which target options to reduce GHG emission intensities and the risk of carbon leakage.

AB  - To estimate carbon emissions from selective logging in Central Africa, we employed the reduced-impact logging for carbon emissions reductions (RIL-C) protocol to quantify baseline carbon emissions from legal timber harvests by source (i.e., hauling, skidding, and felling). We modeled the relationships between emissions and biophysical conditions, logging practices, and forest policies and then used these models to estimate potential emission reductions from full implementation of RIL-C practices. We applied the method in 8 forest management enterprises (FMEs; i.e., concessions) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), 9 in Gabon, and 6 in the Republic of Congo (RoC). Committed logging emissions expressed per cubic meter of timber harvested (to control for differences in logging intensities) ranged from 0.63 Mg C m(-3) in a FME in RoC to 4.8 Mg C m(-3) in a FME in Gabon, with an overall average of 2.1 Mg C m(-3). Logging emissions were dominated by damage caused by road and log landing construction (i.e., hauling; 50%) and felling (43%; includes carbon in extracted logs). Total emissions represented only about 9% of unlogged forest biomass carbon stocks. Average emissions were highest in Gabon (2.65 Mg C m(-3)) followed by DRC (1.84 Mg C m(-3)) and RoC (1.54 Mg C m(-3)). Emissions from concessions certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC, N = 6) and those that were not certified (N = 17) did not differ. Nearly half (51%) of logging emissions could be avoided without reducing timber yields if all best examples of RIL-C logging practices observed were applied in the same FME. At the country level, if all FMEs were to utilize these practices, emissions reductions would be 34% in RoC, 45% in DRC, and 62% in Gabon. When combined with country-level logging statistics, emissions from selective logging as currently practiced in the six countries of the Congo Basin are equivalent to 40% of the region's total emissions from deforestation.

TI  - Changes in soil carbon stocks across the Forest-Agroforest-Agriculture/Pasture continuum in various agroecological regions: A meta-analysis
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The contribution of agroforestry systems (AFS) to enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in soil layers due to the presence of deep tree roots are of interest in the context of promoting carbon sinks and greenhouse gas mitigation. To quantify the relative soil C contribution from trees in agroforestry systems (AFS), this study assessed the reported differences in SOC stocks under agroforestry systems in comparison with other land-use systems (Agriculture, Forestry, Pasture, or Uncultivated Land) in various soil-depth classes in four agroecological regions (arid and semiarid, ASA; lowland humid tropics, LHT; Mediterranean, MED; and temperate, TEM) around the world. Using mixed-effect models and a meta-analytical approach, we synthesized data from 78 peer-reviewed studies that generated 858 data points (sites) on SOC stock under various AFS practiced globally. Comparing Agroforest vs. Agriculture or Agroforest vs. Pasture, SOC stocks under AFS were higher by + 27% in the ASA region, + 26% in LHT, and + 5.8% in TEM, but -5.3% in the TEM in the 0-100 cm soil depth. The Agroforest aged between 10-20 years had higher SOC stock than newly established, as well as < 10-year-old systems across all soil-depth classes and agroecological regions. Overall, Agroforest vs. Agriculture land management practices resulted in positive SOC stock changes within AFS up to 100 cm soil depth, whereas SOC stock under AFS was lower than under Forest. The results suggest that a general pattern of Forest - Agroforest - Agriculture - Pasture continuum could be expected in SOC stock decline during land-use changes. Improvement of SOC stocks under AFS varied across agroecological regions, the highest being under arid and semiarid region, closely followed by the low humid tropics. The important outcome of this meta-analysis is worthy of emphasizing of the role of AFS in climate change adaptation and greenhouse gas mitigation strategies by promoting carbon sinks.

TI  - Soil carbon dynamics under young tropical secondary forests on former pastures-A case study from Panama
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary forests are gaining increased importance in tropical landscapes and have recently been reported to act as potential belowground carbon sinks. While economic interest in the management of secondary forests to mitigate carbon emissions is rising, the dynamics of soil carbon stocks under these ecosystems remain poorly understood. Recent studies report conflicting results concerning soil carbon trends as well as multiple confounding factors (e.g. soil type, topography and land-use history) affecting these trends. In this study, organic carbon stocks were measured in the mineral soil up to 20 cm depth of at 24 active pastures, 5-8-year-old, and 12-15-year-old secondary forest sites on former pastures. Additionally, we estimated carbon stocks under a 100-year-old secondary forest and compared them to those of nearby mature forests. Abiotic conditions in the study area were homogenous, enabling us to isolate the effect of land-use change on soil organic carbon stocks. Contrary to our expectations, soil carbon stocks in the top 10 cm did not change with young secondary forest development. Pasture soils stored 24.8 +/- 2.9 Mg ha(-1) carbon (mean +/- standard error) in the top 10 cm, and no accumulation of soil carbon was apparent during the first 15 years of secondary succession. Soil carbon stocks under 100-year-old secondary forests, averaging 43.0 +/- 7.9 Mg ha(-1) (mean +/- standard error), were clearly higher than those recorded at younger sites and approached levels of soil carbon stocks under mature forests. These data indicate that soil carbon stocks in this region of Panama are not affected by the land-use transition from pasture to young secondary regrowth. However, an increase of soil carbon storage might be possible over a longer period of time. Our results support trends observed in other tropical areas and highlight the importance of environmental conditions such as soil properties rather than land-use transitions on soil carbon dynamics. While our understanding of organic carbon dynamics in tropical soils remains limited, these results underscore the challenges of undertaking short-term reforestation projects with the expectation of increasing soil carbon sequestration. 2010 Elsevier BM.

TI  - Carbon neutral? No change in mineral soil carbon stock under oil palm plantations derived from forest or non-forest in Indonesia
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainability criteria for palm oil production guide new planting toward non-forest land cover on mineral soil, avoiding carbon debts caused by forest and peat conversion. Effects on soil carbon stock (soil C-stock) of land use change trajectories from forest and non-forest to oil palm on mineral soils include initial decline and subsequent recovery, however modeling efforts and life-cycle accounting are constrained by lack of comprehensive data sets; only few case studies underpin current debate. We analyzed soil C-stock (Mg ha(-1)), soil bulk density (BD, g cm(-3)) and soil organic carbon concentration (C-org, %) from 155 plots in 20 oil palm plantations across the major production areas of Indonesia, identifying trends during a production cycle on 6 plantations with sufficient spread in plot age. Plots were sampled in four management zones: weeded circle (WC), interrow (IR), frond stacks (FS), and harvest paths (HP); three depth intervals 0-5, 5-15 and 15-30 cm were sampled in each zone. Compared to the initial condition, increases in Core (16.2%) and reduction in BD (8.9%) in the FS zone, was compensated by decrease in C-org (21.4%) and increase in BD (6.6%) in the HP zone, with intermediate results elsewhere. For a weighted average of the four management zones and after correction for equal mineral soil basis, the net temporal trend in soil C-stock in the top 30 cm of soil across all data was not significantly different from zero in both forest- and non-forest-derived oil palm plantations. Individual plantations experienced net decline, net increase or U-shaped trajectories. The 2% difference in mean soil C-stock in forest and non-forest derived oil palm plantations was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Unless soil management changes strongly from current practice, it is appropriate for C footprint calculations to assume soil C-stock neutrality on mineral soils used for oil palm cultivation.

TI  - Revegetation modifies patterns of temporal soil respiration responses to extreme-drying-and-rewetting in a semiarid ecosystem
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and aims Changes in climate and land-use are altering soil respiration patterns and thus affecting C sequestration rates globally. This study aims to understand the effect of revegetation induced land-use change on the response of soil respiration to precipitation pulses during an extreme-drying-and-rewetting period.Methods Soil respiration (SR) in cropland, grassland, shrubland, and orchard were intensively monitored along with environmental variables during an extreme drought period with precipitation pulse on China's Loess Plateau.Results SR was strongly correlated to soil water content for all land-uses. However, the relationship was highly dependent on land-use types: SR was only strongly suppressed in cropland and orchard when moisture content exceeded 10.8 and 13.7%, respectively, whereas no clear suppression was observed under other land-uses. As a result, the C loss in grassland and shrubland was 49.1-78.9% higher than in cropland following significant precipitation events. In addition, SR was negatively and weakly correlated with soil temperature, indicating the change in the dominant control on SR due to extreme drought.Conclusions Land-use change alters the response of soil respiration to soil moisture during extreme-drying-and-rewetting periods in this revegetated ecosystem. Its effect on respiration pulses will amplify as extreme climate events increase in the future, which may potentially alter the existing C balance.

TI  - Effects of buttressed roots on soil physical and chemical properties of soil in lowland rainforests of Diaoluoshan, Hainan, China br
T2  - Chinese Journal of Applied and Environmental Biology
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical rain forests are one of the most complex forest ecosystems and have long been the focus of ecological research. The aim of the study was to investigate the differences in the physico-chemical properties of soil in areas with buttress and non-buttress roots across different seasons and soil layers. We selected the typical lowland rainforests of the Diaoluoshan Nature Reserve in Hainan Province as the sample site. We collected soil samples from different soil layers of buttress and non-buttress root areas in dry and wet seasons and analyzed the differences in the physico-chemical properties of the soil, to investigate the ecological function of buttresses. The results showed the mechanical composition of the soil in buttress and non-buttress root areas in different soil layers in dry and wet seasons to be of the order: silt > sand > clay. The variation coefficient of the clay fraction in the wet season was significantly higher than that in the dry season. Soil temperature was not significantly different between buttress and non-buttress root areas across different seasons and soil layers. However, the soil moisture content was significantly higher in the buttress root areas, especial in the dry season (P < 0.05). The soil pH of buttress root areas was significantly higher than that in the non-buttress root areas in the dry season, while the buttress roots exerted no effect on the pH of the soil in the wet season. Buttress roots had a significant effect on other soil chemical indices across different seasons and soil layers. In the dry season, the organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, hydrolyzed nitrogen, and available phosphorus contents in the soil from buttress root areas were significantly higher than those of the soil from non-buttress root areas. In the wet season, all the indices were higher in the buttress root areas than in the non-buttress root areas. The organic carbon, total nitrogen, and available phosphorus contents increased significantly by 21.04%-86.30%, 23.60%-99.74%, and 36.00%-103.45%, respectively. Buttress roots can retain not only soil water but also soil nutrients. Therefore, buttress roots are beneficial in improving the habitat heterogeneity of tropical rainforest ecosystems and forming nutrient enrichment areas and high soil carbon sequestration areas in the upper buttress roots

TI  - Land-use change impact on time-averaged carbon balances: Rubber expansion and reforestation in a biosphere reserve, South-West China
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of rubber plantations (Hevea brasiliensis mall. Arg) is a major driving force for deforestation and forest degradation in mountainous South-East Asia. In China, the unclear distinction between natural forest and commercial plantations has permitted the expansion of rubber into protected forest areas of nature reserves. However, the impact of such land-use changes on landscape carbon balances within nature reserves has rarely been investigated. We selected the Naban River Watershed National Nature Reserve (NRWNNR) in Xishuangbanna, China as a case study area and evaluated carbon stocks using the Rapid Carbon Stock Appraisal (RaCSA) method based on tree, plot, land use and landscape assessments, integrating field sampling with remote sensing and GIS technology. Six dominant land use systems were surveyed: lowland forest (<800 m above sea level), highland forest (>800 m a.s.l.), lowland rubber, highland rubber, bush and grassland and agricultural crops. Land use type-specific time-averaged carbon stocks (C-ta) were calculated based on total above ground biomass (AGB). Soil organic carbon (surface 30 cm) and below ground biomass were measured, but not included in C-ta calculations due to large uncertainties unrelated to land use change. The C-ta of lowland and highland rubber plantations were 58 Mg C ha(-1) and 28 Mg C ha(-1) respectively, showing larger carbon sequestration potential than nonforest land use types (agricultural crops, bush and grassland) but much lower than C-ta of natural forest (156-185 Mg C ha(-1)). Sensitivity analysis of C-ta variability showed that forest C stocks have the largest influence on landscape carbon balance. Time series analysis of land-use and land-cover maps (1989, 2007, 2012) demonstrated that during 23 years, the whole landscape of the nature reserve (26,574 ha) gained 0.644 Tg C. Despite rubber expansion, biosphere zoning strategy (i.e. experimental, buffer, core zones), and reforestation activities conducted in NRWNNR were able to enhance the carbon stocks.

TI  - Assessing land-use and carbon stock in slash-and-burn ecosystems in tropical mountain of Laos based on time-series satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In the tropical mountains of Southeast Asia, slash-and-burn (S/B) agriculture is a widely practiced and important food production system. The ecosystem carbon stock in this land-use is linked not only to the carbon exchange with the atmosphere but also with food and resource security. The objective of this study was to provide quantitative information on the land-use and ecosystem carbon stock in the region as well as to infer the impacts of alternative land-use and ecosystem management scenarios on the carbon sequestration potential at a regional scale. The study area was selected in a typical slash-and-burn region in the northern part of Laos. The chrono-sequential changes of land-use such as the relative areas of community age and cropping (C) + fallow (F) patterns were derived from the analysis of time-series satellite images. The chrono-sequential analysis showed that a consistent increase of S/B area during the past three decades and a rapid increase after 1990. Approximately 37% of the whole area was with the community age of 1-5 years, whereas 10% for 6-10 years in 2004. The ecosystem carbon stock at a regional scale was estimated by synthesizing the land-use patterns and semi-empirical carbon stock model derived from in situ measurements where the community age was used as a clue to the linkage. The ecosystem carbon stock in the region was strongly affected by the land-use patterns; the temporal average of carbon stock in 1C + 10F cycles, for example, was greater by 33 MgC ha(-1) compared to that in 1C + 2F land-use pattern. The amount of carbon lost from the regional ecosystems during 1990-2004 periods was estimated to be 42 MgC ha(-1). The study approach proved to be useful especially in such regions with low data-availability and accessibility. This study revealed the dynamic change of land-use and ecosystem carbon stock in the tropical mountain of Laos as affected by land-use. Results suggest the significant potential of carbon sequestration through changing land-use and ecosystem management scenarios. These quantitative estimates would be useful to better understand and manage the land-use and ecosystem carbon stock towards higher sustainability and food security in similar ecosystems.

TI  - Tree species richness increases ecosystem carbon storage in subtropical forests
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest ecosystems are an integral component of the global carbon cycle as they take up and release large amounts of C over short time periods (C flux) or accumulate it over longer time periods (C stock). However, there remains uncertainty about whether and in which direction C fluxes and in particular C stocks may differ between forests of high versus low species richness. Based on a comprehensive dataset derived from field-based measurements, we tested the effect of species richness (3-20 tree species) and stand age (22-116 years) on six compartments of above-and below-ground C stocks and four components of C fluxes in subtropical forests in southeast China. Across forest stands, total C stock was 149 +/- 12 Mg ha(-1) with richness explaining 28.5% and age explaining 29.4% of variation in this measure. Species-rich stands had higher C stocks and fluxes than stands with low richness; and, in addition, old stands had higher C stocks than young ones. Overall, for each additional tree species, the total C stock increased by 6.4%. Our results provide comprehensive evidence for diversity-mediated above-and below-ground C sequestration in species-rich subtropical forests in southeast China. Therefore, afforestation policies in this region and elsewhere should consider a change from the current focus on monocultures to multi-species plantations to increase C fixation and thus slow increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and global warming.

Our inter-cultural research initiative tested the hypothesis that Indigenous custody of the land is compatible with the maintenance of intact forests. Here we combined traditional knowledge, phytolith analysis, remote sensing, and tree inventories to study old-growth forests in Panama's Darien. Phytoliths served to elucidate historical vegetation, remote sensing revealed the current and past Indigenous footprints while tree stature and identity characterised the forest. Until now there has been very little to no human impact within these forests and current Indigenous footprint is both small and stable. Large trees accounted for 13% of trees in the plots that we established. For over half of the species, the measured tree height was taller than previously published maximum heights, leading us to conclude that these forests are a truly exceptional ecological refugium. Noting that the local communities are not rewarded for their custody of these exceptional forests we call to revisit the Good Practice Guidance for Land Use Land Use Change and Forestry to include intact forest land. In the context of sub-optimal carbon finance options, we also propose matching as a methodology that could prove additionality of forest conservation initiatives in climate mitigation portfolios.

TI  - Litterfall-Associated Carbon Deposition and Vertical Profiles of Soil Organic Carbon in Different Land-Use Systems
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Litterfall is one of the major inputs for soil nutrients. Understanding the connection of litterfall and soil organic carbon (SOC) as the part of ecological processes is a key step towards carbon sequestration as a climate change mitigation strategy. Yet, it remains inadequate to support by empirical pieces of evidence particularly in tropical ecosystems. In this study, litter traps were used to monitor the monthly organic carbon deposition over a year through litterfall, and soil samples were collected vertically up to 30 cm depth to define the SOC depth distribution in three different land use types located at Wondo Genet district, southern Ethiopia. The results were interpreted by deploying both the carbon stratification ratio (CSR) and carbon flow balance ratio (CFBR) as ecological indicators. The results revealed that both the annual litterfall amount and associated organic carbon input in plantation forest (958.4 +/- 112 g center dot m-2 center dot yr-1; 391.4 +/- 112 g center dot C center dot m-2 center dot yr-1) were higher than those in the homegarden (183.5.4 +/- 26 g center dot m-2 center dot yr-1; 67.4 +/- 10 g center dot C center dot m-2 center dot yr-1), conceivably due to few litter contributors (trees) present in the homegarden. The CSR of the homegarden (1.3 +/- 0.01) was found between the ratio obtained for crop (1.2 +/- 0.01) and plantation forest (1.4 +/- 0.01), indicating that it is definitely a combination of pure plantation forest and crop system. The CFBR was higher in plantation forest (3.4 yr-1) than in soil of homegarden (0.77 yr-1), implying the net accumulation of soil carbon over time in the latter system. Hence, homegardens could be considered as a system of climate-smart practice with multiple-biogeochemistry pathways, which simultaneously address the social-absolute needs. Given the current tendency of transforming homegarden agroforestry to monoculture types owing to economical drivers, such indicators can dictate of making rational decisions related to land use planning and soil fertility management.

TI  - Role of root inputs from a dinitrogen-fixing tree in soil carbon and nitrogen sequestration in a tropical agroforestry system
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry is often mentioned as a suitable technology for land rehabilitation in the tropics and for mitigation of climate change because this land-use favours nutrient recycling and C sequestration. The aim of this work was to estimate soil C sequestration in a 12-year-old tropical silvopastoral system composed of a legume tree (Gliricidia sepium) and a C4 fodder grass (Dichanthium aristatum), and to link it with tree root biomass and N status in the soil. The site was under cut-and-carry management, i.e. tree pruning residues and cut grass were removed from the field and fed to stabled animals elsewhere. Thus, main sources for tree C and N inputs were root activity and turnover. Organic C derived from the trees and tree root biomass were determined based on natural C-13 abundance. For the 0-0.2 m soil layer, the biomass of tree roots <= 2 mm diameter was 2.4 Mg/ha when the trees were pruned every 6 months (SS6), and 0.6 Mg/ha when pruned every 2 months (SS2). Both C (R-2 = 0.39, P < 0.05) and N (R-2 = 0.82, P < 0.05) sequestration were correlated with tree root biomass. The trees and grass contributed 18 and 8 Mg C/ha to soil, respectively, over the 12-year experiment in SS6. The net increase of 2.5 Mg N/ha in soil, originating from the trees, contributed to the net soil C sequestration. In SS2, trees contributed 16 Mg C/ha to soil over 12 years, but grass-derived C was reduced by 2 Mg C/ha because of the small amount of grass litter. The increase of 1.7 Mg N/ha in soil, derived from the trees, was not large enough to avoid C loss in this plot. Differences in soil C and N sequestration between plots were due to differences in system management, which affected the amount and the C/N ratio of inputs and outputs.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration Benefits of the Makiling Forest Reserve, Philippines
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper discusses carbon sequestration in Makiling Forest Reserve (MFR) and in the Philippines in general in relation to mitigating climate change. First, it estimates the values of carbon sequestration benefits for MFR and the Philippines. Then it reviews the policies and practices in the country pertaining to carbon sequestration. Then it determines the feasibility of different climate abatement projects, including reforestation, tree planting and agroforestry activities. The current carbon content in the biomass of the plant covers in MFR is estimated to be 109 tons per hectare. Accordingly, the total carbon content for the whole of MFR is 167,277 tons. The equivalent in terms of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere is 669,108 tons, amounting to a total sequestration value of P1.5 billion or US$ 3.8 million. The capitalized value derived from MFR carbon sequestration is P15.06 billion or US$1.13 billion. Conservation of existing forests reduces oxidized carbon releases into the atmosphere. Agroforestry systems also have the potential to replace destructive shifting agricultural practices. Other strategies for increasing the carbon sequestration capacity of forests is reforestation, and increasing the amount of carbon being stored in forest ecosystems. The latter involves planting of fast-growing species and high-timber-yielding varieties. The sustainable management of the forests in MFR would contribute significant greenhouse benefits by enhancing long-term storage of carbon in the ecosystem.

TI  - Carbon stocks of above- and belowground tree biomass in Kibate Forest around Wonchi Crater Lake, Central Highland of Ethiopia
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests play an important role in the global carbon (C) balance, but their biomass has decreased globally mainly because of deforestation and a reduction in forest cover. However, little is known about the C stock of tree biomass related to environmental factors in the remnant forest patches. Thus, the present study aimed at assessing the status of C stocks of tree biomass using an allometric equation in Kibate Forest (Ethiopia). Sixty-six plots (30x30 m) were laid out at 100 m interval distance along the altitudinal gradients in five transects. The results revealed that the highest C stocks (67.4%) per species were contributed by Juniperus procera, Ilex mitis var. mitis, Nuxia congesta, and Olea europaea subsp. cuspidata. The mean total tree biomass was 91.9 +/- 10.01 Mg ha(-1). The mean total C stock was 45.9 +/- 5.17 Mg ha(-1), out of which 38.3 +/- 4.31 and 7.7 +/- 0.91 Mg ha(-1) were stored in above- and belowground C pools, respectively. Anthropogenic factors were negatively associated with the C-stock distribution in the study area. Thus, the status of the C stock of tree biomass related to anthropogenic factors indicates that sustainable forest management practice is needed in the study area to conserve biodiversity and mitigate climate change.

TI  - Aboveground biomass in secondary montane forests in Peru: Slow carbon recovery in agroforestry legacies
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Andean tropical montane forests (TMF) are hotspots of biodiversity that provide fundamental hydrological services as well as carbon sequestration and storage. Agroforestry systems occupy large areas in the Andes but climatic pressures, market volatility and diseases may result inagroforest abandonment, promoting secondary succession. Secondary forests are well-adapted and efficient carbon sinks whose conservation is vital to mitigate and adapt to climate change and to support biodiversity. Little is known, however, about how secondary TMF recover their aboveground biomass (AGB) and composition after abandonment. We established a 1.5 ha plot at 1780 masl on a 30-year old abandoned agroforest and compared it against two control forest plots at similar elevations. Agroforestry legacies influenced AGB leading to far lower stocks (42.3 +/- 5.4-59.6 +/- 7.9 Mg ha(-1) using allometric equations) than those expected after 30 years (106 +/- 33 Mg ha(-1)) based on IPCC standard growth rates for secondary montane forests. This suggests a regional overestimation of mitigation potentials when using IPCC standards. Satellite-derived AGB largely overestimated our plot values (179 +/- 27.3 Mg ha(-1)). Secondary growth rates (1.41-2.0 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for DBH >= 10 cm) indicate recovery times of ca. 69 to 97 years to reach average control AGB values (137 +/- 12.3 Mg ha(-1)). This is 26 years above the average residence time of montane forests at our elevation (71 +/- 1.91 years) suggesting a non-recovery or far slower recovery to control AGB values. Three variables appear to define this outcome compared to the control plots: lower DBH (15.8 +/- 5.9 cm vs 19.8 +/- 11.0 cm), lower basal area (12.67 +/- 0.7 vs 28.03 +/- 1.5 m(2) ha(-1)) and higher abundance of lighter-wood tree genera (0.46 +/- 0.10 vs 0.57 +/- 0.11 gr cm(3)) such as Inga, a common shade-tree in Andean agroforests. With 3.2 million hectares committed to restoration, Peru needs to target currently neglected TMF recovery schemes to support biodiversity, water and carbon storage and fulfill its international commitments.

TI  - Modelling the impact of climate change on Tanzanian forests
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Climate change is pressing extra strain on the already degraded forest ecosystem in Tanzania. However, it is mostly unknown how climate change will affect the distribution of forests in the future. We aimed to model the impacts of climate change on natural forests to help inform national-level conservation and mitigation strategies. Location Tanzania. Methods We conducted maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modelling to simulate forest habitat suitability using the Tanzanian national forest inventory survey (1,307 occurrences) and environmental data. Changes in forest habitats were simulated under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) emission scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 for 2055 and 2085. Results The results indicate that climate change will threaten forest communities, especially fragmented strips of montane forests. Even under optimistic emission scenario, the extent of montane forest is projected to almost halve by 2085, intersecting many biodiversity hotspots across the Eastern Arc Mountains. Similarly, climate change is predicted to threaten microhabitat forests (i.e. thickets), with losses exceeding 70% by 2085 (RCP8.5). Other forest habitats are predicted to decrease (lowland forest and woodland) representing essential ecological networks, whereas suitable habitats for carbon-rich mangroves are predicted to expand by more than 40% at both scenarios. Conclusions Climate change will impact forests by accelerating habitat loss, and fragmentation and the remaining land suitable for forests will also be subject to pressures associated with rising demand for food and biofuels. These changes are likely to increase the probability of adverse impacts to the country's indigenous flora and fauna. Our findings, therefore, call for a shift in conservation efforts, focusing on (i) the enhanced management of existing protected areas that can absorb the impacts of future climate change, and (ii) expanding conservation efforts into newly suitable regions through effective land use planning and land reclamation, helping to preserve and enhance forest connectivity between fragmented patches.

TI  - Elements for the expected mechanisms on 'reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation, REDD' under UNFCCC
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation account for about 20% of global anthropogenic emissions. Strategies and incentives for reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) have emerged as one of the most active areas in the international climate change negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). While the current negotiations focus on a REDD mechanism in developing countries, it should be recognized that risks of carbon losses from forests occur in all climate zones and also in industrialized countries. A future climate change agreement would be more effective if it included all carbon losses and gains from land use in all countries and climate zones. The REDD mechanism will be an important step towards reducing emissions from land use change in developing countries, but needs to be followed by steps in other land use systems and regions. A national approach to REDD and significant coverage globally are needed to deal with the risk that deforestation and degradation activities are displaced rather than avoided. Favourable institutional and governance conditions need to be established that guarantee in the long-term a stable incentive and control system for maintaining forest carbon stocks. Ambitious emission reductions from deforestation and forest degradation need sustained financial incentives, which go beyond positive incentives for reduced emissions but also give incentives for sustainable forest management. Current data limitations need-and can be-overcome in the coming years to allow accurate accounting of reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation. A proper application of the conservativeness approach in the REDD context could allow a simplified reporting of emissions from deforestation in a first phase, consistent with the already agreed UNFCCC reporting principles.

TI  - TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF THE DIAMETER DISTRIBUTION IN A SECONDARY BRAZILIAN ATLANTIC FOREST SUGGESTS SITE-SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT PRACTICES
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The diameter distribution of a forest makes it possible to understand its ecological processes and to define actions related to forest management aiming at forest conservation, biodiversity increase, production, and carbon sequestration, among others. This study aimed to identify variation in the diameter distribution in a secondary Atlantic Forest, as a function of sites, over 24 years. The diameter at 1.3 m in height (dbh) was measured for each tree over 5.0 cm dbh, in ten sites, from 1992 to 2016. It was analyzed the quadratic mean diameter (Dq), the Dq annual periodic increment (API(Dq)), the Liocourt's Quotient (q), and the diameter distribution with Meyer's exponential model. The average API(Dq )over 24 years was 0.03 cm year(-1), an average increase of 0.21%, with site variation ranging from 0.74% to -0.45%. The diameter distribution of the forest as a whole maintained the reverse J-shaped over 24-years. When the sites in each inventory year were analyzed, the variation in the diameter distribution was evident, and there were differences in the recovery capacity of the reverse J-shaped distribution from 1992 to 2016. The overall results indicate that, whenever possible, the management plan to recover the structure of the Atlantic Forest remnants should be site-specific, particularly in the mountainous region where the environmental conditions are quite diverse.

TI  - Role of forest regrowth in global carbon sink dynamics
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the existence of a large carbon sink in terrestrial ecosystems is well-established, the drivers of this sink remain uncertain. It has been suggested that perturbations to forest demography caused by past land-use change, management, and natural disturbances may be causing a large component of current carbon uptake. Here we use a global compilation of forest age observations, combined with a terrestrial biosphere model with explicit modeling of forest regrowth, to partition the global forest carbon sink between old-growth and regrowth stands over the period 1981-2010. For 2001-2010 we find a carbon sink of 0.85 (0.66-0.96) Pg year(-1) located in intact old-growth forest, primarily in the moist tropics and boreal Siberia, and 1.30 (1.03-1.96) Pg year(-1) located in stands regrowing after past disturbance. Approaching half of the sink in regrowth stands would have occurred from demographic changes alone, in the absence of other environmental changes. These age-constrained results show consistency with those simulated using an ensemble of demographically-enabled terrestrial biosphere models following an independent reconstruction of historical land use and management. We estimate that forests will accumulate an additional 69 (44-131) Pg C in live biomass from changes in demography alone if natural disturbances, wood harvest, and reforestation continue at rates comparable to those during 1981-2010. Our results confirm that it is not possible to understand the current global terrestrial carbon sink without accounting for the sizeable sink due to forest demography. They also imply that a large portion of the current terrestrial carbon sink is strictly transient in nature.

TI  - The effects of forest conversion on annual crops and pastures: Estimates of carbon emissions and plant species loss in a Brazilian Amazon colony
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The municipality of Theobroma in Rondonia, Brazil, covers 2165 km(2), of which 43% was deforested by 1993. Between 1973 and 1993, the national government continued to improve highway BR364 connecting the area to Brazil's south-central region and established a colony in Theobroma. During this period, 98% of the deforestation occurred. Some 1800 settler families continue to convert forest into pasture in a system based on the slash-and-burn agriculture and dual-purpose cattle production. Trends in carbon emissions and plant species losses during the 20-year history of Theobroma were analyzed by combining observed shifts in land-use types with estimates for the carbon stocks and plant species richness of each of these types. Carbon stocks declined from about 200 t ha(-1) in the forest to 28 t ha(-1) in the pasture and of 326 plant species encountered in the forest, only 20 remained in pastures (along with 66 species not found in forests). The effects of converting more than 93000 ha of forest into other uses over 20 years include approximate losses of 14 million tons of C to the atmosphere and substantial losses of plant species. Land use alternatives that would store more C include agroforestry and - given the strong incentives for settlers to convert lands into pasture - improving pasture management or developing silvopastoral systems. Plant species conservation may be improved with proposed ways to add private value to the forest. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Even cooler insights: On the power of forests to (water the Earth and) cool the planet
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Scientific innovation is overturning conventional paradigms of forest, water, and energy cycle interactions. This has implications for our understanding of the principal causal pathways by which tree, forest, and vegetation cover (TFVC) influence local and global warming/cooling. Many identify surface albedo and carbon sequestration as the principal causal pathways by which TFVC affects global warming/cooling. Moving toward the outer latitudes, in particular, where snow cover is more important, surface albedo effects are perceived to overpower carbon sequestration. By raising surface albedo, deforestation is thus predicted to lead to surface cooling, while increasing forest cover is assumed to result in warming. Observational data, however, generally support the opposite conclusion, suggesting surface albedo is poorly understood. Most accept that surface temperatures are influenced by the interplay of surface albedo, incoming shortwave (SW) radiation, and the partitioning of the remaining, post-albedo, SW radiation into latent and sensible heat. However, the extent to which the avoidance of sensible heat formation is first and foremost mediated by the presence (absence) of water and TFVC is not well understood. TFVC both mediates the availability of water on the land surface and drives the potential for latent heat production (evapotranspiration, ET). While latent heat is more directly linked to local than global cooling/warming, it is driven by photosynthesis and carbon sequestration and powers additional cloud formation and top-of-cloud reflectivity, both of which drive global cooling. TFVC loss reduces water storage, precipitation recycling, and downwind rainfall potential, thus driving the reduction of both ET (latent heat) and cloud formation. By reducing latent heat, cloud formation, and precipitation, deforestation thus powers warming (sensible heat formation), which further diminishes TFVC growth (carbon sequestration). Large-scale tree and forest restoration could, therefore, contribute significantly to both global and surface temperature cooling through the principal causal pathways of carbon sequestration and cloud formation.We assess the cooling power of forest cover at both the local and global scales. Our differentiated approach based on the use of multiple diagnostic metrics suggests that surface albedo effects are typically overemphasized at the expense of top-of-cloud reflectivity. Our analysis suggests that carbon sequestration and top-of-cloud reflectivity are the principal drivers of the global cooling power of forests, while evapotranspiration moves energy from the surface into the atmosphere, thereby keeping sensible heat from forming on the land surface. While deforestation brings surface warming, wetland restoration and reforestation bring significant cooling, both at the local and the global scale.image

TI  - Effects of nitrogen deposition on carbon sequestration in Chinese fir forest ecosystems
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen deposition and its ecological effects on forest ecosystems have received global attention. We used the ecosystem model FORECAST to assess the effects of nitrogen deposition on carbon sequestration in Chinese fir planted forests in SE China. This topic is important as China is intensifying its reforestation efforts to increase forest carbon sequestration for combating climate change impacts, using Chinese fir as the most important plantation species. A series of scenarios including seven N deposition levels (1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 kg ha(-1) y(-1)), three management regime (rotation lengths of 15, 30 and 50 years) and two site qualities (nutrient poor and fertile sites) were defined for the simulations. Our results showed that N deposition increased carbon sequestration in Chinese fir forests, but the efficiency of the increasing effect is reduced as N deposition levels increase. When N deposition levels exceeded 20-30 kg ha(-1) y(-1), the incremental effects of N deposition on forest C pools were marginal. This suggests that N deposition levels above 20-30 kg ha(-1) y(-1) could lead to N saturation in Chinese fir forest soils. Any additional amounts of N input from deposition would likely be leached out. Total above-ground C was more sensitive to N deposition than to rotation length and site quality. It was also estimated that the contributions of N deposition to C sequestration in all Chinese fir forests in South-East China are 7.4 x 10(6) Mg Cy-1 under the current N deposition levels (5 to 10 kg ha(-1) y(-1)) and could reach up to 16 x 10(6) Mg Cy-1 if N deposition continues increasing and reaches levels of 7.5 to 15 kg N ha(-1) y(-1).

TI  - Mega-development trends in the Amazon: Implications for global change
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes four global-change phenomena that are having major impacts on Amazonian forests. The first is accelerating deforestation and logging. Despite recent government initiatives to slow forest loss, deforestation rates in Brazilian Amazonia have increased from 1.1 million ha yr(-1) in the early 1990s, to nearly 1.5 million ha yr(-1) from 1992-1994, and to more than 1.9 million ha yr(-1) from 1995-1998. Deforestation is also occurring rapidly in some other parts of the Amazon Basin, such as in Bolivia and Ecuador, while industrialized logging is increasing dramatically in the Guianas and central Amazonia.The second phenomenon is that patterns of forest loss and fragmentation are rapidly changing. In recent decades, large-scale deforestation has mainly occurred in the southern and eastern portions of the Amazon - in the Brazilian states of Para, Maranhao, Rondonia, Acre, and Mate Grosso, and in northern Bolivia. While rates of forest loss remain very high in these areas, the development of major new highways is providing direct conduits into the heart of the Amazon. If future trends follow past patterns, land-hungry settlers and loggers may largely bisect the forests of the Amazon Basin.The third phenomenon is that climatic variability is interacting with human land uses, creating additional impacts on forest ecosystems. The 1997/98 Fl Nino drought, for example, led to a major increase in forest burning, with wildfires raging out of control in the northern Amazonian state of Roraima and other locations. Logging operations, which create labyrinths of roads and tracks in forests, are increasing fuel loads, desiccation and ignition sources in forest interiors. Forest fragmentation also increases fire susceptibility by creating dry, fire-prone forest edges.Finally, recent evidence suggests that intact Amazonian forests are a globally significant carbon sink, quite possibly caused by higher forest growth rates in response to increasing atmospheric CO2 fertilization. Evidence for a carbon sink comes from long-term forest mensuration plots, from whole-forest studies of carbon flux and from investigations of atmospheric CO2 and oxygen isotopes. Unfortunately, intact Amazonian forests are rapidly diminishing. Hence, not only is the destruction of these forests a major source of greenhouse gases, but it is reducing their intrinsic capacity to help buffer the rapid anthropogenic rise in CO2.

TI  - Concentration and stock of carbon in the soils affected by land uses and climates in the western Himalaya, India
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soils are the third biggest sink of carbon on the earth. Hence, suitable land uses for a climatic condition are expected to sequester optimum atmospheric carbon in soils. But, information on how climatic conditions and land uses influence carbon accumulation in the soils on the Himalayan Mountains is not known. This study reports the impact of four climatic conditions (sub-tropical, altitude: 500-1200 m; temperate 1200-2000 m; lower alpine 2000-3000 m; upper alpine, 3000-3500 m) and four land uses (forest, grassland, horticulture, agriculture) on the concentrations and stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC) in upper (0-30 cm) and deeper (30-100 cm) soil depths on the western Himalayan Mountains of India. The study also explored the drivers which influenced the SOC stock build up on the mountains. Rainfall and soil moisture showed quadratic relations, whereas temperature declined linearly with the altitude. SOC stock as well as concentration was the highest (101.8 Mg ha(-1) in 0-30 cm, 227.97 Mg ha(-1) in 0-100 cm) in temperate and the lowest in subtropical climate (37 Mg ha(-1) in 0-30 cm, 107.04 Mg ha(-1) in 0-100 cm). Pattern of SOC stock build up across the altitude was: temperate>lower alpine>upper alpine>sub-tropical. SOC stocks in all land uses across the climatic conditions, except agriculture in lower alpine, was higher (0.7 to 41.6%) in the deeper than upper soil depth. SOC stocks in both the depths showed quadratic relations with soil temperature and soil moisture. Other factors like fine soil particles, land-use factor and altitude influenced positively whereas slope and pH, negatively to the SOC stocks. In all climatic conditions, other than temperate, SOC stocks were greater in natural ecosystems like forests and pastures (112.5 to 247.5 Mg ha(-1)) than agriculture (63 to 120.4 Mg ha(-1)). In temperate climate, SOC stock in agriculture (253.6 Mg ha(-1)) on well formed terraces was a little higher than forest (231.3 Mg ha(-1)) on natural slope. These observations, suggest that land uses on temperate climate may be treated as potential sinks for sequestration of the atmospheric carbon. However, agriculture in subtropical climate need to be pursued with due SOC protection measures like the temperate climate for greater sequestration of the atmospheric carbon. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Estimating Aboveground Biomass of Two Different Forest Types in Myanmar from Sentinel-2 Data with Machine Learning and Geostatistical Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate estimation of spatially explicit forest aboveground biomass (AGB) provides an essential basis for sustainable forest management and carbon sequestration accounting, especially in Myanmar, where there is a lack of data for forest conservation due to operational limitations. This study mapped the forest AGB using Sentinel-2 (S-2) images and Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) based on random forest (RF), stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) and Kriging algorithms in two forest reserves (Namhton and Yinmar) in Myanmar, and compared their performance against AGB measured by the traditional methods. Specifically, a suite of forest sample plots were deployed in the two forest reserves, and forest attributes were measured to calculate the plot-level AGB based on allometric equations. The spectral bands, vegetation indices (VIs) and textures derived from processed S-2 data and topographic parameters from SRTM were utilized to statistically link with field-based AGB by implementing random forest (RF) and stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) algorithms. Followed by an evaluation of the algorithmic performances, RF-based Kriging (RFK) models were employed to determine the spatial distribution of AGB as an improvement of accuracy against RF models. The study's results showed that textural measures produced from wavelet analysis (WA) and vegetation indices (VIs) from Sentinel-2 were the strongest predictors for evergreen forest reserve (Namhton) AGB prediction and spectral bands and vegetation indices (VIs) showed the highest sensitivity to the deciduous forest reserve (Yinmar) AGB prediction. The fitted models were RF-based ordinary Kriging (RFOK) for Namhton forest reserve and RF-based co-Kriging (RFCK) for Yinmar forest reserve because their respective R-2, whilst the RMSE values were validated as 0.47 and 24.91 AGB t/ha and 0.52 and 34.72 AGB t/ha, respectively. The proposed random forest Kriging framework provides robust AGB maps, which are essential to estimate the carbon sequestration potential in the context of REDD+. From this particular study, we suggest that the protection/disturbance status of forests affects AGB values directly in the study area; thus, community-participated or engaged forest utilization and conservation initiatives are recommended to promote sustainable forest management.

TI  - Co-Benefits of Sustainable Forest Management in Biodiversity Conservation and Carbon Sequestration
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sustainable forest management (SFM), which has been recently introduced to tropical natural production forests, is beneficial in maintaining timber resources, but information about the co-benefits for biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration is currently lacking.Methodology/Principal Findings: We estimated the diversity of medium to large-bodied forest-dwelling vertebrates using a heat-sensor camera trapping system and the amount of above-ground, fine-roots, and soil organic carbon by a combination of ground surveys and aerial-imagery interpretations. This research was undertaken both in SFM applied as well as conventionally logged production forests in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Our carbon estimation revealed that the application of SFM resulted in a net gain of 54 Mg C ha(-1) on a landscape scale. Overall vertebrate diversity was greater in the SFM applied forest than in the conventionally logged forest. Specifically, several vertebrate species (6 out of recorded 36 species) showed higher frequency in the SFM applied forest than in the conventionally logged forest.Conclusions/Significance: The application of SFM to degraded natural production forests could result in greater diversity and abundance of vertebrate species as well as increasing carbon storage in the tropical rain forest ecosystems.

TI  - N2O and CH4 emissions from soils under conventional and no-till management practices in Goiania (Cerrados, Brazil)
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) are important greenhouse gases (GHG) produced respectively by the naturally occurring microbial processes of incomplete denitrification or nitrification and methanogenesis. Tillage practices and climate affect the release of GHGs. No tillage (DMC) systems may increase CO2-C fixation in soil but also N2O and CH4 emissions. The aim of this article is to question whether the positive effect of a DMC system observed on carbon storage for the topsoil layer in Cerrado soils is offset or not by the N2O and/or CH4 emissions. Two 5-year-old systems, tillage (disc on the first 15 cm called offset: OFF) and a direct-sowing mulch-based crop system (DMC) with an additional cover crop were studied during a cropping cycle. N2O and CH4 fluxes are determined using a closed-chamber, N2O and CO2 concentrations are measured at 3 depths (10-, 20- and 30 cm). No significant difference between treatments was observed for both gases (for emissions and concentrations). Soil NO contents increase from surface to depth (30 cm) and range from 300 ppbv to 3 ppm for both treatments. Total annual estimated emissions of N2O range from 31 to 35 g N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1) for DMC and OFF respectively which is low and corresponds only to 0.03% of he total N-fertilizer applied. Monthly means N2O emissions were strongly correlated to monthly means of N2O content at 10 cm depth (R-2 = -0.66) and seem to increase exponentially with monthly mean Water Filled Pore Space WFPS (0-10 cm layer) (R-2 = 0.33). CH4 fluxes were very low as well: both treatment act as source of CH4 (245 and 403 g CH4-C ha(-1) year(-1) for DMC and OFF respectively. On a CO-C equivalent basis these results correspond to 4.1 and 4.7 kg CO2-C ha(-1) year(-1) for NO and to 1.9 and 3.1 kg CO2-C ha(-1) year(-1) for CH4 for DMC and OFF respectively. As a result, the carbon sequestration balance taking into account the CO2, CH4 and N2O on a CO2-C equivalent basis is in favour of DMC treatment considering that this treatment increases carbon storage originated from CO-C for the topsoil (0-10 cm) layer (350 kg C ha(-1) year(-1)) in comparison with OFF treatment.

TI  - Biomass Production and Carbon Sequestration Potential of Different Agroforestry Systems in India: A Critical Review
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Agroforestry systems (AFS) and practices followed in India are highly diverse due to varied climatic conditions ranging from temperate to humid tropics. The estimated area under AFS in India is 13.75 million ha with the highest concentration being in the states of Uttar Pradesh (1.86 million ha), followed by Maharashtra (1.61 million ha), Rajasthan (1.55 million ha) and Andhra Pradesh (1.17 million ha). There are many forms of agroforestry practice in India ranging from intensified simple systems of monoculture, such as block plantations and boundary planting, to far more diverse and complex systems, such as home gardens. As a result, the biomass production and carbon sequestration potential of AFS are highly variable across different agro-climatic zones of India. Studies pertaining to the assessment of biomass and carbon storage in different agroforestry systems in the Indian sub-continent are scanty and most of these studies have reported region and system specific carbon stocks. However, while biomass and carbon stock data from different AFS at national scale has been scanty hitherto, such information is essential for national accounting, reporting of C sinks and sources, as well as for realizing the benefits of carbon credit to farmers engaged in tree-based production activities. Therefore, the objective of this study was to collate and synthesize the existing information on biomass carbon and SOC stocks associated with agroforestry practices across agro-climatic zones of India. The results revealed considerable variation in biomass and carbon stocks among AFS, as well as between different agro-climatic zones. Higher total biomass (>200 Mg ha(-1)) was observed in the humid tropics of India which are prevalent in southern and northeastern regions, while lower total biomass (<50 Mg ha(-1)) was reported from Indo-Gangetic, western and central India. Total biomass carbon varied in the range of 1.84 to 131 Mg ha(-1) in the agrihorticulture systems of western and central India and the coffee agroforests of southern peninsular India. Similarly, soil organic carbon (SOC) ranged between 12.26-170.43 Mg ha(-1), with the highest SOC in the coffee agroforests of southern India and the lowest in the agrisilviculture systems of western India. The AFS which recorded relatively higher SOC included plantation crop-based practices of southern, eastern and northeastern India, followed by the agrihorticulture and agrisilviculture systems of the northern Himalayas. The meta-analysis indicated that the growth and nature of different agroforestry tree species is the key factor affecting the carbon storage capacity of an agroforestry system. The baseline data obtained across various regions could be useful for devising policies on carbon trading or financing for agroforestry.

AB  - The annual average increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration is touching new heights every year. Global climate change and warming are twin outcomes of record-breaking CO2 levels. The trees outside forests (TOF) are the most promising and suitable components in the ecosystem for combating global warming via carbon (C) sequestration. Urban university campuses are the hotspot regions of TOF. We have attempted to quantify the C stock, C sequestration potential, and C credit value of dominant tree species at Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU), Rohtak. Different volumetric and biomass equations were used for biomass computation. We assessed a total of 29,442 trees (top 10) for measuring phytosociological parameters like total tree count, age, height (H), and diameter at breast height (DBH) to quantify the amount of C stored. The total C stock, C sequestration rate, and monetary value were 78.67 (Mg C ha(-1)), 19.05 (Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1)), and 23,101.59 $ year(-1), respectively. Eucalyptus globulus is the most dominant tree species on the campus and topped almost all the quantitative characteristics like total tree count (similar to 40 %), age (25 years), density (D) (55.35 trees ha(-1)), and total C stock (16.06 & PLUSMN; 9.90 Mg C ha(-1)). Tree basal area (BA), D, diversity, and H positively affected the total C stocks. When the C market becomes operational, these C credits can be traded while generating additional income for the university. The results from this study can also help calculate the total C footprint of the campus.

TI  - Growth, productivity, aboveground biomass, and carbon sequestration of pure and mixed native tree plantations in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In Costa Rica, reforestation programs with indigenous tree species are a recent activity. Information is still scarce on long-term species performance and silvicultural management to ensure the success of tree plantings, especially for mixed stands. This study aims to estimate growth, aboveground biomass, and carbon sequestration of nine native tree species growing in mixed and pure plantings. The study was carried out at La Selva Biological Station in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica. More than a half of the tree species studied (e.g. Calophyllum brasiliense, Jacaranda copaia, Terminalia amazonia, Hyeronima alchorneoides, Vochysiaferruginea, Balizia elegans) are distributed from Mexico-Guatemala to South America and a few have more limited distribution in Central America (e.g. Vochysia guatemalensis, Virola koschnyi, Dipteryx panamensis). The nine tree species are divided into three sets. The 3 members of each set were grown separately in pure plantations, and together in I mixed plantation, giving 12 monocultures and 4 mixtures. Plantation 1 (13 years old) is composed of V guatemalensis, C. brasiliense, and J. copaia. Plantation 2 (13 years old) is comprised of D. panamensis, T amazonia and V koschnyi. Plantation 3 (12 years old) is composed of H. alchorneoides, B. elegans, and V. ferruginea. Overall, all the species had good growth and productivity either in pure or mixed stands in comparison to other native and exotic species growing in similar ecological conditions. The exception was C. brasiliense in mixed stands, where it was suppressed by the fast-growing species V guatemalensis and J. copaia. At the stand level, the mixed stands performed well for volume, basal area, aboveground biomass, and carbon sequestration, in comparison to other pure or mixed plantations of tropical timber species. Pure plantations of V guatemalensis, V ferruginea, V koschnyi, J. copaia, and T amazonia also presented good productivity. At the tree level, V guatemalensis, J. copaia, T amazonia, H. alchorneoides, and D. panamensis performed better in mixtures than in pure stands for diameter, height, aboveground biomass, and carbon sequestration estimations. Values for the former three species were significantly higher in mixed than in pure stands. C. brasiliense was the only species with significantly better growth in pure stands than in mixed stands, for the three-species combination examined. The results show that mixed plantings had similar or higher productivities for several of the variables examined, but conclusions, on relative productivities depend on the species and growth features, interactions among species, and the variables quantified. In addition, there is a need to continue monitoring over longer time-frames, and for further studies of the species interactions and site factors involved, in order to develop reforestation guidelines for a range of objectives and environmental settings.

AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in soil solution plays roles in soil C storage and biogeochemical cycles. Factors regulating fluxes and concentrations of DOC still remain unclear.To identify the factors regulating fluxes and concentrations of DOC in the soil profiles, we compiled the data of site information [Country, Region or state, Coordinates, Vegetation, Mean annual air temperature (C), Climate type, Vegetation type, Mycorrhiza type, Soil (USDA, Soil Taxonomy)], soil properties [Litter pH (H2O), Soil pH (H2O), Soil C/N ratio, Clay (%), Alo+1/2Feo (g kg-1), O horizon C stock (Mg C ha-1), Mineral soil C stock (Mg C ha-1)], fluxes and concentrations of DOC [Throughfall DOC flux (kg C ha-1 yr-1), DOC flux at the bottom of the O horizon (kg C ha-1 yr-1), DOC flux at the bottom of the B horizon (kg C ha-1 yr-1), DOC concentration at the bottom of the O horizon (mg C L-1), DOC concentration at the bottom of the B horizon (mg C L-1), DOC/Dissolved organic N (DON) (O horizon), DOC/DON (B horizon), Precipitation (mm yr-1), Water flux at the bottom of the O horizon (mm yr-1), Water flux at the bottom of B horizon (mm yr-1)], plant litter properties [Litterfall C input (Mg C ha-1 yr-1), C/N ratio in litter, Lignin content in litter (%), Lignin/N ratio in litter, Root litter C input (Mg C ha-1 yr-1)], and DOC retention in mineral soil (%), DOC flux relative to C input (%), Contribution of DOC to C input in mineral soil (%), and Turnover time of mineral soil C (yr)]. The data were compiled from data in our study and those from published sources by searching for dissolved organic carbon, solute, flux, leaching, and soil in Google Scholar. We compiled the data of DOC fluxes in throughfall and soil profiles from 91 sites, of which the DOC flux data at 18 sites have been published by our group. The climate was classified into four groups [polar climate (MAT < 0 C), boreal climate (0 C < MAT < 6 C), temperate climate (6 C < MAT < 20 C), tropical climate (20 C < MAT)], based on mean annual air temperature. The other parameters include climatic properties [mean annual precipitation and mean annual air temperature], plant litter properties [litterfall C input, C/N ratio, Klason-lignin (residue after digestion with sulfuric acid; Allen et al., 1974), lignin/N ratio, root litter production] and soil properties [soil C stocks (O horizon and mineral soil (0-30 cm depth)), pH (water extraction), clay content, short-range-order (amorphous) aluminum (Al), iron (Fe) (acid ammonium oxalate extractable Al and Fe; McKeague and Day, 1966)]. The sampling and analytical methods are concisely summarized as follows: Throughfall (canopy leaching) samples were collected by precipitation collector, while soil solution samples were collected using tension-free lysimeters for downward flux of water percolating in the soil profiles. Sample solutions were filtered through a 0.45 m filter (e.g., PTFE syringe filter) and stored at 1°C in the dark prior to analyses. The concentrations of DOC were determined using a total organic carbon and nitrogen analyzer (TOC-VCSH, Shimadzu, Japan). The dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations were calculated by subtracting dissolved inorganic nitrogen (sum of NH4+ and NO3-) from TDN concentrations (DON = TDN - NH4+ - NO3-) to obtain DOC/DON ratios in soil solution. The DOC flux at the depth of 0 cm (the bottom of organic layers) and the bottom of B horizon (the bottom of rooting zone) was estimated by multiplying DOC concentrations in soil solution and water fluxes at each depth. Soil water fluxes were estimated by hydrological models or precipitation-evapotranspiration water budgets. Annual root production was measured by ingrowth core method, net sheet method, or sequential sampling method and estimated to be equal to annual root litter inputs. Proportion of DOC flux from the O horizon relative to C input via both throughfall and litterfall was calculated by dividing DOC flux from the O horizon by C input via both throughfall and litterfall. DOC retention in the mineral soil was calculated as the percentage of net decrease in DOC flux between O and B horizons relative to DOC flux from the O horizon. The apparent turnover time (yr) of soil C was estimated by dividing soil C stocks (Mg C ha-1) by C inputs (net DOC inputs and root litter inputs into the mineral soil) (Mg C ha-1 yr-1). # Fluxes and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon in soils This README file was generated on 2024-01-30 by Kazumichi Fujii.

TI  - Quantifying the Effects of Stand and Climate Variables on Biomass of Larch Plantations Using Random Forests and National Forest Inventory Data in North and Northeast China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate estimation of forest biomass is crucial for supporting climate change mitigation efforts such as sustainable forest management. Although traditional regression models have been widely used to link stand biomass with biotic and abiotic predictors, this approach has several disadvantages, including the difficulty in dealing with data autocorrelation, model selection, and convergence. While machine learning can overcome these challenges, the application remains limited, particularly at a large scale with consideration of climate variables. This study used the random forests (RF) algorithm to estimate stand aboveground biomass (AGB) and total biomass (TB) of larch (Larix spp.) plantations in north and northeast China and quantified the contributions of different predictors. The data for modelling biomass were collected from 445 sample plots of the National Forest Inventory (NFI). A total of 22 independent variables (6 stand and 16 climate variables) were used to develop and train climate-sensitive stand biomass models. Optimization of hyper parameters was implemented using grid search and 10-fold cross-validation. The coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) of the RF models were 0.9845 and 3.8008 t ha(-1) for AGB, and 0.9836 and 5.1963 t ha(-1) for TB. The cumulative contributions of stand and climate factors to stand biomass were >98% and <2%, respectively. The most crucial stand and climate variables were stand volume and annual heat-moisture index (AHM), with relative importance values of >60% and -0.25%, respectively. The partial dependence plots illustrated the complicated relationships between climate factors and stand biomass. This study illustrated the power of RF for estimating stand biomass and understanding the effects of stand and climate factors on forest biomass. The application of RF can be useful for mapping of large-scale carbon stock.

TI  - A systematic analysis and review of the impacts of afforestation on soil quality indicators as modified by climate zone, forest type and age
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - This global systematic analysis and review investigate the impacts of previous land use system, climate zone, forest type and forest age on soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) stock, soil bulk density (BD) and pH at soil layers 0-20, 20-60 and 60-100 cm, following afforestation. Data came from 91 publications on SOC. TN and TP stock changes, covering different countries and climate zones. Overall, afforestation significantly increased SOC by 46%, 52% and 20% at 0-20, 20-60 and 60-100 cm depths, respectively. It also significantly increased shallower TN stocks by 28% and 22% at 0-20 and 20-60 cm depths, respectively, but had no overall impacts on TP. Previous land use system had the largest influence on SOC, TN and TP stock changes, with greater accumulations on barren land compared to cropland and grassland. Climate zone influenced SOC, TN and TP stock changes, with greater accumulations for moist cool than other dimate zones. Broadleaf forests were better than coniferous forests for increasing SOC, TN and TP stocks of the investigated soil profile (0-100 cm). Afforestation for <20 years accumulated SOC and TN stocks only at the soil surface (0-20 cm), whilst afforestation for >20 years accumulated SOC and TN stocks to 100 an soil depth. Changes to SOC and TN were positively correlated at depths down to 100 cm under all age groups, demonstrating that an increase TN could offset progressive N limitation, and maintains SOC accumulation as forests age. TP stock deceased significantly in topsoil (0-20 cm) for <20-year-old forest and did not change for >20-year-old forest, suggesting that it may become a limiting factor for carbon sequestration as forests age. Following afforestation, soil BD decreased alongside significant increases in SOC and TN stocks to 100 cm depth, but had no relationship with TP. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - 15-year fertilization increased soil organic carbon stock even in systems reputed to be saturated like permanent grassland on andosols
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous long-term experiments conducted more than 10 years ago, showed that long-term application of organic fertilizer increased soil organic carbon (SOC) of grasslands. However, it was usually assumed that, independent of the successive additions of fertilizer, soils have an upper limit to their SOC due to the inability of the soil mineral phase to fix additional carbon. Andosols of the volcanic Reunion Island are typically very rich in carbon and are usually considered as saturated in SOC. To assess the long-term effect of different types of fertilization on SOC in these soils, SOC concentrations were recorded at yearly intervals for 15 years in one arenosol site and in two andosols sites across a topo-sequence. The types of fertilization tested included inorganic, organic, and a mix of inorganic and organic nutrient sources. The addition of organic fertilizers increased soil carbon in the top (0-15 cm) horizon in both the arenosol and the two andosols (up to +250% in the arenosol and up to +41% in the andosol), whereas inorganic fertilizers and the control treatment did not always result in a significant in-crease in SOC. After 15 years, no plateau was reached in C stocks even with the highest fertilization rates. Our results suggest that the increase in SOC was mainly caused by direct carbon inputs, while the effect of the in-crease in litter resulting from the increase in yield caused by fertilization, remained uncertain. In the andosol, all the fertilization treatments led to higher concentrations of carbon in the deeper layers. This suggests that SOC inputs lead to downward migration of OC to deep horizons. For C-rich soils like andosols, assessing the variations in carbon in the deep horizon is thus critical in estimating the effects of soil management on carbon sequestration.

TI  - Application of land-use/land cover changes in monitoring and projecting forest biomass carbon loss in Pakistan
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Located at the foothills of the Himalayan Mountains, subtropical and moist temperate forests of Pakistan are very rich in flora and fauna. However, due to increased illegal and uncontrolled harvesting of wood, agricultural activities, and urbanization, these forests are fast disappearing. The recent expansion of human activities resulting illegal and uncontrolled harvesting, agricultural activities, and urbanization is a cause for concern. Using Landsat imagery, Markov Chain and Cellular Automata, this study focused on the quantitative assessment of spatiotemporal land use and land cover changes during 1998, 2008, 2018 and a simulation of 2028. In addition, a forest inventory survey of biomass and carbon sink were respectively calculated for these subtropical broad-leaved evergreen, subtropical chirpine and moist temperate forests. Results showed biomass was 560.56 +/- 104.33 Mg ha(-1), 350.95 +/- 104.33 Mg ha(-1) and 153.63 +/- 104.33 Mg ha(-1) in moist temperate, subtropical chirpine and subtropical broad-leaved forests respectively. Meanwhile, carbon was 313.94 +/- 44.78 Mg C ha(-1), 221.34 +/- 44.78 Mg C ha(-1) and 131.77 +/- 44.78 Mg C ha(-1) in moist temperate, subtropical chirpine and subtropical broad-leaved forests respectively. During the study period, land-use and land cover changes showed forest land changed from 40936.77 ha to 36709.23 ha, agricultural land from 4220.46 to 10374.64 ha, and built-up area from 1497.60 to 5395.12 ha. The average annual biomass and carbon loss were respectively 50.34 Gg ha(-1) yr(-1) and 31.33 Gg C ha(-1) yr(-1). The information derived from this study could assist in the development of appropriate sustainable forest management policies in Pakistan. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Agroforestry is a land management practice where trees are grown around or among crops or pastureland. This integration of agriculture and forestry is frequently seen as an option that can secure food security and co-deliver a range of environmental benefits. However, quantitative studies simultaneously integrating multiple aspects of agroforestry are rare. Focusing on four sustainability goals, namely adaptation to climate change, biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation and rural development, this study investigated co-benefits and adverse side-effects of shaded agroforests above cocoa, coffee, oil palm, banana and citrus plantations in tropical humid West Africa. Time series of remote sensing land cover datasets were used to quantify and map recent land cover transitions in the region, and a field study in 25 agroforestry plots in Togo provided biomass carbon measurements in over 3000 trees, in addition to local farmers interviews. Estimates of theoretical agroforestry expansion and associated carbon sequestration potential in the region were compared to regional emissions from fossil fuels and deforestation. We found that about 1.6 Mha of losses in evergreen forests occurred between 1992 and 2015 (corresponding to 17% of the forest area originally present in 1992), while agricultural areas increased by 2.4 Mha (+5% relative to 1992). On average, trees in the studied agroforestry plots store 83.7 +/- 7.0 t C/ha. We found synergies between rural development and adaptation benefits, no clear relationship between biodiversity and carbon storage, and a tradeoff between high carbon stocks and crop yields. This trade-off can be minimized with an optimal management of agroforestry by using a mix of tree species that store medium carbon stocks and can enhance yields, soil fertility and climate resilience. In general, plant functional diversity, i.e. a balanced mix of shade trees, fruit trees, palms and bananas, emerged as a key feature of successful agroforestry systems. Besides, agroforestry trees coproducts are reported as an additional, diversified source of income for local farmers. A large-scale deployment of agroforestry over seven countries in West Africa can sequester up to 135 Mt CO2/year over two decades, corresponding to about 166% of the carbon emissions from fossil fuels and deforestation in the region. Overall, agroforestry practices in tropical humid West Africa offer multiple-win solutions that are relevant to address major local and global environmental challenges. Increasing cooperation among local farmer communities, national authorities, and international organizations are instrumental to overcome the barriers for a future expansion of agroforestry systems in the region.

TI  - Biomass and carbon storage in an age-sequence of Acacia mangium plantation forests in Southeastern region, Vietnam
T2  - FOREST SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim of study: The major objective of this study was to estimate the biomass increment and carbon (C) storage of the main ecosystem components in an age-sequence of three Acacia mangium plantation stands.Area of study: Chang Riec Historical - Cultural Forest, Southeastern region, Vietnam.Material and methods: In order to assess the biomass of different tree components, 36 trees with diameter at breast height ranging from 13.38 to 22.87 cm were harvested from the different aged stands. Biomasses of understory (shrubs and herbs), and litter were also determined. Carbon storage in the trees and understory biomass, litter, and mineral soil (0-50 cm) were determined by analyzing the C content of each compartment.Main results: The biomass in trees, understory vegetation, litter, and ecosystem increased with stand age. Soil C represented 61.99% of the total, aboveground tree biomass C made up 26.73%, belowground tree biomass C accounted for 7.01%, and litter comprised 2.96%, whereas only a small amount (1.30%) was associated with understory vegetation. The average C content of total tree (47.97%) was higher than those of understory and litter. Soil organic C stock in the top 50 cm depth in 4-, 7- and 11-year-old stands of A. mangium were 86.86, 126.88 and 140.94 Mg. C ha(-1) respectively. Soil C concentration decreased continually with increasing soil depth. Total C storage of three planted forests ranged from 131.36 to 255.86 Mg. C ha-1, of which 56.09 - 67.61% of C storage was in the soil and 26.88 - 40.40% in the trees.Research highlights: These results suggest that A. mangium is a promising afforestation tree species with fast growing, high biomass accumulation and high C sequestration potential.

TI  - Carbon storage and sequestration rate assessment and allometric model development in young teak plantations of tropical moist deciduous forest, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon (C) sequestration through plantations is one of the important mitigation measures for rising levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This study aimed to assess C stocks and their sequestration rate, and to develop allometric models for estimation of C stocking in age-series young teak (Tectona grandis) plantations (1, 5, 11, 18, 24 and 30 years) by using biomass and productivity estimation and regression, respectively. These plantations were raised in tropical moist deciduous forests of Kumaun Himalayan tarai. Total C stocks estimated for these plantations were 1.6, 15.8, 35.4, 39.0, 61.5 and 73.2 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Aboveground and belowground C storage increased with increasing plantation age; however, the range of their percentage contribution showed little variation (87.8-88.2 and 11.7-12.7 %, respectively). The rate of C sequestration for these respective plantations was 1.06, 6.95, 5.46, 5.42, 3.39 and 5.37 Mg ha(-1) a(-1). Forty percent of the aboveground annual storage was retained in the tree while 60 % was released in the form of foliage, twigs, and fruit litter. In the case of total (tree) annual production, 43 % was retained while 57 % was released as litter including root. C stock, C sequestration rate, accumulation ratio (1.4-18.1), root:shoot C ratio (0.61-0.13) and production efficiency (0.01-0.18) were comparable to some previous reports for other species and forests. These data could be useful in deciding the harvesting age for young teak with respect to C storage and sequestration rate. Four allometric models using linear regression equations were developed between biomass (twice the C stock) and diameter, girth, and height of the tree at different ages. The diameter model was found more suitable for C stock prediction in similar areas.

TI  - New forest biomass carbon stock estimates in Northeast Asia based on multisource data
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests play an important role in both regional and global C cycles. However, the spatial patterns of biomass C density and underlying factors in Northeast Asia remain unclear. Here, we characterized spatial patterns and important drivers of biomass C density for Northeast Asia, based on multisource data from in situ forest inventories, as well as remote sensing, bioclimatic, topographic, and human footprint data. We derived, for the first time, high-resolution (1 km x 1 km) maps of the current and future forest biomass C density for this region. Based on these maps, we estimated that current biomass C stock in northeastern China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Republic of Korea to be 2.53, 0.40, and 0.35 Pg C, respectively. Biomass C stock in Northeast Asia has increased by 20%-46% over the past 20 years, of which 40%-76% was contributed by planted forests. We estimated the biomass C stock in 2080 to be 6.13 and 6.50 Pg C under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively, which exceeded the present region-wide C stock value by 2.85-3.22 Pg C, and were 8%-14% higher than the baseline C stock value (5.70 Pg C). The spatial patterns of biomass C densities were found to vary greatly across the Northeast Asia, and largely decided by mean diameter at breast height, dominant height, elevation, and human footprint. Our results suggest that reforestation and forest conservation in Northeast Asia have effectively expanded the size of the carbon sink in the region, and sustainable forest management practices such as precision forestry and close forest monitoring for fire and insect outbreaks would be important to maintain and improve this critical carbon sink for Northeast Asia.

TI  - Carbon dynamics in slash-and-burn agriculture and land use alternatives of the humid forest zone in Cameroon
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the environmental consequences of slash-and-burn farming is the loss of forest system carbon which in turn contributes to atmospheric change and impacts upon global climates. International attention has become focused upon the development of alternatives to slash-and-burn agriculture to alleviate poverty, protect biodiversity and reduce climate change. Before alternative land use systems can be evaluated in terms of carbon sequestration, baseline measurements of carbon dynamics resulting from current practices are required. We have characterized the carbon stocks in six slash-and-burn chronosequences in the humid forest zone of Cameroon, Each chronosequence consisted of original forest, two year-old cropland, a cacao plantation, bush fallow, tree fallow and secondary forest. Four, nine and seventeen years, respectively, had passed since the original forest was cleared for the latter three land uses. At each of 36 site x land use combinations, tree, understorey, litter, root and soil (0-50 cm) carbon were measured in five 100 m(2) quadrates, The original forest contained 308 t C ha(-1) and lost 220 t C ha(-1) upon conversion to agriculture, The most vulnerable carbon pool was the above ground tree biomass and the most stable was soil organic matter. Carbon reaccumulated in the recovering fallows at a rate of 9.4 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) (r = 0.83). When these results were extrapolated using a geographic information system, deforestation rates in Southern Cameroon were estimated to be 1,355 km(-2) yr(-1) between 1973 and 1988 resulting in annual forest system carbon losses of 13.5 million t C. During the course of this study, three alternatives to slash-and-burn were identified: commercial cassava cultivation, improved forest conversion, and stratified agroforestry. These alternative land uses have the potential to reduce C losses over current practices by 10, 55 and 75 t C ha(-1), respectively, and also differ greatly in their potential to alleviate rural poverty, protect biodiversity and deflect additional deforestation.

TI  - Contribution of vegetation restoration to carbon sequestration driven by ex-situ poverty alleviation and relocation in ecologically fragile areas-Taking Guizhou, China, as a case
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation restoration in ecologically fragile areas has a significant carbon sequestration (CS) effect. However, it is usually difficult to achieve quantitative assessment at the regional scale for this part of human activity intervention. The Chinese government's ex-situ poverty alleviation and relocation (EPAR) project has relocated approximately 10 million people from areas with a fragile ecological environment to urban centralized resettlement, which is a typical case of weakened environmental intervention by human activities (Guizhou Province accounting for approximately 20% of the total relocated population in China). The CS model of vegetation photosynthesis and spatial analysis of geographic information were used to quantify the contribution of human activities to the natural restoration of vegetation CS, based on the data of net primary productivity (NPP) of vegetation from 2000 to 2020. The results show that the implementation of the EPAR project acts as an external force to drive vegetation restoration and CS, which increases the slope of the carbon density change trend (from k = 30.9 to k = 57.41), resulting in an overall carbon density increase of 26.51 tCkm(-2). The regional spatial analysis showed that the correlation coefficients between carbon density and relocation intensity in the 5-year and 10-year change were r = 0.976 (p < 0.01) and r = 0.949 (p < 0.05), respectively, indicating a significant positive correlation. Based on this, the CS contribution of vegetation in 84 districts in Guizhou Province that implemented EPAR projects was calculated, showing that 79 districts contributed positively, accounting for 94%. The average contribution of CS by vegetation restoration in each district was 0.0556 Tg, and offset CO2 emissions were 0.2059 Tg. The other five districts with a negative contribution to CS were distributed in regions with relatively stable ecosystems and mature forests. This shows that human intervention in the environment changes more significantly in fragile ecological areas.

TI  - Soil carbon and nitrogen sequestration over an age sequence of Pinus patula plantations in Zimbabwean Eastern Highlands
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests play a major role in regulating the rate of increase of global atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations creating a need to investigate the ability of exotic plantations to sequester atmospheric CO2. This study examined pine plantations located in the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe relative to carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage along an age series. Samples of stand characteristics, forest floor (L, F and H) and 0-10, 10-30 and 30-60 cm soil depth were randomly taken from replicated stands in Pinus patula Schiede & Deppe of 1, 10, 20, 25, and 30 years plus two natural forests. Sodium polytungstate (density 1.6 g cm(-3)) was used to isolate organic matter into free light fraction (fLF), occluded light fraction (oLF) and mineral associated heavy fraction (MaHF). In both natural and planted forests, above ground tree biomass was the major ecosystem C pool followed by forest floor's humus (H) layer in addition to the 45%, 31% and 24% of SOC contributed by the 0-10, 10-30 and 30-60 cm soil depths respectively. Stand age caused significant differences in total organic C and N stocks. Carbon and N declined initially soon after establishment but recovered rapidly at 10 years, after which it declined following silvicultural operations (thinning and pruning) and recovered again by 25 years. Soil C and N stocks were highest in moist forest (18.3 kg C m(-2) and 0.66 kg of N m(-2)) and lowest in the miombo (8.5 kg m(-2) of C and 0.22 kg of N m(-2)). Average soil C among Pinus stands was 11.4 kg of C m(-2), being highest at 10 years (13.7 of C kg m(-2)) and lowest at 1 year (9.9 kg of C m(-2)). Some inputs of charcoal through bioturbation over the 25 year period contributed to stabilisation of soil organic carbon (SOC) and its depth distribution compared to the one year old stands. Nitrogen was highest at 10 years (0.85 kg of N m-2) and least at 30 years (0.22 kg of N m(-2)). Carbon and N in density fractions showed the 20 year old stand having similar proportions of fLF and oLF while the rest had significantly higher B.F. than oLF. The contribution of fLF C, oLF C and MaHF C to SOC was 8-13%, 1-7% and 90-91% respectively. Carbon and N in all fractions decreased with depth. The mineral associated C was significantly affected by stand age whilst the fLF and oLF were not. Conversion of depleted miombo woodlands to pine plantations yield better C gains in the short and long run whilst moist forest provide both carbon and biodiversity. Our results highlight the importance of considering forestry age based C pools in estimating C sink potential over a rotation and the possibility of considering conservation of existing natural forests as part of future REDD + projects.

TI  - Carbon sequestration and turnover in semiarid savannas and dry forest
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Data on carbon and biomass budgets under different land use in tropical savannas and some dry forests are reviewed. Global data show wide ranges of biomass carbon stocks (20-150 Mg C ha(-1)), net primary production (2-15 Mg C ha(-1)y(-1)) and litter production (2-10 Mg C ha(-1)y(-1)) for the semiarid tropics. Although ranges for soil carbon are also wide, an average figure for the top 20 cm is probably 10 g C kg(-1), or about 25 Mg C ha(-1). In order to arrive at a better understanding of C budgets and their controls, two regional reviews are presented for NE Brazil and W. Africa.In NE Brazil approximately 40% of the lands have "near-climax" native vegetation. Less than 10% of the area is planted annually, but about 3-4 times that area is affected by shifting cultivation which has an average cycle of 5 y arable use followed by 20 y or more recovery. Standing biomass of native caatinga shows nearly the full global range with 2-50 Mg C ha(-1), Litter fall around 1-2 Mg C ha(-1)y(-1) is partly decomposed and partly consumed by animals, resulting in low average soil C levels near 8 g kg(-1), or 20 Mg C ha(-1). Under cultivation, C sequestration is decreased, and soils lose approximately half their C stocks before being abandoned.In W. Africa between 50-70% of the land is under a management regime with minimal C returns to the soils. Overgrazing and over-exploitation for fuel wood has resulted in land degradation. Short fallow periods on cultivated lands have caused serious declines in soil C stocks. Both C sequestration and stocks are therefore lower in W. Africa than in NE Brazil.Improvements in the C sequestration in these semi arid regions depend on an increase in crop production under suitable rotations, improved fallow and animal husbandry, and a limitation on biomnass burning. Use of fertilizer is required for improved productivities but socioeconomic constraints largely prevent such improvements, resulting in a very limited scope for changes in soil C management.

TI  - Potential of dendrochronology in assessing carbon sequestration rates of Vitellaria paradoxa in southern Mali, West Africa
T2  - DENDROCHRONOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the applicability of dendrochronology for assessing the growth dynamics and response to climate variability and to estimate the aboveground carbon stock and carbon sequestration potential of Vitellaria paradoxa in southern Mali. Twenty stem disks were collected from three land-use types (parklands, fallows and protected areas) in Koutiala and Yanfolila districts. We cornbined a standard dendrochronological approach with biomass allometric equations to estimate the growth and carbon stocks. The results showed that V. paradoxa forms distinct growth ring boundaries but most of the disks from parklands did not successfully cross-date due to management operations like pruning. The tree-ring width showed a significant standardized coefficient of regression with rainfall (r(2) = 0.66, p < 0.001) but insignificant correlation with temperature. One-way analysis of variance showed no significant difference (p > 0.05) for C-sequestration as well as for carbon stocks in aboveground biomass for both land-use types and sites. Mean values of the amount of C-sequestered in Yanfolila were 0.112 +/- 0.0.065 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in parklands, 0.075 +/- 0.018 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in fallows and 0.064 +/- 0.028 Mg C ha-(1) yr(-1) in protected areas. In Koutiala, the values were 0.068 +/- 0.020 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in the parklands and 0.053 +/- 0.017 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in the fallows. These results clearly indicate that dendrochronology can be applied to assess growth and carbon sequestration potential of V. paradoxa. These results also suggest that climate change could affect the growth and carbon sequestration potential of V. paradoxa. Given the limited size of our sample, figures on the amount of carbon are indicative calling for applying the tested approaches to larger samples and also to other tree species in West Africa.

TI  - Grass vs. tree origin of soil organic carbon under different land-use systems in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Silvopastoral management of tree plantations is becoming popular in Brazil. The impact of this practice on carbon dynamics of these soils is unknown, and predicting it is difficult because historical land-use records of the region do not exist. The objective of the study was to quantify the relative soil organic carbon (SOC) contributions of C3 and C4 plants in different land-use system.We evaluated total delta 13C, the contribution of C4 and C3-derived soil organic C in three fraction-size classes of soils in six land-use systems (Eucalyptus hybrid plantations established in 1985 and 2005; a native forest; silvopasture stands of Brachiaria brizantha under eucalyptus established in 1994 and 2004; and an open pasture), and undertook carbon dating (C-14) for three of those systems, an Oxisol in Minas Gerais, Brazil. From each system, soil samples were collected from four depths (0-10, 10-20, 20-50, and 50-100 cm); samples were fractionated into 250-2000, 53-250, and < 53 mu m size classes, and their delta 13C determined. Carbon dating (C-14 analysis) was done for whole soil samples from 0 to 10 cm and 50-100 cm depth classes of three land-use systems.The delta 13C values increased (showing increase in C contribution by C4 plants, i.e., grasses) with soil depth at all sites and all size-classes. The older systems showed a higher contribution of C4-derived SOC at all depths. Carbon dating indicated that the area had been cleared about 300 years ago.Silvopastoral and pasture systems can be considered as good carbon sinks. We infer that the study site was grassland with high proportion of C4 plants in the past, not a forest as it is today.

TI  - Carbon stock in silvopastoral systems: A study in the Middle Sinu, Colombia
T2  - AGRONOMIA MESOAMERICANA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. Silvopastoral systems play an important role in livestock production, provide benefits to the animal and edaphic components, and offer environmental services such as atmospheric carbon sequestration in the soil and biomass. Objective. To evaluate the capacity of atmospheric carbon sequestration in three systems of different complexities focused on livestock production, in northern Colombia. Materials and methods. The study was carried out at the Turipana Research Center of the Corporacion Colombiana de Investigacion Agropecuaria between 2019 and 2021. The dasometric parameters of the tree/shrub component were evaluated. The aboveground (CBA) and belowground (CBR) biomass of these species were estimated with allometric models. The fallen litter biomass (CLIT) and soil organic carbon up to 30 cm, with readings every 10 cm, were quantified by the combustion method and total accumulated carbon. The design corresponded to complete randomized blocks, with three treatments and four repetitions. The treatments corresponded to two silvopastoral systems (SSP) of different complexity and a grass without trees (Pr). Results. Aerial biomass was higher in the SSP (2.18 +/- 1.13, 4.51 +/- 3.76 t ha-1 C) than in Pr (0.19 +/- 0.09 t ha-1 C). The highest accumulation of CBR (1.16 +/- 3.76 t ha-1 C) and CLIT (3.09 +/- 2.45 t ha-1 C) occurred in SSP2. The soil organic carbon accumulated (COS) values showed higher accumulation in the first stratum. The COS represented in the three systems more than 70 % of the total contribution in accumulated carbon contribution. Conclusion. Under the environmental conditions of the humid tropical dry forest, silvopastoral systems increased the stock of atmospheric carbon in the soil and biomass. The use of SSP is a strategy in the mitigation of greenhouse gases in the livestock production system.

TI  - Carbon density and C-sequestration of tree plantation ecosystems in the mid-hills of the NW-Himalayas: Implications for climate change mitigation
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the current era of global warming, the Himalayan forests are under tremendous pressure due to intensified anthropogenic activity, resulting in the loss of forest diversity. However, the potential of carbon (C) sinks for increasing carbon storage and/or sequestration is still uncertain. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to examine the C-sequestration and mitigation potential of eight different tree plantations, namely: Pinus roxburghii, Quercus leucotrichophora, Acacia mollissima, Acacia catechu, Alnus nitida, Albizia procera, Ulmus villosa, and Eucalyptus tereticornis in the mid-hills of the Indian Himalayas. The soil samples used in our study (humus, 0-20cm, 20-40cm, and 40-100 cm) were used to determine the soil and ecosystem C-density. The analysis revealed that the maximum tree biomass (300.19 Mg ha(-1)), vegetation biomass (305.43 Mg ha(-1)), vegetation carbon (153.59 Mg ha(-1)), and total ecosystem C density (369.93 Mg ha(-1)) occurred under U. villosa plantation. Similarly, P. roxburghii plantations had the maximum detritus C-density (7.25 Mg ha(-1)), whereas A. nitida (224.71 Mg ha(-1)) had the maximum soil C-density. The highest C-sequestration was recorded under U. villosa (183.0 Mg ha(-1)). A significantly higher and lower rate of C-sequestration and CO2 mitigation was observed in Ulmus villosa (5.9 and 21.64 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and Eucalyptus tereticornis (3.9 and 14.3 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)). Our study found that indigenous tree species such as U. villosa, A. procera, A. nitida, and Q. leucotrichophora should be encouraged for afforestation on degraded lands to support climate change mitigation strategies in the sub-temperate forest ecosystem.

TI  - Photosynthetic and functional traits of tree seedlings from dry dipterocarp forest
T2  - Dryad
M3  - Data set
AB  - Seedlings frequently suffer the highest mortality rate, as they have different requirements for growth and survival from their mature life cycle stage. However, the links between functional traits and photosynthetic performance traits of tree seedlings, especially from dry evergreen forests, remain largely unexplored. Here, we measured eleven functional traits and six photosynthetic performance traits of thirty species of tree seedlings from the seasonally dry evergreen forest in Southeast Asia. We explored the relationship between traits and photosynthesis, compared them with their canopy layers when mature to their adult stature, and classified growth strategies. The results showed that photosynthetic measurements were highly correlated with seedling growth traits. The measured functional and photosynthetic traits did not correspond with the canopy layers of the mature trees. Through k-mean clustering analyses of the tree seedling trait data, two main groups of growth strategies emerged: (1) the fast-growing group, which mainly consists of shade-intolerant or -avoidance species; and (2) the slow-growing group, which consists of shade-tolerant species. This finding can be applied by future practitioners to select tree seedlings accurately based on their juvenile physiology, which is fundamental to the success of species selection for forest restoration in the face of global climate change. In this study, we collected seeds of 30 plant species from the permanent plot in the seasonally dry evergreen forest of Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary (HKK) (15˚40  N, 99˚10  E), Uthai Thani (Bunyavejchewin et al., 2003), from December 2016 until September 2018. At least five seeds per species were collected to investigate the variation within species. The collected seeds were cleaned and dried under natural sunlight for 14 days (Chamchumroon, 1997). The seeds were then planted in a greenhouse using a prepared mixture of silt, rice husk charcoal, and manure in a ratio of 6:3:1 (Table S1). The plants were grown in 4-inches plastic pots under regular watering, natural light (3,402.9-5,978.2 lumen/m2), and a temperature range of 28.5-33.9˚C. The studied species were chosen to cover the species from all three canopy layers, as identified in previous studies (e.g., Bunyavejchewin et al., 2016; Flora of China; Flora of Thailand; Pooma et al., 2017). These three canopy layers were classified by the average height of mature plants, including nine species from the understory (lower than 10 m), fourteen species in the sub-canopy (11-30 m), and seven species in the canopy layers (31-45 m; Table 1). Functional traits and photosyntheticsis performances traits were measured from six to ten seedlings for each species (Table 1). The seedlings were measured at 12-18 months after planting, which is a typical age for seedlings used in reforestation (Snorrason, 2020). Eleven functional traits were measured from three leaves per samples, including 1) leaf area, 2) leaf fresh weight, 3) leaf dry weight, 4) specific leaf area, 5) seedling height, 6) root collar diameter, 7) leaf thickness, 8) chlorophyll content, 9) carbon content, 10) nitrogen content, and 11) carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (Table S2). Leaf areas were measured by using the scanner and the Fiji software (Schindelin et al., 2012; Umana et al., 2015). Dry weights were measured after drying in a 70˚C hot air oven for 48 hr (Cornelissen et al., 2003; Garnier et al., 2001; Perez-Harguindeguy et al., 2016). Specific leaf area (SLA) was the fraction between leaf area and dried matter, one of the most frequently studied plant traits (Cornelissen et al., 2003; Wright et al., 2004). Seedling height (H) and root collar diameter (RCD) were measured as a proxy for performance to represent plant seedling growth rate for one 2 years old (Table S2). Leaf thickness was determined using the Thickness Gauge 547 (Mitutoyo, Japan) (Onoda et al., 2011). The chlorophyll content was measured using the SPAD-502 Chlorophyll Meter at the leaf apex, middle, and base, avoiding major veins and margins (Coste et al., 2010). Carbon, nitrogen content, and the ratio of C and N were also determined to represent leaf chemistry. Three dried leaves for each species were used for estimating these values, using the Standard Test Methods for Determination of Carbon, Hydrogen, and Nitrogen in Analysis Samples of Coal and Carbon in Analysis Samples of Coal and Coke, CHNS-628 (LECO, USA) at the Biomass and Bio-energy Technology Division, Kasetsart Agricultural and Agro-Industrial Product Improvement Institute (KAPI). Each trait was measured with three replications (Perez-Harguindeguy et al., 2016). Photosynthetic performance trait measurement To determine the performance traits of tree seedling photosynthesis, we measured five fully expanded leaves from each 1-year-old tree seedling before midday (Perez-Harguindeguy et al., 2016) using the LI-6400 Portable Photosynthesis System (LICOR Inc., USA). The leaf chamber contained an LED light source at 25-30˚C air temperature and 400 ppm CO2. Intensities of light were set at 2000, 1600, 1200, 1000, 800, 600, 400, 200, 100, 50, 20, and 0 mol · m-2 · s-1 to measure photosynthetic rate at each light intensity and generate a light response curve. The following photosynthesis parameters were estimated using the equation from Lobo et al. (2013): maximum capacity of photosynthesis (Pmax, mol · m-2 · s-1), quantum yield (ɸ or Phi), dark respiration (Rd, mol · m-2 · s-1), convexity index (theta or Theta), light compensation point (LCP, mol · m-2 · s-1), and light saturation point (Qsat75, mol · m-2 · s-1). # Photosynthetic and functional traits of tree seedlings from dry dipterocarp forest [https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.m905qfvbk](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.m905qfvbk) ## Description of the data and file structure Average value of functional traits and photosynthetic performance of the seedlings. ### Files and variables #### File: species\_level\_dataset.csv **Description:** ##### Variables * Codes: Species code * LA: leaf area (cm2) * DW:leaf dry weight (g) * FW:leaf fresh weight (g) * H:height (cm) * SLA:specific leaf area (cm2 · g-1) * RCD:root collar diameter (mm) * T:leaf thickness (mm) * SPAD:SPAD index, chlorophyll content * N:nitrogen content (%) * C: carbon content (%) * C:N:carbon-to-nitrogen ratio * Pmax:maximum photosynthesis (mol · m-2 · s-1) * ɸ (phi): quantum yield * Rd:dark respiration (mol · m-2 · s-1) * theta (theta): convexity index * LCP:light compensation point (mol · m-2 · s-1) * Qsat75:light saturation point (mol · m-2 · s-1) Species code | Codes | Scientific Names | | :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------ | | AFZEXY | *Afzelia xylocarpa* (Kurz) Craib | | ALANCH | *Alangium chinense* (Lour,) Harms | | ALCHRU | *Alchornea rugosa* (Lour.)

TI  - Estimating the full greenhouse gas emissions offset potential and profile between rehabilitating and established mangroves
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Mangrove forests are extremely productive, with rates of growth rivaling some terrestrial tropical rainforests. However, our understanding of the full suite of processes underpinning carbon exchange with the atmosphere and near shore-waters, the allocation of carbon in mangroves, and fluxes of non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHGs) are limited to a handful of studies. This constrains the scientific basis from which to advocate for greater support for and investment in mangrove restoration and conservation. Improving understanding is urgently needed given the on-going landuse pressures mangrove forests face, particularly throughout much of Southeast Asia. The current study reduces uncertainties by providing a holistic synthesis of the net potential GHG mitigation benefits resulting from rehabilitating mangroves and established forests. Rehabilitating sites from two contrasting locations representative of high (Tiwoho) and low (Tanakeke) productivity systems on the island of Sulawesi (Indonesia) were used as case studies to compare against established mangroves. A carbon budget, allocation and pathways model was developed to account for inputs (carbon sequestration) and outputs (GHG emissions of CO2, N2O and CH4) to estimate Net Ecosystem Production (NEP) and Net Ecosystem Carbon Balance (NECB). Our results indicate that while Tiwoho's rehabilitating sites and established mangroves represent a significant carbon sink (-10.6 +/- 0.9 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1) y(-1) and 16.1 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1) y(-1) respectively), the low productivity of Tanakeke has resulted in minimal reductions to date (0.7 +/- 0.3 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1) y(-1)). Including NEP from mangrove-allied primary producer communities (e.g. benthic algae) and the portion of dissolved inorganic carbon exported from mangroves (EXDIC) that remainswithin the water column may drive overall removals considerably upwards in established forests to 37.2 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1) y(-1). These values are higher than terrestrial forests and strengthen the evidence base needed to underpin the use of forest carbon financing mechanisms for mangrove restoration. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Monitoring vegetation dynamics with open earth observation tools: the case of fire-modulated savanna to forest transitions in Central Africa
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Woody encroachment and forest progression are widespread in forest-savanna transitional areas in Central Africa. Quantifying these dynamics and understanding their drivers at relevant spatial scales has long been a challenge. Recent progress in open access imagery sources with improved spatial, spectral and temporal resolution combined with cloud computing resources, and the advent of relatively cheap solutions to deploy laser sensors in the field, have transformed this domain of study. We present a study case in the Mpem & Djim National Park (MDNP), a 1,000 km(2) protected area in the Centre region of Cameroon. Using open source algorithms in Google Earth Engine (GEE), we characterized vegetation dynamics and the fire regime based on Landsat multispectral imagery archive (1975-2020). Current species assemblages were estimated from Sentinel 2 imagery and the open source biodivMapR package, using spectral dissimilarity. Vegetation structure (aboveground biomass; AGB) was characterized using Unmanned Aerial vehicle (UAV) LiDAR scanning data sampled over the study area. Savanna vegetation, which was initially dominant in the MDNP, lost about 50% of its initial cover in <50 years in favor of forest at an average rate of ca. 0.63%.year(-1) (6 km(2).year(-1)). Species assemblage computed from spectral dissimilarity in forest vegetation followed a successional gradient consistent with forest age. AGB accumulation rate was 3.2 Mg.ha(-1).year(-1) after 42 years of forest encroachment. In savannas, two modes could be identified along the gradient of spectral species assemblage, corresponding to distinct AGB levels, where woody savannas with low fire frequency store 40% more AGB than open grassy savannas with high fire frequency. A fire occurrence every five year was found to be the fire regime threshold below which woody savannas start to dominate over grassy ones. A fire frequency below that threshold opens the way to young forest transitions. These results have implications for carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation policies. Maintaining savanna ecosystems in the region would require active management actions to limit woody encroachment and forest progression, in contradiction with global reforestation goals.

TI  - Soil carbon stocks and dynamics of different land uses in Italy using the LUCAS soil database
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In terrestrial biosphere, soil represents the largest organic carbon pool, and a small change of soil organic carbon (SOC) can significantly affect the global carbon cycle and climate. Land use change (LUC) and soil management practices coupled with climate variables can significantly influence the soil organic carbon stocks (SOC-S) and its dynamics; however, our understanding about the responses of SOC in different LUC's (e.g., cropland, grassland and forest land) to mitigate climate change is quite limited at country level like Italy. Thus, the aims of this study were which factors are affecting SOC dynamics in three LUC's over time across Italy; and their relevance in terms of SOC-S in the superficial layer of soil that significantly contributes to the climate change mitigation, using LUCAS soil database. To calculate the SOC-S, it is necessary to have soil bulk density (BD) which is not present in the LUCAS database. Thus, we estimate the soil BD using the pedotransfer function (PTFs); and results shows that the soil BD obtained from fitting of the PTFs were reasonable to estimate the SOC-S for different land use types (R-2 >= 0.75). Overall, results showed that LUC's and soil management practices can significantly (p < 0.001) influences SOC dynamics and SOC storage from the soil and varied among LUC's but not for over time except grassland. Spatially, the mean SOC-S storage of the different LUC's was in the following order: forest land > grassland > cropland for both years 2009 and 2015. On the other hand, the SOC-S storage increased by 8.33% for cropland, 13.56% for forest land, and 29.79% for grassland during the year of 2009-2015, while SOC-S storage increased significantly (p < 0.001) in grassland over time but not for cropland and forest land which also follow the increasing trend but insignificantly. Our results also reveal that the SOC dynamics negatively correlated with MAT, and positively correlated with MAP for all land uses except forest land. Thus, this research indicates that LUC's and soil management practices coupled with climate variables can significantly influence SOC storage and its dynamics in the superficial layer of soil which have the potential capacity to mitigate climate change.

TI  - How resilient are African woodlands to disturbance from shifting cultivation?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Large parts of sub-Saharan Africa are experiencing rapid changes in land use and land cover, driven largely by the expansion of small-scale shifting cultivation. This practice creates complex mosaic landscapes with active agricultural fields and patches of mature woodland, interspersed with remnant patches in various stages of regrowth. Our objective here was to examine the rate and extent to which carbon stocks in trees and soils recover after cultivation, and detail how this disturbance and regrowth affect patterns in tree species composition and diversity over 40 years of succession in a miombo woodland landscape in southeast Tanzania. We sampled 67 areas, including plots previously cleared for cultivation, active fields, and mature woodlands for reference purposes. Sites were further stratified by soil texture to test for associated effects. Tree carbon stocks accumulated at an average rate of 0.83 +/- 0.10 Mg C.ha(-1).yr(-1), with soil texture having no clear impact on accumulation rates. Bulk soil carbon stocks on both soil types appeared unaffected by both the initial land clearance and the subsequent regrowth, which resulted in no significant changes over time. Tree species diversity in regrowing plots developed rapidly and within similar to 10 years was equivalent to that of mature woodland. Many of the species found in mature woodlands reappeared relatively quickly after abandonment, although species composition is expected to take considerably longer to recover, with at least 60-80 years required for the compositional similarity between regrowing and mature woodlands to reach levels similar to that among nearby mature woodlands. Through impacts on beta-diversity, disturbance was also found to increase the total number of tree species present in the landscape, with many of the recorded species only found in regrowing woodlands. Our results are of relevance to carbon sequestration projects by helping to inform the potential future carbon and biodiversity benefits of restoring disturbed habitats (REDD+). At a time where the use of shifting cultivation is threatened by shifts to larger-scale, commercial agriculture, we show that secondary woodland habitats can retain considerable biodiversity value, and act as carbon sinks.

TI  - The effect of traditional slash-and-burn agriculture on soil organic matter, nutrient content, and microbiota in tropical ecosystems of Papua New Guinea
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Slash-and-burn agriculture followed by tillage and western style agriculture often lead to loss of soil organic matter and soil degradation. Traditional slash-and-burn agriculture affects large areas of land across the tropical zone. However, there are few detailed studies about this practice. To evaluate the effect of traditional slash-and-burn agriculture on soil properties (total C, N, P, and C fractions of soil and available P, Ca, Mg, K, NO3, pH, and microbial community biomass and composition), we studied a chronosequence represented by active gardens, abandoned gardens (5-10 years old), secondary forest in abandoned garden sites (20-40 years old), and primary forest with no evidence of cultivation for at least 60 years. No significant differences between individual succession stages were found in total C, N, and P and in C fractions, pH, conductivity, and microbial biomass. In addition, stocks of C, N, and P in the soil did not differ between succession stages. By contrast, the concentration of available P, Ca, Mg, K, and NO3 was highest in active gardens. Litter was absent in active gardens, and the highest amount of litter on the soil surface was found in primary forest. Our results show that traditional slash-and-burn agriculture had a strong effect on nutrient availability but no effect on the total CNP stocks and soil C fractions.

TI  - Deep Learning Based Retrieval of Forest Aboveground Biomass from Combined LiDAR and Landsat 8 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is crucial for various technical and scientific applications, ranging from regional carbon and bioenergy policies to sustainable forest management. However, passive optical remote sensing, which is the most widely used remote sensing data for retrieving vegetation parameters, is constrained by spectral saturation problems and cloud cover. On the other hand, LiDAR data, which have been extensively used to estimate forest structure attributes, cannot provide sufficient spectral information of vegetation canopies. Thus, this study aimed to develop a novel synergistic approach to estimating biomass by integrating LiDAR data with Landsat 8 imagery through a deep learning-based workflow. First the relationships between biomass and spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) and LiDAR metrics were separately investigated. Next, two groups of combined optical and LiDAR indices (i.e., COLI1 and COLI2) were designed and explored to identify their performances in biomass estimation. Finally, five prediction models, including K-nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, the deep learning model, i.e., Stacked Sparse Autoencoder network (SSAE), and multiple stepwise linear regressions, were individually used to estimate biomass with input variables of different scenarios, i.e., (i) all the COLI1 (ACOLI1), (ii) all the COLI2 (ACOLI2), (iii) ACOLI1 and all the optical (AO) and LiDAR variables (AL), and (iv) ACOLI2, AO and AL. Results showed that univariate models with the combined optical and LiDAR indices as explanatory variables presented better modeling performance than those with either optical or LiDAR data alone, regardless of the combination mode. The SSAE model obtained the best performance compared to the other tested prediction algorithms for the forest biomass estimation. The best predictive accuracy was achieved by the SSAE model with inputs of combined optical and LiDAR variables (i.e., ACOLI1, AO and AL) that yielded an R-2 of 0.935, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 15.67 Mg/ha, and relative root mean squared error (RMSEr) of 11.407%. It was concluded that the presented combined indices were simple and effective by integrating LiDAR-derived structure information with Landsat 8 spectral data for estimating forest biomass. Overall, the SSAE model with inputs of Landsat 8 and LiDAR integrated information resulted in accurate estimation of forest biomass. The presented modeling workflow will greatly facilitate future forest biomass estimation and carbon stock assessments.

TI  - Soil Carbon Storage in Silvopasture and Related Land-Use Systems in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Silvopastoral management of fast-growing tree plantations is becoming popular in the Brazilian Cerrado (savanna). To understand the influence of such systems on soil carbon (C) storage, we studied C content in three aggregate size classes in six land-use systems (LUS) on Oxisols in Minas Gerais, Brazil. The systems were a native forest, a treeless pasture, 24- and 4-yr-old eucalyptus (Eucalyptus sp.) plantations, and 15- and 4-yr-old silvopastures of fodder grass plus animals under eucalyptus. From each system, replicated soil samples were collected from four depths (0-10, 10-20, 20-50, and 50-100 cm), fractionated into 2000- to 250-, 250- to 53-, and < 53 mu m size classes representing macroaggregates, microaggregates, and silt + clay, respectively, and their C contents determined. Macroaggregate was the predominant size fraction under all LUS, especially in the surface soil layers of tree-based systems. In general, C concentrations (g kg(-1) soil) in the different aggregate size fractions did not vary within the same depth. The soil organic carbon (SOC) stock (Mg C ha(-1)) to 1-m depth was highest under pasture compared with other LUS owing to its higher soil bulk density. The soils under all LUS had higher C stock compared with other reported values for managed tropical ecosystems: down to 1 m, total SOC stock values ranged from 461 Mg ha(-1) under pasture to 393 Mg ha(-1) under old eucalyptus. Considering the possibility for formation and retention of microaggregates within macroggregates in low management-intensive systems such as silvopasture, the macroaggregate dynamics in the soil seem to be a good indicator of its C storage potential.

TI  - The global potential for increased storage of carbon on land
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Constraining the climate crisis requires urgent action to reduce anthropogenic emissions while simultaneously removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Improved information about the maximum magnitude and spatial distribution of opportunities for additional land-based removals of CO2 is needed to guide on-the-ground decision-making about where to implement climate change mitigation strategies. Here, we present a globally consistent spatial dataset (approximately 500-m resolution) of current, potential, and unrealized potential carbon storage in woody plant biomass and soil organic matter. We also provide a framework for prioritizing actions related to the restoration, management, and maintenance of woody carbon stocks and associated soils. By comparing current to potential carbon storage, while excluding areas critical to food production and human habitation, we find 287 petagrams (PgC) of unrealized potential storage opportunity, of which 78% (224 PgC) is in biomass and 22% (63 PgC) is in soil. Improved management of existing forests may offer nearly three-fourths (206 PgC) of the total unrealized potential, with the majority (71%) concentrated in tropical ecosystems. However, climate change is a source of considerable uncertainty. While additional research is needed to understand the impact of natural disturbances and biophysical feedbacks, we project that the potential for additional carbon storage in woody biomass will increase (+17%) by 2050 despite projected decreases (-12%) in the tropics. Our results establish an absolute reference point and conceptual framework for national and jurisdictional prioritization of locations and actions to increase land-based carbon storage.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Over the last 2 decades, the Philippine government has devoted a considerable amount of resources to the rehabilitation and reforestation of degraded forest land. However, deforestation and forest degradation have continued to be a major environmental problem in the Philippines as vast forest cover is lost annually. While large-scale reforestation projects have been initiated, most have been far from successful. This chapter argues that soil is the single most important factor affecting survival, growth, and development of trees and thus, influence the success of reforestation programs. Within the context of the Philippines, it analyzes soil factors that limits the success of reforestation projects and discusses the use of exotic and native tree species in reforestation. Finally, it presents current research and development efforts to reforest degraded forest land, particularly the National Greening Program, and the role of the reforestation program on soil carbon sequestration.

TI  - Secondary forest growth deviation from chronosequence predictions in central Amazonia
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nearly all published rates of secondary forest (SF) regrowth for Amazonia are inferred from chronosequences. We examined SF regrowth on abandoned pastures over a 4-year period to determine if measured rates of forest recovery differ from chronosequence predictions. We studied the emergence, development and death of over 1300 stems in 10 SFs representing three age classes (< 1-5, 6-10 and 11-14 years old). Mean tree biomass accumulation in both the < 1-5 and 6-10 years old (4.4 and 5.7 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively) abandoned pastures was lower than predicted and deviated significantly (57% and 41%) from rates estimated from the chronosequence. The older SFs, with a mean growth rate of 9.9 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) followed the rate predicted by the chronosequence. Understocking was the primary cause of low biomass recovery rates in the youngest forests; although the youngest stands had a diameter at breast height increment three times the oldest stands, the youngest stands lacked sufficient density to cumulatively produce high biomass accumulation rates. Four years of measurement indicated that the youngest stands had developed 59% of the stems measured in the older stands during the same time period. The 6-10-year-old stands were rapidly self-thinning and approached stem density values measured in the same aged stands at the onset of the study. Mortality was high for all stands, with 54% of the original stems remaining after 4 years in intermediate-aged stands. The forests were dominated by the tree Vismia, which represented 55-66% of the biomass in all stands. The Vismia share of the biomass was decreasing over time, with other genera replacing the pioneer. Our measured rates of regrowth indicate that generalized estimates of forest regrowth through chronosequence studies will overestimate forest regrowth for the youngest forests that were under land use for longer time-periods before abandonment. Certified Emission Reductions under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto protocol should consider these results when predicting and compensating for carbon sequestered under natural forest management.

TI  - Comparing carbon sequestration and stand structure of monoculture and mixed mangrove plantations of Sonneratia caseolaris and S. apetala in Southern China
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are one of the most carbon-rich tropical ecosystems. Two fast-growing mangrove species of the genus Sonneratia, the native S. caseolaris and non-native S. apetala, have been widely used for mangrove reforestation in China; however their ability to sequester carbon is still unclear. The present study aimed to estimate the growth, carbon accumulation in biomass and carbon sequestration in sediments of these two species, in both mixed (50% S. caseolaris: 50% S. apetala) and monoculture plantations, in the intertidal zones of Shenzhen Bay, Guangdong Province, China. Twenty-five months of observation showed strong competition between the two species in the mixed plantation, with the native S. caseolaris outcompeting the non-native S. apetala due to a faster growth rate. Although S. caseolaris in the mixed plantation had lower carbon storage in biomass than in monoculture, carbon accumulation in sediment was higher in the mixed plantation. Thus, the relative advantage of the mixed plantation was in sequestering more carbon in sediment, as opposed to high carbon accumulation to biomass. These results indicated that the mixed plantation could be a good option for mangrove restoration and carbon sequestration of sediment. However, the two and a half years of this study may not indicate long-term trends, so more research on long-term species performance is essential for successful mangrove reforestation.

TI  - Biomass energy in industrialised countries - A view of the future
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Biomass fuels currently (1994) supply around 14% of the world's energy, but most of this is in the form of traditional fuelwood, residues and dung, which is often inefficient and can be environmentally detrimental. Biomass can supply heat and electricity, liquid and gaseous fuels. A number of developed countries derive a significant amount of their primary energy from biomass: USA 4%, Finland 18%, Sweden 16% and Austria 13%. Presently biomass energy supplies at least 2 ET year(-1) in Western Europe which is about 4% of primary energy (54 EJ). Estimates show a likely potential in Europe in 2050 of 9.0-13.5 EJ depending on land areas (10% of useable land, 33 Mha), yields (10-15 oven-dry tonnes (ODt) ha(-1)), and recoverable residues (25% of harvestable). This biomass contribution represents 17-30% of projected total energy requirements up to 2050. The relative contribution of biofuels in the future will depend on markets and incentives, on continuous research and development progress, and on environmental requirements. Land constraints are not considered significant because of the predicted surpluses in land and food, and the near balance in wood and wood products in Europe.There is considerable potential for the modernisation of biomass fuels to produce convenient energy carriers such as electricity, gases and transportation fuels, whilst continuing to provide for traditional uses of biomass; this modernisation of biomass and the industrial investment is already happening in many countries. When produced in an efficient and sustainable manner, biomass energy has numerous environmental and social benefits compared with fossil fuels. These include improved land management, job creation, use of surplus agricultural land in industrialised countries, provision of modem energy carriers to rural communities of developing countries, a reduction of CO2 levels, waste control, and nutrient recycling. Greater environmental and net energy benefits can be derived from perennial and woody energy cropping than from annual arable crops which are short-term alternative feedstocks for fuels. Agroforestry systems can play an important role in providing multiple benefits to growers and the community, besides energy. In order to ameliorate CO2 emissions, using biomass as a substitute for fossil fuels (complete replacement, co-firing, etc.) is more beneficial from social and economic perspectives than sequestering the carbon in forests.Case studies are presented for several developed countries and the constraints involved in modernising biomass energy along with the potential for turning them into entrepreneurial opportunities are discussed. It is concluded that the long term impacts of biomass programmes and projects depend mainly on ensuring income generation, environmental sustainability, flexibility and replicability, while taking account of local conditions and providing multiple benefits, which is an important attribute of agroforestry-type systems. Biomass for energy must be environmentally acceptable in order to ensure its widespread adoption as a modern energy source. Implementation of biomass projects requires governmental policy initiatives that will internalise the external economic, social and environmental costs of conventional fuel sources so that biomass fuels can become competitive on a 'level playing field'.

TI  - The role of wild palms in agroforestry systems in the Neotropics: A review
T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
M3  - Review
AB  - Wild palms are among the most important plants in the Neotropics due to their wide distribution, species richness and cultural relevance for humans. In addition to their presence in forests, these plants also occur in anthropogenic systems throughout their range of distribution, but their role in these systems is often overlooked. We explored databases of scientific publications to attain a panorama about the presence of wild palm species in agroforestry systems (AFS), their management and their role in those systems. Our keywords in the search engines were names of palm genera that occur in the Americas and types of agroforestry practices. We gathered and analysed information from 154 studies. For each record, we registered: study sites, management actions, agroforestry practices and uses. We identified 65 species belonging to 24 genera managed in AFS, mainly including agrisilvicultural and silvopastoral systems, homegardens and agroforests. We identified traits phylogenetically determined such as stem height, number and length of leaves, and fruit size that influence the presence of wild palms in AFS. Furthermore, we point out three major ways that favour the presence and management of palms in AFS: (1) the management of the canopy and the raise of palms in the understorey, (2) intentional enhancement or cultivation and (3) tolerance of palms during deforestation/fragmentation. We emphasize that a change in the vision of palms as key components of agroforestry would favour future research and plans to improve their performance in these systems while ensuring their conservation.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.Debido a su amplia distribuci & oacute;n, riqueza de especies y la relevancia cultural de las mismas, las palmas silvestres son uno de los grupos de plantas m & aacute;s importantes del Neotr & oacute;pico.

TI  - The Economics of Biodiversity Additionality (BIOADD)
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - The Dasgupta Review on the economics of biodiversity illustrated the complex and embedded ecology-economy relationships and thereby the fundamental economic and societal value of biodiversity. The Review evidenced the unsustainable path of exploitation biodiversity and made plain the need to manage regeneration of natural capital in the global economy to ensure sustainability. For sustainability to be achieved efficiently requires trade-offs to be made, the relative economic values of biodiversity to be understood, and interventions to be evaluated according to "shadow prices". The UK government's aims in this regard are reflected in domestic (The Environment Act of 2021) and international commitments (e.g. the Kunming Declaration of the COP15 of the Convention on Biodiversity).  Economies must consider their impact on nature, yet biodiversity policy: e.g. Protected Areas (PAs); NBS for climate change mitigation (e.g. reforestation); and agricultural policies, therefore need to account for interactions in the economy, which can conspire to limit the success or additionality of interventions. Leakage, non-compliance, project failure and impermanence, or policy failures, all limit the success of area-based and other policies, questioning their additionality. Particularly prone are NBS to climate change, which can provide cost-effective solutions to net-zero commitments (UK Climate Act), and large gains in biodiversity. To understand the effectiveness of biodiversity policies requires an understanding of the economics of biodiversity additionality. BIOADD will develop the economics of biodiversity additionality from key perspectives. First, to guide the trade-offs required for sustainability and value biodiversity additionality, BIOADD estimates a Shadow Price of Biodiversity (SPB). Rather than reflecting Willingness to Pay for biodiversity (unreliable and controversial) SPB reflects the costs of meeting a societally determined target for biodiversity, such as net-gain or 30% protected areas, or staying within planetary boundaries. We will apply this theory to: i) Indonesian and Bolivian forests; ii) Nature Based Solutions (NBS) for mitigating climate change, in each case pricing the risk of non-additionality (e.g. failure, impermanence). The SPB will indicate the trade-offs and priorities for biodiversity and how targets can be met at least cost to society by targeting biodiversity rich and low-cost areas. Second, to understand the baseline against which additionality is measured, BIOADD will analyse the spatial economic factors that determine biodiversity regrowth in secondary forests in the Amazon rainforest, with focus on Bolivia.  Third, in Indonesia, the role of "policy layering": multiple overlapping policies, in hindering or improving biodiversity outcomes in tropical forests will be analysed.  These two case studies will use bespoke spatial data to identify economic and policy drivers of biodiversity additionality. Finally, together with CarbonPlan, an online tool that will be developed for the carbon offset market to allow different NBS to be valued and compared according to their impacts on biodiversity, the offset carbon emissions, and additionality risks (e.g. failure, impermanence).  The research is important for the UK as it: 1) implements domestic commitments to biodiversity net-gain in the Environment Act (2021) without leakage of biodiversity loss to other countries; 2) addresses how to meet commitments towards biodiversity the 30 by 30 target from the COP15; 3) helps to orientate development assistance towards halting deforestation and guide COP26 commitments on zero-deforestation by 2030; 3) assesses NBS as a potential means of meeting net-zero commitments; 4) illustrates where "free" renewable returns (Dasgupta 2020) from natural capital are most valuable and the economic processes determine them.

TI  - Fire in the Brazilian Amazon 3. Dynamics of biomass, C, and nutrient pools in regenerating forests
T2  - OECOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Regenerating forests have become a common land-cover type throughout the Brazilian Amazon. However, the potential for these systems to accumulate and store C and nutrients, and the fluxes resulting from them when they are cut, burned, and converted back to croplands and pastures have not been well quantified. In this study, we quantified pre- and post-fire pools of biomass, C, and nutrients, as well as the emissions of those elements, at a series of second- and third-growth forests located in the states of Para and Rondonia, Brazil. Total aboveground biomass (TAGB) of second- and third-growth forests averaged 134 and 91 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Rates of aboveground biomass accumulation were rapid in these systems, but were not significantly different between second- and third-growth forests, ranging from 9 to 16 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). Residual pools of biomass originating from primary forest vegetation accounted for large portions of TAGB in both forest types and were primarily responsible for TAGB differences between the two forest types. In second-growth forests this pool (82 Mg ha(-1)) represented 58% of TAGB, and in third-growth forests (40 Mg ha(-1)) it represented 40% of TAGB. Amounts of TAGB consumed by burning of second- and third-growth forests averaged 70 and 53 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Aboveground pre-fire pools in second- and third-growth forests averaged 67 and 45 Mg C ha(-1), 821 and 707 kg N ha(-1), 441 and 341 kg P ha(-1), and 46 and 27 kg Ca ha(-1), respectively. While pre-fire pools of C, N, S and K were not significantly different between second- and third-growth forests, pools of both P and Ca were significantly higher in second-growth forests. This suggests that increasing land use has a negative impact on these elemental pools. Site losses of elements resulting from slashing and burning these sites were highly variable: losses of C ranged from 20 to 47 Mg ha(-1); N losses ranged from 306 to 709 kg ha(-1); Ca losses ranged from 10 to 145 kg ha(-1); and P losses ranged from 2 to 20 kg ha(-1). Elemental losses were controlled to a large extent by the relative distribution of elemental mass within biomass components of varying susceptibilities to combustion and the temperatures of volatilization of each element. Due to a relatively low temperature of volatilization and its concentration in highly combustible biomass pools, site losses of N averaged 70% of total pre-fire pools. In contrast, site losses of P and Ca resulting from burning were 33 and 20% of total pre-fire pools, respectively, as much of the mass of those elements was deposited on site as ash. Pre- and post-fire biomass and elemental pools of second- and third-growth forests, as well as the emissions from those systems, were intermediate between those of primary forests and pastures in the Brazilian Amazon. Overall, regenerating forests have the capacity to act as either large terrestrial sinks or sources of C and nutrients, depending on the course of land-use patterns within the Brazilian Amazon. Combining remote sensing techniques with field measures of aboveground C accumulation in regenerating forests and C fluxes from those forests when they are cut and burned, we estimate that during 1990-1991 roughly 104 Tg of C was accumulated by regenerating forests across the Brazilian Amazon. Further, we estimate that approximately 103 Tg of C was lost via the cutting and burning of regenerating forests across the Brazilian Amazon during this same period. Since average C accumulations (5.5 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) in regenerating forests were 19% of the C lost when such forests are cut and burned (29.3 Mg ha(-1)), our results suggest that when less than 19% of the total area accounted for by secondary forests is cut and burned in a given year, those forests will be net accumulators of C during that year. Conversely, when more than 19% of regenerating forests are burned, those forests will be a net source of C to the atmosphere.

TI  - Rainforest transformation reallocates energy from green to brown food webs
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial animal biodiversity is increasingly being lost because of land-use change(1,2). However, functional and energetic consequences aboveground and belowground and across trophic levels in megadiverse tropical ecosystems remain largely unknown. To fill this gap, we assessed changes in energy fluxes across 'green' aboveground (canopy arthropods and birds) and 'brown' belowground (soil arthropods and earthworms) animal food webs in tropical rainforests and plantations in Sumatra, Indonesia. Our results showed that most of the energy in rainforests is channelled to the belowground animal food web. Oil palm and rubber plantations had similar or, in the case of rubber agroforest, higher total animal energy fluxes compared to rainforest but the key energetic nodes were distinctly different: in rainforest more than 90% of the total animal energy flux was channelled by arthropods in soil and canopy, whereas in plantations more than 50% of the energy was allocated to annelids (earthworms). Land-use change led to a consistent decline in multitrophic energy flux aboveground, whereas belowground food webs responded with reduced energy flux to higher trophic levels, down to -90%, and with shifts from slow (fungal) to fast (bacterial) energy channels and from faeces production towards consumption of soil organic matter. This coincides with previously reported soil carbon stock depletion(3). Here we show that well-documented animal biodiversity declines with tropical land-use change(4-6) are associated with vast energetic and functional restructuring in food webs across aboveground and belowground ecosystem compartments.

TI  - Carbon sequestration and biodiversity of re-growing miombo woodlands in Mozambique
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land management in tropical woodlands is being used to sequester carbon (C), alleviate poverty and protect biodiversity, among other benefits. Our objective was to determine how slash-and-burn agriculture affected vegetation and soil C stocks and biodiversity on an area of miombo woodland in Mozambique, and how C stocks and biodiversity responded once agriculture was abandoned. We sampled twenty-eight 0. 125 ha plots that had previously been cleared for subsistence agriculture and had been left to re-grow for 2 to similar to 25 years, and fourteen 0.25 ha plots of protected woodlands, recording stem diameter distributions and species, collecting wood for density determination, and soil from 0 to 0.3 m for determination of %C and bulk density. Clearance for agriculture reduced stem wood C stocks by 19.0 t C ha(-1). There were significant relationships between period of re-growth and basal area, stem numbers and stein biomass. During re-growth, wood C stocks accumulated at 0.7 t C ha(-1) year(-1). There was no significant difference in stem C stocks on woodlands and on abandoned farmland 20-30 years old. Soil C stocks in the top 0.3 m on abandoned land had a narrower range (21-74 t C ha(-1)) than stocks in woodland soils (18-140 t C ha(-1)). There was no discernible increase in soil C stocks with period of re-growth, suggesting that the rate of accumulation of organic matter in these soils was very slow. The re-growing plots did not contain the defining miombo species, and total stem numbers were significantly greater than in woodland plots, but species richness and diversity were similar in older abandonments and miombo woodlands. Wood C stocks on abandoned farmland were capable of recovery within 2-3 decades, but soil C stocks did not change on this time-scale. Woodland soils were capable of storing > 100 t C ha(-1), whereas no soil on a re-growing area exceeded 74 t C ha(-1), so there is a potential for C sequestration in soils on abandoned farmland. Management should focus on identifying C-rich soils, conserving remaining woodlands to protect soil C and preserve defining miombo species, and on investigating whether fire control on recovering woodland can stimulate accumulation of soil C and greater tree biomass, and restore defining miombo species.

TI  - Influence of nutrient availability, stand age, and canopy structure on isoprene flux in a Eucalyptus saligna experimental forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - [1] Eucalyptus plantations occupy approximately 10 million ha of land in the tropics and, increasingly, afforestation and reforestation projects are relying on this genus to provide rapid occupation of degraded sites, large quantities of high-quality wood products, and high rates of carbon sequestration. Members of the genus Eucalyptus are also very high emitters of isoprene, the dominant volatile organic compound emitted by trees in tropical ecosystems, which significantly influences the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere. While fertilization growth response of these trees has been intensively studied, little is known about how fertilization and tree age alter isoprene production from plantations of these trees. Here we examined the effects of fertilization and tree age on leaf-level isoprene flux from 2- and 6-year-old trees in a Eucalyptus saligna experimental forest in Hawaii. Leaf-level emission at a given canopy height did not differ between fertilized and unfertilized 6-year-old trees likely because leaf nitrogen content did not vary with fertilization. Across treatments, however, the standardized emission rate of isoprene (emission at a standard light and temperature) followed patterns of leaf N content and declined with canopy depth. Although leaf nitrogen content was similar between 2- year and 6-year fertilized trees, leaf-level emission rates declined with stand age. Surprisingly, despite differences in stand leaf area and leaf area distribution, modeled canopy-level isoprene flux was similar across stands varying in fertilization and tree age. Model results suggest that leaf area index was high enough in all treatments to absorb most of the light penetrating the canopy, leading to similar canopy flux rates despite the very different sized canopies.

TI  - Aligning climate and health: assessing zoonotic arboviral risks in agroforestry as a climate mitigation strategy
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Recent outbreaks of arboviral diseases such as Zika and West Nile have their roots in tropical forests.Their spread coincides with significant land conversion for agriculture, impacting arthropod vectors andreservoirs of zoonotic diseases. Our decade-long epidemiological studies in Panama's Darien region indicatehigh incidence of zoonotic alphaviruses in humans, wildlife and more recently, in livestock. In Darien, openpasture ranching and crop farming coexist with agroforestry, an important climate change mitigation strategy thatintegrates crops, livestock and forest. Despite the rising global adoption of agroforestry, its impact on infectiousdisease risk is understudied. Our research aims to fill this knowledge gap by investigating zoonotic arboviraltransmission in Darien in relation to its agricultural practices, including agroforestry. Various factors, frombiodiversity shifts to land tenure benefits and irrigation schemes, likely influence disease transmission. Wehypothesize that landscapes that merge forest, agriculture and human dwellings potentially enhance the spreadof zoonotic arboviruses due to increased overlap of vectors, vertebrate reservoirs including livestock, andhumans. Our first aim in this study is to assess agroforestry's impact on zoonotic arboviral risk among the agrarianpopulation and livestock in Darien, Panama, by conducting serosurveys and acute febrile studies to informhabitat suitability modeling. Interviews with participants will provide data on health and social determinantsinfluencing agriculture and zoonoses interactions. Our second aim is to characterize vector ecology, infectionrates, and host use across an agricultural gradient. We will study immature vector breeding preferences andwater quality, and employ a variety of vector trapping methods to assess viral transmission rates and blood mealorigins to shed light on shifts is host usage within agroforestry environments. Our third aim is to map zoonoticarboviral risk using geospatial and field data. We will also analyze natural selection and gene flow of thepredominant zoonotic arbovirus in the region, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, across the agriculturalgradient. We will use genomes derived from field isolates (mosquito, animal and human), along with regionalhistorical isolates, to test the hypothesis that increased host diversity at the forest/agriculture ecotone fostersgreater VEEV genetic diversification, leading to the emergence of new variants capable of causing epizootics. The research outcomes will be instrumental in defining transmission dynamics and health burden ofsignificant zoonotic arboviruses and informing preventive measures. This understanding will guide land use andhealth policies in Darien, serve as a blueprint for interventions, and help ensure alignment of climate and healthobjectives within the context of agroforestry. Our methodologies and findings will have broad applicability acrossregions with similar ecologies.

TI  - Land use drives the distribution of free, physically protected, and chemically protected soil organic carbon storage at a global scale
T2  - Dryad
M3  - Data set
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration is increasingly emphasized as a climate mitigation solution, as scientists, policy makers, and land-managers prioritize enhancing belowground C storage. To identify key underlying drivers of total SOC distributions, we compiled a global dataset of soil C stocks held in three chemical forms, reflecting different mechanisms of organic C protection: free particulate organic C (fPOC), physically protected particulate organic C (oPOC), and mineral-protected soil organic C (mSOC). In our dataset, these three SOC pools were differentially sensitive to effects of climate, soil mineralogy, and ecosystem type, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing between physical and chemical C protection mechanisms. C stocks in all three pools varied among ecosystems: cropland soils stored the least amount in each pool, with forest and grassland soils both containing significantly more fPOC (40-60% greater in each ecosystem) than croplands. oPOC stocks did not significantly differ from zero in croplands, but were substantial in forest and grassland soils. Meanwhile, mSOC stocks were the greatest in grasslands and shrublands (90-100% greater than croplands). In cropland soils, there were no major effects of tillage on C storage in any of the three pools, while manure addition enhanced mSOC stocks, especially when added with inorganic N. Thus, the human land use intensity in croplands appears to reduce SOC storage in all major pools, depending upon management; retaining native vegetation should be emphasized to maintain current global SOC stocks. We collected data from papers which utilized a density fractionation methodology to measure soil organic C (SOC) within the three fraction pools: free particulate organic fraction (fPOC), occluded particulate organic fraction (oPOC), and mineral soil organic carbon (mSOC). To filter through published studies reporting SOC stocks, we chose to extract data from papers which cited one of the following rigorous and influential fractionation methodologies: (Golchin et al., 1994; Shaymukhametov et al., 1984; Six et al., 1998; Sollins et al., 1984, 2006, 2009; Spycher et al., 1983; Steffens et al., 2009). On Google Scholar, there were 3915 papers citing one of the above papers through September 2020. We examined each publication and only extracted data from empirical studies, published in a peer-review journal in English, that measured SOC via density fractionation. When recording oPOC or mSOC data, we only collected data from papers which utilized sonication, sodium hexametaphosphate dispersion, or physical disruption (e.g., from glass beads) to separate oPOC from mSOC (Figure S1). Unless it was specified for a particular soil and reported in the respective study, we set a density cutoff of 1.85 g cm-3 for classifying mSOC. Since some studies isolated C pools along a density gradient, we summed SOC stored in fractions above or below the density cutoff. To make meaningful global comparisons, we chose to only include papers which reported enough information to calculate the C stock in units of g C m2. In cases where C concentrations but not stocks were reported, we used soil depth and bulk density (BD, g cm-3) to calculate the C stock in a given pool (fPOC, oPOC, mSOC). Data were recorded separately for different locations, ecosystem types, treatments, soil depths, and fractions. Because there was a wide range in soil depth increments used within studies, we summed C stocks from specific depth intervals (e.g. 0-10 cm, 10-30 cm) into two categories: topsoil (0-30cm) or subsoil (31+cm). Soil volume associated with each observation was calculated assuming a 1x1 m sampling area and the sampling depth increment reported by the study authors (e.g. 0-10 cm, 15-30 cm). # Land use drives the distribution of free, physically protected, and chemically protected soil organic carbon storage at a global scale [https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.b5mkkwhp0](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.b5mkkwhp0) ### Files and variables #### File: Willard\_GCB\_2024\_processed\_data.csv **Description:** ##### Variables * UniqueObsCodeThreePool:Code to denote each unique datapoint featuring: Study ID, simplified ecosystem, USDA soil order, Treatment name, fractionation type (fLF, oLF, mSOC), and topsoil or subsoil * Study_ID:Author name and published year * Citation:Author name, published year, journal name, and edition information * Year_sampled:Sampled year * Field_or_Lab: Study system * Latitude:Latitude of sampled location * Longitude:Longitude of sampled location * Country:Country of sampled location * Elevation:Sample elevation * Ecosystem_type:Ecosystem of sampled location * Ecosystem_simplified:Simplified ecosystem of sampled location * Crop_or_forest_type_reported:Cropping or forest type of sampled location * Cropland_addition:Nutrient addition of sampled soil * Cropland_addition_N.kg.ha.yr:Inorganic nitrogen addition of sampled soil in units of kg/ha/yr. * Cropland_addition_Manure.Mg.ha.yr:Manure addition of sampled location in units of kg/ha/yr. * Cropland_tillage:Tillage regimen of sampled soil * Soil_order_reported:Reported soil orderincluding USDA and World Reference Base * Soil_order_simplified:USDA simplified soil order * Soil_texture:Reported soil texture * Horizon:Sampled soil horizon * Soil_volume:Calculated soil volume (100cm **100cm** soil depth) * Top_depth:Top soil depth (cm) * bottom_depth:Bottom soil depth (cm) * Soil_pH_reported:Reported soil pH * Treatment:Treatment name * Rotation:Reported cropland rotation information * Fraction_reported:SOC fraction reported in study * Fraction_harmonized:Harmonized fraction name for dataset unification * Floatation_density:Reported density flotationin units of g/cm^3 * Two_pool:Harmonized fraction for two pool sorting (HF and LF) * Three_pool:Harmonized fraction for three pool sorting (fLF, oLF, mSOC; note manuscript uses terms fPOC, oPOC, and mSOC to convey geochemical characteristics) * Method_used_C:Reported methodology used to differentiate SOC fraction * Primary_C_pool:Primary C pool data reported from study: used to calculate data found in C_stock_for_analysis_three_pool.

TI  - Carbon Storage in Amazonian Peatlands: Distribution and Dynamics
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - This proposal aims to make a step change in the precision and accuracy of our knowledge of the distribution of peatlands in the tropics, and to develop a capacity to predict and monitor future changes to the carbon storage function of these peatlands.  Tropical forest ecosystems are important for carbon storage. The densest 'carbon hotspots' occur where peat underlies the vegetation. Peat is an organic soil formed by the accumulation of plant litter, often over thousands of years, usually under waterlogged conditions which limit micro-organism activity and inhibit litter decomposition.   Given that they store so much carbon per unit area, tropical peatlands should be priorities for conservation. Unfortunately, it is not currently known with certainty where peatlands occur. Even using satellite imagery, it is challenging to distinguish forest overlying peat from forest occurring on dry soil. Mapping peat deposits in the field by trial and error is impractical given the large areas of remote terrain involved.   This proposal builds on an extensive record of research into tropical peatlands by the research team. Our group has worked extensively in the Pastaza-Mara&ntilde;&oacute;n Foreland Basin (PMFB) in Peruvian Amazonia. Here, in one of the highest-rainfall regions of Amazonia, the existence of extensive bodies of peat was only revealed by a publication in 2009. Since then, we have undertaken extensive fieldwork and laboratory analyses, and have developed an algorithm that uses remotely-sensed (satellite) data to predict the distribution of vegetation types associated with peat in the PMFB. On this basis we estimate that there is more than 35,000 square km of peat in the PMFB, making it by far the largest known peatland complex in Amazonia.  Our results were used to build the science case for the first ever carbon-conservation project funded by the Green Climate Fund, a major, intergovernmental, UN- and UK-backed climate mitigation project. We now want to develop the science base further to enable similar projects throughout the scheme.  Our first aim is to substantially develop and improve our current method for inferring the distributions of vegetation, peat and carbon from satellite data, by addressing fundamental gaps in our understanding of the controls on these distributions and by testing a set of technical improvements. We will then test how well our model works on floodplains in other parts of Amazonia. Ultimately we want to know how widespread peat is across the whole of Amazonia.  Our second aim is to develop, for the first time, the ability to predict and monitor future changes to tropical peatland carbon stocks. It is already possible to predict carbon accumulation patterns in northern peatlands from climatic and topographic data, and hence to predict how carbon accumulation may change under future climate scenarios (e.g. climatic drying), but a lack of basic data has prevented similar modelling from being attempted in the tropics. Recent advances in fusing modelling and remotely-sensed data are also opening new possibilities for monitoring present-day changes to the carbon cycle.   In order to achieve our second aim, we will study the pattern of peatland carbon storage through the last several thousand years, measure the rates at which litter is added to the peat and removed by decomposition today, and determine how these rates are affected by variations in hydrological regimes. We will use this information to determine, using a process-based model of peat accumulation, the conditions required for peat to accumulate. By doing so we will be able to evaluate and refine two complementary, simpler process-based models of peat distribution and carbon cycling that are suited to prediction and monitoring on a pan-tropical scale.

TI  - Job share Knowledge Exchange Fellowship: Regenerative agriculture for sustainable plantation ecosystems
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Plantation ecosystems underpin the production of a range of commodities including tea and coffee and supports the livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers. However, these ecosystems face a range of challenges, including declining soil fertility and increased soil erosion, and yields that are maintained through high nitrogen fertiliser applications. Across most production areas, climate change is reducing yields and crop quality, impacting farmer livelihoods. Regenerative agriculture (RA) describes a suite of practices designed to deliver beneficial outcomes for agroecosystems, with a focus on improving soil health and soil carbon sequestration, lower agrochemical inputs, and increasing biodiversity. This results in a healthier, more climate resilient ecosystem. For plantation crops, approaches include agroforestry and intercropping, reduced soil disturbance, and the use of organic fertilisers and composts as alternatives to inorganic fertilisers. At present, adoption is low due to limited research on specific techniques for certain crops, and knowledge and financial barriers. However, many techniques have significant similarities across regions and crops, and thus evidence of the benefits and possible trade-offs have the potential to be more widely applied. Adopting such an approach will help accelerate the incorporation of RA into current management practices. In this project, we will focus on the adoption of RA in tea and coffee production in East Africa. We will primarily work in Kenya, as tea and coffee are key regional exports and underpins the livelihoods of over a million smallholder farmers, but production is vulnerable to climate change. In the longer-term, and with the help of our partners and networks, we hope to expand our scope to include further crops and regions. To achieve our aim, this fellowship will facilitate knowledge exchange between researchers, agribusinesses, NGOs and smallholder farmers in tea and coffee ecosystems, building on the relationships and networks already established by the applicants (Dr Nick Girkin and Dr Kenisha Garnett) and Cranfield University. We will adopt a transdisciplinary approach, bringing our diverse background, experience and collective expertise in tropical ecosystem processes, RA, and the social sciences. We will synthesise NERC-remit science on RA's environmental benefits for tea and coffee ecosystems, with evidence of the social and economic impacts of adoption and combine this with new knowledge generated through the sharing of ideas, experience and expertise between researchers, agribusinesses and smallholder famers. We will adopt a co-production approach to our work with smallholders, to generate insights on current sustainable practices, and identify barriers to change, and delivery models. We will use this evidence to create materials to inform discussions with policymakers (e.g. the All-Parliamentary Group on Agroecology for Sustainable Food and Farming), NGOs (e.g. Rainforest Alliance) and businesses (e.g. Ekaterra) around the benefits of RA and means of incentivising adoption. Working collaboratively with our partners and a network of smallholder farmers, we will co-develop a RA toolkit for plantation crops, which can inform practice and promote adoption. A key impact of this fellowship will be the translation of NERC-remit science to improve the sustainability of tea and coffee production, bringing environmental, social and economic benefits to smallholders in the long-term. We will achieve our aim with support from a range of partners including agribusiness (e.g. Ekaterra), NGOs (e.g. Rainforest Alliance) and regional research institutions (e.g. Kenyatta University). We anticipate the knowledge exchange and engagement of stakeholders across our networks can be sustained and that the network will be self-maintaining after the fellowship, to deliver a long-term legacy by increasing the sustainability and climate resilience of plantation ecosystems.
