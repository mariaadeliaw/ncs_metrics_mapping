TI  - Carbon payments as a safeguard for threatened tropical mammals
T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
AB  - One reason for the rapid loss of species-rich tropical forests is the high opportunity costs of forest protection. In Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo), the expansion of high-revenue oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantations currently threatens 3.3 million ha of forest. We estimate that payments for Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD) could offset the costs of stopping this deforestation at carbon prices of US$ 10-33 per tonne of CO2, or $ 2-16 per tonne if forest conservation targets only cost-efficient areas. Forty globally threatened mammals are found within these planned plantations, including the Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) and Borneo pygmy elephant (Elephas maximus borneensis). Cost-efficient areas for emissions reductions also contain higher-than-average numbers of threatened mammals, indicating that there may be synergies between mitigating climate change and conserving biodiversity. While many policy and implementation issues need clarification, our economic assessment suggests that REDD could offer a financially realistic lifeline for Kalimantan's threatened mammals if it is included in future climate agreements.

TI  - The global exposure of species ranges and protected areas to forest management
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
AB  - Aim Many vertebrate species globally are dependent on forests, most of which require active protection to safeguard global biodiversity. Forests, however, are increasingly either being disturbed, planted or managed in the form of timber or food plantations. Because of a lack of spatial data, forest management has commonly been ignored in previous conservation assessments. Location Global. Methods We combine a new global map of forest management types created solely from remote sensing imagery with spatially explicit information on the distribution of forest-associated vertebrate species and protected areas globally. Using Bayesian logistic regressions, we explore whether the amount of forested habitat available to a species as well as information on species-specific threats can explain differences in IUCN extinction risk categories. Results We show that disturbed and human-managed forests dominate the distributional ranges of most forest-associated species. Species considered as non-threatened had on average larger amounts of non-managed forests within their range. A greater amount of planted forests did not decrease the probability of species being threatened by extinction. Even more worrying, protected areas are increasingly being established in areas dominated by disturbed forests. Conclusion Our results imply that species extinction risk and habitat assessments might have been overly optimistic with forest management practices being largely ignored so far. With forest restoration being at the centre of climate and conservation policies in this decade, we caution that policy makers should explicitly consider forest management in global and regional assessments.

TI  - Comparison of water-use characteristics of tropical tree saplings with implications for forest restoration
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Tropical forests are experiencing reduced productivity and will need restoration with suitable species. Knowledge of species-specific responses to changing environments during early stage can help identify the appropriate species for sustainable planting. Hence, we investigated the variability in whole-tree canopy conductance and transpiration (G(t) and E-L) in potted saplings of common urban species in Thailand, viz., Pterocarpus indicus, Lagerstroemia speciosa, and Swietenia macrophylla, across wet and dry seasons in 2017-2018. Using a Bayesian modeling framework, G(t) and E-L were estimated from sap flux density, informed by the soil, atmospheric and tree measurements. Subsequently, we evaluated their variations with changing vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and soil moisture across timescales and season. We found that G(t) and E-L were higher and highly variable in L. speciosa across seasons than S. macrophylla and P. indicus. Our results implied that water-use in these species was sensitive to seasonal VPD. L. speciosa may be suitable under future climate variability, given its higher G(t) and E-L across atmospheric and soil moisture conditions. With their lower G(t) and E-L, P. indicus and S. macrophylla may photosynthesize throughout the year, maintaining their stomatal opening even under high VPD. These findings benefit reforestation and reclamation programs of degraded lands.

TI  - Forest strata-dependent functional evenness explains whole-community aboveground biomass through opposing mechanisms
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - A positive biodiversity - aboveground biomass relationship is often attributed to the niche complementarity hypothesis. This hypothesis has received much less support when based on functional trait diversity and when tested in complex natural forests. Here, we hypothesized that niche complementarity (high trait diversity) in the understorey and niche overlap (low trait diversity) in the overstorey would drive whole-community aboveground biomass. To test this hypothesis, we used multiple linear regression models to evaluate how functional trait diversity (functional richness, evenness, divergence and dispersion) of overstorey, understorey, and whole community determine aboveground biomass across 125 plots in a 5-ha subtropical forest of Eastern China. A structural equation model was used to evaluate whether the functional trait diversity of overstorey affects the relationships between understorey functional trait diversity and whole-community aboveground biomass while considering for the effect of environmental factors. We additionally considered the effects of mass ratio (i.e. community-weighted mean of trait values) and stand structural complexity. The strong negative effect of overstorey functional evenness on aboveground biomass provides support to the functional dominance and/or niche overlap rather than niche complementarity effect. The negative effect of overstorey functional evenness on aboveground biomass was also partially mediated by its direct negative effect on understorey functional evenness. The weak positive effect of understorey functional evenness on aboveground biomass provides support to the niche complementarity effect. We conclude that functional evenness of overstorey and understorey strata affect whole-community aboveground biomass differently through opposing mechanisms, regardless of the effects of mass ratio and stand structural complexity.

TI  - Spatial and temporal analyses of burned areas 1998, 2003 and 2015 in Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve, Chiapas, Mexico
T2  - BOSQUE
AB  - In southeastern Mexico, forest fires threaten the biodiversity in tropical rainforests. The aim of this work was to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of burned areas in Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve and its area of influence over three years: 1998, 2003 and 2015. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and the Burnt Area Index for MODIS (BAIM) were extracted from near-infrared and shortwave-infrared Landsat imagery; their accuracy was validated with ASTER images. As a result, 1,628 polygons of burned areas larger than 10 ha were delimited, covering 86,500 ha and representing 11.2 % of the study area: 7.7 % in 1998, 3.2 % in 2003 and 0.4 % in 2015. Burned areas of under 50 ha are of common occurrence each year, whereas the largest polygons (1,000 - 3,000 ha) are considered exceptional and are present only under the severe influence of El Nino weather phenomenon. The highest proportion of burned areas (54.7 %) affected agricultural lands, followed by secondary vegetation (34 %), tropical forests (7.6 %), temperate forests (2.1 %), savannah (1 %) and tular marshlands (0.6 %). Regarding burned areas, 20 % occurred within the protected area. The decreasing tendency of burned areas confirms their relationship with the intensity of ENSO. Cartographic representation of burned areas is an effective means of evaluating the effects of fire management programs and biodiversity conservation of tropical rainforests in protected areas.

TI  - Costs of Lost opportunities: Applying Non-Market Valuation Techniques to Potential REDD plus Participants in Cameroon
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) has been systematically advanced within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). However, implementing REDD+ in a populated landscape requires information on local costs and acceptability of changed practices. To supply such information, many studies have adopted approaches that explore the opportunity cost of maintaining land as forest rather than converting it to agricultural uses. These approaches typically assume that the costs to the smallholder are borne exclusively through the loss or gain of the production values associated with specific categories of land use. However, evaluating the value of land to smallholders in incomplete and messy institutional and economic contexts entails other considerations, such as varying portfolios of land holdings, tenure arrangements, restricted access to capital, and unreliable food markets. We suggest that contingent valuation (CV) methods may provide a more complete reflection of the viability of REDD+ in multiple-use landscapes than do opportunity cost approaches. The CV approach eliminates the need to assume a homogenous smallholder, and instead assumes heterogeneity around social, economic and institutional contexts. We apply this approach in a southern rural Cameroonian context, through the lens of a hypothetical REDD+ contract. Our findings suggest local costs of REDD+ contracts to be higher and much more variable than opportunity cost estimates.

TI  - Evaluating the Role of Community-Managed Forest in Carbon Sequestration and Climate Change Mitigation of Tripura, India
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB  - Community-based forest management provides an opportunity to build a sustainable link with ecology for meeting future needs. A study was carried out to understand the effect of management strategies on the biodiversity, soil nutrient, and carbon stock of two community forests practiced by Jamatia (JCF) and Halam (HCF) tribes of Tripura, northeast India. The forest managed by Jamatia is community conserved, whereas the Joint Forest Management (JFM) regulation issued by the Government of India was implemented in Halam community-based forest. JCF showed higher tree diversity (2.741) than HCF (2.176), while there was no significant variation in the total number of species in these forests. Anogeissus acuminata, Schima wallichii, and Terminalia bellirica were the most dominant species in JCF and HCF. A relatively higher amount of organic matter, nitrogen, and phosphorus content was found in JCF soils. JCF showed higher carbon stock (342.9 Mg C ha(-1)) than HCF (158.7 Mg C ha(-1)). A positive and significant correlation of SOC concentration was observed with soil moisture, SOM, and soil nutrient content. The results show that both stands were at developmental stages; however, regular extraction of biomass from HCF was attributable to lower carbon stock. We found that the Jamatia communities are proactively involved in the conservation of forests and sustainable management of biodiversity under their control. The results reveal that the agent of management can play a vital role in enhancing tree diversity, soil properties, and carbon stock in community forests.

TI  - Green deserts, but not always: A global synthesis of native woody species regeneration under tropical tree monocultures
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Tree monocultures constitute an increasing fraction of the global tree cover and are the dominant tree-growing strategy of forest landscape restoration commitments. Their advantages to produce timber are well known, but their value for biodiversity is highly controversial and context dependent. Therefore, understanding whether, and in which conditions, they can harbor native species regeneration is crucial. Here, we conducted meta-analyses based on a global survey of the literature and on a database created with local, unpublished studies throughout Brazil to evaluate the regeneration potential of native species under tree monocultures and the way management influences this regeneration. Native woody species regeneration under tree monocultures harbors a substantial fraction of the diversity (on average 40% and 68% in the global and Brazilian surveys, respectively) and abundance (on average 25% and 60% in the global and Brazilian surveys, respectively) of regeneration observed in natural forests. Plantations with longer rotation lengths, composed of native tree species, and located adjacent to forest remnants harbor more species. Pine plantations harbor more native individuals than eucalypt plantations, and the abundance of regenerating trees is higher in sites with higher mean temperatures. Species-area curves revealed that the number of woody species under pine and eucalypt plantations in Brazil is 606 and 598 species, respectively, over an aggregated sampled area of ca. 12 ha. We highlight that the understory of tree monocultures can harbor a considerable diversity of regenerating native species at the landscape and regional scales, but this diversity strongly depends on management. Long-rotation length and favorable location are key factors for woody regeneration success under tropical tree monocultures. Therefore, tree monocultures can play a role in forest landscape restoration and conservation, but only if they are planned and managed for achieving this purpose.
   In this study, we assessed the woody natural regeneration under tree monocultures reported in studies conducted in the tropical region. We found out that native tree monocultures, tree plantations adjacent to forest remnants, and longer rotation lengths harbor more species, while the abundance of regenerating trees is higher in sites with higher mean temperatures. According to our results, tree monocultures can play a role in forest landscape restoration and conservation, but only if they are planned and managed for achieving this purpose.image

TI  - Demographic analysis of Agave angustifolia (Agavaceae) with an emphasis on ecological restoration
T2  - BOTANICAL SCIENCES
AB  - We studied the demography of two populations of Agave angustifolia, one in a preserved tropical dry forest (Xochicalco), and the other one in a pastureland area used for cattle grazing (Tembembe), to test whether populations are likely to thrive on the deteriorated habitats left after cattle ranching. Seed germination and seedling survival experiments were carried out in different natural microsites (i.e. under tree canopies and in open microsites). We built Lefkovitch matrices and carried out prospective (elasticity) and retrospective (Life Table Response Experiments) analyses for both populations. Numerical simulations were performed to project the effect of inflorescences harvest and seedling introduction. Seedling survival and seed germination were highest in Tembembe. Population growth rate was slightly higher in Tembembe (lambda = 1.268) than in Xochicalco (lambda = 1.208). Prospective and retrospective analyses showed that stasis and growth contributed most to population growth rate and that the differences between the two populations were accounted for a lower fecundity and stasis in Xochicalco compared to Tembembe. Simulations of inflorescence harvest showed that lambda dropped below unity only when all inflorescences were eliminated. The simulated introduction of seedlings produced a substantial rise in lambda. As the lambda values reflect thriving populations at both sites, we suggest that this species could be successfully used in restoration programs.

TI  - The forest strata-dependent relationship between biodiversity and aboveground biomass within a subtropical forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The relationships between biodiversity and aboveground biomass in forest ecosystems have been intensively studied in recent decades. Still, the mechanisms that underlie it remain highly debated. We hypothesized that overstorey species diversity and individual tree size variation contribute to aboveground biomass and understorey species diversity through the niche complementarity effect, while weaken the relationship between understorey aboveground biomass and individual tree size variation due to the mixed effects of tree development, biotic interaction and reduced available resources by over storey strata. The integrative relationships of species diversity and tree size variation (variation in diameter at breast height-DBH) with aboveground biomass were analysed at overstorey and understorey strata across 125 plots in a 5-ha subtropical forest in Eastern China. For comparison, we tested these relationships at individual strata (isolation modelling), and whole-community level, by using linear structural equation model while accounting for the effects of soil nutrients. The integrative modelling accounted for 35, 31, 16, 12, 4, and 0% of the variation in understorey aboveground biomass, overstorey aboveground biomass, overstorey DBH variation, overstorey species diversity, understorey species diversity, and understorey DBH variation, respectively. Overstorey DBH variation and species diversity had the positive direct effects on overstorey aboveground biomass. Overstorey species diversity significantly promoted the understorey species diversity, but DBH variation and aboveground biomass of overstorey strata had negligible effects on the diversity and aboveground biomass of understorey strata. Soil nutrients had positive direct effect on overstorey DBH variation, but negative direct effects on overstorey and understorey aboveground biomass and overstorey species diversity. These results provide strong evidence for the niche complementarity effect for driving positive relationships of species diversity and individual tree size variation with aboveground biomass at overstorey strata. The strong and consistent negative effects of soil nutrients on overstorey aboveground biomass and species diversity suggest an important mechanism that high species diversity of overstorey strata with great tree size variation on nutrient-poor soils is crucial for driving high aboveground biomass in subtropical forest ecosystems. In conclusion, this study suggests that no sole and ubiquitous relationship between biodiversity and aboveground biomass exists in a structurally complex forest, but rather that the magnitude and direction of this relationship is greatly dependent on the forest strata where available resources shift substantially. We argue that ecological models for predicting aboveground biomass would be improved by including separate effects of overstorey and understorey diversity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Capacity for Timber Management in Small and Medium Forest Enterprises: A Case Study from the Peruvian Amazon
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
AB  - With the implementation of a new legal framework for more responsible forest management in Peru, private small-medium forest enterprises (SMFEs) have become the most important social actors engaged in commercial forestry in the Peruvian Amazon. Despite the role of SMFEs in contributing to employment and local economic growth, there is little information with respect to their economic performance and capacities. This is a hindrance to efforts aimed at better characterizing this important sector and its influence on the development and conservation of tropical forests. For this study, 29 private SMFEs were surveyed to inventory their capital assets in order to evaluate their capacities to carry out timber management. Results indicate that SMFEs vary greatly in terms of their produced and natural capital assets, and consequently in their forest management capabilities as well. While most SMFEs lack adequate capacity for sustainable forest management, those that had more valuable timber resources and physical infrastructure attained forest certification. SMFE capacities depend greatly on external mechanisms to ensure consistent technical and financial assistance.

TI  - The diversity and abundance of ants in relation to forest disturbance and plantation establishment in southern Cameroon
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Tropical biodiversity is seriously threatened by deforestation but few studies have quantified its impact. We aimed to measure the impact of forest clearance and different methods of establishing Terminalia Norensis (Combretaceae) forest plantations on the abundance, richness and composition of ants. the most abundant group of arthropods in tropical forest canopies, in the Mblamayo Forest Reserve in Cameroon. For canopy ants, we quantified the effects of different methods of plantation establishment by sampling two sets of plots subjected to complete clearance, partial mechanical clearance and partial manual clearance relative to uncleared forest reference plots. For leaf-litter ants, we quantified the impacts of different levels of forest disturbance along a gradient from near primary forest to complete forest clearance.
   2. A total of 97 ant species was recorded from the canopy (from approximately 48 500 individuals), at an average of 213 (+/-45) ants m(-2). Jack-knife estimates of species richness showed that at one site. Bilik. 87% more species occurred in the partial manual clearance plot than the complete clearance plot, with the partial mechanical clearance plot intermediate. At the other site. Ebogo, ant richness did not vary between treatments. Ants were 20 times more abundant in the partial manual clearance plot in Ebogo than the partial manual clearance plot in Bilik, largely due to a numerous Technomyrmex species that might have reduced ant richness on this plot.
   3. Cluster analysis of the similarities in ant species composition between plots, calculated by the Morisita index, showed that site and treatment affected species composition. Neither treatment nor site affected the relative number of species in different nesting categories.
   4. A total of I I I ant species (from 3650 individuals) was recorded from the leaf litter, at an average of 52 (+/-4.6) ants m(-2). Species numbers were greatest in the two partial clearance plots in Ebogo (52-53 species), lowest in the two complete clearance plots (37), and intermediate and most variable in the three uncleared forest plots (40-52). Cluster analysis showed that species composition was not affected by treatment, while neither treatment nor site affected the relative number of ant species in different feeding categories.
   5. Despite some local effects by dominant species, our results support the view that deforestation can reduce arthropod species richness. This study is unique in showing that reforestation methods (using a single tree species) can have a marked effect on arthropod species richness and composition. Specifically, it reveals that ant species richness can be greater in plantations established after partial manual clearance than complete clearance.

TI  - Permanence of avoided deforestation in a Transamazon REDD plus project (Para, Brazil)
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Rigorous impact evaluations of local REDD+ (reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) initiatives have shown some positive outcomes for forests, while well-being impacts have been mixed. However, will REDD+ outcomes persist over time after interventions have ended? Using quasi-experimental methods, we investigated the effects of one REDD+ project in the Brazilian Amazon on deforestation and people's well-being, including intra-community spillover effects (leakage). We then evaluated to what extent outcomes persisted after the project ended (permanence). This project combined Payments for Environmental Services (PES) with sustainable livelihood alternatives to reduce smallholder deforestation. Data came from face-to-face surveys with 113 households (treatment: 52; non-participant from treatment communities: 35; control: 46) in a three-datapoint panel design (2010, 2014 and 2019). Results indicate the REDD+ project conserved an average of 7.8% to 10.3% of forest cover per household and increased the probability of improving enrollees' well-being by 27-44%. We found no evidence for significant intra-community leakage. After the project ended, forest loss rebounded and perceived well-being declined - yet, importantly, past saved forest was not cleared. Therefore, our results confirm what the theory and stylized evidence envisioned for temporal payments on activity-reducing ('set-aside'): forest loss was successfully delayed but not permanently eradicated.

TI  - Space-use patterns of Malay civets (Viverra tangalunga) persisting within a landscape fragmented by oil palm plantations
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB  - Context Agricultural land use is expanding and is a major driver of the biodiversity crisis. Land use planning initiatives seeking to optimize wildlife conservation are hindered by a lack of baseline data quantifying species' tolerance to human-modified landscapes. Objectives We explored the influence of landscape characteristics on the fine-scale space-use patterns of a model generalist carnivore, the Malay civet (Viverra tangalunga), within degraded tropical forests and oil palm plantations. Methods We collected over 20,000 GPS locations from 21 male civets in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo to evaluate the species' space-use patterns and habitat utilization processes. We used movement-based modeling to determine home ranges, and combined the results with high-resolution remotely sensed habitat characteristics. We developed resource utilization functions to determine individual and population-level functional responses to proximity to plantation edge, distance to water, terrain ruggedness, forest structure, and functional diversity. Results Civets foraged within oil palm plantations, yet all animals utilized forests. Home ranges scaled with proportion of plantation within both total and core ranges. Resource utilization functions reported individualism in the species' responses to habitat characteristics. At the population-scale, civets consistently and more intensely used habitats closer to plantation edges and taller tree canopies. Conclusions Although plantations did not pose an inhospitable matrix, oil palm agriculture is a less suitable habitat than remnant forests for civets. Proximity measures and forest structure influenced the spatial behaviors of this adaptable generalist, highlighting the importance of protected areas. We recommend land-sparing and -sharing approaches to facilitate carnivore persistence across oil palm degraded landscapes.

TI  - Bird conservation in extremely small tropical rainforest patches in southwest China
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Tropical forests support high levels of avian diversity but these areas have been impacted by extensive deforestation. The lowland tropical rainforest of Xishuangbanna in southwest China is one such impacted hotspot. In this region, rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations have replaced most of the original forest, but numerous small fragments of forest remain. To assess the value of these fragments to avian diversity, we classified the fifteen selected remnant forest patches into three size categories, <1 ha, 1-3 ha, and 36 ha, and conducted avifauna surveys. We found that 97 bird species inhabit the fragments and that bird diversity increases with patch area. The resident species composition similarity index was low among forest patches, both within and across size categories, and also low between the wet and dry seasons. Ground insectivores, frugivores and large bird species were the most vulnerable to habitat fragmentation. Our study encouragingly shows that fragments can play an important role in bird conservation in regions that now lack large tracts of natural forest; however, current patches are too small to support stable annual populations of some species, while others are more tolerant of fragmentation. We discuss these findings and provide conservation strategies to improve bird conservation within rubber plantations in southern China. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Asymmetric forest transition driven by the interaction of socioeconomic development and environmental heterogeneity in Central America
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Forest transitions (FT) have been observed in many developed countries and more recently in the developing world. However, our knowledge of FT from tropical regions is mostly derived from case studies from within a particular country, making it difficult to generalize findings across larger regions. Here we overcome these difficulties by conducting a recent (2001-2010) satellite-based analysis of trends in forest cover across Central America, stratified by biomes, which we related to socioeconomic variables associated with human development. Results show a net decrease of woody vegetation resulting from 12,201 km(2) of deforestation of moist forests and 6,825 km(2) of regrowth of conifer and dry forests. The Human Development Index was the socioeconomic variable best associated with forest cover change. The least-developed countries, Nicaragua and Guatemala, experienced both rapid deforestation of moist forests and significant recovery of conifer and dry forests. In contrast, the most developed countries, Panama and Costa Rica, had net woody vegetation gain and a more stable forest cover configuration. These results imply a good agreement with FT predictions of forest change in relation to socioeconomic development, but strong asymmetry in rates and directions of change largely dependent upon the biome where change is occurring. The FT model should be refined by incorporating ecological and socioeconomic heterogeneity, particularly in multicountry and regional studies. These asymmetric patterns of forest change should be evaluated when developing strategies for conserving biodiversity and environmental services.

TI  - Traits of the host trees, not community diversity, drive epiphytes abundance in tropical seasonal forests
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - Epiphytes are considered indicators of forest ecological integrity, but the factors that explain their abundance are still not well understood. We here evaluated tree colonization by epiphytes in old-growth monospecific reforestation stands of Astronium urundeuva (M.Allem & atilde;o) Engl. (Anacardiaceae) and Eucalyptus saligna Sm. (Myrtaceae), in comparison to a neighbor seasonal tropical forest fragment under similar environmental conditions. In each forest type, we identified and measured all trees (planted and colonizers) from 5 -cm stem diameter in five 200 m 2 plots and quantified all vascular epiphytes per tree. Tree species were categorized by bark roughness, canopy deciduousness and growth rate. The abundance of epiphytes and the frequency of host trees were higher in the A. urundeuva plantation than in the native forest, with the E. saligna stand in an intermediate position. Also, we found that host traits influenced the abundance of epiphytes in their trunks. Host trees had average stem perimeter and height both higher than non-hosts, which indicates that colonization is more likely to occur in older trees. The average abundance of epiphytes per tree was higher in species with rough bark, but no relationship was found with canopy deciduousness or tree growth rate. We evidenced, therefore, that forest plantations, even if monospecific, can provide habitat for epiphytes. However, at community level, colonization success, either in native or restored forest, depends on the relative abundance of species whose bark type favors epiphytes establishment.

TI  - Long-term stability of sapling dynamics is regulated by soil phosphorus availability in subtropical forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - The abiotic and biotic factors that regulate stability in species-rich forests are poorly resolved, and this limits the ability to predict how climate change and other perturbations impact forest dynamics. Phosphorus limitation and nitrogen deposition are important factors affecting the dynamics and functioning of tropical and subtropical forests, but how long-term temporal stability of tree communities is affected by availability and heterogeneity of soil phosphorus and nitrogen remains unclear.We collected annual dynamic data of 20,768 regenerating saplings, which were censused from 2008 to 2019 in a subtropical forest, to investigate how soil nutrients affect the temporal stability of productivity at both population and community levels.We found that concentrations of soil inorganic phosphorus were significantly and positively correlated with sapling richness and phylogenetic diversity, leading to significantly higher species asynchrony and community temporal stability. By contrast, higher concentrations of organic phosphorus weakened community stability via a negative effect on species richness. Structural equation models provide further strong evidence that increasing concentrations of soil inorganic phosphorus strongly promoted community temporal stability via increased species diversity, species asynchrony and population stability, while organic phosphorus displayed opposite effects. Meanwhile, soil concentrations of available and unavailable forms of nitrogen showed much weaker and negative associations with community stability.Synthesis. Using a 12-year data set of sapling demography from a subtropical forest of south China, our study demonstrates that soil phosphorus is an important determinant of the long-term stability of sapling dynamics and consequently the whole-community structure, and the composition of soil phosphorus pools predicts the temporal stability and diversity of tree communities in phosphorus-limited forests.
   Using a 12-year field monitoring on the demography of over 20,000 individual seedlings in a subtropical forest, this study demonstrates that soil phosphorus availability is an important determinant of the long-term stability of sapling dynamics and consequently the whole-community structure, which highlights the importance of considering different forms of soil nutrients when predicting the temporal stability and diversity of tree communities.image

TI  - Geomorphological landscape features explain floristic patterns in French Guiana rainforest
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Geomorphic landscape features have been suggested as indicators of forest diversity. However, their explanatory power has not yet been explicitly tested at a regional scale in tropical rainforest. We used forest inventories conducted according to a stratified sampling design (3,132 plots in 111 transects at 33 sites) and holistic multi-scale geomorphological mapping derived from a Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model to describe and explain spatial patterns in floristic composition across French Guiana (80,000 km(2)). We measured and identified 123,906 trees with DBH a parts per thousand yen20 cm and used constrained and unconstrained ordinations to analyze variations in the abundance of 221 taxa and 51 families. Variance partitioning and variograms were used to detect spatial patterns in species composition, compare the explanatory power of spatial and environmental factors, and select the variables that best explain forest composition. Strong floristic patterns corresponded to a major latitudinal gradient and significant sub-regional floristic structure. Geomorphological landscapes shaped by historic climate fluctuations and major geological events successfully captured these patterns and explained the variation in abundance of 80 taxa, corresponding to 65 % of the inventoried trees. Our findings suggest that long-term forest dynamics are under substantial "geomorphographic control". A geomorphological perspective on landscapes that incorporates current and past environmental filters and historical biogeographical processes could thus be used more systematically in tropical regions for regional planning and forest conservation.

TI  - Quantifying phyllostomid bats at different taxonomic levels as ecological indicators in a disturbed tropical forest
T2  - ACTA CHIROPTEROLOGICA
AB  - With the aim of quantitatively evaluating the usefulness of phyllostomid bats as ecological indicators, we compared intra-family levels and feeding guilds between tropical old-growth forest and patches of secondary vegetation growing where the land had been used for shifting agriculture. There were significant differences between vegetation types in bat species composition, with the frugivore guild most abundant in secondary vegetation and the animalivore guild most abundant in the old-growth forest. These results are congruent with the findings for other Neotropical zones and appear to be associated with the type of soil management that allows secondary vegetation to grow. Using the Indicator Value method, two subfamilies, five genera and five species were found to have a significant indicator value. However, these numbers only represent a small proportion of the five subfamilies, 20 genera and 28 species recorded, indicating that under the disturbance conditions that characterize the study area, phyllostomid bats were poor ecological indicators. Even so, some species and subfamilies are useful as disturbance detectors.

TI  - HOW TO SELECT POTENTIAL SPECIES FOR ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION OF RAIN FOREST - SOUTHERN BRAZIL
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Monitoring of natural regeneration can provide information on potential species for use in ecological restoration projects, as well as provide indications of the area resilience after degradation. In order to analyze variations of natural regeneration in two successional stages and to subsidize the indication of species for planting and enrichness, two abandoned pastures were sampled in Serra do Itajai National Park (PNSI), Santa Catarina state, Southern Brazil. In the analysis of the main components, the plots differed according to the change in the quantitative variables of the species (Monte Carlo, P <= 0.05), and two groups were segregated: the first one constituted by the vegetation in the initial stage, and the second one, by intermediate stage vegetation. Twenty-one species were sampled and the intermediate stage showed the greatest richness (n = 19). The pioneer species were predominant in both stages, especially Vernonanthura discolor, Piptocarpha regnellii and Myrsine coriacea. The results demonstrate that the initial stage does not have indicator species, because all species occur frequently in the intermediate stage. However, the intermediate stage was distinguished by the presence of eight indicator species, which are potentially recommended for reforestation and enrichment plantations of Montana Ombrophilous Dense Forest in the PNSI.

TI  - Functional identity of overstorey tree height and understorey conservative traits drive aboveground biomass in a subtropical forest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - The niche complementarity hypothesis has received empirical support but species differ in functional strategies for their contribution to ecosystem function, as predicted by the mass ratio hypothesis. Our understanding of how functional identity of conservative and acquisitive strategies of trees predicts aboveground biomass across forest strata (i.e. overstorey and understorey) remains unclear. Aboveground biomass, community-weighted mean (CWM - functional identity) of trait values (6 leaf and 2 stem traits), and soil physicochemical properties were estimated for 125 plots in a 5-ha subtropical forest in Eastern China. We used multiple linear regressions models to relate aboveground biomass to CWM indices at overstorey and understorey strata separately, and whole-community level. We finally employed the structural equation model to test for the effects of overstorey on understorey strata, in addition to the effects of soil physicochemical properties. Forest strata optimal models showed that overstorey strata had high aboveground biomass when they are dominated by functional identity of tree height, whereas high aboveground biomass in understorey strata was driven by functional identity of dense wooded conservative strategy. Whole-community optimal model showed that communities dominated by functional identity of leaf dry matter content and mean leaf area had high aboveground biomass. Aboveground biomass was negatively related to soil nutrients across forest strata and whole-community level. The structural equation model showed that CWM of overstorey tree height did not affect understorey functional identity and aboveground biomass, when soil physicochemical properties were accounted. Soil nutrients had positive effect on functional identity of overstorey tree height whereas negative effect on functional identity of understorey dense-wooded strategy. This study highlights the fundamental roles of forest strata where overstorey and understorey strata contribute to their corresponding aboveground biomass with contrasting functional strategies across a range of soil nutrients. High aboveground biomass was potentially driven by functional identity of tree height through making use of plentiful soil nutrients at overstorey strata, whereas by conservative strategy at understorey strata through enduring nutrient-poor soils. To better understand the roles of functional identity of conservative and acquisitive strategies in driving ecosystem functions, it is worth to analyse forest strata separately.

TI  - Alterations in Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Community Along a Chronosequence of Teak (Tectona grandis) Plantations in Tropical Forests of China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi play a crucial role in promoting plant growth, enhancing plant stress resistance, and sustaining a healthy ecosystem. However, little is known about the mycorrhizal status of teak plantations. Here, we evaluated how the AM fungal communities of rhizosphere soils and roots respond to different stand ages of teak: 22, 35, 45, and 55-year-old from the adjacent native grassland (CK). A high-throughput sequencing method was used to compare the differences in soil and root AM fungal community structures. In combination with soil parameters, mechanisms driving the AM fungal community were revealed by redundancy analysis and the Mantel test. Additionally, spore density and colonization rates were analyzed. With increasing stand age, the AM fungal colonization rates and spore density increased linearly. Catalase activity and ammonium nitrogen content also increased, and soil organic carbon, total phosphorous, acid phosphatase activity, available potassium, and available phosphorus first increased and then decreased. Stand age significantly changed the structure of the AM fungal community but had no significant impact on the diversity of the AM fungal community. However, the diversity of the AM fungal community in soils was statistically higher than that in the roots. In total, nine and seven AM fungal genera were detected in the soil and root samples, respectively. The majority of sequences in soils and roots belonged to Glomus. Age-induced changes in soil properties could largely explain the alterations in the structure of the AM fungal community along a chronosequence, which included total potassium, carbon-nitrogen ratio, ammonium nitrogen, catalase, and acid phosphatase levels in soils and catalase, acid phosphatase, pH, and total potassium levels in roots. Soil nutrient availability and enzyme activity were the main driving factors regulating the shift in the AM fungal community structure along a chronosequence of the teak plantations.

TI  - Plant and bird diversity in rubber agroforests in the lowlands of Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Plant and bird diversity in the Indonesian jungle rubber agroforestry system was compared to that in primary forest and rubber plantations by integrating new and existing data from a lowland rain forest area in Sumatra. Jungle rubber gardens are low-input rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) agroforests that structurally resemble secondary forest and in which wild species are tolerated by the farmer. As primary forests have almost completely disappeared from the lowlands of the Sumatra peneplain, our aim was to assess the contribution of jungle rubber as a land use type to the conservation of plant and bird species, especially those that are associated with the forest interior of primary and old secondary forest. Species-accumulation curves were compiled for terrestrial and epiphytic pteridophytes, trees and birds, and for subsets of 'forest species' of terrestrial pteridophytes and birds. Comparing jungle rubber and primary forest, groups differed in relative species richness patterns. Species richness in jungle rubber was slightly higher (terrestrial pteridophytes), similar (birds) or lower (epiphytic pteridophytes, trees, vascular plants as a whole) than in primary forest. For subsets of 'forest species' of terrestrial pteridophytes and birds, species richness in jungle rubber was lower than in primary forest. For all groups, species richness in jungle rubber was generally higher than in rubber plantations. Although species conservation in jungle rubber is limited by management practices and by a slash-and-burn cycle for replanting of about 40 years, this forest-like land use does support species diversity in an impoverished landscape increasingly dominated by monoculture plantations.

TI  - Stand dynamics, nitrogen accumulation, and symbiotic nitrogen fixation in regenerating stands of Acacia koa
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Recently, abandonment of montane cattle pastures in Hawaii has stimulated interest in forest restoration both for expansion of habitat for native species and for plantation forestry. Acacia koa is one of the most common forest trees in Hawaii, the most abundant native legume, and the most economically valuable native tree; it could be important to restoration efforts in many areas.
   Using an age sequence of even-aged, 6- to 20-yr-old stands of A. koa, we evaluated stand characteristics, N accumulation, and rates of N fixation. Average diameter at breast height (dbh) and height increased linearly during the first 20 yr of tree growth, while stem density, dbh increment. and leaf area index declined. An experimental thinning in the 9-yr-old stand more than doubled dbh increment, suggesting that high tree densities could constrain tree growth. In contrast. N fertilization did not affect dbh increment. Nodule biomass was more than an order of magnitude less in the 20-yr-old stand than in the 6-yr-old stand, which corresponded to a similar decline in estimated input of N via fixation. Neither thinning nor N fertilization affected nodule biomass, but measurements of foliar and root phosphorus (P) suggest that a decline in P availability over time may have contributed to the decline in N fixation. In these stands, large amounts of decomposing litter remaining from stand establishment may have provided much of the N that accumulated in koa biomass. In more degraded sites. N fixation by A. koa may play a relatively more important role in restoration and in soil and ecosystem development.

TI  - Eucalyptus PLANTATION BENEFITS TO PATCH SIZE AND SHAPE OF FORESTED AREAS IN SOUTHEAST ATLANTIC FOREST
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
AB  - The adoption of mixed plantation systems (exotic and native species) is viable and represents an important alternative in the context of forest and landscape restoration. This study evaluated whether Eucalyptus cultivation is associated with changes in native forest cover and fragment connectivity in the region from 1987 to 2017. The study region (Southeast Atlantic Forest) has been undergoing a forest transition process. Based on land use/land cover maps obtained from satellite images and a pair-wise comparison, it was detected that the dynamics in one land cover were not necessarily associated with the other one. It was verified an increase in Eucalyptus cover since 2007, possibly related to the New Forest Code that allows the use of exotic species in reforestation, provided it does not exceed 50% of the total area. An increase in the native vegetation cover was also observed, highlighting the importance of restoration actions and national regulations. In addition, forest patches were larger and less complex with Eucalyptus presence, indicating that this land cover is potentially beneficial for the landscape connectivity.

TI  - Variation of soil fertility and carbon sequestration by planting Hevea brasiliensis in Hainan Island, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB  - The development of rubber industry depends on the sustainable management of rubber plantation. To evaluate the environmental effects of planting Hevea brasiliensis on a subsystem of tropical forest ecosystem, the variation of soil. fertility and carbon sequestration under rubber plantation within 30-year life period were investigated in Hainan Island. Results showed that (1) with the increase of stand age of rubber plantation, soil fertility decreased all along. From 1954 to 1995, soil organic matter, total N, available K and available P decreased by 48.2%, 54.1%, 56.7% and 64.1%, respectively. (2) If the complete return of litters was considered without additional fertilizer application to the soil of the rubber plantations, the consumption periods for P, N, K, Mg were only 825 years, 329 years, 94 years and 65 years, respectively. To improve soil fertility is essential for rubber plantation development. (3) The C sequestration of rubber trees per hectare accounts for 272.08 t within 30-year life period and 57.91% of them was fixed in litters. In comparison with C sequestration by rain forest (234.305 t/hm(2)) and by secondary rain forest (150.203 t/hm(2)), rubber forest has more potentials for C fixation. On the base of above results, the following measures would benefit the maintenance of soil fertility and the development of rubber industry, including applying fertilizer to maintain the balance of soil nutrients, intercropping leguminous plant to improve soil fertility, reducing the collection of litters, optimizing soil properties to improve element P availability such as applying CaCO3. The information gathered from the study can be used as baseline data for the sustainable management of rubber plantation elsewhere.

TI  - Landscape assessment of tree communities in the northern karst region of Puerto Rico
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
AB  - The northern karst of Puerto Rico is a unique formation that contains one of the island's largest remaining forested tracts. The region is under ever-increasing human pressure, but large portions of it are being considered for conservation. Forest classification of the region is at a coarse scale, such that it is considered one vegetation type. We asked whether there were distinct tree assemblages which would necessitate targeted conservation strategies to ensure their protection. We examined tree species and communities across the region at three different major topographic positions along mogotes, or haystack-shaped hills. We found distinct tree communities on hilltops and valleys, with significantly more non-native species in valleys and significantly more endemic species on hilltops and hillsides. At a landscape level, we identified at least four different communities within each topographic position. Two mogote top communities were separated geographically (west and south) within the region, while two others co-occurred in the east-central part of the region. Mogote side and valley communities were less distinct geographically. Temperature, elevation, and precipitation were important variables in separating some communities, suggesting that abiotic stress may play an important role in the distribution of some species. In contrast, the lack of geographic separations of other communities suggested that variables such as soil conditions, land use and biotic interactions such as dispersal limitation may also be important. Conservation planning strategies should target the south, west, and east-central areas that harbor distinct mogote top plant communities to ensure protection of the widest range of tree species and communities in the karst region.

TI  - Mining in the Amazon: Importance, impacts, and challenges to restore degraded ecosystems. Are we on the right way?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Mining is one of the main economic activities in the Amazon region, contributing substantially to the economy of countries that share its territory. This activity, however, brings environmental aftermaths as vegetation suppression, soil destruction, hydrological instability, and faunal displacement, making restoration of degraded ecosystems a challenge. In this sense, the objective of our study was to present the economic importance, the main restoration methods, and the bottlenecks to obtain successful restoration trajectories in degraded areas by industrial mining in the Amazon. We listed eight possible relevant procedures for successful restoration after mining and discussed worldwide adopted restoration methods such as seedling planting, inducing natural regeneration, hydroseeding, and nucleation. Despite the great development of restoration methods after mining, there are still barriers to obtain inputs, which include seedlings, and qualified labor to plan and develop restoration projects. These issues come in addition to operational restrictions, technical incapacity, deficient or inflexible legal basis, and lack of law enforcement. We suggest the selection of key species for planting, associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and biochar, establishment of lists with ecological indicators and reference values, usage of organic waste, and monitoring through unmanned aerial vehicles with high sensors resolution to correct revegetation failures and estimate aboveground biomass and carbon.

T2  - COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ITS APPLICATIONS, ICCSA 2021, PT VII
CP  - 21st International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications (ICCSA)
AB  - Forest canopy gaps caused by natural disturbances represent the primary driver of forest regeneration dynamics, modifying several ecological factors such as the light environment within an ecosystem. Canopy openings constantly change the shape and structure of forests as well as tree species diversity. The analysis of forest canopy gap spatial patterns in old-growth forests can provide helpful information for their conservation. Moreover, it can be an important reference for outlining sustainable forest management to restore and maintain the original biodiversity and accelerate forest succession towards old-growth characteristics. The main goal of this research was to assess a first forest gap size distribution and analyze their spatial pattern in an old-growth beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest in the Pollino National Park (Italy) strict reserve, with no human influence in at least the past 70 years due to its remote location. Using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based canopy height model (CHM), we detected and classified 196 canopy gaps ranging from 10 to 343 m(2). The gap size-frequency reflected a power-law distribution. Using second-order statistics, following the K and L Ripley's function, we found that the canopy gaps were spatially clustered distributed. These preliminary results show the predominance of small-scale disturbances, confirmed by the spatial structure analyses highlighting the single tree nature of these processes influenced by site-specific conditions.

TI  - Brazilian payment for environmental services programs emphasize water-related services
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH
AB  - Based on "user pays" and "provider gets" principles, the Payment for Environmental Services (PES) consists of providing economic incentives or compensation for land users who adopt activities that promote ecosystem services. These PES initiatives have grown rapidly in Brazil over the last few decades, however, studies that address the panorama of these programs in the country are still scarce, regional, or outdated. Here, we investigate the PES overview in Brazil through interviews and an extensive literature review. We found in total 80 PES programs implemented in Brazil, of which 14 were closed. The pro-grams are poorly distributed across the country, mostly concentrated in the Atlantic Forest (56.25%) and Savanna (36.25%) biomes, in Southeastern Brazil. The majority of programs primarily prioritize improving water quality and quantity. Therefore, reforestation, protection of native vegetation, and soil and water conservation are their main proposed practices. The positive impacts of Brazil's PES experi-ences are evident; while the lack of transparency and monitoring, and poor spatial and financial dis-tribution are still major limitations. We conclude that if correctly implemented, PES schemes offer a path to reconcile environmental conservation with agricultural production in Brazil.(c) 2023 International Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation, China Water and Power Press, and China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research.

TI  - Derivation and validation of a pedotransfer function for estimating the bulk density of tropical forest soils
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Bulk density (rho(b)), a soil physical property critical for estimating soil carbon storing potentials, is often under-reported in many tropical soil databases because of the difficulty and tedious nature of its measurement in the field. In this study, a pedotransfer function was developed to estimate the bulk density of topsoils (0-30 cm) of Nimbia Forest Reserve, Nigeria. Easily measured soil variables including sand content, total organic carbon and moisture contents were used as predictor variables. A pedotransfer function (PTF) was derived based on multiple linear regression model. Bulk density values for the forest soils varied from 0.78 to 1.28 g/cm(3) with a mean value of 1.03 g/cm(3). All the metrics used for the validation of the pedotransfer function show the model is statistically significant confirming its usefulness. The RMSE, R-squared and MAE of the pedotransfer function are 0.07498, 0.42231 and 0.058934, respectively. Given that this is the first PTF developed for bulk density estimation in the study area, we recommend a comparison of this new model with others that can be developed using machine learning algorithms and other statistical techniques. The PTF developed in this study will find application in the calculation of the soil organic carbon stocks in the Nimbia Forest Reserve to provide baseline estimates-a decision support tool for sustainable soil management and possible climate change mitigation.

TI  - Diversity and composition of tropical butterflies along an Afromontane agricultural gradient in the Jimma Highlands, Ethiopia
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Afromontane landscapes are typically characterized by a mosaic of smallholder farms and the biodiversity impacts of these practices will vary in accordance to local management and landscape context. Here, we assess how tropical butterfly diversity is maintained across an agricultural landscape in the Jimma Highlands of Ethiopia. We used transect surveys to sample understory butterfly communities within degraded natural forest, semi-managed coffee forest (SMCF), exotic timber plantations, open woodland, croplands and pasture. Surveys were conducted in 29 one-hectare plots and repeated five times between January and June 2013. We found that natural forest supports higher butterfly diversity than all agricultural plots (measured with Hill's numbers). SMCF and timber plantations retain relatively high abundance and diversity, but these metrics drop off sharply in open woodland, cropland and pasture. SMCF and timber plantations share the majority of their species with natural forest and support an equivalent abundance of forest-dependent species, with no increase in widespread species. There was some incongruence in the responses of families and sub-families, notably that Lycaenidae are strongly associated with open woodland and pasture. Adult butterflies clearly utilize forested agricultural practices such as SMCF and timber plantations, but species diversity declines steeply with distance from natural forest suggesting that earlier life-stages may depend on host plants and/or microclimatic conditions that are lost under agricultural management. From a management perspective, the protection of natural forest remains a priority for tropical butterfly conservation, but understanding functioning of the wider landscape mosaic is important as SMCF and timber plantations may act as habitat corridors that facilitate movement between forest fragments.

TI  - Contributions of ethnobiology to the conservation of tropical rivers and streams
T2  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - 1. This study aimed to link basic ethnobiological research on local ecological knowledge (LEK) to the conservation of Brazilian streams, based on two case studies: original data on LEK of fishermen about freshwater fish in the Negro River, Amazon, and previously published data about LEK of farmers on the ecological relationship between forest and streams in the Macabuzinho catchment, Atlantic Forest.
   2. Information was obtained from fishermen through interviews using standard questionnaires containing open-ended questions. Informants for interview were selected either following some defined criteria or applying the 'snowball' method.
   3. Fishermen's LEK about the diets and habitats of 14 fish species in the Negro River provided new biological information on plant species that are eaten by fish, in addition to confirming some ecological patterns from the biological literature, such as dependence of fish on forests as food sources.
   4. In the Atlantic Forest, a comparison between farmers' LEK and a rapid stream assessment in the farmers' properties indicated that farmers tended to overestimate the ecological integrity of their streams. Farmers recognized at least 11 forest attributes that correspond to the scientific concept of ecosystem services. Such information may be useful to promote or enhance dialogue among farmers, scientists and managers.
   5. These results may contribute to the devising of ecosystem management measures in the Negro River, aimed to conserve both rivers and their associated floodplain forests, involving local fishermen. In the Atlantic Forest, we proposed some initiatives, such as to allow direct economic use of their forests to conciliate conflicting perceptions of farmers about ecological benefits versus economic losses from reforestation. Despite their cultural, environmental and geographical differences, the two study cases are complementary and cost-effective and promising approaches to including LEK in the design of ecological research.

TI  - Assessment of Above-Ground Biomass in Pakistan Forest Ecosystem's Carbon Pool: A Review
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Climate change is acknowledged as a global threat to the environment and human well-being. Forest ecosystems are a significant factor in this regard as they act both as a sink and a source of carbon. Forest carbon evaluation has received more attention after the Paris Agreement. Pakistan has 5.1% forest cover of its total land area, which comprises nine forest types. This study covers the studies conducted on above-ground biomass and carbon stock in various forest types of Pakistan. Most of the studies on biomass and carbon stock estimation have been conducted during 2015-2020. The non-destructive method is mostly followed for carbon stock estimation, followed by remote sensing. The destructive method is used only for developing allometric equations and biomass expansion factors. The information available on the carbon stock and biomass of Pakistan forest types is fragmented and sporadic. Coniferous forests are more important in carbon sequestration and can play a vital role in mitigating climate change. Pakistan is a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol and still lacks regional and national level studies on biomass and carbon stock, which are necessary for reporting under the Kyoto Protocol. This study will help researchers and decision-makers to develop policies regarding Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+), conservation, sustainable forest management and enhancement of forest carbon stocks

TI  - The potential of REDD plus for carbon sequestration in tropical forests: Supply curves for carbon storage for Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - We study the potential of tropical multi-age multi-species forests for sequestering carbon in response to financial incentives from REDD+. Following existing carbon crediting schemes, the use of reduced impact logging techniques (RIL) allows a forest manager to apply for carbon credits whereas conventional logging (CL) does not. This paper is the first to develop a Hartman model with selective cutting in this setting that takes additionality of carbon sequestration explicitly into account. We apply the model using data for Kalimantan, Indonesia, for both private and government forest managers. The latter have a lower discount rate and are exempt from taxes. RIL leads to less damages on the residual stand than CL and has lower variable but higher fixed costs. We find that a system of carbon credits through REDD+ can increase carbon stored per hectare by 15.8% if the forest is privately managed and by 22% under government management if the carbon price equals the average 2015 price in the European Union's Emission Trading Scheme. Interestingly, awarding carbon credits to carbon stored in end-use wood products does not increase the amount of carbon stored, nor Land Expectation Value. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Aboveground Spatiotemporal Carbon Storage Model in the Changing Landscape of Jatigede, West Java, Indonesia
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) change is the variable with the maximum influence on carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems, due to a fundamental alteration of the ecosystem, structure, function, and variability over time. Understanding the dynamics of aboveground carbon stocks in underway constructions and urban expansions is crucial to provide a basis for land use management and planning. The objective of this study was to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of aboveground carbon storage and assess how the LULC change is affected by human intervention, as well as how aboveground carbon stocks respond to these changes in the tropical highland landscape of Jatigede. In this study, changes in aboveground carbon stocks were investigated between 2014 and 2021 by using the integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs (InVEST) model. The results revealed that the total aboveground carbon stock decreased between 2014 and 2021. Forests showed the greatest decline in the aboveground carbon stock in terms of space. The primary cause of the reduction in the aboveground carbon stock was the conversion of vegetated land to agricultural and urban land cover. The aboveground carbon stock change was also caused by the continuing construction, which resulted in the extension of construction zones. However, an increase in the aboveground carbon stock was mostly observed in mixed gardens that were close to forest areas. The preservation of mixed gardens as a tree-based agroforestry system can be suggested for enhancing the aboveground carbon stock, as mixed gardens play a significant role in carbon storage in the midst of the increasingly massive deforestation due to the expansion of urban areas.

TI  - The Changes in China's Forests: An Analysis Using the Forest Identity
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Changes in forest carbon stocks are a determinant of the regional carbon budget. In the past several decades, China has experienced a pronounced increase in forest area and density. However, few comprehensive analyses have been conducted. In this study, we employed the Forest Identity concept to evaluate the changing status of China's forests over the past three decades, using national forest inventory data of five periods (1977-1981, 1984-1988, 1989-1993, 1994-1998, and 1999-2003). The results showed that forest area and growing stock density increased by 0.51% and 0.44% annually over the past three decades, while the conversion ratio of forest biomass to growing stock declined by 0.10% annually. These developments resulted in a net annual increase of 0.85% in forest carbon sequestration, which is equivalent to a net biomass carbon uptake of 43.8 Tg per year (1 Tg = 10(12) g). This increase can be attributed to the national reforestation/afforestation programs, environmentally enhanced forest growth and economic development as indicated by the average gross domestic product.

TI  - How effective are perches in promoting bird-mediated seed dispersal for natural forest regeneration? A systematic review protocol
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE
AB  - BackgroundForest landscape restoration (FLR), often through tree planting, is one of the priorities in many global and national initiatives for carbon offsetting as part of climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation. However, active efforts to meet FLR objectives entail substantial costs for the procurement of planting stocks and require an experienced workforce for planting and nurturing tree seedlings. Alternatively, restoration projects can be more cost-effective and potentially may have greater biodiversity gain through assisting and accelerating natural forest regeneration. The use of perches is one of the strategies under Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR) and is used to attract avian seed dispersers to degraded habitats for increased tree seed supply and seedling establishment. This systematic review and potential meta-analysis aim to determine the effectiveness of artificial and natural perches in promoting natural forest regeneration. Specifically, we will evaluate their effectiveness in driving seed richness, seed density, seedling richness, and seedling density. The results will synthesize available evidence on the topic, identify knowledge gaps we need filling to upscale the strategy, and inform their use in concert with other ANR strategies.MethodsThe search strategy was informed through a literature scan and discussions with stakeholders and experts. A total of eight databases, which include an organizational library and a web-based search engine, will be searched using the refined search string in English. The search string was formed using keywords corresponding to the PICO structure of the research question, and its comprehensiveness was evaluated using 10 benchmark articles. The search results will be screened by the review team (composed of a primary and at least two secondary reviewers) using the set eligibility criteria at the title and abstract level, followed by the full-text screening. The screened studies will then undergo critical appraisal using the assessment criteria based on risk of bias and methods. Data from the accepted studies will be extracted to the standard data sheet for meta-analysis. Effect size (Hedges' g) will be computed to determine whether perches are effective in increasing seed dispersal and seedling establishment in degraded sites. The effect of potential modifiers relating to the landscape will be explored via mixed models.

TI  - Edge Effects and Seedling Bank Depletion: The Role Played by the Early Successional Palm Attalea oleifera (Arecaceae) in the Atlantic Forest
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - In this study, we examined the impacts of Attalea oleifera on the structure of seedling bank and discuss potential mechanisms of palm influence. Seed rain, seedling bank, and palm leaf fall were assessed beneath the canopy and in the vicinity of 16 adult palms across the edges of a large fragment (3500 ha) of the Atlantic forest. Moreover, we examined A. oleifera impacts on seed germination and seedling mortality by experimentally submitting seeds and seedlings to prolonged palm-leaf covering. As expected, seedling bank beneath the adults exhibited reduced abundance and species richness at local and habitat scale. Small to large seeds (3.1-30 mm) were underrepresented in the seed rain below adults palms, while experimental leaf covering drastically reduced both seed germination and seedling survivorship. A. oleifera leaf fall occurred over the whole year (3.6 +/- 2.7 leaves/individual/yr), which resulted in deep leaf litter mounds (10.7 +/- 9.2 cm). Finally, adult palm density (21.6 +/- 11.9 individuals/ha) correlated negatively with seedling density across Attalea clusters. Our results suggest that A. oleifera exerts negative effects on the seedling bank by reducing seedling abundance and richness as a consequence of two complementary mechanisms: impoverished and size-biased seed rain plus reduced seed germination and increased seedling mortality due to prolonged covering by fallen leaves.

TI  - Soil quality assessment of constructed Technosols: Towards the validation of a promising strategy for land reclamation, waste management and the recovery of soil functions
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Mine reclamation has long relied on reusing topsoil to mitigate mining impacts but recently constructed soils (i. e., Technosols) have emerged as novel technologies for restoring post mining landscapes. However, their success depends on their ability to sustain soil functions. To assess the efficiency of a limestone mine reclamation, we measured the soil quality (SQ) of a three(SC3) and seven-year-old (SC7) Technosol under sugarcane, and one 20-year-old (P20) Technosol under pasture, constructed with limestone spoil in southeastern Brazil. Soil chemical, physical, and biological attributes were evaluated and compared with those of an adjacent natural soil (NS; Rhodic Lixisol). We also tested the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) for assessing the SQ of the studied soils. SMAF was suitable to detect SQ changes over the years of reclamation. After three and seven years under sugarcane cultivation, the Technosols showed similar SQ indexes (= 0.70 and 0.67) to that of the native soil (SQ = 0.69), whereas after 20 years under pasture the SQ (= 0.88) of P20 was superior to that of NS. Overall, the Technosols recovered most of the ecosystem services expected for healthy soils, especially in P20, where carbon stocks were 2.7 times higher than in NS (82.1 vs 30.35 Mg C ha(-1)). We highlight the importance of using soil quality assessment tools, such as SMAF, in mine reclamation. In summary, Technosols from limestone wastes could restore basic soil functions under tropical environmental conditions within only 20 years.

TI  - Assessment of land use dynamics and vulnerability to land degradation in coal-mined landscapes of central India: implications for ecorestoration strategies
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Introduction: Anthropogenic disturbances resulting from extensive mining activities in tropical regions pose significant threats to native land use, leading to deforestation, biodiversity loss, climate change impacts, environmental degradation, health risks, landscape fragmentation, compromised ecological security, and societal wellbeing. Monitoring Land Use and Land Cover Change (LULCC) becomes imperative for evaluating the extent and nature of land degradation in mined areas.Methods: This study examined and compared land cover change patterns across three coalmined sites: Sohagpur (Site-I), Jamuna & Kotma (Site-II), Bishrampur (Site-III) in Central India over 3 decades using Landsat satellite imagery from 1994, 2007, and 2022. The Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithm, within a supervised classification framework, was applied to discern mining impacts on decadal land use shifts.Results and discussion: The analysis revealed that 7.32%-17.61% of forest cover, 5.0%-10% of water bodies, and 3%-5% of agricultural lands were lost due to mining activities, with Site three and Site two experiencing greater losses compared to Site 1. Overall, native land cover diminished by 35% between 1994 and 2022. Indices including Soil Index, Climate Index, Terrain Index, Land Utilization Index, and Vegetation Index were derived to assess land degradation patterns. These indices were integrated using a weighted index model in ArcGIS to generate the Land Degradation Vulnerability Index (LDVI). Vulnerability notably escalated with mining expansion, particularly pronounced at Site 3 (Bishrampur) and lower at Site 1 (Sohagpur). The "extremely vulnerable" class encompassed a substantial area (25%-40%), while the "low vulnerable" class was less than 5% across all sites. This study's comprehensive analysis aids policymakers, planners, and managers in prioritizing targeted interventions and implementing sustainable land management 175 practices for ecorestoration, aligning with the goal of Zero Net Land Degradation 176 (ZNLD) in coal-mined landscapes.

TI  - OPTIONS FOR MITIGATING GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS IN VENEZUELA FOREST SECTOR - A GENERAL OVERVIEW
T2  - INTERCIENCIA
AB  - The objective of this paper is to analyze alternatives within the forest sector for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing carbon sinks in Venezuela. Forest clearing represents a major source of carbon emissions in the country, accounting for more than 40% of carbon dioxide and 33% of carbon monoxide emissions.
   The first section of the paper provides a general description of the forest resources and the forest sector in Venezuela and a brief summary of the estimated greenhouse gas emissions associated with forest clearing. The second section presents a detailed analysis of two case studies based on ongoing forest projects, an industrial plantation and a managed protected area. Our analysis assesses the value of these two projects as mitigation options. The third section provides an overview of Venezuela's potential for conserving and sequestering carbon based on technically available land where several options could be implemented The results of the case studies are used here to provide a very rough estimate of the carbon sequestration potential at a national level, based on native forest management, plantations, agroforestry, and forestry protection. Our preliminary results indicate that forest management and forest protection might be the most promising mitigation options for Venezuela. However, given the broad scope of the study and the data uncertainties, the results of our analysis should be viewed as a first attempt to evaluate the carbon benefits derived from the adoption of such measures.

TI  - Carbon storage and sequestration in Southeast Asian urban clusters under future land cover change scenarios (2015-2050)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Land-use land-cover (LULC) changes are occurring rapidly in Southeast Asia (SEA), generally associated with population growth, economic development and competing demands for land. Land cover change is one of the vital factors affecting carbon dynamics and emissions. SEA is an important region to study urban-caused LULC emissions and the potential for nature-based solutions (NBS) and nature climate solutions (NCS), as it is home to nearly 15% of the world's tropical forests and has some of the world's fastest rates of urban growth. We present a fine-scale urban cluster level assessment for SEA of current (2015) and future (2050) scenarios for carbon sequestration service and climate mitigation potential. We identified 956 urban clusters distributed across 11 countries of SEA. Considering the urban expansion projected and decline in forests, this region could see a carbon loss of up to 0.11 Gigatonnes (Scenario SSP4 RCP 3.4). Comparing carbon change values to urban emissions, we found that the average offset value ranging from -2% (Scenario SSP1 RCP 2.6) to -21%. We also found that a few medium and large urban clusters could add to more than double the existing carbon emissions in 2050 in the SSP3 and SSP4 RCP 3.4 scenarios, while a minority of clusters could offset their emissions under SSP1. Our study confirms that NCS, and particularly reforestation, are in many cases able to offset the direct emissions from land cover conversion from SEA urban clusters. Hence, documenting the plausible LULC transitions and the associated impacts gains significance in the SEA region as the results can be useful for informing policy and sustainable land management.

TI  - Expert review of the science underlying nature-based climate solutions
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
AB  - Viable nature-based climate solutions (NbCS) are needed to achieve climate goals expressed in international agreements like the Paris Accord. Many NbCS pathways have strong scientific foundations and can deliver meaningful climate benefits but effective mitigation is undermined by pathways with less scientific certainty. Here we couple an extensive literature review with an expert elicitation on 43 pathways and find that at present the most used pathways, such as tropical forest conservation, have a solid scientific basis for mitigation. However, the experts suggested that some pathways, many with carbon credit eligibility and market activity, remain uncertain in terms of their climate mitigation efficacy. Sources of uncertainty include incomplete GHG measurement and accounting. We recommend focusing on resolving those uncertainties before broadly scaling implementation of those pathways in quantitative emission or sequestration mitigation plans. If appropriate, those pathways should be supported for their cobenefits, such as biodiversity and food security.
   Nature-based climate solutions are widely incorporated into climate change mitigation plans and need firm scientific foundations. Through literature review and expert elicitation, this analysis shows that for some major pathways there is strong support, while for others their efficacy remains uncertain.

TI  - Geometrid Moth Species Richness, Distribution and Community Composition in Different Forest Types of Papua New Guinea
T2  - CASE STUDIES IN THE ENVIRONMENT
AB  - As the major group of herbivorous insects, moths are highly significant in natural ecosystems. In collaboration with the Papua New Guinea (PNG) multipurpose National Forest Inventory (NFI) survey, this study investigates the species richness, distribution and community composition of Geometrid moths (Lepidoptera) in PNG's tropical forests and analyses environmental drivers of the geometrid community structure. By providing a baseline assessment of an important order of insects that can serve as an indicator for broader biodiversity, this study informs how biodiversity assessments can be better integrated into the planning of forest conservation initiatives, particularly those related to REDD+ and forest carbon offset developments. The research was conducted over 3 years at 38 NFI clusters throughout six provinces: Eastern Highlands, Western Highlands, Morobe, Madang and West New Britain and Central Province. Moths were collected from dusk to before midnight (18:00 h to 22:00 h) using a manual light trapping method for four nights per site, with a total of 152 light trap samples. Results included a total of 11,830 specimens from 1,108 morphological species from lowland and montane forests in disturbed (degraded and/or logged) and primary forests. Elevation and forest disturbance are the main variables that influence the distribution of species. Species richness was low in montane undisturbed forests compared with lowland (disturbed and primary) forests and montane disturbed forests. Species similarity between light trap samples tends to decrease as elevation increases. Geometrid moth species were arranged into two main orders of community composition according to the forest types: montane (disturbed and/or primary) forests species and lowland (disturbed and/or primary forest) species as per the samples.

TI  - The legitimacy of incentive-based conservation and a critical account of social safeguards
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB  - Incentive-based conservation has become a significant part of how tropical forests are being governed. Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) is a mechanism to mitigate climate change that many countries have started to implement. REDD+, however, is criticized for its potential negative impacts on local populations and Indigenous people. To prevent and mitigate the negative impacts, safeguards are increasingly being used to prevent and shift the focus toward 'non-carbon' elements of forest conservation. We discuss the legitimacy of these types of projects from a stakeholder perspective. Using a normative framework, we assess the Ecuadorian Socio Bosque conservation program, concentrating more specifically on the level of input and output legitimacy. Results show that Socio Bosque in its current form has shortcomings in both input and output legitimacy. We argue that an encompassing conception of legitimacy, including input and output criteria, particularly from a local stakeholder perspective, is essential for the future success of incentive-based conservation and particularly for REDD+ projects.

TI  - Secondary forest buffers the effects of fragmentation on aerial insectivorous bat species following 30 years of passive forest restoration
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Passive forest restoration can buffer the effects of habitat loss on biodiversity. We acoustically surveyed aerial insectivorous bats in a whole-ecosystem fragmentation experiment in the Brazilian Amazon over a 2-year period, across 33 sites, comprising continuous old-growth forest, remnant fragments, and regenerating secondary forest matrix. We analyzed the activity of 10 species/sonotypes to investigate occupancy across habitat types and responses to fragment size and interior-edge-matrix (IEM) disturbance gradients. Employing a multiscale approach, we investigated guild (edge foragers, forest specialists, flexible forest foragers, and open space specialists) and species-level responses to vegetation structure and forest cover, edge, and patch density across six spatial scales (0.5-3 km). We found species-specific habitat occupancy patterns and nuanced responses to fragment size and the IEM disturbance gradient. For example, Furipterus horrens had lower activity in secondary forest sites and the interior and edge of the smallest fragments (1 and 10 ha) compared to continuous forest, and only two species (Pteronotus spp.) showed no habitat preference and no significant responses across the IEM and fragment size gradients. Only the Molossus sonotype responded negatively to vegetation structure. We uncovered no negative influence of forest cover or edge density at guild or species-level. Our results indicate that reforestation can buffer the negative effects of fragmentation and although these effects can still be detected in some species, generally aerial insectivorous bats appear to be in recovery after 30 years of passive forest restoration. Our findings reinforce the need to protect regenerating forests while conserving vast expanses of old-growth forest.

TI  - Carbon stocks of above- and belowground tree biomass in Kibate Forest around Wonchi Crater Lake, Central Highland of Ethiopia
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Forests play an important role in the global carbon (C) balance, but their biomass has decreased globally mainly because of deforestation and a reduction in forest cover. However, little is known about the C stock of tree biomass related to environmental factors in the remnant forest patches. Thus, the present study aimed at assessing the status of C stocks of tree biomass using an allometric equation in Kibate Forest (Ethiopia). Sixty-six plots (30x30 m) were laid out at 100 m interval distance along the altitudinal gradients in five transects. The results revealed that the highest C stocks (67.4%) per species were contributed by Juniperus procera, Ilex mitis var. mitis, Nuxia congesta, and Olea europaea subsp. cuspidata. The mean total tree biomass was 91.9 +/- 10.01 Mg ha(-1). The mean total C stock was 45.9 +/- 5.17 Mg ha(-1), out of which 38.3 +/- 4.31 and 7.7 +/- 0.91 Mg ha(-1) were stored in above- and belowground C pools, respectively. Anthropogenic factors were negatively associated with the C-stock distribution in the study area. Thus, the status of the C stock of tree biomass related to anthropogenic factors indicates that sustainable forest management practice is needed in the study area to conserve biodiversity and mitigate climate change.

TI  - Sources of anthropogenic fire ignitions on the peat-swamp landscape in Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - Fire disturbance in many tropical forests, including peat swamps, has become more frequent and extensive in recent decades. These fires compromise a variety of ecosystem services, among which mitigating global climate change through carbon storage is particularly important for peat swamps. Indonesia holds the largest amount of tropical peat carbon globally, and mean annual CO2 emissions from decomposition of deforested and drained peatlands and associated fires in Southeast Asia have been estimated at, similar to 2000 Mt y-1. A key component to understanding and therefore managing fire in the region is identifying the land use/land cover classes associated with fire ignitions. We assess the oft-asserted claim that escaped fires from oil palm concessions and smallholder farms near settlements are the primary sources of fire in a peat-swamp forest area in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, equivalent to around a third of Kalimantan's total peat area. We use the MODIS Active Fire product from 2000 to 2010 to evaluate the fire origin and spread on the land use/land cover classes of legal, industrial oil palm concessions (the only type of legal concession in the study area), non-forest, and forest, as well as in relation to settlement proximity. We find that most fires (68-71%) originate in non-forest, compared to oil palm concessions (17%-19%), and relatively few (6-9%) are within 5 km of settlements. Moreover, most fires started within oil palm concessions and in close proximity to settlements stay within those boundaries (90% and 88%, respectively), and fires that do escape constitute only a small proportion of all fires on the landscape (2% and 1%, respectively). Similarly, a small proportion of fire detections in forest originate from oil palm concessions (2%) and within close proximity to settlements (2%). However, fire ignition density in oil palm (0.055 ignitions km(-2)) is comparable to that in non-forest (0.060 km-2 ignitions km(-2)), which is approximately ten times that in forest (0.006 ignitions km(-2)). Ignition density within 5 km of settlements is the highest at 0.125 ignitions km(-2). Furthermore, increased anthropogenic activity in close proximity to oil palm concessions and settlements produces a detectable pattern of fire activity. The number of ignitions decreases exponentially with distance from concessions; the number of ignitions initially increases with distance from settlements, and, around from 7.2 km, then decreases with distance from settlements. These results refute the claim that most fires originate in oil palm concessions, and that fires escaping from oil palm concessions and settlements constitute a major proportion of fires in this study region. However, there is a potential for these land use types to contribute substantially to the fire landscape if their area expands. Effective fire management in this area should therefore target not just oil palm concessions, but also non-forested, degraded areas where ignitions and fires escaping into forest are most likely to occur.

TI  - Forest protection and permanence of reduced emissions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Tropical forests are essential for climate change mitigation. With growing interest over the use of credits from reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) and other natural climate solutions within both voluntary and compliance carbon markets, key concerns about the long-term durability of the reductions, or their permanence, arise for countries, corporations, regulators, and policy makers. This paper seeks to analyze the longevity of emissions reductions from different policies to slow down and stop deforestation. To establish conditions of permanence, we conduct numerical analyses using a model based on a cellular automata algorithm that learns from historical deforestation patterns and other spatial features in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. First, we simulate increased law enforcement to curb deforestation at a jurisdictional scale from 2025 to 2034, followed by potential policy rollbacks from 2035 to 2050. Second, we consider alternative scenarios to avoid potentially legal deforestation coupled with reforestation. We find spatial and path dependence - a successful policy intervention may permanently change the deforestation trajectory even after potential policy reversals. Hence, permanence depends both on the probability of policy reversals and the risk of emissions overshooting. Our results are important for advancing the understanding around the unsettled debate on the permanence of avoided emissions. Further, this paper argues that as policies to prevent deforestation or reduce emissions otherwise are reversible, permanence should be understood and discussed in a probabilistic and time-dependent framework.

TI  - Effects of climate and land cover changes on water availability in a Brazilian Cerrado basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
AB  - The effects of riparian restoration and soil and water conservation practices on catchment hydrology are still unclear. Here, we assess whether a positive change in soil and water conservation practices and riparian reforestation will affect the water availability and boost resilience in a Brazilian Cerrado basin under climate change scenarios. This study was developed in the Tres Marias basin (50.600 km(2)) located in southeastern Brazil. First, we calibrated (1992-2005) and evaluated (2006-2012) the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Then, we created a land cover and land use change (LCLUC) scenario that considers improving soil and water conservation practices and the reforestation of riparian zones, following the recommendations of the Brazilian Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES). We also used the trend SSP2-4.5 and the fossilbased economy SSP5-8.5 (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) climate scenarios data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) project for the period of 2015-2100. Along with a decrease of 5 %-15 % in precipitation in the projected period, an increase of 7 %-15 % in forest areas due to the LCLUC scenarios generated an increase in evapotranspiration values up to 38 %, resulting in a decrease of surface runoff and baseflow. Riparian reforestation and soil and water conservation practices did not necessarily enhance water availability on the simulations performed, as expected by many PES.

TI  - Patterns of forest community diversity, regeneration potential and carbon storages along an altitudinal gradient in Eastern Himalaya, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
AB  - This study showed changing patterns in the plant species composition, diversity, and carbon storage potential of different forests along altitudinal gradients (i.e. 100 - 1900 m) in Eastern Himalayan India. Different tree, shrub and herb species were sampled along the altitudinal gradients ranging from tropical to temperate forests through Nested Plot design. In each forest, vegetation sampling was made by establishing a permanent plot of 250 m x 250 m as per ISRO-GBP/NCP-VCP protocol. Individuals of trees >= 10 cm girth at breast height (GBH), shrubs and herbs were recorded in 4, 8 and 16 subplots of 31.62 m x 31.62 m, 5 m x 5 m and 1 m x 1 m, respectively. Community attributes such as species richness, density, basal area, diversity indices and biomass and carbon storages were computed for each study site. A total of 5 forest communities (2 each from tropical and subtropical and one from temperate forest) were identified. The woody species diversity was highest in the subtropical forest followed by tropical and temperate forest. Altitude played an important role in the Eastern Himalayan Mountains in the establishment and distribution of forest community. Forest community composition changes with elevation, for instance, the dominant communities like Dipterocarpus retusus-Phoebe goalparensis-Schima wallichii (D-PS), Gmelina arborea-Schima wallichii-Duabanga grandiflora (G-S-D), Schima wallichii-Duabanga grandiflora-Alstonia scholaris (S-D-A), Alstonia scholaris-Terminalia myriocarpa-Bischofia javanica (A-T-B) and Acer thomsonii-Rhodendron arboreum-Quercus lamellose (A-R-Q) were present at elevational ranges of 100-300 m, 300-700 m, 700-1100 m, 1100-1500 m and 1500-1900 m, respectively. The study showed that about 41-57% of the tree species exhibited good regeneration followed by 23-30% as fair, 6-16% as poor, and 6-21% species did not show regeneration along the altitudinal gradient. The total biomass carbon (Mg C ha-1) varied from 84.74 to 163.56 in tropical, 103.12 - 156.41 in subtropical and 133.05 in temperate forest. In conclusion, community composition, regeneration pattern and biomass carbon storage changes along altitude because of altered biophysical characteristics. However, despite variations in elevation, factors for forest disturbance at different altitudes significantly contributed to the community attributes and overall accumulation of biomass carbon. Hence, the traditional management practices carried out by local communities also play a crucial role in shaping the structure, composition, and carbon dynamics of forest ecosystems. Understanding the impacts of these practices is essential for promoting sustainable forest management by conserving forests and preserving carbon stocks for mitigating climate change in future. This study emphasizes the importance of long-term forest monitoring to promote biodiversity conservation and formulate conservation strategies that support sustainable forest management policies to which ensure continuous provision of ecosystem services in the region.

TI  - Assessment of major pools and fluxes of carbon in Indian forests
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB  - The major pools including phytomass, soil, litter, and fluxes of carbon (C) due to litterfall and landuse changes were estimated for Indian forests. Based on growing stock-volume approach at the state and district levels, the Indian forest phytomass was estimated in the range of 3.8-4.3 PgC. The total soil organic pool in the top 1m depth was estimated as 6.8 PgC, using estimated soil organic carbon densities and Remote Sensing (RS) based area by forest types. Based on 122 published Indian studies and RS-based forest area, the total litterfall carbon flux was estimated as 208.8 MgC ha(-1) yr(-1). The cumulative net carbon flux (1880-1996) from Indian forests (1880-1996) due to landuse changes (deforestation, afforestation and phytomass degradation) was estimated as 5.4 PgC, using a simple book-keeping approach. The mean annual net C flux due to landuse changes during 1985 1996 was estimated as 9.0 TgC yr(-1). For the recent period, the Indian forests are nationally a small source with some regions acting as small sinks of carbon as well. The improved quantification of pools and fluxes related to forest carbon cycle is important for understanding the contribution of Indian forests to net carbon emissions as well as their potential for carbon sequestration in the context of the Kyoto protocol.

TI  - Effects of wildfire on vegetation and understory avian communities in montane rainforests, north-eastern Tanzania
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - The Eastern Arc Mountains are part of the Eastern Afromontane global biodiversity hotspot with a remarkable concentration of endemic species. Wildfire is among the major threats to biodiversity of forested mountains. This study assessed the effect of forest fire on the vegetation and understory birds in the Magamba montane forest, 5 years post a major fire outbreak. Mist-net transects were used to sample understory birds. During the breeding season, active bird nests were searched using the time-constrained method in both burnt and unburnt forests. Vegetation plots were sampled along the mist-net transects, and shrubs and trees were identified and counted. The diversity of trees and shrubs, tree density per plot and canopy cover were significantly higher at unburnt than burnt sites with no difference in shrub density per plot. Bird species composition and number of nests between burnt and unburnt forests differed significantly with a considerable decline of forest interior bird specialists in burnt areas. An invasive plant species, Acacia melanoxylon, was found in dense groves within burnt sites and if not controlled, would escalate the fire regimes to further affecting plants and avian communities. Fire management, restoration and rehabilitation of burnt areas are among the immediate recommended actions.

TI  - Impact of agroecological management on plant diversity and soil-based ecosystem services in pasture and coffee systems in the Atlantic forest of Brazil
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The development of agroecosystems that can provide multiple ecosystem services with a reduced need of external inputs, requires management practices that foster ecological processes to enhance soil quality and crop productivity. We assessed the direct and indirect impacts of farmers' management practices on plant diversity, soil quality and crop productivity in coffee and pasture fields belonging to different types of farms: agroecological, conventional, and large-scale. The study was carried out in twelve farms in the Zona da Mata, Brazil. For each of the total of 24 fields (twelve pastures and twelve coffee) we recorded 41 variables associated with management practices, indicators of plant diversity (taxonomical, structural and functional diversity) and soil quality (biological, chemical and physical properties). The direct and indirect effects of management on plant diversity, soil quality and in the case of coffee, crop productivity, were assessed using structural equation models. In the case of pastures, we found that increased plant diversity due to agroecological management resulted in higher soil quality, probably due to higher soil litter cover and plant structural heterogeneity. Yet, practices presented in the agroecological farms also had a direct negative effect on soil quality, which indicates that increased plant diversity in pastures needs to be combined with other agroecological management practices than currently adopted. In the case of coffee, we show that despite the higher weeding intensity and higher use of external inputs in large-scale and conventional coffee farming systems, these practices did not result in increased soil quality or coffee productivity as compared to agroecological systems. In contrast, agroecological coffee management was associated with increased plant diversity, which, in turn, was positively associated with soil microbial biomass carbon. Our results highlight a causal pathway of agroecological management leading to increased plant diversity and, in turn, maintenance or increase in soil quality. While no causal link between agroecological coffee management and coffee productivity could be demonstrated, the biodiversity-mediated pathway resulted in similar coffee productivity in agroecological farms as compared to conventionally managed farms, which relied on pesticides and higher inputs of chemical fertilizers. We conclude that agroecological practices can be efficient to maintain satisfactory crop yields and soil fertility without the need of intensive use of external inputs and weeding.

TI  - Balancing the Principle of Permanent Sovereign over Natural Resources and Sustainable Forest Management: Indonesian Experiences
T2  - JOURNAL OF EAST ASIA AND INTERNATIONAL LAW
AB  - Most scholars argue that the principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources (PSNR) has been used by developing countries as a legal basis to exploit their natural resources, including forests, for the sake of economic development. Land conversion and forest burning are the primary causes of forest degradation and deforestation in Indonesia. Thus, the biodiversity of Indonesian tropical forests is decreasing tremendously. This article aims to comprehensively analyze the experiences of the Indonesian government to balance the principle of PSNR and sustainable forest management (SFM). The paper argues that the implementation of the PSNR principle in SFM faces many challenges, such as deforestation, forest degradation, and the failures in implementing laws, as well as weak law enforcement. Therefore, to balance the PSNR principle with SFM, the Indonesian government needs to undertake various efforts, such as strengthening law enforcement, carrying out social forest management, and exercising mandatory forest certification. Moreover, all these efforts need to be further improved.

TI  - Intra-specific patterns of δ<SUP>13</SUP>C, growth and wood density variation at sites of contrasting precipitation with implications for modelling carbon sequestration of tropical tree species
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Tropical agroforestry practices play a crucial role in mitigating global climate change by absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and storing carbon in their biomass. Assessing the effects of water stress on carbon sequestration as well as uncertainties in measurement, are important for implementing the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) programs and carbon trading. This study aims to understand how precipitation influences carbon sequestration of Tectona grandis, Acacia mangium and Eucalyptus camaldulensis growing in agroforestry (woodlot) plantations in Bangladesh. Wood cores were collected at two different sites with contrasting (low vs high) annual precipitation and analysed for radial growth, carbon isotope abundance (delta C-13) of cellulose and wood density. Site- and species-specific variation in delta C-13 was observed with higher values (less negative) detected at the low precipitation site. Trees at the low precipitation site showed lower growth rate and higher wood (basic) density compared to the trees at high precipitation site. Trees at the low precipitation site also showed significantly lower carbon sequestration rate (CSR) than those of the high precipitation site. delta C-13 reflects site- and species-specific water stress conditions. This study characterises intra- and inter-specific CSR variations in contrasting sites and confirms the importance of considering site-specific radial variation of wood density to render more accurate accounting of carbon sequestration and storage in tropical forests.

TI  - Quantifying uncertainty about forest recovery 32-years after selective logging in Suriname
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The inclusion of managed tropical forests in climate change mitigation has made it important to find the sustainable sweet-spot for timber production, carbon retention, and the quick recovery of both. Here we focus on recovery of aboveground carbon and timber stocks over the first 32 years after selective logging with the CELOS Harvest System in Suriname. Our data are from twelve 1-ha permanent sample plots in which growth, survival, and recruitment of trees >= 15 cm diameter were monitored between 1978 and 2012. We evaluate plot-level changes in basal area, stem density, aboveground carbon, and timber stock in response to average timber harvests of 15, 23, and 46 m(3) ha(-1). We use a linear mixed-effects model in a Bayesian framework to quantify recovery time for aboveground carbon and timber stock, as well as annualized increments for both. Our statistical models accounted for the uncertainty associated with the height and biomass allometries used to estimate aboveground carbon and Increased precision of annualized aboveground carbon increments by including data from forty-one plots located elsewhere on the Guiana Shield. The probabilities of aboveground carbon recovery to pre-logging levels 32 years after harvests of 15, 23 and 46 m(3) ha(-1) were 45%, 40%, and 24%, respectively. Net aboveground carbon increment for logged forests across all harvest intensities was 0.64 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), more than twice the rate observed in unlogged forests (0.26 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)). The probabilities of timber stock recovery at the end of the 32-year period were highest after harvest intensities of 15 and 23 m(3) ha(-1) (with 80% probability) and lowest after the harvest of 46 m(3) ha(-1) (with 70% probability). Timber stock recovery across all harvest intensities was driven primarily by residual tree growth. Application of the legal cutting limit of 25 m(3) ha(-1) will require more than 70 and 40 years to recover aboveground carbon and timber stocks, respectively, with 90% probability. Based on the low recruitment rates of the twelve species harvested, the 25 year cutting cycle currently implemented in Suriname is too short for long-term timber stock sustainability. We highlight the value of propagating uncertainty from individual tree measurements to statistical predictions of carbon stock recovery. Ultimately, our study reveals the trade-offs that must be made between timber and carbon services as well as the opportunity to use carbon payments to enable longer cutting rotations to capture carbon from forest regrowth.

TI  - The Dilemma of Maintaining Intact Forest Through Certification
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Intact forests are natural and often extensive forests free from apparent anthropogenic degradation. Intact forests have important intrinsic and societal values, making their protection a high conservation priority. They are, however, vulnerable to being lost and degraded due to high opportunity costs and a lack of positive incentives to their preservation. Market-based mechanisms, such as voluntary certification, might provide a means to conserve intact forests while maintaining income through sustainable forest uses. Yet possibilities to ensure strict protection of large areas of intact forests through certification remain limited as long as premiums from certification are bound to the units of forest products that are sold. We explore challenges for incorporating intact forests into certification processes, and of maintaining intact forests within forest management units. To circumvent these challenges, it might be necessary to create a form of compensation payment scheme to overcome the foregone costs of intact forest preservation. Alternatively, certification systems might need to consider permitting some degree of regulated extraction in exchange for recognition and implementation of stringent forest preservation. This will require a re-evaluation of the way intactness is treated within current certification standards and the requirements for forestry within intact forests. Eventually, intact forest conservation and socially and economically viable forest management can only be reconciled on the landscape scale.

TI  - Markedly divergent estimates of Amazon forest carbon density from ground plots and satellites
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB  - Aim The accurate mapping of forest carbon stocks is essential for understanding the global carbon cycle, for assessing emissions from deforestation, and for rational land-use planning. Remote sensing (RS) is currently the key tool for this purpose, but RS does not estimate vegetation biomass directly, and thus may miss significant spatial variations in forest structure. We test the stated accuracy of pantropical carbon maps using a large independent field dataset.
   Location Tropical forests of the Amazon basin. The permanent archive of the field plot data can be accessed at: http://dx.doi.org/10.5521/FORESTPLOTS.NET/2014_1
   Methods Two recent pantropical RS maps of vegetation carbon are compared to a unique ground-plot dataset, involving tree measurements in 413 large inventory plots located in nine countries. The RS maps were compared directly to field plots, and kriging of the field data was used to allow area-based comparisons.
   Results The two RS carbon maps fail to capture the main gradient in Amazon forest carbon detected using 413 ground plots, from the densely wooded tall forests of the north-east, to the light-wooded, shorter forests of the south-west. The differences between plots and RS maps far exceed the uncertainties given in these studies, with whole regions over-or under-estimated by > 25%, whereas regional uncertainties for the maps were reported to be < 5%.
   Main conclusions Pantropical biomass maps are widely used by governments and by projects aiming to reduce deforestation using carbon offsets, but may have significant regional biases. Carbon-mapping techniques must be revised to account for the known ecological variation in tree wood density and allometry to create maps suitable for carbon accounting. The use of single relationships between tree canopy height and above-ground biomass inevitably yields large, spatially correlated errors. This presents a significant challenge to both the forest conservation and remote sensing communities, because neither wood density nor species assemblages can be reliably mapped from space.

TI  - Soil nutrients affect spatial patterns of aboveground biomass and emergent tree density in southwestern Borneo
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Studies on the relationship between soil fertility and aboveground biomass in lowland tropical forests have yielded conflicting results, reporting positive, negative and no effect of soil nutrients on aboveground biomass. Here, we quantify the impact of soil variation on the stand structure of mature Bornean forest throughout a lowland watershed (8-196 m a.s.l.) with uniform climate and heterogeneous soils. Categorical and bivariate methods were used to quantify the effects of (1) parent material differing in nutrient content (alluvium > sedimentary > granite) and (2) 27 soil parameters on tree density, size distribution, basal area and aboveground biomass. Trees >= 10 cm (diameter at breast height, dbh) were enumerated in 30 (0.16 ha) plots (sample area = 4.8 ha). Six soil samples (0-20 cm) per plot were analyzed for physiochemical properties. Aboveground biomass was estimated using allometric equations. Across all plots, stem density averaged 521 +/- 13 stems ha(-1), basal area 39.6 +/- 1.4 m(2) ha(-1) and aboveground biomass 518 +/- 28 Mg ha(-1) (mean +/- SE). Adjusted forest-wide aboveground biomass to account for apparent overestimation of large tree density (based on 69 0.3-ha transects; sample area = 20.7 ha) was 430 +/- 25 Mg ha(-1) stop. Stand structure did not vary significantly among substrates, but it did show a clear trend toward larger stature on nutrient-rich alluvium, with a higher density and larger maximum size of emergent trees. Across all plots, surface soil phosphorus (P), potassium, magnesium and percentage sand content were significantly related to stem density and/or aboveground biomass (R-Pearson = 0.368-0.416). In multiple linear regression, extractable P and percentage sand combined explained 31% of the aboveground biomass variance. Regression analyses on size classes showed that the abundance of emergent trees > 120 cm dbh was positively related to soil P and exchangeable bases, whereas trees 60-90 cm dbh were negatively related to these factors. Soil fertility thus had a significant effect on both total aboveground biomass and its distribution among size classes.

TI  - Linking climate change research with food security and poverty reduction in the tropics
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
CP  - Conference on Food and Forestry: Global Change and Global Challenges
AB  - Climate change is a reality and will affect the poor in developing countries in many ways. The effectiveness of global change research could be substantially improved by linking International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) study with Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) centres based in the tropics. These centres are carrying interdisciplinary research and development on how to achieve food security and reduce rural poverty through the innovative management of natural resources. A CGIAR intercentre working group on climate change (ICWG-CC) identified joint opportunities that take advantage of the comparative advantages of both institutions. CGIAR centres will focus on adaptation and mitigation research in developing countries. A natural resource management research approach is suggested, which consists of six steps: (1) identifying and quantifying the extent of food insecurity, rural poverty and resource degradation; (2) conducting technological and policy research on economic and environmental functions; (3) optimising the trade-offs between global environmental benefits and private farmer benefits; (4) extrapolating and disseminating results, including research on policy implementation; (5) assessing impact and (6) providing feedback.
   Two examples of current CGIAR research illustrate this approach. Agroforestry alternatives to slash and burn (ASB) agriculture at tropical forest margins were identified and the trade-offs between carbon sequestration and farmer profitability provided options to policy makers. Land tenure problems were resolved with participatory policy research. Agroforestry practices sequester an additional 57 Mg C per ha, three times that of croplands or grasslands are able to do. Soil nutrient capital is being replenished in subhumid tropical Africa through improved leguminous tree fallows, rock phosphate and biomass transfers of Tithonia diversifolia, helping farmers to attain food security. Afterwards, when farmers shift to high-value tree or vegetable crop production, poverty is reduced. The transformation of low productivity croplands to sequential agroforestry is estimated to triple system carbon stocks in 20 years. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Direct seeding of late-successional trees to restore tropical montane forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Natural regeneration of large-seeded, late-successional trees in fragmented tropical landscapes can be strongly limited by a lack of seed dispersal resulting in the need for more intensive restoration approaches, such as enrichment planting, to include these species in future forests. Direct seeding may be an alternative low-cost approach to planting nursery-raised tree seedlings, but there is minimal information on its efficacy or when in the successional process this technique will be most successful. We tested directly seeding five native tree species into habitats representing passive and active restoration approaches: (1) recently abandoned pasture; (2) naturally establishing, young secondary forests; and (3) young, mixed-species (fast-growing N-fixers and commercially valuable species) tree plantations established to facilitate montane forest recovery in southern Costa Rica. We monitored germination, survival, growth, and above- and below-ground biomass over a 2-year period. Germination in pastures, secondary forests, and tree plantations was similar(-..43%). Seedling survival after one and two years was significantly higher under tree plantations (91% year 1, 75% year 2) compared to secondary forests (76.44%) or pastures (74, 41%). Moreover, seedlings had greater total biomass and lower root:shoot ratios in the plantations, suggesting higher nutrient availability in that treatment. Costs for direct seeding were 10- to 30-fold less per 100 seedlings after 2-year compared to nursery-raised seedlings planted at the same sites; however, there are important trade-offs to the two restoration approaches. Planting nursery-raised seedling is a more effective but higher cost approach for rapidly establishing canopy cover and restoring large areas whereas direct seeding is a more efficient way to enrich an existing system. We particularly recommend using direct seeding as a complimentary measure to the more intensive restoration approach of planting fast-growing and N-fixing trees. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Bacuru Droa: Indigenous forest custody as an effective climate change mitigation option. A case study from Darien, Panama
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CLIMATE
AB  - Efforts to naturally remove atmospheric CO2 demand that largely intact forests be maintained. Our inter-cultural research initiative tested the hypothesis that Indigenous custody of the land is compatible with the maintenance of intact forests. Here we combined traditional knowledge, phytolith analysis, remote sensing, and tree inventories to study old-growth forests in Panama's Darien. Phytoliths served to elucidate historical vegetation, remote sensing revealed the current and past Indigenous footprints while tree stature and identity characterised the forest. Until now there has been very little to no human impact within these forests and current Indigenous footprint is both small and stable. Large trees accounted for 13% of trees in the plots that we established. For over half of the species, the measured tree height was taller than previously published maximum heights, leading us to conclude that these forests are a truly exceptional ecological refugium. Noting that the local communities are not rewarded for their custody of these exceptional forests we call to revisit the Good Practice Guidance for Land Use Land Use Change and Forestry to include intact forest land. In the context of sub-optimal carbon finance options, we also propose matching as a methodology that could prove additionality of forest conservation initiatives in climate mitigation portfolios.

TI  - Forest certification in Amazonia: standards matter
T2  - ORYX
AB  - Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification promises international consumers that 'green-label' timber has been logged sustainably. However, recent research indicates that this is not true for ipe (Tabebuia spp.), currently flooding the US residential decking market, much of it logged in Brazil. Uneven or non-application of minimum technical standards for certification could undermine added value and eventually the certification process itself. We examine public summary reports by third-party certifiers describing the evaluation process for certified companies in the Brazilian Amazon to determine the extent to which standards are uniformly applied and the degree to which third-party certifier requirements for compliance are consistent among properties. Current best-practice harvest systems, combined with Brazilian legal norms for harvest levels, guarantee that no certified company or community complies with FSC criteria and indicators specifying species-level management. No guidelines indicate which criteria and indicators must be enforced, or to what degree, for certification to be conferred by third-party assessors; nor do objective guidelines exist for evaluating compliance for criteria and indicators for which adequate scientific information is not yet available to identify acceptable levels. Meanwhile, certified companies are expected to monitor the long-term impacts of logging on biodiversity in addition to conducting best-practice forest management. This burden should reside elsewhere. We recommend a clarification of 'sustained timber yield' that reflects current state of knowledge and practice in Amazonia. Quantifiable verifiers for best-practice forest management must be developed and consistently employed. These will need to be flexible to reflect the diversity in forest structure and dynamics that prevails across this vast region. We offer suggestions for how to achieve these goals.

TI  - Integrating remotely sensed fires for predicting deforestation for REDD
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Fire is an important tool in tropical forest management, as it alters forest composition, structure, and the carbon budget. The United Nations program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) aims to sustainably manage forests, as well as to conserve and enhance their carbon stocks. Despite the crucial role of fire management, decision-making on REDD+ interventions fails to systematically include fires. Here, we address this critical knowledge gap in two ways. First, we review REDD+ projects and programs to assess the inclusion of fires in monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems. Second, we model the relationship between fire and forest for a pilot site in Colombia using near-real-time (NRT) fire monitoring data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The literature review revealed fire remains to be incorporated as a key component of MRV systems. Spatially explicit modeling of land use change showed the probability of deforestation declined sharply with increasing distance to the nearest fire the preceding year (multi-year model area under the curve [AUC] 0.82). Deforestation predictions based on the model performed better than the official REDD earlY-warning system. The model AUC for 2013 and 2014 was 0.81, compared to 0.52 for the early-warning system in 2013 and 0.68 in 2014. This demonstrates NRT fire monitoring is a powerful tool to predict sites of forest deforestation. Applying new, publicly available, and open-access NRT fire data should be an essential element of early-warning systems to detect and prevent deforestation. Our results provide tools for improving both the current MRV systems, and the deforestation early-warning system in Colombia.

TI  - Biodiversity values of abandoned teak, Tectona grandis plantations in southern Western Ghats: Is there a need for management intervention?
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Abandoned plantations could potentially support a large number of native tree species through succession and restore the original tree community. In order to assess the ability of abandoned teak plantations to recover through regeneration, teak stands from 29 to 80 years old were sampled for seedling and sapling density, species richness and the use by large ungulates in the southern Western Ghats using 10 m circular plots. The influence of the forest-plantation edge was also studied. There was regeneration of a species-rich tree community in the understorey of abandoned teak plantations. However, regeneration was arrested, and thereby the large girth-class tree community remained species-poor. There was no significant change in the tree species richness with distance from natural forest, suggesting that the forest-plantation edge had little influence on the penetration of native tree species inside plantations. Asian elephant and Indian gaur dung densities were significantly lower in the plantations than in the forest. Indian gaur and sambar used the younger plantations intensively, and the density of their dung was negatively correlated with age of the plantation. Abandonment of mature teak stands arrested the succession of native trees. We provide evidence that abandoned teak plantations might not serve as suitable habitats for large herbivores during the dry months of the year in the region. The study highlights the need for active management of mature teak plantations inside wildlife reserves, in order to promote succession and improve the habitat for wild flora and fauna in the Western Ghats.

TI  - Forest use and vertical stratification in fruit-feeding butterflies of Sulawesi, Indonesia:: impacts for conservation
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Protected forest areas of Sulawesi are gradually being replaced by intensively used agroforestry systems and farmland, especially in lowland and sub-montane regions. Studies on the impact of these man-induced changes on biodiversity are of urgent conservation concern. We compared the fruit-feeding butterfly assemblage of a natural hill forest to that of a disturbed hill forest, representing a mosaic of old secondary forest and recently abandoned or active subsistence farms. Overall, species richness seemed highest in the disturbed site, but both abundance and diversity of endemic butterflies were significantly higher in the natural forest. Although the butterfly assemblage showed a clear vertical structure in the natural forest, vertical stratification was no longer pronounced at the disturbed site. Comparative studies based on diversity estimates from ground samples should consider not only the scale at which sampling is carried out and influences from nearby habitat patches in the surrounding landscape mosaic, but also possible behavioural changes in stratified species after forest modification. This study shows that higher overall species richness does not imply higher species distinctiveness, and indicates that the contribution of land-use systems to global biodiversity should be evaluated with caution, even when relatively high species richness estimates are found.

TI  - Lime and gypsum application increases biological activity, carbon pools, and agronomic productivity in highly weathered soil
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The application of lime and gypsum has been recognized as an important strategy for correcting soil acidity and for improving soil fertility, soil aggregation, and agronomic productivity in highly weathered soils. We hypothesized that the combined application of lime and gypsum would create favorable conditions for biological activity and result in increased SOC storage and agronomic productivity. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term (i.e., 15 years) impact of lime and gypsum application on the biological activity, SOC stocks, and agronomic productivity of plots under no-till soil management. The experiment was established in 1998 at a site with clayey Oxisol in southern Brazil, and was designed with a split-plot arrangement, completely randomized blocks, and three replicates. The main plot was subject to three lime treatments: (i) control (no lime); (ii) incorporated lime (IL):incorporation of 4.5 Mg lime ha(-1) to a depth of 0-20 cm by; and (iii) surface lime (SL): surface application of 4.5 Mg lime ha(-1), which was equally divided among three annual applications during the first three years of the experiment. The subplots were comprised by surface applications of gypsum at 0, 3, 6, or 9 Mg ha(-1). Soil samples were collected in 1998, before of the experiment, and in October 2013, in order to evaluate soil enzyme activities, SOC pool stocks, crop productivity, C-biomass input, and soil fertility attributes. Both forms of lime application significant improved the stocks of several SOC pools, crop productivity, biomass-C input rates, soil fertility attributes, and enzyme activity. The SOC stocks were positively correlated with Ca2+ content and biomass-C input, demonstrating the potential of calcium to improve C accumulation. Enzyme activities were significantly affected by both soil fertility and SOC pools, with increases in hot water extractable organic C yielding the greatest increases in enzyme activity. In addition, we also found that gypsum application significantly increased the stocks of labile SOC pools and arylsulfatase activity. However, effects of gypsum application were less apparent than those of lime application and the combination of surface lime (4.5 Mg ha(-1)) and gypsum (9 Mg ha(-1)) application yielded the greatest long-term increase in the stock of total organic C stock. Thus, the results of the present study suggest that lime and gypsum application, along with no-till management and biomass-C input, constitutes an efficient strategy for improving the biological activity, C stocks, and productivity of agricultural soils.

TI  - Testing hypotheses for the success of different conservation strategies
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - Evaluations of the success of different conservation strategies are still in their infancy. We used four different measures of project outcomes-ecological, economic, attitudinal, and behavioral - to test hypotheses derived from the assumptions that underlie contemporary conservation solutions. Our hypotheses concerned the effects of natural resource utilization, market integration, decentralization, and community homogeneity on project success. We reviewed the conservation and development literature and used a specific protocol to extract and code the information in a sample of papers. Although our results are by no means conclusive and suffer from the paucity of high-quality data and independent monitoring (80% of the original sample of 124 projects provided inadequate information for use in this study), they show that permitted use of natural resources, market access, and greater community involvement in the conservation project are all important factors for a successful outcome. Without better monitoring schemes in place, it is still impossible to provide a systematic evaluation of how different strategies are best suited to different conservation challenges.

TI  - Alleviating forest degradation in the Lancang-Mekong Region requires closing management-measurement gaps
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
AB  - Deforestation and forest degradation are having profound negative impacts on social-ecological systems in the emerging economies across the tropics. Consequently, interest in restoring and rehabilitating degraded forests has been growing. This paper explores current issues related to addressing forest degradation in the Lancang-Mekong Region (LMR) of Southeast Asia through a review of the use of criteria and indicators for forest degradation and rehabilitation. Forest degradation must be understood in the context of its underlying drivers, which are numerous and complex. Understanding these underlying drivers of degradation requires diagnosing the entwined political, social, economic, and environmental systems that affect forests. Landscapes are the relevant scales to diagnose and intervene for improved forests. Interventions to restore or rehabilitate forests should be process-driven, focused on the underlying social, ecological and political processes that degrade landscapes. Interventions should also include negotiation among all actors influencing and competing for natural resource claims in forest landscapes. Criteria and indicators for forest landscape restoration should therefore help to improve the governance of forest landscapes. Criteria and indicators provide measures of the biophysical outcomes of degradation, in addition to processes, but these should be adapted to changing contexts and emerging challenges, and should rectify any pre-existing flawed change-logic. Restoration activities should synthesize, integrate, and build upon the rich history of pre-existing restoration guidelines, but should be adaptable in order to be applied effectively in the contexts of local landscapes. This project is facilitating a dialogue around the use of criteria and indicators to help solve the degradation challenge in the LMR. We will trial the use of the criteria and indicators generated through this research in the LMR to learn what works and what doesn't. This will provide an opportunity to build consensus around the ways in which restoration investments made by governments, civil society, and the private sector can influence sustainability.

TI  - How accurately may we project tropical forest-cover change? A validation of a forward-looking baseline for REDD
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - The Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) mechanism of a future post-2012 global climate-change treaty would aim to give incentive to tropical countries to reduce deforestation and thus forest-carbon emissions. It would do so by crediting tropical countries for reducing deforestation relative to a baseline scenario describing carbon emissions and removals from forest-cover change expected in the absence of REDD+. Defining a credible and accurate baseline is both critical and challenging. One approach considered promising is spatial modelling to project forest-cover change on the basis of historical trends: yet few such projections have been validated at a national scale. We develop and validate a novel GEOMOD projection of forest-cover change in Panama over 2000-2008, based on trends over 1990-2000 and 25 drivers of forest-cover change. Compared with the actual landscape of 2008, our projection is 85.2% accurate at a 100-m pixel resolution. More error is attributable to the location of projected forest (8.6%) than to its area (6.2%). Accuracy was least where forest regeneration predominated (80%), and greatest where deforestation predominated (90%). Despite the sophistication of our projection, it is slightly less accurate than if we had assumed no forest-cover change over 2000-2008. We identify factors limiting projection accuracy, including the complexity of forest-cover change, the spatial variability of forest-carbon density, and the relatively small area of change at the national scale. We conclude that, with the exception of contexts where forest-cover change is significant and straightforward and where forest-carbon density relatively uniform (e.g., agricultural frontiers), spatially projected baselines are of limited value for REDD+ - their accuracy is too limited given their relative lack of transparency. Simpler, relatively coarse scale, retrospective baselines are recommended instead. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Identifying priority areas for Forest Landscape Restoration in Chiapas (Mexico): An operational approach combining ecological and socioeconomic criteria
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
AB  - The degradation of forest resources is a global issue and represents a considerable threat to both the functioning of ecosystems and the well-being of human communities. The recently introduced Forest Landscape Restoration approach focuses on building up a forest-based landscape that can improve biodiversity conservation, ecological functioning and the livelihoods of human communities. Reforestation, when properly planned, can mitigate the effects of the degradation process, protect biodiversity and enhance the provision of forest goods and services. To this purpose a sound identification of priority reforestation sites is fundamental. This study introduces a GIS-based methodology to identify reforestation priorities, design a number of landscape-scale reforestation options and evaluate them with respect to a set of ecological and socioeconomic criteria. The prioritisation is based on two main non-compensatory factors: the need for biodiversity conservation and the ecological feasibility of reforestation Suitability maps are generated for both factors through spatial multicriteria analysis and threshold pairs used to extract priority areas. The minimum suitability levels and the total area to be reforested are used as input parameters to generate a finite number of resulting reforestation options. These are assessed for their ability to conserve biodiversity and improve living conditions of local communities by introducing additional ecological and socioeconomic criteria. Finally, sensitivity analysis is used to test the robustness of the assessment. The methodology is applied to a case study in western Chiapas (Mexico) where conditions of forest degradation and widespread poverty occur. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Quo vadis Patria Gaucha? Uruguayan pathways of land use change
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - South American grasslands, socio-ecological systems used heavily for a long time, are currently experiencing dramatic land-use changes due to implementation of large-scale afforestation and agro-industrial cash crops. Applying the conceptual framework of "Multifunctional and sustainable productive landscapes" to Uruguay, we explored the impacts on rural ecosystems and communities based on a long-term monitoring network by assessing species richness of plant and terrestrial arthropods and socio-economic data from national census. We found that silvi- and agricultural industry established mainly at the expense of extensively grazed grasslands and local family farms with traditional techniques, accompanied by a deregulation of the rural labor market, depopulation and aging of rural society. Governmental nature protection efforts increase the native forest cover and establish nature protection areas focusing mainly on forests. We also discuss pathways of land-use change in recent decades and related discourses of local stakeholders.

TI  - Ecophysiological responses of Cupuassu tree ecotypes ( Theobroma grandiflorum) in an agroforestry system designed with rubber trees in Colombian Amazon
T2  - XXXI INTERNATIONAL HORTICULTURAL CONGRESS, IHC2022: INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INNOVATIVE PERENNIAL CROPS MANAGEMENT
CP  - 31st International Horticultural Congress (IHC) - Horticulture for a World in Transition / International Symposium on Innovative Perennial Crops Management
AB  - Cupuassu [Theobroma grandiflorum (Willd. ex Spreng.) K. Schum] is a promising Amazonian fruit tree of great interest for implementation in sustainable agroforestry enrichment alternative models for the Colombian Amazon. The purpose of this study was to assess the diurnal and seasonality eco-physiological behavior of two distinctive ecotypes (i.e., Eco11 and Eco4) and a control ecotype (EcoCaq) in association with rubber plantations (clone FX 4098) in growth phase in two agro-climatic zones of Caqueta in the Colombian Amazon. Cupuassu was established in a completely random design with distances of 3.0x4.0 m in double rubber corridors, and the latter in turn with distances of 4.0x2.8x10.0 m. Linear models were used to analyze the daily courses of gas exchange and water potential of the plant, micro- climatic parameters and soil water potential. A biplot genotype x environment analysis was used to analyze the adaptability and stability of the three eco-types. The highest photosynthetic rates occurred between 9:00 and 12:00 h and in times of greater precipitation (wet and transition to dry season). The plants water potential was the eco-physiological parameter that best correlated with photosynthesis, and with climatic factors, positively with relative humidity and negatively with PAR (photosynthetically active radiation), temperature and VPD (vapor pressure deficit). Eco11 presented the highest photosynthetic performance therefore representing the best option for implementation of agroforestry enrichment arrangements with rubber plantations with potential for the Colombian Amazon

TI  - Quantifying aboveground biomass in African environments: A review of the trade-offs between sensor estimation accuracy and costs
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Increased global recognition of the role of forests in regulating the biosphere-atmospheric carbon cycle through carbon sequestration, has resulted in a wide range of scientific studies on estimation, mapping, monitoring and the prediction of Aboveground Biomass (AGB) on various scales in sub-Saharan Africa. In many parts of the developing world, specifically in sub-Saharan Africa, the accurate quantification of AGB, although still a challenge, is important for national carbon accounting, REDD+ project payments, sustainable forest management and strategic policy-making. In this review, an overview of remote sensing applications in AGB estimation in sub-Saharan Africa, including research challenges and basic information related to the trade-offs between sensor estimation accuracy and costs, is provided. It is assumed that this review is timely, due to a relative increase in the number of remotely sensed forests carbon studies in the recent years (specifically the period between 1998 and 2013). Remotely sensed data is particularly appealing, due to its robustness, instantaneity and repeated spatio-temporal coverage and hence the ability to successful estimate and map AGB. However, estimation accuracy and image acquisition cost vary with sensor resolution and type. It is assumed that this study will provide guidance in future national carbon accounting studies, which is one of the main objectives of the Kyoto Protocol and the REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) project, housed under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), particularly for the developing world.

TI  - A methodological approach for assessing cross-site landscape change: Understanding socio-ecological systems
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - The expansion of agriculture has resulted in large-scale habitat loss, the fragmentation of forests, significant losses in biological diversity and negative impacts on many ecosystem services. In this paper, we highlight the Agrarian Change Project, a multi-disciplinary research initiative, that applies detailed socio-ecological methodologies in multi-functional landscapes, and assess the subsequent implications for conservation, livelihoods and food security. Specifically, the research focuses on land use impacts in locations which exhibit various combinations of agricultural modification/change across a forest transition gradient in six tropical landscapes, in Zambia, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Indonesia and Bangladesh. These methods include integrated assessments of the perceptions of ecosystem service provision, tree cover loss and gain, relative poverty, diets and agricultural patterns of change. Although numerous surveys on rural livelihoods are undertaken each year, often at great cost, many are hampered by weaknesses in methods and thus may not reflect rural realities. We attempt to highlight how integrating broader socio-ecological methods can be used to fill in those gaps and ensure such realities are indeed captured. Early findings suggest that the transition from a forested landscape to a more agrarian dominated system does not necessarily result in better livelihood outcomes and there may be unintended consequences of forest and tree cover removal. These include the loss of access to grazing land, loss of dietary diversity and the loss of ecosystem services/forest products.

TI  - Identifying changes in mangrove landscapes in the Philippines and Indonesia using remote sensing and community perceptions: Towards ecosystem services management
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems provide important services in mitigating global climate change while delivering various co-benefits at the local level. However, they are subjected to multiple anthropogenic and natural disturbances, leading to several investigations aimed at addressing these threats and/or restoring them. This study was conducted to develop site-specific scale land cover maps using remote sensing to monitor and quantify mangroves, alongside assessing community perceptions to identify the direct drivers of mangrove cover changes. Results showed that in Balangkayan, (Philippines), the mangrove cover increased by approximately 500 ha between 2014 and 2021, following a decline in 2013 due to Typhoon Haiyan. In Muaragembong (Indonesia), mangrove cover increased by about 176.13 ha between 2000 and 2022 after years of conversion to fish and shrimp ponds. Community perceptions in both sites revealed that natural disturbances, such as strong typhoons and coastal erosion, were the primary drivers of mangrove cover changes. The key findings of this study provide valuable insights into (1) mangrove cover changes over time, (2) proximate and underlying drivers of these changes, and (3) land use and land cover maps highlighting mangroves in less-explored sites. These local-scale observations offer global perspectives on the long-term effects of natural disasters and sustained mangrove restoration efforts on mangrove blue carbon.

TI  - Rainforest-restoration success as judged by assemblages of soil- and litterd-welling mites (Arachnida: Acari)
T2  - ACAROLOGY XIII: PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS
CP  - 13th International Congress of Acarology (ICA)
AB  - Decline in rainforest cover in many areas of Australia is being countered by various methods of forest reestablishment, including ecological restoration plantings, timber plantations, and unmanaged regrowth. We used assemblages of soil-and litter-dwelling mites to determine which style most closely recaptures the assemblage structure of mites associated with intact rainforest at 84 tropical and subtropical sites in eastern Australia. The six habitat types surveyed were pasture (the typical 'pre-restoration' state), unmanaged regrowth, monoculture forestry, multi-species forestry, ecological restoration and intact rainforest (the 'target'state). Forestry and ecological restoration sites were 5-20 years old. Mites were extracted from soil/litter samples and (excluding Oribatida) identified to family or to finer levels. For two diverse but taxonomically difficult superfamilies characteristic of rainforest, Uropodoidea and Trombidioidea, identification was to morphotaxon. Presence/absence data were analyzed in several ways. First, we used our data to create a list of 'indicator taxa' for pasture and rainforest, and determined the abundance of these indicators in each of the four reforestation methods. We also calculatedmorphotaxon richness for uropodoids and trombidioids and compared these values among habitat types. In both of these analyses, ecological restoration was most similar to rainforest. We used ordination and ANOSIM to compare mite assemblages among habitat-types. Although mite assemblages clearly distinguished between rainforest and pasture sites, they did not identify any of the four reforestation methods as being consistently similar to rainforest. They did, however, indicate that monoculture forestry and multi-species forestry plantations were often not readily distinguishable from pasture. This may have as much to do with silvicultural methods common to these plantations (e.g., pruning, herbicide application, and maintenance of a relatively open canopy) as to the low diversity of trees present in plantations. We conclude with a brief discussion of the utility of mites in rapid bioassessment programs in Australia, and suggest that the most pragmatic approach involves focusing on a few easily recognized indicators rather than on entire assemblages.

TI  - The significance of using satellite imagery data only in Ecological Niche Modelling of Iberian herps
T2  - ACTA HERPETOLOGICA
AB  - The environmental data used to calculate ecological niche models (ENM) are obtained mainly from ground-based maps (e.g., climatic interpolated surfaces). These data are often not available for less developed areas, or may be at an inappropriate scale, and thus to obtain this information requires fieldwork. An alternative source of eco-geographical data comes from satellite imagery. Three sets of ENM were calculated exclusively with variables obtained (1) from optical and radar images only and (2) from climatic and altitude maps obtained by ground-based methods. These models were compared to evaluate whether satellite imagery can accurately generate ENM. These comparisons must be made in areas with well-known species distribution and with available satellite imagery and ground-based data. Thus, the study area was the south-western part of Salamanca (Spain), using amphibian and reptiles as species models. Models' discrimination capacity was measured with ROC plots. Models' covariation was measured with a Spatial Spearman correlation. Four modelling techniques were used (Bioclim, Mahalanobis distance, GARP and Maxent). The results of this comparison showed that there were no significant differences between models generated using remotely sensed imagery or ground-based data. However, the models built with satellite imagery data exhibited a larger diversity of values, probably related to the higher spatial resolution of the satellite imagery. Satellite imagery can produce accurate ENM, independently of the modelling technique or the dataset used. Therefore, biogeographical analysis of species distribution in remote areas can be accurately developed only with variables from satellite imagery.

AB  - In order to characterize the composition and structure of the forest formations of the Commune, Pital, Buffer zone of the Machalilla National Park, the structural characterization of four localities of the equatorial dry forest belonging to two plant formations was carried out, the spiny tropical hill and the premontane spiny mountain that go from 40 to 460 msnm. For the investigation, 28 temporary sampling plots of 50 x 20 m (0.10 ha) were established, the tree species e" 10 cm of DAP were measured. A total of 1,346 individuals represented in 89 species belonging to 82 genera and 42 families were identified and evaluated. The localities were compared statistically in terms of wealth, composition, structure and diversity. High alpha and beta diversity were found; Height above sea level, basal area and density are the variables that most influence the segregation of four types of forests that differ in their composition and forest structure. Significant, promising and rare species were identified, with the most important species being Cordia alliodora, Nectandra acutifolia and Ficus velutina. The family with the most species and genera is Fabaceae. Most individuals (58%) were recorded in the 10-20 cm diameter class for all four locations. The results obtained will allow projects aimed at sustainable forest management through the application of methods for ecological restoration and conservation of these tropical forests.

TI  - Terrestrial carbon sinks in China and around the world and their contribution to carbon neutrality
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-LIFE SCIENCES
AB  - Enhancing the terrestrial ecosystem carbon sink (referred to as terrestrial C sink) is an important way to slow down the continuous increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and to achieve carbon neutrality target. To better understand the characteristics of terrestrial C sinks and their contribution to carbon neutrality, this review summarizes major progress in terrestrial C budget researches during the past decades, clarifies spatial patterns and drivers of terrestrial C sources and sinks in China and around the world, and examines the role of terrestrial C sinks in achieving carbon neutrality target. According to recent studies, the global terrestrial C sink has been increasing from a source of (-0.2 +/- 0.9) Pg C yr(-1) (1 Pg=10(15) g) in the 1960s to a sink of (1.9 +/- 1.1) Pg C yr(-1) in the 2010s. By synthesizing the published data, we estimate terrestrial C sink of 0.20-0.25 Pg C yr(-1) in China during the past decades, and predict it to be 0.15-0.52 Pg C yr(-1) by 2060. The terrestrial C sinks are mainly located in the mid- and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, while tropical regions act as a weak C sink or source. The C balance differs much among ecosystem types: forest is the major C sink; shrubland, wetland and farmland soil act as C sinks; and whether the grassland functions as C sink or source remains unclear. Desert might be a C sink, but the magnitude and the associated mechanisms are still controversial. Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration, nitrogen deposition, climate change, and land cover change are the main drivers of terrestrial C sinks, while other factors such as fires and aerosols would also affect ecosystem C balance. The driving factors of terrestrial C sink differ among regions. Elevated CO2 concentration and climate change are major drivers of the C sinks in North America and Europe, while afforestation and ecological restoration are additionally important forcing factors of terrestrial C sinks in China. For future studies, we recommend the necessity for intensive and long term ecosystem C monitoring over broad geographic scale to improve terrestrial biosphere models for accurately evaluating terrestrial C budget and its dynamics under various climate change and policy scenarios.

TI  - Contrasting range changes and drivers of four forest foundation species under future climate change in China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Forest foundation species, vital for shaping community structure and dynamics through non-trophic level interactions, are key to forest succession and sustainability. Despite their ecological importance, the habitat ranges of these species in China and their responses to future climate change remain unclear. Our study employed the optimal MaxEnt model to assess the range shifts and their essential drivers of four typical forest foundation species from three climatic zones in China under climate scenarios, including Acer tegmentosum, Acer pseudosieboldianum (temperate zone), Quercus glandulifera (subtropical zone), and Ficus hispida (tropical zone). The optimal MaxEnt model exhibited high evaluation indices (AUC values > 0.90) for the four foundation species, indicating excellent predictive performance. Currently, we observed that A. tegmentosum and A. pseudo-sieboldianum are predominantly inhabited temperate forest areas in northeastern China, Q. glandulifera is primarily concentrated in subtropical forests in southeastern China, and F. hispida is mainly distributed across the tropical forests in southern China. Climate factors, particularly temperature, emerged as the primary environmental factors influencing the potential range of forest foundation species. Moreover, precipitation strongly influenced the potential range of A. tegmentosum and A. pseudo-sieboldianum , while elevation exhibited a greater impact on the range of Q. glandulifera and F. hispida . Under future climate scenarios, suitable areas for A. tegmentosum and A. pseudo-sieboldianum tend to expand southward, F. hispida tends to expand northward, while Q. glandulifera exhibited a tendency to contract towards the center. This study advances our understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of forest foundation species in China under climate change, providing critical insights for conservation efforts and sustainable forest management practices.

TI  - Conversion of rainforest into oil palm and rubber plantations affects the functional composition of litter and soil Collembola
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Rainforest conversion and expansion of plantations in tropical regions are associated with changes in animal communities and biodiversity decline. In soil, Collembola are one of the most numerous invertebrate groups that affect the functioning of microbial communities and support arthropod predators. Despite that, information on the impact of changes in land use in the tropics on species and trait composition of Collembola communities is very limited. We investigated the response of Collembola to the conversion of rainforest into rubber agroforestry ("jungle rubber"), rubber, and oil palm plantations in Jambi Province (Sumatra, Indonesia), a region which experienced one of the strongest recent deforestation globally. Collembola were sampled in 2013 and 2016 from the litter and soil layer using heat extraction, and environmental factors were measured (litter C/N ratio, pH, water content, composition of microbial community and predator abundance). In the litter layer, density and species richness in plantation systems were 25%-38% and 30%-40% lower, respectively, than in rainforest. However, in the soil layer, density, species richness, and trait diversity of Collembola were only slightly affected by land-use change, contrasting the response of many other animal groups. Species and trait composition of Collembola communities in litter and soil differed between each of the land-use systems. Water content and pH were identified as main factors related to the differences in species and trait composition in both litter and soil, followed by the density of micro- and macropredators. Dominant species of Collembola in rainforest and jungle rubber were characterized by small body size, absence of furca, and absence of intense pigmentation, while in plantations, larger species with long furca and diffuse or patterned pigmentation were more abundant. Overall, land-use change negatively affected Collembola communities in the litter layer, but its impact was lower in the soil layer. Several pantropical genera of Collembola (i.e., Isotomiella, Pseudosinella, and Folsomides) dominated across land-use systems, reflecting their high environmental adaptability and/or efficient dispersal, calling for studies on their ecology and genetic diversity. The decline in species richness and density of litter-dwelling Collembola with the conversion of rainforest into plantation systems calls for management practices mitigating negative effects of the deterioration of the litter layer in rubber plantations, but even more in oil palm plantations.

TI  - Timber production and plant Biodiversity conservation in a Costa Rican rain forest: An experimental study and its lessons for adaptive sustainability assessment
T2  - CRITERIA AND INDICATORS FOR SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT AT THE FOREST MANAGEMENT UNIT LEVEL
CP  - Conference on the Criteria and Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management at the Forest Management Unit Level
AB  - Progress towards sustainable forest management in the neotropics will eventually require greater emphasis on monitoring and an adaptive approach, for which baseline data on management effects on fundamentally important plant community characteristics are still required. During the first decade following intervention, a Costa Rican rain forest appeared resilient and productive, although mortality rates rose following silvicultural treatment. Intervention did not affect floristic diversity, but abundances of lianas and some non-commercial tree species were reduced. As in any forest, precaution and best practice can reduce some management impacts on plant biodiversity, and can be evaluated by input and process indicators. Some outcome indicators of floristic change, necessary for adaptive management, are costly to evaluate, and the case study casts doubt on the use of structural indicators as surrogates for floristic ones. Permanent sample plot protocols modified as in the case study, in combination with a focal species approach, are suggested for monitoring. Focal species would have priority if the robustness of floristic diversity is confirmed by further work. Policy and institutional mechanisms to make monitoring possible are urgently needed, and attributes of forest types (limited area, unusual characteristics and degree of threat) and management operations (type and intensity of intervention) should also be used in setting priorities for monitoring.

TI  - Reference scenarios for deforestation and forest degradation in support of REDD: a review of data and methods
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Global climate policy initiatives are now being proposed to compensate tropical forest nations for reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation ( REDD). These proposals have the potential to include developing countries more actively in international greenhouse gas mitigation and to address a substantial share of the world's emissions which come from tropical deforestation. For such a policy to be viable it must have a credible benchmark against which emissions reduction can be calculated. This benchmark, sometimes termed a baseline or reference emissions scenario, can be based directly on historical emissions or can use historical emissions as input for business as usual projections. Here, we review existing data and methods that could be used to measure historical deforestation and forest degradation reference scenarios including FAO ( Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations) national statistics and various remote sensing sources. The freely available and corrected global Landsat imagery for 1990, 2000 and soon to come for 2005 may be the best primary data source for most developing countries with other coarser resolution high frequency or radar data as a valuable complement for addressing problems with cloud cover and for distinguishing larger scale degradation. While sampling of imagery has been effectively useful for pan-tropical and continental estimates of deforestation, wall-to-wall ( or full coverage) allows more detailed assessments for measuring national-level reference emissions. It is possible to measure historical deforestation with sufficient certainty for determining reference emissions, but there must be continued calls at the international level for making high-resolution imagery available, and for financial and technical assistance to help countries determine credible reference scenarios. The data available for past years may not be sufficient for assessing all forms of forest degradation, but new data sources will have greater potential in 2007 and after. This paper focuses only on the methods for measuring changes in forest area, but this information must be coupled with estimates of change in forest carbon stocks in order to quantify emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.

TI  - Biodiversity Conservation and Indigenous Land Management in the Era of Self-Determination
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - Indigenous people inhabit approximately 85% of areas designated for biodiversity conservation worldwide. They also continue to struggle for recognition and preservation of cultural identities, lifestyles, and livelihoods-a struggle contingent on control and protection of traditional lands and associated natural resources (hereafter, self-determination). Indigenous lands and the biodiversity they support are increasingly threatened because of human population growth and per capita consumption. Application of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to tribal lands in the United States provides a rich example of the articulation between biodiversity conservation and indigenous peoples' struggle for self-determination. We found a paradoxical relationship whereby tribal governments are simultaneously and contradictorily sovereign nations; yet their communities depend on the U. S. government for protection through the federal-trust doctrine. The unique legal status of tribal lands, their importance for conserving federally protected species, and federal environmental regulations' failure to define applicability to tribal lands creates conflict between tribal sovereignty, self-determination, and constitutional authority. We reviewed Secretarial Order 3206, the U. S. policy on "American Indian tribal rights, federal-tribal trust responsibilities, and the ESA," and evaluated how it influences ESA implementation on tribal lands. We found improved biodiversity conservation and tribal self-determination requires revision of the fiduciary relationship between the federal government and the tribes to establish clear, legal definitions regarding land rights, applicability of environmental laws, and financial responsibilities. Such actions will allow provision of adequate funding and training to tribal leaders and resource managers, government agency personnel responsible for biodiversity conservation and land management, and environmental policy makers. Increased capacity, cooperation, and knowledge transfer among tribes and conservationists will improve biodiversity conservation and indigenous self-determination.

TI  - How do terrestrial wildlife communities respond to small-scale Acacia plantations embedded in harvested tropical forest?
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - To offset the declining timber supply by shifting towards more sustainable forestry practices, industrial tree plantations are expanding in tropical production forests. The conversion of natural forests to tree plantation is generally associated with loss of biodiversity and shifts towards more generalist and disturbance tolerant communities, but effects of mixed-landuse landscapes integrating natural and plantation forests remain little understood. Using camera traps, we surveyed the medium-to-large bodied terrestrial wildlife community across two mixed-landuse forest management areas in Sarawak, Malaysia Borneo which include areas dedicated to logging of natural forests and adjacent planted Acacia forests. We analyzed data from a 25-wildlife species community using a Bayesian community occupancy model to assess species richness and species-specific occurrence responses to Acacia plantations at a broad scale, and to remote-sensed local habitat conditions within the different forest landuse types. All species were estimated to occur in both landuse types, but species-level percent area occupied and predicted average local species richness were slightly higher in the natural forest management areas compared to licensed planted forest management areas. Similarly, occupancy-based species diversity profiles and defaunation indices for both a full community and only threatened and endemic species suggested the diversity and occurrence were slightly higher in the natural forest management areas. At the local scale, forest quality was the most prominent predictor of species occurrence. These associations with forest quality varied among species but were predominantly positive. Our results highlight the ability of a mixed-landuse landscape with small-scale Acacia plantations embedded in natural forests to retain terrestrial wildlife communities while providing an alternate source of timber. Nonetheless, there was a tendency towards reduced biodiversity in planted forests, which would likely be more pronounced in plantations that are larger or embedded in a less natural matrix.

TI  - Soil organic carbon turnover following forest restoration in south China: Evidence from stable carbon isotopes
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - As over half of the world's tropical forests are reforested or afforested, understanding the resilience of carbon (C) pool in these forests is critical for global C balance. While most previous studies on the reforested lands have focused on C stock recovery, soil C turnover has largely been overlooked. We evaluated soil C turnover rate by calculating the isotopic enrichment factors of alpha (defined as the slope of the regression between the delta C-13 difference and /n-transferred C concentrations in mineral soil samples relative to the surface litter) and ji (defined as the slope of the regression between delta C-13 and log-transferred C concentrations) along 0-30 cm soil profiles in a 400-year-old monsoon evergreen broad-leaved forest (MEBF), a 51-year-old mixed-native plantation (NP1), a 31-year-old mixed-native plantation (NP2), a 31-year-old Acacia mangium plantation (AP), a 31-year-old mixedconifer plantation (CP), and a 31-year-old secondary forest with natural restoration (SF). Results showed that soil C stocks did not differ among the six forests. The estimated a values ranged from 1.0023 to 1.0086 and increased in the order of MEBF = NP1 < NP2 = AP = CP < SF. The estimated ji values ranged from -19.70 to -5.22 but showed an opposite trend to a values. Additionally, changes of the a and ji values among these forests were mainly regulated by soil water content and bulk density. Our findings demonstrate that forest restoration could enhance soil C stock equivalent to the undisturbed old-growth forests within a few decades, but the rate of soil C turnover in these restored forests were still higher.

TI  - Impacts of tropical selective logging on local-scale movements of understory birds
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Widespread selective logging in tropical forest causes structural damage and associated shifts in species composition, but we lack understanding of how selective logging impacts mechanistic processes that drive these biodiversity changes. Movement is a vital mechanistic process underpinning demographic, ecological, and evolutionary processes that likely determine species responses to logging. We assessed how tropical selective logging impacts local movements of 71 understory avian species in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, and determined whether movement patterns relate to species' conservation status, functional traits, sensitivity to logging and trophic position. We used a capture-mark-recapture methodology and a hierarchical Bayesian framework to model maximum observed local movement distances, accounting for spatial sampling heterogeneity. Across the avian community, we found a higher probability of moving shorter distances (up to 200 m) in logged forests, and higher movement probability at longer distances (above 200 m) in unlogged forests. Altered movement patterns after logging may reflect increased understory density, changed resource distribution and/or predation risks, and suggest smaller home-range sizes. Species' conservation status, body mass, foraging guild, logging sensitivity and trophic position were unrelated to the magnitude of movement change. The continued persistence of understory species in our sample after selective logging may depend on flexibility in movement behaviour, conferring resilience to habitat degradation and the retention of high conservation values. This lends further support for the protection of these logged forests for biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Land change in the central Albertine rift: Insights from analysis and mapping of land use-land cover change in north-western Rwanda
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - Land change was assessed in the Albertine rift region (ARR) using its central section of north-western Rwanda as case study. This region is one of Africa's most ecologically sensitive environments under severe pressure from human activities. The study maps and quantifies the spatial extent of land use-land cover (LULC) changes between 1987 and 2016 from Landsat images. Transitions between five major land classes were identified in order to understand the trajectory of observed changes. In terms of gains, the forest class, the urban built-up and bare land class increased by 9% and 4% respectively over the study period. The gains of forest were mainly derived from the afforestation of some agricultural lands in the southern part, whereas the gains of built-up and bare lands were mostly from cultivated land which was a net losing class. Forest increase is in line with government's policy to increase the national forest cover to 30% by 2020. Forest losses occurred mostly outside protected areas due to land conversion for settlement and agricultural purposes. Much needed information about changes in LULC over the last three decades is provided. This study demonstrates in a timely manner how to analyse and monitor LULC change and the drivers in an environment where field based research is a challenge due to the mountainous terrain. The ecological richness of the region, which coincides with heightened human population pressure, necessitates the monitoring of land change as input for improving land use planning with focus on conserving biodiversity.

TI  - Diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in undisturbed forest, slash-and-burn field, and monoculture forest of Indo-Burma megadiverse region
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Conversion of pristine forests to agricultural lands is one of the leading causes of biodiversity loss worldwide. To assess the impact of such forest disturbance on microbial diversity, we investigated the diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in the rich forests of Karbi Anglong hills of Assam, a biodiversity hotspot part of Indo-Burma region. AMF spore diversity was assessed in distinct study sites with different intensities of disturbances that encompassed a pristine undisturbed forest (UF), slash-and-burn field (SBF), and monoculture forest (MF). A total of 35 arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal species belonging to 9 genera were isolated. Species forming glomoid spores were dominant in all the three sites followed by acaulosporoid spores. Highest spore density was found in UF and lowest in MF. Multivariate analyses revealed similarity in UF and SBF. It was found that in MF, AMF diversity was significantly modified and reduced, resulting in an ecological degraded ecosystem. Our results show that natural UF and SBF contained similar and a high AM fungal diversity. The AM fungal diversity is not significantly affected by the slash-and-burn agricultural land use practices practised by the ethnic hilly tribes and, therefore, could be a component of a tropical forest "conservation-agriculture matrix.'' Also because of the high generic and species diversity found, this region can be considered as AMF hotspot and a priority place for conservation.

TI  - Economic valuation of selected coastal ecosystems based on key provisioning and regulation services of Jaguaruna (Brazil)
T2  - DESENVOLVIMENTO E MEIO AMBIENTE
AB  - The search for sustainability can be understood as a trajectory towards the maintenance of ecosystem services, which includes ways of minimizing the risk of losing them due to some imminent coastal hazard. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the state of key-ecosystem services of provisioning and regulation in the southern coast of the state of Santa Catarina in the face of coastal stressors. For the development of the research, eight types of ecosystems were identified and mapped, according to a key ecosystem service offered by each of them, and the four largest in area were selected to apply the environmental valuation methodologies. The methodologies used were the Avoided Costs Method (ACM) and the Replacement Cost Method (RCM). The ACM calculates the economic value of the benefits that an ecosystem provides that would not be available if it did not exist. In turn, the RCM is based on the replacement cost of a damaged asset. Valuation results for Agriculture and Cattle farming; Continental waters and Marine environment; and Afforestation were respectively 1.74; 2.86; 2.89 million of dollars per year, while results for Dunes, Beaches and Restingas were in the range of USD 3,120-6,240 ha-1 yr-1. These values should be understood as approximations of the true economic dimension of the damages caused by the use of ecosystems, since they correspond to how much the environment is capable of monetarily returning to individuals. Furthermore, these values cannot be used to calculate fines in case of environmental degradation.

TI  - Responses of bird functional communities to anthropogenic disturbances in the naturally fragmented Southern Mistbelt Forests in the Midlands of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Forest disturbance poses major threats to biodiversity and forest ecosystem processes. Understanding bird species' responses to disturbed forests is important for species conservation and forest management. Here, we assessed the impact of selective logging history (similar to 150 years), livestock grazing, alien plant invasion and adjacent matrix-type surrounding forest patches on bird species richness and functional diversity in 14 Southern Mistbelt Forest patches in the Midlands of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The bird communities were surveyed using fixedradius point-counts. We quantified functional diversity using three functional indices functional richness, functional divergence, and functional evenness. None of the disturbance types assessed affected the richness of bird species. The size of the forest patch affected bird species. For functional diversity, FRic was significantly higher in disturbed forest patches for forest specialists, insectivores and cup or ball-nesting birds. Functional evenness for the forest-sensitive groups, like forest specialists and insectivores, was significantly lower in disturbed sites. The results of this study showed that responses of functional communities and forest specialist bird species varied depending on disturbance type and intensity. We recommend that future studies assessing forest disturbance impacts on bird species use taxonomic proxies with different functional diversity indices for forest bird species conservation and management.

TI  - Social and Environmental Impacts of Forest Management Certification in Indonesia
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - In response to unsustainable timber production in tropical forest concessions, voluntary forest management certification programs such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) have been introduced to improve environmental, social, and economic performance over existing management practices. However, despite the proliferation of forest certification over the past two decades, few studies have evaluated its effectiveness. Using temporally and spatially explicit village-level data on environmental and socio-economic indicators in Kalimantan (Indonesia), we evaluate the performance of the FSC-certified timber concessions compared to non-certified logging concessions. Employing triple difference matching estimators, we find that between 2000 and 2008 FSC reduced aggregate deforestation by 5 percentage points and the incidence of air pollution by 31%. It had no statistically significant impacts on fire incidence or core areas, but increased forest perforation by 4 km(2) on average. In addition, we find that FSC reduced firewood dependence (by 33%), respiratory infections (by 32%) and malnutrition (by 1 person) on average. By conducting a rigorous statistical evaluation of FSC certification in a biodiversity hotspot such as Indonesia, we provide a reference point and offer methodological and data lessons that could aid the design of ongoing and future evaluations of a potentially critical conservation policy.

TI  - Anthropogenic Impacts on Bark and Ambrosia Beetle Assemblages in Tropical Montane Forest in Northern Borneo
T2  - INSECTS
AB  - Anthropogenic disturbances, such as forest conversion, have a profound impact on species distributions and biodiversity in tropical forests. This study aimed to determine the diversity and distribution of bark and ambrosia beetles (Curculionidae: Scolytinae and Platypodinae) across three forest types: Primary Forest (PF), Disturbed Forest (DF), and Rubber Plantation (RP) in southern Sabah, Malaysia. We analyzed biweekly data obtained from ethanol-baited traps over three years, from April 2017 to May 2020, which included 7257 individuals from 154 species. The dominant species remained the same across all forest types. However, species composition was highly stochastic and unpredictable between forest types. The abundance and number of species were highest in RP but lowest in DF. Indigenous forest use in DF mostly for fuel likely reduced the resources for the beetles. Open canopy structure in RP probably increased the number of flying beetles. Although adjacent to PF, RP displayed a distinct species composition predominantly associated with rubber trees. These findings underscore the anthropogenic impact on beetle assemblages due to forest use and emphasize the need for sustainable forest management practices to prevent biodiversity loss and maintain ecosystem stability.

TI  - Demographic effects of collecting rattan cane and their implications for sustainable harvesting
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - Rattan, Old World climbing palm, is an extremely valuable nontimber forest product whose canes are gathered for both market and nonmarket uses. I evaluated the effects, of harvesting commercial rattan, Calamus zollingeri Becc., on genet survival and ramet demography in two primary forest sites near Lore Lindu National Park in Sulawesi, Indonesia. I monitored 168 permanently marked C. zollingeri genets for 4 years and surveyed random transects for C. zollingeri genet and ramet populations and evidence of cane harvesting in 1996 and 2000. Cane harvesting had no significant effect on genet survival or mean ramet densities. However, current cane extraction rates significantly reduced mean cane lengths and total available cane throughout the study period. Based on observed genet and ramet populations and average cane growth rates area during the stud of 1.4 m/year, the sustained-yield harvesting potential of C. zollingeri is approximately 101 m and 56 m/ha/year in the two study sites. Although C. zollingeri exhibits life-history traits well suited to sustained-yield harvesting, including production of multiple canes, cane resprouting following harvest, rapid cane growth, and widespread abundance below 1100 m, current harvest rates exceed growth and yield, and supplies of cane are being depleted. Rattan harvesting is widespread in Lore Lindu National Park. Approximately 18% of the park (42,000 ha) is likely subject to intensive and unsustainable extraction of C. zollingeri.

TI  - Habitat Associations and Community Structure of Dipterocarps in Response to Environment and Soil Conditions in Brunei Darussalam, Northwest Borneo
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Plant habitat associations are well documented in Bornean lowland tropical forests, but few studies contrast the prevalence of associations across sites. We examined habitat associations and community composition of Dipterocarpaceae trees in two contrasting Bornean lowland mixed dipterocarp forests separated by approximately 100 similar to km: Andulau (uniform topography, lower altitudinal range, sandy soils) and Belalong (highly dissected topography, higher altitudinal range, clay-rich soils). Dipterocarpaceae trees =similar to 1 similar to cm diameter at breast height (dbh) were censused in 20-m wide belt transects established along topographic gradients at each site. Dipterocarp density, evenness, species richness, and diversity were significantly higher at Andulau than Belalong. Significant site associations (with either Andulau or Belalong) were detected for 19 (52%) of the 37 dipterocarp species tested. Dipterocarpaceae community composition at Belalong correlated with soil nutrient concentrations as well as measures of vegetation and topographic structure, but community composition at Andulau correlated with fewer habitat variables. Within each site, dipterocarp density, species richness, and diversity were consistently higher on ridges than in slopes and valleys. Significant within-site associations to topographic habitats were less common at Andulau (10% of species tested) than at Belalong (15%). We conclude that edaphic and other environmental factors influence dipterocarp community composition at a local scale, and are more important drivers of community structure in the more variable environment at Belalong. Species richness and diversity of dipterocarps on small plots, however, were higher at Andulau, suggesting that factors other than environmental heterogeneity contribute to contrasts in dipterocarp tree species richness at small scales.

TI  - Monitoring of a Seedling Planting Restoration in a Permanent Preservation Area of the Southeast Atlantic Forest Biome, Brazil
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - The Atlantic Forest biome is a biodiversity hotspot with only 13% of its native vegetation cover remaining in Brazil. Forest restoration is an important process for the re-establishment of biodiversity and the preservation of water resources in degraded areas, like riparian forests. Monitoring is an essential step of restoration, because the periodic evaluation of indicators allows researchers to analyze the effectiveness of applied techniques. This study aimed to evaluate the environmental quality of a seedling planting (active restoration) in a Permanent Preservation Area (PPA) of the Southeast Atlantic Forest biome, through a monitoring protocol, within a year. More specifically, we aimed to investigate the following questions: (1) do some ecological groups or families grow more than others? and (2) is the cover of exotic grasses negatively influencing forest regeneration? Data were collected during November 2017 and April (interval represents five months of wet season) and October 2018 (six months of dry season). Eight plots of 9 x 18 m were established and all individuals were identified and measured (diameter at ground level (DGL), height (H), and canopy diameter (CD)). Exotic grass cover and richness of regenerating species were also recorded. We registered 119 individuals during the three inventories, distributed in 35 species and 14 families. Results indicate an inverse association between exotic grasses and the presence of recruits in the area. Thus, exotic grass control may be needed while the forest canopy is not closed. A significant growth of individuals in the whole study period, especially during the wet season, was detected. Legumes grew more in trunk and canopy diameter (Anadenanthera colubrina (Vell.) Brenan and Inga vera Willd. subsp. affinis (DC.) T. D. Penn. had the biggest growth, respectively) than non-legumes during wetter months and within a year. Pioneers had greater height increase compared to non-pioneers only during wetter months. Legumes may be important species to be used in other young tropical forest restoration areas.

TI  - Multifunctionality, social benefits, and engagement: insights for forest restoration success from a study case in Brazil
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Social, economic, and ecological aspects must be considered for ecological restoration projects to be successful. Multifunctionality, achieved when restored ecosystems have multiple uses, is the desired goal for these projects. Understanding people's perceptions of forest restoration is essential to advance the debate on stakeholder acceptance and engagement. Based on a 30-year case study of forest restoration on a university campus in Brazil, we assessed (1) how project objectives relate to contemporary multifunctionality and social attributes; (2) how the current state of the forest meets social goals; and (3) how stakeholders perceive the importance of the forest and the project itself. We used documents, interviews, and questionnaires, applying content analysis and narrative interpretation with the "social benefits wheel" and the "five-star social system" to assess how the initial project objectives corresponded to contemporary social development goals and its progress toward social goals. The results revealed that socioecological goals were incorporated from the beginning of the project, ensuring a multifunctional approach. Respondents highlighted ecological, social, and cultural functions, with 84% expressing positive feelings toward the forest. Ecosystem services, especially regulatory and cultural benefits, were recognized as the most valuable. Although academic use was significant, nonmaterial values, such as cultural and emotional connections, were more prominent. The study concludes that a well-planned restoration project involving the local community generates lasting support for ecological restoration. This information strongly supports Brazil's voluntary reforestation targets proposed in the Paris Agreement.

TI  - Use of woody species in the Caatinga dry forest may lead to higher vulnerability to extirpation: An assessment based on ethnobiological, reproductive and conservation criteria
T2  - FLORA
AB  - Tropical forests play an important role in maintaining, replenishing and conserving a large portion of the planet's biodiversity. However, these forests have been converted into anthropic landscapes, threatening the persistence of wildlife. The exploitation of forest products can result in different ecological impacts at different levels of biological organization. In this study, we propose a vulnerability index to examine the susceptibility of woody plants used by locals in a human-modified landscape of the Caatinga dry forest (i.e., the Catimbau National Park). We contrasted patterns of (1) plant use by local people (risk of use, collection risk, local importance, and diversity of use), (2) plant reproductive strategies (pollination, sexual and reproductive systems, dispersal mode, flowering and fruiting phenology), and (3) the conservation status of the plant species. We combined this information to propose a vulnerability index expressing species sensitivity to human disturbances in 14 regenerating and 14 old-growth forest stands. We tested the hypothesis that regenerating forest stands will harbor more vulnerable plant species compared to old-growth forest stands. Among the 119 plant species registered in regenerating and old-growth forest stands, 80 species (67.2 %) were recorded as useful for local people in Caatinga. Specifically, about 71.8 % and 70.5 % are exploited by the rural population for some type of use in regenerating and old-growth forest stands, respectively. The most frequent type of use was medicinal, followed by construction and fuel in both regenerating and old-growth forest stands. Regarding the potentially collected plant parts, the total removal of the individual and collection of leaves exhibited similar and higher relevance in regenerating, while leaves were the most collected part in old-growth forest stands. Of the 80 plant species analyzed, 62 % and 58.5 %, respectively, were classified as exhibiting moderate and high vulnerability to extirpation in regenerating and old-growth forest stands; thus not supporting our hypothesis. Our results suggest that in the Caatinga dry forest, (1) woody plant species responsible for forest regeneration in the context of slash- and-burn agriculture are exploited for multiple uses, (2) medicinal use is the main type of use of woody plants occurring in regenerating and old-growth forest stands, (3) total removal of the individual and collection of leaves were the most collected plant parts, and (4) both regenerating and old-growth forest stands showed a high vulnerability to human disturbances in the study area. In the long term, the exploitation of vulnerable plant species may negatively affect the composition and structure of the community and, consequently, the rate and trajectory of succession. It can be expected that as populations of vulnerable plant species are reduced or extirpated from the community, ecological interactions such as pollination and dispersal, which are key to ecosystem maintenance, will change along with the services provided.

TI  - Land use effects on tree species diversity and soil properties of the Awudua Forest, Ghana
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Rubber plantation establishment is a common land use that can profoundly impact plant diversity and soil properties in tropical forest ecosystems, although empirical data on such effects are scarce in tropical Africa. In this study, we examined the effects of this land use on tree species diversity and soil physicochemical properties of the Awudua Forest in Ghana. We surveyed 60 25 m x 25 m plots, 20 in each of three land uses (i.e., primary forest, secondary forest and rubber plantation) of the study area. Within each plot, we identified and enumerated all trees (>= 10 cm diameter at breast height, dbh at 1.3 m) and collected soil samples at three depths (i.e., 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm) for the determination of soil physicochemical properties (bulk density, particle size distribution, pH, OC, TN, AP, K, Mg, Ca). Soil physicochemical properties; sand, OC, AP, K, Mg, Ca in the rubber plantation decreased by 4.4%, 24.9%, 40.0%, 16.7%, 50.0% and 20.2% respectively, whereas the primary forest recorded decreases in OC (42.2%), TN (25%), AP (71.1%), K (69%), Mg (59.6%), Ca (27%) from the surface to the sub layers. Results showed significantly lower tree species richness (S, 12), diversity (H', 0.37), evenness (E, 0.43), and basal area (BA, 2.86 m(2)/ha) in the rubber plantation compared to those of the secondary forest (36, 1.10, 0.85 and 0.93 m(2) ha(-1), respectively) and the primary forest (46, 2.28, 0.97, and 3.32 m(2) ha(-1), respectively). Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination also revealed distinct tree species composition among the land uses. Terminalia ivorensis (IVI = 7.1%), Musanga cecropoides (28.91%) and Hevea brasiliensis (72.03%) were the most dominant species in the primary forest, secondary forest and plantation respectively. Soil OC, TN, K, AP, Mg and bulk density differed among the land uses, but no differences were observed in pH and Ca. The findings confirmed the strong negative impacts of rubber plantation land use on plant diversity and soil properties, suggesting the need for mitigation measures such as afforestation and offsetting to ensure sustainable utilization and conservation of biodiversity in the reserve.

TI  - Ecological outcomes and livelihood benefits of community-managed agroforests and second growth forests in Southeast Brazil
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - The Forest and Landscape Restoration movement has emerged as an approach to reconcile biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services provisioning and human well-being in degraded landscapes, but little is known so far about the potential of different reforestation methods to achieve these objectives. Based on this gap, we assessed the ecological outcomes and local livelihood benefits of community-managed agroforests and second growth forests to assist natural regeneration in the coastal Atlantic Forest of Brazil. We investigated and compared agroforests and secondary forests according to their structure and floristic composition in 51 circular plots of 314 m(2), their role in supporting local livelihoods (45 semi-structured interviews) and the use and cultural importance of plant species (61 interviews). Agroforests and, more remarkably, managed secondary forests (1) re-established a well-developed forest structure, with a higher density of tree-sized individuals and similar basal area compared to nearby old growth forests; (2) were composed by a rich array of native species, including five threatened species, but had lower species richness than old growth remnants; and (3) improved local livelihoods by supplying market valuable and culturally important plants, including 231 native ethnospecies. Overall, local production systems showed remarkable potential to engage smallholders of developing tropical countries in Forest and Landscape Restoration and contribute to achieve its overall goals. We advocate the promotion of these systems as effective Forest and Landscape Restoration approaches in multi-scale programs and policies.

TI  - Modeling and Mapping Agroforestry Aboveground Biomass in the Brazilian Amazon Using Airborne Lidar Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Agroforestry has large potential for carbon (C) sequestration while providing many economical, social, and ecological benefits via its diversified products. Airborne lidar is considered as the most accurate technology for mapping aboveground biomass (AGB) over landscape levels. However, little research in the past has been done to study AGB of agroforestry systems using airborne lidar data. Focusing on an agroforestry system in the Brazilian Amazon, this study first predicted plot-level AGB using fixed-effects regression models that assumed the regression coefficients to be constants. The model prediction errors were then analyzed from the perspectives of tree DBH (diameter at breast height)height relationships and plot-level wood density, which suggested the need for stratifying agroforestry fields to improve plot-level AGB modeling. We separated teak plantations from other agroforestry types and predicted AGB using mixed-effects models that can incorporate the variation of AGB-height relationship across agroforestry types. We found that, at the plot scale, mixed-effects models led to better model prediction performance (based on leave-one-out cross-validation) than the fixed-effects models, with the coefficient of determination (R-2) increasing from 0.38 to 0.64. At the landscape level, the difference between AGB densities from the two types of models was similar to 10% on average and up to similar to 30% at the pixel level. This study suggested the importance of stratification based on tree AGB allometry and the utility of mixed-effects models in modeling and mapping AGB of agroforestry systems.

TI  - Stone walls and sacred forest conservation in Ethiopia
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Many tropical forests worldwide are protected due to their sacredness to religious communities. In the south Gondar region of Ethiopia, most of the remaining native forests are tiny fragments (5.42 ha +/- 0.34) surrounded by pasture and agriculture that are protected because they encompass churches of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church (EOTC). A small number of communities have erected stone walls around the perimeter of the forests to demarcate the boundary, and/or protect the interior of the forest. We evaluated the effectiveness of these walls at protecting ecological conditions by examining tree and seedling communities among sacred forests with and without walls in Montane and Upper Montane sites. We found the wall to be an effective conservation tool as regeneration potential was higher in forests with a wall. The density and species richness of seedlings were significantly higher in forests with a wall and these effects were more pronounced in Upper Montane forests. Forests with a wall also had seedlings of many native tree species that were not found in forests without walls. As expected, there were few differences in tree communities in forests with and without a wall. Although rare on the landscape, the presence of a stone wall around these forests was effective at protecting the seedling community because it likely reduced access to the forests by grazers and directed human visitors to trails. The use of a stone wall may protect seedling communities in other sacred forest fragments, particularly for those that are small, isolated, surrounded by agriculture, and have a depleted seed bank.

TI  - A framework for integrating biodiversity concerns into national REDD+ programmes
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - The UNFCCC mechanism for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation in developing countries (REDD+) represents an unprecedented opportunity for the conservation of forest biodiversity. Nevertheless, there are widespread concerns surrounding the possibility of negative environmental outcomes if biodiversity is not given adequate consideration throughout the REDD+ process. We propose a general framework for incorporating biodiversity concerns into national REDD+ programmes based on well-established ecological principles and experiences. First, we identify how biodiversity distribution and threat data, together with data on biodiversity responses to forest change and management, can be readily incorporated into the strategic planning process for REDD+ in order to identify priority areas and activities for investment that will deliver returns for both carbon and biodiversity. Second, we propose that assessments of changes in biodiversity following REDD+ implementation could be greatly facilitated by paralleling, where possible, the existing IPCC architecture for assessing carbon emissions. A three-tiered approach is proposed for biodiversity assessment, where lower tiers can provide a realistic starting point for countries with fewer data and lower technical capacities. Planning and assessment of biodiversity safeguards for REDD+ need not overburden an already encumbered UNFCCC process. Immediate progress is already possible for a large number of developing countries, and a gradual, phased approach to implementation would minimise risks and facilitate the protection of additional biodiversity benefits from REDD+ activities. Greater levels of coordination between the UNFCCC and CBD, as well as other agencies and stakeholder groups interested in forest conservation are needed if biodiversity safeguards are to be fully adopted and implemented.

TI  - Unveiling economic dimensions of peatland restoration in Indonesia: A systematic literature review
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
AB  - Indonesian peatlands play a critical role in global carbon storage and biodiversity conservation, but they face significant ongoing threat of degradation and loss due to human-induced pressures, including the development of industrial plantations, agricultural expansion, extractive forestry practices, and recurrent fires. The imperative to restore these peatlands is significant, but the restoration effort has, so far, been underwhelming. This paper systematically reviews studies that have assessed the economic costs and benefits of peatland restoration in Indonesia. It summarizes the substantial economic stakes involved in peatland restoration efforts, ranging from millions to billions of dollars. The collective findings emphasize the significant costs required for restoration, alongside the potential economic benefits derived from environmental conservation, climate change mitigation, and sustainable land management. These economic valuations are complemented by a holistic consideration of ecological, social, and cultural factors, providing valuable insights for policymakers and decision-makers. However, while these studies have offered valuable insights into various aspects such as local preferences, willingness to pay, financial costs, and potential economic benefits, none have comprehensively explored the potential trade-offs or forgone opportunities resulting from the proposed restoration programs. This is a critical gap in current research and practice. We illustrate the need for more systemic learning about how peatlands are valued to advance a transition towards healthier peatlands in Indonesia.

TI  - Spatial variation in human disturbances and their effects on forest structure and biodiversity across an Afromontane forest
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB  - Context Human disturbances can have large impacts on forest structure and biodiversity, and thereby result in forest degradation, a property difficult to detect by remote sensing. Objectives To investigate spatial variation in anthropogenic disturbances and their effects on forest structure and biodiversity. Methods In 144 plots of 20 x 20 m distributed across a forest area of 750 km(2) in Southwest Ethiopia, we recorded: landscape variables (e.g., distance to forest edge), different human disturbances, forest structure variables, and species composition of trees and epiphyllous bryophytes. We then first assessed if landscape variables could explain the spatial distribution of disturbances. Second, we analysed how forest structure and biodiversity were influenced by disturbances. Results Human disturbances, such as coffee management and grazing declined with distance to forest edges, and penetrated at least a kilometer into the forest. Slope was not related to disturbance levels, but several types of disturbances were less common at higher elevations. Among human disturbance types, coffee management reduced liana cover and was associated with altered species composition of trees. The presence of large trees and basal area were not related to any of the disturbance gradients. Conclusions Although most anthropogenic disturbances displayed clear edge effects, surprisingly the variation in the chosen forest degradation indices were only weakly related to these disturbances. We suggest that the intersection between edge effects and forest degradation is very context specific and relies much on how particular societies use the forests. For example, in this landscape coffee management seems to be a key driver.

TI  - 15-year fertilization increased soil organic carbon stock even in systems reputed to be saturated like permanent grassland on andosols
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Previous long-term experiments conducted more than 10 years ago, showed that long-term application of organic fertilizer increased soil organic carbon (SOC) of grasslands. However, it was usually assumed that, independent of the successive additions of fertilizer, soils have an upper limit to their SOC due to the inability of the soil mineral phase to fix additional carbon. Andosols of the volcanic Reunion Island are typically very rich in carbon and are usually considered as saturated in SOC. To assess the long-term effect of different types of fertilization on SOC in these soils, SOC concentrations were recorded at yearly intervals for 15 years in one arenosol site and in two andosols sites across a topo-sequence. The types of fertilization tested included inorganic, organic, and a mix of inorganic and organic nutrient sources. The addition of organic fertilizers increased soil carbon in the top (0-15 cm) horizon in both the arenosol and the two andosols (up to +250% in the arenosol and up to +41% in the andosol), whereas inorganic fertilizers and the control treatment did not always result in a significant in-crease in SOC. After 15 years, no plateau was reached in C stocks even with the highest fertilization rates. Our results suggest that the increase in SOC was mainly caused by direct carbon inputs, while the effect of the in-crease in litter resulting from the increase in yield caused by fertilization, remained uncertain. In the andosol, all the fertilization treatments led to higher concentrations of carbon in the deeper layers. This suggests that SOC inputs lead to downward migration of OC to deep horizons. For C-rich soils like andosols, assessing the variations in carbon in the deep horizon is thus critical in estimating the effects of soil management on carbon sequestration.

TI  - Impact of forest disturbance and land use change on soil and litter arthropod assemblages in tropical rainforest margins
T2  - STABILITY OF TROPICAL RAINFOREST MARGINS: LINKING ECOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONSTRAINTS OF LAND USE AND CONSERVATION
CP  - International Symposium on Stability of Tropical Rainforest Margins
AB  - Land use intensification at rainforest margins increases the pressure on the primary rainforest ecosystem, known for its high biodiversity and important functional role in global climate and carbon balances. Studying this system at different levels of disturbance increases our knowledge about its stability and mechanisms of diversity changes. While most studies investigating the effects of disturbance on animal populations focus on canopy communities, the present study reviews the driving factors for soil and litter arthropod communities. In addition, results from a study along a land use gradient in Central Sulawesi (Indonesia) will be discussed.
   Within natural forests, litter composition, patchiness and especially litter abundance seem to be key factors driving litter arthropod diversity and densities, by creating microhabitats for many species and individuals. With increasing levels of disturbance in tropical forests, and with forest conversion into agroforestry and agricultural systems, soil/litter temperature and moisture levels become extremely important, leading to reduced densities and species richness. Changes of soil pH, a reduction of the litter habitat and increased anthropogenic disturbance via site management practices add to degradation. In the present study, litter arthropod communities were compared between three levels of forest use (none, small and large timber extraction) and two types of cacao plantations (under natural shade trees and under a polyculture of planted shade trees). The negative effects of increasing gap fraction and thus increasing temperatures accompanied by decreasing moisture levels and litter depth could be confirmed. Abundances of Collembola, Oribatida and Symphyla in litter and soil and the number of ant species in the litter declined with increasing land use intensity. In contrast, spider density and ant activity increased when natural forest sites were compared with the two types of cacao plantations. This can be explained by the shifting community structure of these two taxa, indicating that few, but abundant species of open habitats, such as Lycosidae, were replacing forest species. Surprisingly, the decline in microarthropod abundances along the land use gradient was not linearly correlated with decreasing moisture and litter depth or increasing temperature or litter quality (C-to-N ratio). Rather low microarthropod densities were already measured in little disturbed natural forest sites with small timber extraction. A similar pattern was observed for fungal abundances and root production, indicating that even small levels of disturbance influence the litter and soil system in tropical forests. On the one hand, changing micro-climate, limited litter space, reduced availability of microbial resources and increased disturbance by plot maintenance inhibit higher densities of litter and soil animal populations. On the other hand, the simplified habitat structure favours populations of open habitats, especially predatory groups adapted to higher temperatures and/or lower soil moisture. It has to be investigated how a reduction of decomposers and an increase in predators could influence pest control and thus yields in these agroforestry systems.

TI  - Potential for Farmers' Cooperatives to Convert Coffee Husks into Biochar and Promote the Bioeconomy in the North Ecuadorian Amazon
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - Featured Application
   Agricultural wastes generated in farmers' cooperatives constitute valuable resources for the bioeconomy and can be recycled into biochar to contribute to the implementation of economically and environmentally sustainable agricultural production in the forests of the Ecuadorian Amazon.
   Improving the livelihoods of communities living in fragile ecosystems, such as tropical forests, is among the main strategies to promote their conservation and preserve wildlife. In the Ecuadorian Amazon, farmers' cooperatives are recognized as an important mechanism to improve the socioeconomic conditions of local communities. This study analyzes the integration of pyrolysis processes to convert agricultural waste into biochar as a way to implement the bioeconomy in these organizations. We found that post-harvesting processes in the studied farmers' cooperatives are similar, and coffee husks are a potential feedstock to produce biochar. Although the environmental policies in Ecuador consider the valorization of agricultural waste, we did not find any specific standard to regulate the operation of pyrolysis facilities. Nonetheless, conversion of agricultural waste into biochar can contribute to (i) replacement of subsidized fossil fuels used in drying processes, (ii) prevention of environmental pollution caused by accumulation of waste, (iii) emergence of new income sources linked with the provision of carbon sequestration services, and (iv) the long-term maintenance of soil fertility. Currently, demonstration projects are needed to stimulate collaboration among farmers' cooperatives, academia, the government, international cooperation agencies, and existing forest conservation initiatives.

TI  - Effects of an invasive tree on community structure and diversity in a tropical forest in Puerto Rico
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - We report the effects of an invasive tree (Syzgium jambos, Myrtaceace) on species composition, plant diversity patterns, and forest regeneration in primary and secondary forest in the Luquillo Mountains of northeastern Puerto Rico, including the area in and around the Caribbean National Forest (CNF) and the Luquillo Long Term Ecological Research site (Luquillo LTER). Land use history was reconstructed using aerial photographs from 1936 to 1989 and study sites were categorized into four groups that corresponded to their status in 1936: unforested, young secondary. mature secondary, and primary forests. In randomly selected forest stands in each forest type, we measured the abundance of invasive and native tree species, seedling recruitment for S. jambos as well as soil nutrient pools and tested for the effects of land use history on S. jambos density and diversity. A partial Mantel test was used to control for historical and elevational differences across study sites. The results indicate that S. jambos density was highest in habitats classified in 1936 as unforested, young, or mature secondary forests. Compared to all other forest classes, species diversity was significantly higher in primary forests. However, there was no statistically significant difference between observed and estimated species richness across the four forest types. S. jambos density and species diversity were strongly negatively correlated. even after controlling for land use history and elevation. There was significantly higher S. jambos seedling recruitment in areas that were either unforested or had young secondary forests in 1936. The results also indicate that S. jambos is able to establish viable populations in habitats with different soil nutrient status. S. jambos has also altered vegetation composition and diversity patterns in habitats where it is the dominant tree species. After nearly 185 years since its introduction to the island, S. jambos is not only well established within 30 in of stream channels. its presence does not appear to be limited by topographic, soil nutrient, or elevational conditions. This study suggests that land use change and subsequent plant invasions have produced a new vegetation assemblage that has led to potentially long-term changes in community structure, species composition. and successional trajectory in regenerating secondary forests in the Luquillo Mountains.

TI  - Biodiversity of Tamaulipan thornscrub in relation to fragmentation
T2  - NORTH AMERICAN SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM: TOWARD A UNIFIED FRAMEWORK FOR INVENTORYING AND MONITORING FOREST ECOSYSTEM RESOURCES
CP  - North American Science Symposium on Toward a Unified Framework for Inventorying and Monitoring Forest Ecosystem Resources
AB  - Tamaulipan thornscrub has often been removed in northeastern Mexico to give way to agriculture and induced grasslands for cattle. This results in over 90% of thornscrub being either removed or severely modified, with a few remaining fragments varying in size and distance to nearby fragments (isolation). Fragment size ranges from isolated trees in induced buffel grasslands to 300 ha of "continuous vegetation".
   Remaining fragments are by no means conserved, as they are over-utilized for grazing goats, extraction of timber, fuel-wood and medicinal plants. Ecosystem fragmentation and isolation of fragments has an impact on the dynamics of thornscrub by reducing population sizes, promoting genetic erosion, and perhaps local extinction of species with large habitat requirements.
   In here we present same measurements of plant, bird, ante, and beetles diversity, as well as some implications on seed parasitism, removal and dispersal Results contrast species richness under isolated Prosopis and Ebenopsis trees and thornscrub fragments from less than 10 to over 100 ha. Preliminary results imply that fragment size is not related to species number, but to ecosystem function. Seed removal rates were slower under isolated mesquite trees than under similar trees in continuous vegetation. Seed production was higher for isolated mesquite trees than for similar size ones inside continuous vegetation. Seed parasitism (while still inside the vines) was higher far the latter.

TI  - Change in Land Use Affects Soil Organic Carbon Dynamics and Distribution in Tropical Systems
T2  - SOIL SYSTEMS
AB  - Anthropogenic land cover change is directly responsible for the deforestation and degradation of tropical forests. In this context, assessing soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks is key to understanding the impact of anthropogenic activities on SOC so that we can implement management practices that effectively reduce emissions or promote carbon sequestration. Our objective was to assess the effect of land-use change on the dynamics and distribution of SOC in three systems (agriculture, pasture and agroforestry) after 40 years of deforestation in a tropical dry forest in the central-eastern region of Honduras. For this purpose, the bulk density, percentage of coarse fragments (>2 mm) and soil organic carbon content were determined at three depths (0.00-0.10 m, 0.10-0.20 m and 0.20-0.30 m). The results showed an increase in bulk density for all new uses, although soil compaction had not yet occurred. In terms of total soil organic carbon (TOC) stocks, deforestation caused a decrease from 17% to 48% in agricultural and agroforestry soils, respectively; on the other hand, grasslands did not show significant differences compared to tropical dry forest, suggesting that they have a high potential as carbon sinks in deforested tropical areas. However, this did not imply a better state of the system, as the greatest increases in bulk density were found in pastures.

TI  - Diversity and ecosystem functioning: Litter decomposition dynamics in the Atlantic Rainforest
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - The relationship between ecosystem functioning and species diversity is important for conservation and restoration management of endangered ecosystems. Here we experimentally analysed the effects of tree species richness and composition on the fundamental ecosystem process of leaf litter decomposition in the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest. We measured the decomposition rates of leaf litter of eight broad-leaved, native tree species either individually or in mixtures of two, four, or six species. Additionally, we analysed the effect of macro- and meso-invertebrate exclusion using coarse- and fine-meshed litter bags. Species composition, but not species richness, significantly influenced litter decomposition rates. Invertebrate exclusion also influenced litter decomposition, although this effect varied between species and mixtures. Overall, litter decomposition dynamics was non-additive, i.e. observed decomposition rates of litter mixtures differed from what would be expected from the decomposition rates of their component species. However, there were also differences between mixtures, which could be at least partly attributed to the varying influence of invertebrates. We conclude that the relationship between the decomposition subsystem and species diversity in the Atlantic Rainforest follows the idiosyncratic response hypothesis and not the rivet hypothesis. For conservation or reforestation management, our results emphasise the need to maintain or restore the composition of locally native tree species communities rather than to maintain only a high tree species richness.

TI  - Woody species diversity and aboveground carbon stocks in agroforestry systems in Burkina Faso
T2  - DISCOVER SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - In the semi-arid areas of West Africa, agroforestry systems (AFS) play a crucial role in livelihood support and climate change mitigation. Yet, in Burkina Faso, these ecosystems are insufficiently accounted for in national efforts to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide due to the scarcity of data about their carbon storage potential. This study aimed to assess woody species diversity and aboveground carbon stocks in AFS across three climatic zones of Burkina Faso. Dendrometric measurements of 4733 individuals were carried out using a systematic sampling design in 180 farmlands sampled across the Sahel, Sudan-Sahel, and Sudan climatic zones of Burkina Faso, with 60 farmlands per climatic zone. Diversity indices were used to assess woody species diversity, dendrometric measurements were used to estimate aboveground carbon stocks of woody species using allometric equation. The findings showed a gamma-diversity of 71 woody species belonging to 53 genera and 25 families across the three climatic zones. Species richness (S = 6.53), Shannon's index and Simpson's index (H = 1.26; D = 0.59) were highest in the Sudan-Sahel zone. However, the mean aboveground carbon stocks increased from the Sahel zone (2.3 to 3.4 Mg C ha(-1)) to the Sudan zone (6.1 to 8.1 Mg C ha(-1)). Carbon stock was positively correlated with stand density (0.56 < r < 0.61) and diversity (S, H, D) (0.3 < r < 0.41), highlighting the positive relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. This study highlights the co-benefits associated with policies maintaining stand diversity and carbon storage in AFS as a mean to increase the resilience of these systems to changing environmental conditions.

TI  - The sustainable management and protection of forests: Analysis of the current position globally
T2  - AMBIO
AB  - The loss of forest area globally due to change of land use, the importance of forests in the conservation of biodiversity and in carbon and other biogeochemical cycles, together with the threat to forests from pollution and from the impacts of climate change, place forestry policy and practice at the center of global environmental and sustainability strategy. Forests provide important economic, environmental, social, and cultural benefits, so that in forestry, as in other areas of environmental policy and management, there are tensions between economic development and environmental protection. In this article we review the current information on global forest cover and condition, examine the international processes that relate to forest protection and to sustainable forest management, and look at the main forest certification schemes. We consider the link between the international processes and certification schemes and also their combined effectiveness. We conclude that in some regions of the world neither mechanism is achieving forest protection, while in others local or regional implementation is occurring and is having a significant impact. Choice of certification scheme and implementation of management standards are often influenced by a consideration of the associated costs, and there are some major issues over the monitoring of agreed actions and of the criteria and indicators of sustainability. There are currently a number of initiatives seeking to improve the operation of the international forestry framework (e.g., The Montreal Process, the Ministerial Convention of the Protection of Forests in Europe and European Union actions in Europe, the African Timber Organisation and International Tropical Timber Organisation initiative for African tropical forest, and the development of a worldwide voluntary agreement on forestry in the United Nations Forum on Forests). We suggest that there is a need to improve the connections between scientific understanding, policy development, and forestry practice, and also the cooperation between the various international initiatives and processes, so that the international framework is more effective and its influence is extended geographically.

TI  - NDVI - alpha diversity relationship in tropical montane cloud forest of Ecuador
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - In tropical forest the biodiversity is in a constant threat, some species are listed in the IUCN as vulnerable, endangered or threatened with extinction. Thus, a fast method for biodiversity determination or monitoring can contribute to its conservation. Remote sensing has demonstrated to be a powerful tool, and together with the vegetation indexes, can determine the vegetation state of forest. Recently researches have correlated the normalized differentiated vegetation index (NDVI) with species richness, structure and biodiversity of forests obtaining successful results.
   This study, conducted in a Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (TMCF) of Ecuador, aims to correlate NDVI with alpha diversity estimators to understand its relationships. NDVI of Landsat OLI 8 Level 1 images in five months was determined. We considered a scene as valid in case of cloud coverage in the areas of interest below 25%. Radiometric and atmospheric corrections, with flaash tool, and the delimitation of the study site (ROI) were developed in ENVI 5.3 program. NDVI was calculated with ENVI 5.3 program (histograms allowed the determination of mean, maximum and minimum NDVI), and with ArcGIS 10.3 (for classification index). In field, species richness, Chao1, Shannon index, Simpson index, and biomass of three plots were quantified for trees with D13H >= 10 cm. Then, we calculate Pearson coefficient to correlate and disentangle the effects of altitude, diversity, richness, biomass and N DV I. A positive relationship was observed between Mean NDVI and Chao1 (p < 0.10) and Mean NDVI - richness (p < 0.05). In conclusion, NDVI can be considered useful to estimate richness and biodiversity and even to detect ecotone as was the case in this research. The application of this methodology could allow biodiversity assessment and monitoring in real time and low cost, which contributes in forest conservation programs.

TI  - Reconciling policy instruments with drivers of deforestation and forest degradation: cross-scale analysis of stakeholder perceptions in tropical countries
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Cross-scale studies combining information on policy instruments and on drivers of deforestation and forest degradation are key to design and implement effective forest protection measures. We investigated the scale and country dependency of stakeholder perceptions about future threats to tropical forests (e.g. agriculture, logging, woodfuel) and preferred policy instruments (e.g. reforestation, protected areas, combat illegal logging), by interviewing 224 representatives of forest-related institutions. We conducted analysis of variance and principal component analysis for eighteen variables across three countries (Zambia, Ecuador and the Philippines) and four spatial levels (from international to local). We found that the overall alertness about commercial drivers and the confidence in policy instruments are significantly lower at subnational levels and also in Zambia. Stakeholder expectations about the most important drivers and the most effective policies in the coming decade follow regional narratives, suggesting that there are no one-size-fits-all solutions in international forest policy. However, we found an unexpected consensus across scales, indicating potential for collaboration between institutions operating at different geographical levels. Overall, agriculture remains the driver with the highest expected influence (43%), while a strong favoritism for reforestation and forest restoration (38%) suggests a paradigm shift from protected areas to a stronger focus on integrative approaches.

TI  - Seed Rain in a Tropical Dry Forest and Adjacent Home Gardens in the Yucatan
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - Tropical home gardens are widely recognized as reservoirs of biodiversity. Typically, Maya home gardens have an area of intensive management and one of extensive management. In the latter, some wild plant species may find safe sites for establishment, since they exhibit a high degree of similarity (in terms in plant species composition) to the surrounding forest and are dominated by plants with fleshy fruit. Therefore, this may attract frugivorous animals, which in turn may generate some seed rain. The objective of our study was to compare seed rain in the extensively managed areas of home gardens and in the surrounding forest during the fruiting peak in a rural landscape in the Yucatan. We assessed seed rain using seed traps in two habitats: the extensively managed areas of home gardens and an adjacent tropical forest. Seed rain was more abundant, denser and more diverse in the home gardens than in the adjacent forest. Approximately one quarter of the seeds recorded are from species shared between the forest and home gardens, suggesting there is notable seed exchange between these habitats. Also 50% of the seed species exclusively found in home gardens are allochthonous, likely rare species from the forest. In general, our results suggest that home gardens-particularly their extensively managed areas-are effective seed traps for forest species.

TI  - Extent change of protected mangrove forest and its relation to wave power exposure on Aldabra Atoll
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Mangrove forests, vital for the conservation of biodiversity, protection of coastlines, and carbon capture, are decreasing globally at a rate higher than most other tropical forests. They are threatened by sea level rise, drought and storm surge, especially on low-lying islands where forests are directly exposed to the elements and have limited land area. We investigated changes in the spatial extent of mangroves on Aldabra Atoll, Seychelles - a protected area without direct human pressures, over 21 years using Landsat images. Over the 21-year study period, mean mangrove extent was 1283 ha with an overall net increase of 60 ha (0.23% year(-1)). The majority of extent changes were small (< 2 ha) and contiguous to the existing mangrove extent. We then assessed the relation of mangrove cover change along the lagoon coastline with wave power (rate of energy transfer by waves), using fetch measures and local wind data. We found lower wave power values for stable mangrove areas than for areas that had gained or lost mangroves from 1997 to 2018. We identified wave power thresholds of 2.3 W m(-1) for stable mangrove and 7.1 W m(-1) for mangrove occurrence. These thresholds might be valuable for assessing threats and sites with the greatest potential for mangrove restoration across similar areas worldwide. Our results highlight the importance of quantifying mangrove extent changes at a local scale to assist with planning for the protection and restoration of this ecologically important habitat, given its vulnerability to the pressures associated with climate change.

TI  - Are we selecting appropriate metrics to assess human impacts on biodiversity?
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Biased and subjective choices of metrics to be used in ecological studies could lead researchers to reach misleading conclusions regarding patterns of biodiversity response to human disturbances. Nevertheless, little attention has been given to the choices of variables in the majority of studies published to date. Here, we used the literature concerning land use change effects on dung beetles to assess the extent to which variables commonly employed in ecological studies correspond to those deemed to be most important by researchers of the same studies. Specifically, we examined both biodiversity (response) and environmental (explanatory) metrics from a comprehensive literature review and compared their use with their relative importance, according to a survey of the authors of the studies. Our results highlight marked disparities between researchers opinion expressed in our survey and their choice of variables in published papers. We suggest that these disparities are due to the high costs of sampling and processing some variables, logistical constraints and different perceptions of importance amongst researchers. We highlight the importance of these issues for our understanding of the biodiversity consequences of land use change, and highlight some recommendations for alleviating this issue.

TI  - Rural household participation in illegal timber felling in a protected area of West Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Illegal logging is a threat to tropical forests in protected areas, yet the factors motivating it need to be better understood. Here, rural household participation in timber felling in the Barisan I Nature Reserve (West Sumatra) was described, the household contextual factors relating to this participation analysed and the importance of these activities to the household income assessed. Nearly 19% of the sampled households cut or hauled timber in the Reserve, and the demand for cash encouraged participation. Alternative livelihoods such as livestock raising and agroforestry intensification outside the Reserve could reduce the need for timber felling. Knowledge about legal status of the Reserve did not affect the odds of a household engaging in timber harvesting, but greater awareness of the Reserve resulted in lower levels of income from timber. Development policy that seeks to provide livelihood alternatives to timber felling households could reduce dependence on timber and contribute to forest conservation in the Reserve. Moreover, conservation outcomes should improve if control over the protection and enforcement of the Reserve is co-managed between the government and the local communities.

TI  - The diversity of birds in the young oil palm agroforestry plot in Jambi, Indonesia
T2  - 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN AGROFORESTRY 2022
CP  - 4th International Conference in Agroforestry (ICAF) - Agroforestry for Sustainable and Resilient Communities
AB  - By 2010, Sumatera Island of Indonesia had lost the highest annual forest cover due to oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) expansion, leading to adverse environmental impacts. The introduction of oil palm agroforestry (OPAF) within the social forestry program was to reduce these environmental impacts, conserve biodiversity, enhance wildlife habitat, and improve smallholder household resilience. However, the information on OPAF implementation progress and its benefits and ecological impacts still need to be explored. This research aims to measure the diversity of birds in young OPAF by comparing birds' diversity in four land covers: young oil palm agroforestry (three years after establishment), old oil palm agroforestry (20 years after establishment), oil palm monoculture, and secondary forest. We indicated 43 bird species from 25 families across all land covers. The secondary forest had the highest valueof bird diversity index value of 2.80. The second was the first young oil palm agroforestry (2.42), followed by old OPAF, oil palm monoculture, and the second young OPAF with index values of 2.30, 2.19, and 2.16, respectively. Enrichment planting on oil palm monoculture through OPAF development could help restore tropical forests' structural complexity while also providing more suitable bird habitats.

Interspecific hybridization could be sought to improve yield and tolerance to flooding and further increase the economic potential of the poorly drained Amazonian soils and minimize deforestation.
   Inga species are important components of tropical American forests, as well as a local food source. Little is known about the genetic structure of these species; in particular the amount of introgression among species remains unknown.
   We assessed the degree of genetic divergence and introgression among populations of I. ingoides (Rich.) Willd. and I. edulis Mart. (Fabaceae) from three Peruvian Amazon tributary rivers.
   Using microsatellite markers we determined the genetic structure of populations using an analysis of molecular variance and a Bayesian analysis of population structure in areas affected by seasonal river fluctuations and in 'terra firme' forests.
   Overall genetic differentiation was weak. The degree of genetic variation was similar in the two species. A putatively strong introgression was detected between the two species and an intense gene flow was identified among populations. This indicates that an intense gene flow had happened in the past, leading also to a small differentiation among populations within species.
   Selection of natural hybrids or artificial hybridization between I. edulis and I. ingoides could be applied to improve legume size and yield in the later species, while maintaining tolerance to flooding. Improved I. ingoides could be used in multipurpose agroforestry on open areas along the rivers, instead of using the usual slash and burn practice to create inland open areas.

TI  - Positive forestry: The effect of rubber tree plantations on fruit feeding butterfly assemblages in the Brazilian Atlantic forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Agroforestry systems have increased in area in tropical regions in recent decades and many studies have sought to evaluate their impact on native biodiversity. Yet, few have assessed the impact of perennial plantations such as rubber-tree harvesting on native biodiversity. The goal of our study was to assess the effect of rubber tree plantations on fruit-feeding butterflies of the endangered Brazilian Atlantic Forest in Brazil. To do so, we sampled fruit-feeding butterfly species in a landscape mosaic composed of primary forest, rubber tree plantations under two management regimes (active production with intense management and undergrowth suppression and low management plantations with no undergrowth suppression), and forest fragments immersed in rubber tree plantation matrix. By trap-baiting butterflies for a year, we captured 5800 individuals of 85 butterfly species. Species richness was higher in unmanaged (no growth suppression) plantation and forest fragments (57-60 species) and lower in managed plantation (with growth suppression) (47) and primary forest (43). Ordination analysis suggests three main community groups formed by primary forest samples, a cluster combining unmanaged plantation and fragments, and managed plantation. There was substantial variation in butterfly abundance in the landscape, but our data suggest that several forest specialists species are able to occur along the mosaic on the landscape, and despite differences in management the entire landscape can contribute for a rich biota. Loss of understory vegetation led to simplified communities, with skewed dominance of a few species. By allowing understory development, a low impact management can provide adequate habitat for native butterflies. Yet, current rubber tree plantation technology does not normally use this method, opting to use the high management approach instead. We hypothesize that these minimally benign plantations may serve as conduits for butterflies in forest patches. Thus, we suggest that rubber tree plantations near Atlantic forest fragments should encourage understory development and establish a landscape mosaic, allowing forest fragments immersed in plantation matrix to be able to exchange individuals and colonize more complex plantation habitat. Intensive suppression of undergrowth should be avoided, except for trail maintenance, and isolation of fragments in this matrix should be kept to a minimum. If undergrowth suppression cannot be avoided, then establishment of stepping stones in plantation matrix should be encouraged to reduce isolation of fragments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Altitudinal and aspect-driven variations in soil carbon storage potential in sub-tropical Himalayan forest ecosystem: assisting nature to combat climate change
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB  - Forest soils serve as the greatest sink of terrestrial carbon (C) and have a significant impact on worldwide or regional C cycling. By reducing emissions and enhancing the C storage in forests, the environmental monitoring function of a forest ecosystem may be ensured. The study focused on measuring the densities of major nutrients in soil to gain insight into the C and nitrogen dynamics of the Himalayan sub-tropical forest ecosystem of India besides supplementing the information about the C storage potential of these forest soils. The study examined the physico-chemical properties and nutrient densities across three altitudinal ranges viz., 600-800 m (A(1)), 800-1000 m (A(2)) and 1000-1200 m (A(3)) and two aspects, i.e. Northern (N) and Southern (S) in a randomized complete block design and data collection was done from 24 main sample plots (3 altitudinal ranges x 2 aspects x 4 replications). The soil pH, electrical conductivity, and bulk density observed a decreasing pattern with an increase in altitude, whereas a reverse trend was observed in soil organic C (SOC), total nitrogen and available phosphorus. The SOC and total nitrogen densities ranged from 20.08 to 48.35 Mg ha(-1) and 2.56 to 4.01 Mg ha(-1), respectively in an increasing trend from A(1) to A(3). The northern aspect exhibited significantly higher SOC and nitrogen densities than the southern aspects. The C storage potential of forest soils followed the order A(1) < A(2) < A(3) with significantly higher potential (nearly 1.5 times) compared to those on the southern aspect. There was a consistently significant increase in the C:N ratio (CNR) with a maximum value (10.51) at A(3) and minimum value (8.37) at A(1), however the effect of aspect remained insignificant. This research underscores the importance of considering altitude and aspect when planning forest restoration efforts, as these factors have a substantial influence on soil properties, C storage potential and CNR. Understanding the significance of CNR is critical, as it serves as a key indicator of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from forest soils. Ultimately, these findings empower policymakers and conservationists to make informed decisions that can contribute to the sustainable management of Himalayan forests and the global fight against climate change.

TI  - Intraspecific alternative phenotypes contribute to variation in species' strategies for growth
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Ecologists have historically sought to identify the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of local species diversity. High-dimensional trait-based relationships, such as alternative phenotypes, have been hypothesized as important for maintaining species diversity such that phenotypically dissimilar individuals compete less for resources but have similar performance in a given environment. The presence of alternative phenotypes has primarily been investigated at the community level, despite the importance of intraspecific variation to diversity maintenance. The aims of this research are to (1) determine the presence or absence of intraspecific alternative phenotypes in three species of tropical tree seedlings, (2) investigate if these different species use the same alternative phenotypes for growth success, and (3) evaluate how findings align with species co-occurrence patterns. We model species-specific relative growth rate with individual-level measurements of leaf mass per area (LMA) and root mass fraction (RMF), environmental data, and their interactions. We find that two of the three species have intraspecific alternative phenotypes, with individuals within species having different functional forms leading to similar growth. Interestingly, individuals within these species use the same trait combinations, high LMA x\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\times$$\end{document} low RMF and low LMA x\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\times$$\end{document} high RMF, in high soil nutrient environments to acquire resources for higher growth. This similarity among species in intraspecific alternative phenotypes and variables that contribute most to growth may lead to their negative spatial co-occurrence. Overall, we find that multiple traits or interactions between traits and the environment drive species-specific strategies for growth, but that individuals within species leverage this multi-dimensionality in different ways for growth success.

TI  - Impacts of the forest definitions adopted by African countries on carbon conservation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - In this paper, we aim to assess the impacts of the forest definitions adopted by each African country involved in the global climate change programmes of the United Nations on national carbon emission estimations. To do so, we estimate the proportion of national carbon stocks and tree cover loss that are found in areas considered to be non-forest areas. These non-forest areas are defined with respect to a threshold on the percentage of tree cover adopted by each country. Using percent tree cover and aboveground biomass maps derived from remote sensing data, we quantitatively show that in many countries, a large proportion of carbon stocks are found in non-forest areas, where a large amount of tree cover loss can also occur. We further found that under the REDD+ framework (reduced deforestation, reduced degradation, enhancement and conservation of forest carbon stocks, sustainable management of forests), some partner countries have proposed activities related to only reducing deforestation, even when a large proportion of their carbon stocks are stored outside forests. This situation may represent a limitation of the efficiency of the REDD+ mechanism, and could be avoided if these countries choose a lower tree cover threshold for their definition of forests and/or if they were are engaged in other activities.

TI  - Understory colonization of Eucalyptus plantations in Hawaii in relation to light and nutrient levels
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Exotic tree plantations may serve as catalysts for native forest regeneration in agriculturally degraded landscapes. In 2001, we evaluated plant species regeneration in the understory of a 7-year-old experimental Eucalyptus saligna forest in Hawaii approximately 1 year after the cessation of 5 years of herbicide. These forests were organized in a 2 x 2-factorial design of planting density (1 x 1- or 3 x 3-m spacing) and fertilization (unfertilized control and regular fertilization), which resulted in varying resource availabilities. We found that understory biomass was highest under high light conditions, regardless of fertilization treatment, whereas species richness was lowest under fertilized 1 x 1-m plots. The understory was dominated by species exotic to Hawaii. The most common tree species, the noxious weed Citharexylum caudatum, was particularly successful because high light-saturated photosynthesis rates and a low light compensation point allowed for high growth and survival under both light conditions. To assess longer-term recruitment patterns, we resurveyed a portion of this site in 2006 and also surveyed five Eucalyptus plantations in this region of Hawaii that differed in age (5-23 years), species (E. saligna, E. grandis, E. cloeziana, E. microcorys), and management (experimental, industrial, nonindustrial stewardship); all were established on previous agricultural sites within approximately 3 km of native-dominated forest. Again, very few native species were present in any of the stands, indicating that within certain landscapes and for native species with certain life history traits, exotic plantations may he ineffective nursery ecosystems for the regeneration of native species.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration Potential of Trees in Kuvempu University Campus Forest Area, Western Ghats, Karnataka
T2  - SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND ECO-BIOLOGICAL DIMENSIONS IN RESOURCE USE AND CONSERVATION: STRATEGIES FOR SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Assessing carbon sequestration by measuring above ground and below ground biomass with non destructive method is globally acknowledged. The studies from forest ecosystem have made a significant contribution in quantifying carbon stock. This type of study has now gaining importance in urban ecosystems. Most of the institutions and universities have natural forest and manmade plantations are now assessing carbon stocks in India and elsewhere. In the present study Kuvempu university campus which is a part of Central Western Ghats was assessed. The total area of the campus covers 326.21 acres with dry deciduous forest of Bhadra tiger reserve. A total of 5596 individuals were recorded with a carbon stock of 457.0 t ha(-1) and the dominant Terminalia paniculata contributed a total of 13% of carbon stock. The storing capacity varies with species diversity, disturbance gradient and phenology. This pilot study has made an attempt in advertising the present area in global carbon stock assessment. Therefore, every educational institutions/universities can easily contribute to global CO2 mitigation by restoring the native species in their campus and even it supports biodiversity and helps in future long term monitoring.

TI  - Measuring the causal effect of no-till system adoption on Brazilian natural areas
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB  - No-till system (NTS) is a method of soil management that involves techniques recommended to increase agricultural land productivity. Therefore, employing NTS results in changes in agricultural land use decisions and indirectly impacts the conservation of natural areas. This study aims to evaluate the causal effect between NTS adoption and land use decisions in Brazil, with particular attention to their impacts on natural areas. The discussion on the effects of NTS use over agricultural practices gains relevance in Brazil, given the country's strategic position in the global agricultural market and the need to preserve tropical natural areas to mitigate global warming and preserve local biodiversity. We conducted this assessment using the statistical approach of spatial propensity score matching, which relies on a small set of assumptions to estimate causal effects in experiments with observational data robustly. Our statistical results show that the adoption of NTS had a positive effect on the natural (0.338; p-value < 0.05) and cultivated agricultural (0.214; p-value < 0.05) areas of the treated municipalities. The evidence from this case study indicates that NTS allows for the recovery of eroded soil and expansion of cultivated lands, preserving natural areas, while corroborating Borlaug's approach and further reinforcing the use of NTS as a sustainable soil management practice.

TI  - Estimating Aboveground Biomass and Carbon Sequestration in Afforestation Areas Using Optical/SAR Data Fusion and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The growing population and the impacts of climate change present a major challenge to forests, which play a crucial role in regulating the carbon cycle. Pakistan, as a Kyoto Protocol signatory, has implemented afforestation initiatives such as the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) government's Billion Tree Afforestation Project (BTAP). Quantifying the environmental impacts of such initiatives is very important; however, carbon pool data for BTAP plantation regions remain unavailable and are underexplored. This study aims to quantify aboveground biomass (AGB) and carbon sequestration potential (CSP) in the BTAP plantation regions using remote sensing and field data. Random sampling of 310 circular plots (17.84 m radius) provided measurements for tree height and diameter, from which AGB was calculated using allometric equations. Remote sensing data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, combined with polarization rasters and vegetation indices, were used to train and evaluate multiple regression models including multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest regression (RFR). The RFR model outperformed the others (R2 = 0.766) when using combined optical and radar data, yielding a mean AGB of 4.77 t/ha, carbon stock of 2.24 t/ha, and CO2 equivalent of 10.36 t/ha. For BTAP plantations, the total biomass reached 1.19 million tons, with 2.06 million tons of CO2 equivalent sequestered, corresponding to an annual sequestration of 0.47 tC/ha/yr and a potential of 99.18 +/- 15 tC/ha. This research introduces innovative predictive models and a comprehensive carbon assessment framework for afforestation projects, providing critical insights for policymakers and climate change mitigation efforts.

TI  - Landscape predictors are more important than local factors in determining multiple dimensions of amphibian and reptile diversity in shaded cocoa agroforests
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB  - ContextHigh rates of deforestation have prompted discussions on the use of agricultural systems for biodiversity conservation. Although agroforests are recognized as supplementary habitats for many species, it is still unclear whether this agricultural system can maintain multiple dimensions of species diversity.ObjectivesWe investigated the impact of landscape and local factors on the taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic richness and diversity of the herpetofauna in 30 cocoa agroforests located in three different regions of the Atlantic Forest.MethodsWe used Hill's numbers in orders 0 and 1 to estimate the richness and diversity of each dimension of amphibian and reptile communities. Using model selection approach, we evaluate the influence of landscape and local factors on the different dimensions of diversity of both groups.ResultsFor amphibians, we observed that pasture cover positively affects taxonomic richness and diversity, as well as phylogenetic richness. In contrast, forest edge density and number of forest fragments negatively affect richness and functional diversity, respectively. We also observed that the region with high forest cover exhibited lower amphibian functional richness. For reptiles, we found that forest cover and edge density positively affect species richness. We also noted that forest cover and edge density positively affect phylogenetic richness and diversity, respectively. Regarding local factors, only humidity positively affected functional richness and diversity, while temperature had a negative effect on reptile functional richness.ConclusionsOur study showed that the landscape context in which cocoa agroforests are located modulates the ability of this agricultural system to harbor multiple dimensions of amphibian and reptile diversity in human-modified landscapes.

TI  - Alternative field fertilization techniques to promote restoration of leguminous Acacia koa on contrasting tropical sites
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Field fertilization can promote early growth and survival of planted trees on degraded pastures and agricultural lands where low soil fertility and high herbaceous competition inhibit regeneration success. Controlled-release fertilizers (CRF) may improve the effectiveness of fertilization relative to that of immediately available fertilizers (IAF) because CRF gradually release nutrients directly to the root zone, thereby limiting nutrient losses. Despite past research in boreal and temperate landscapes, few studies have tested the efficacy of similar applications in tropical systems where year-round high temperatures can increase release rates of CRF and intensity of competing vegetation. On two contrasting sites on the Island of Hawaii, USA, we evaluated early growth and survival responses of koa (Acacia koa Gray), a fast-growing legume, using ten treatments: a control, four IAF formulations, and five rates of polymer coated CRF (15N-9P-12K; 15-75 g). At Pahala, a productive site, we detected no significant growth, survival, or foliar nitrogen (N) or phosphorous (P) responses to the fertilizer treatments. At Volcano, a rockier and cooler site on younger soil, height increased by 36-49% for the highest performing CRF and IAF relative to the control; diameter likewise increased by 55-92%. Growth responses appeared to be a result of P fertilization rather than N. The highest performing IAF had a reduced survival rate relative to the lowest CRF (46% vs. 83%). Although total nutrient application rates were much lower for CRF, our results suggest that on tropical restoration sites, CRF may promote seedling performance at least equally to that of IAF. There is a need to more carefully evaluate the effects of site-specific interactions that may determine field fertilizer responses, across a range of genera and functional groups.

TI  - Extent and Area of Swidden in Montane Mainland Southeast Asia: Estimation by Multi-Step Thresholds with Landsat-8 OLI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Information on the distribution, area and extent of swidden agriculture landscape is necessary for implementing the program of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD), biodiversity conservation and local livelihood improvement. To our knowledge, explicit spatial maps and accurate area data on swidden agriculture remain surprisingly lacking. However, this traditional farming practice has been transforming into other profit-driven land use, like tree plantations and permanent cash agriculture. Swidden agriculture is characterized by a rotational and dynamic nature of agroforestry, with land cover changing from natural forests, newly-cleared swiddens to different-aged fallows. The Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard the Landsat-8 satellite has visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared bands, which are sensitive to the changes in vegetation cover, land surface moisture content and soil exposure, and therefore, four vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI). In this study, we developed a multi-step threshold approach that uses a combination of thresholds of four VIs and local elevation range (LER) and applied it to detect and map newly-opened swiddens and different-aged fallows using OLI imagery acquired between 2013 and 2015. The resultant Landsat-derived swidden agriculture maps have high accuracy with an overall accuracy of 86.9% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.864. The results of this study indicated that the Landsat-based multi-step threshold algorithms could potentially be applied to monitor the long-term change pattern of swidden agriculture in montane mainland Southeast Asia since the late 1980s and also in other tropical regions, like insular Southeast Asia, South Asia, Latin America and Central Africa, where swidden agriculture is still common.

TI  - Geodesign Brazil: Trees for the Metropolitan Area of Sao Paulo
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ITS APPLICATIONS, ICCSA 2021, PT VI
CP  - 21st International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications (ICCSA)
AB  - Trees are central in the Nature-based Solutions for promoting simultaneously quality of life and biodiversity while providing mitigation and adaptive ecosystem services in the cities. Based on the Geodesign framework using the GIS-Colab Platform, the impact of decision-making scenarios on tree-cover changes, as well as the consequences it will have for carbon sequestration, was evaluated for 2020, 2035 and 2050 in the Metropolitan Area of Sao Paulo (MASP). This metropolitan area is one of the largest urban conglomerates in the world with more than 22 million people. It lies on the Atlantic Rainforest Biome, a tropical moist broadleaf forest regarded as a world hotspot of biodiversity. First, a diagnostic of the current conditions was elaborated using available layers of geospatial data from the MASP. Then the future tree cover was discussed according to three scenarios: i) the non-adopters that represent the business as usual; ii) the late-adopters that develop innovative actions from 2035; and iii) early-adopters that undertake innovative interventions of urban greening from 2020. The vegetation cover was estimated to be reduced by 4% considering the current non-adopter scenario by 2050. On the other hand, vegetation cover has the potential to increase 30% in 2050, once there is an early adoption of innovative interventions, promoting various ecosystem services and co-benefits that support the quality of life and the biodiversity in the MASP, while fostering the carbon credit in the city through vegetation carbon sink. This article points to possible pathways required to attain desired afforestation goals in the MASP following the Geodesign framework. This framework proved to be effective even though it was based only on remote meetings, imposed by the social distancing during the pandemic of COVID-19.

TI  - Changes from pasture to a native tree plantation affect soil organic matter in a tropical soil, Panama
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Background and aims We examined changes in soil organic matter arising from conversion of a 45-year old pasture to a 10 yr. old native tree plantation in Panama, to evaluate the effect of monoculture and mixtures.
   Methods We intensively sampled the soil 0-10 cm depth in the pasture in 2001 and in 22 plantation plots in 2011, ranging from 5 monocultures to 3- and 6-species treatments; samples were also taken from an undisturbed forest site. Soil analyses included organic carbon (SOC) and delta C-13.
   Results Conversion of the pasture to tree plantation resulted in an overall loss of SOC of 0.6 kg m(-2) (18%) in the top 10 cm, but neither tree species nor diversity had a significant effect. End-member delta C-13 values suggested that the contribution of C-3 plants to SOC was increased from 26% in the pasture to 55% after 10 years of plantation and SOC turnover times were calculated to be 21-36 yr.
   Conclusions The magnitude of the loss in soil SOC is smaller than the increases in tree biomass (similar to 3 kg C m(-2)) and litter (similar to 0.3 kg C m(-2)) in the plantation, but still a significant part of the ecosystem C balance.

TI  - Tropical rainforest biodiversity and aboveground carbon changes and uncertainties in the Selva Central, Peru
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Tropical deforestation has reduced the extent of natural forests, which conserve biodiversity, provide essential resources to people, and reduce climate change by storing carbon. Forest conservation projects need tree species data to effectively manage biodiversity while greenhouse gas reduction programs require robust methods to estimate forest carbon. Here, we use field measurements, remote sensing, and Monte Carlo analyses to quantify tree biodiversity and aboveground carbon changes and uncertainties in 5200 km(2) of Amazonian and Yungas rainforest and other land around the Parque Nacional Yanachaga-Chemillen and two other protected areas in the Selva Central, Peru. Field inventories of 17 ha found 438 tree species in 156 families. Field measurements of 10,838 trees and Monte Carlo analyses of uncertainties in measurements, allometric equations, wood density, and the carbon fraction of biomass showed that aboveground live carbon densities were 93 +/- 39 Mg ha(-1) (mean +/- 95% confidence interval [CI]) in old-growth forest and 40 +/- 10 Mg ha(-1) in secondary forest. Carbon density was significantly correlated to tree species richness (P < 0.0001). Supervised classification of Landsat images showed a 1989-2005 net deforestation rate of 0.3% y(-1), reduction of forest cover from three-quarters of the area to two-thirds, and net degradation of additional forest equivalent to half the deforested area. A Monte Carlo analysis that combined carbon density and remote sensing uncertainties showed that forest changes caused statistically significant net emissions of 1.6 +/- 0.4 million Mg carbon. Allometric equations and remote sensing accounted for most of the uncertainty. Multivariate statistical analyses showed that, of six factors examined, distance to roads most explained historical deforestation patterns. The protected areas experienced no net deforestation, very low degradation, and very low change close to roads. Projection of potential forest cover to 2021 indicates that a Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) project could avoid gross emissions of 2.8 +/- 0.8 million Mg carbon. One-eighth of the area would be eligible for afforestation or reforestation under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), with credit for carbon storage occurring above a projected baseline gross reforestation rate of 1.8% y(-1). These activities could conserve tropical forest carbon and biodiversity. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Variation patterns of plant composition/diversity in Dacrydium pectinatum communities and their driving factors in a biodiversity hotspot on Hainan Island, China
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Climate changes and human-mediated modifications to ecosystems have threatened the biodiversity and habitats of various species. Dacrydium pectinatum is a constructive and endangered species in the tropical mountain forests of Hainan Island, China. In this study, we established sixty-eight 30 m x 30 m permanent plots of D. pectinatum along an environmental axis of temperature and precipitation in the west (Bawangling, 30 plots), southwest (Jianfengling, 30 plots) and east (Diaoluoshan, 8 plots) of Hainan Island. Our objectives are to explore the change mechanisms of plant composition/diversity in the D. pectinatum community at distinct environmental scales and analyze the association between environmental factors (topography, soil and stand conditions) and vegetation distribution. The results showed that the diversity of D. pectinatum communities was lower than that in tropical forests at other sites around the world and much higher than that in subtropical forests at similar latitudes. At the regional scale, plant diversity showed a pattern that decreases with increasing latitude; at the local scale, diversity decreases with increasing elevation. Eight environmental factors, namely, elevation, slope, canopy density, soil organic matter, soil pH, soil total nitrogen, soil available phosphorus and soil available potassium, showed a significant correlation to species distribution. Elevation factors were identified as the determinants of the overall diversity patterns. In conclusion, our study clarified that abiotic environmental factors strongly influence the vegetation structure and diversity pattern of the D. pectinatum communities in various environmental scales. Low temperatures, high humidity, low soil nutrients, and high stand density may be the limiting factors that cause their diversity to decline. We recommend various actions to ameliorate the impact of environmental changes on the D. pectinatum community, such as protecting existing habitats, strengthening monitoring of restrictive environmental factors, appropriate thinning of higher density stands, and conducting research on genetic diversity to improve the community survivability.

TI  - Forest fragmentation in the Argentine Chaco: recruitment and population patterns of dominant tree species
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
AB  - The forest in the Central Argentine Chaco has been dramatically fragmented and persists only as isolated patches in an agricultural matrix. In this study, we evaluated the effects of fragmentation on total density, recruitment, and size-class structure of its dominant tree species, a key issue, although little explored, for forest conservation in the region. We particularly analyzed the effects of fragment size and forest cover at landscape level on seven of the most important tree species of the forest. Our results suggest that forest cover at landscape level is more important than fragment size to explain the population patterns of the main tree species. Fragment size was relevant in only one species, Cordia americana, whereas forest cover resulted relevant in five species. The size-class structure of Schinopsis balansae, one of the dominant species of the upper stratum, appeared to be affected in landscapes with less forest cover, showing lower densities of the smaller classes. Our results show that for the conservation of the forest it would be important to increase their protection degree against the expansion of agriculture, attempting to preserve as much of the forest as possible, to promote the forest cover at landscape level and give relevance even to the smallest fragments.

TI  - A participatory approach to elucidate the consequences of land invasions on REDD plus initiatives: A case study with Indigenous communities in Panama
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Land tenure and tenure security are among the most important factors determining the viability and success of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) initiatives. The premise of the present paper is that territorial conflicts lead to forest loss and compromise the successful implementation of REDD+. Within this context, the main objectives of this paper are to (i) document, relying on participatory methods, the extent to which land conflicts drive deforestation and (ii) reflect on the legal context of REDD+ examining if, from an Indigenous perspective, it offers tools to resolve such conflicts. We used the Upper Bayano Watershed in eastern Panama as a case study of complex land tenure dynamics, and their effects on forest conservation in the context of REDD+. Combining a range of participatory methods including participatory mapping and forest carbon stock assessment, we estimated the consequences of land invasions on forest carbon stocks. Our analysis shows that invasions of Indigenous territories amounted to 27.6% of the total deforestation for the period of 2001-2014. The situation is of paramount concern in the Embera territory of Maje A where 95.4% of total deforestation was caused by colonist invaders. Using and validating the maps made freely available by the Global Forest Change initiative of the University of Maryland, we then developed a reference level for the watershed and carried out a back of the envelop estimation of likely REDD+ revenue, showing its potential to bring much needed income to Indigenous communities striving to protect their forest estate. Our analysis of current legislation in Panama highlights confusion and important legal voids and emphasizes the strong links between land tenure, carbon ownership, and territorial invasions. The options and shortcoming of implementing REDD+ in Indigenous territories is discussed in the conclusion taking our legal review into account.

TI  - COMMUNITY FOREST MANAGEMENT AND CARBON SEQUESTRATION - A FEASIBILITY STUDY FROM CHIAPAS, MEXICO
T2  - INTERCIENCIA
AB  - Although forestry and agroforestry are recognized as promising land-use alternatives for reducing the increasing levels of global atmospheric carbon, the viability of carbon sequestration projects at the land-user level has rarely been evaluated We present the results of a feasibility study to: (1) evaluate the interest of local communities in a carbon sequestration project and how they would organize themselves for the proposed forestry project; (2) identify the Carbon sequestration potential of the agroforestry/forestry systems that are both ecologically viable and preferred by local farmers (3) determine the social constraints of and potential for, such projects; and (4) assess the economic potential of the carbon offsets estimated for such systems. This project was carried out by an interdisciplinary team of scientists and farmers in two ecological regions: the Tojolabal and Tzeltal zones of Chiapas, Mexico.
   Five systems with high carbon sequestration potential were considered technically and socially viable for each region. Initially, all participants will plant trees on an individual basis in their coffee plantation, fallow, and pasture lands, or in their maize fields. The estimated amount of carbon sequestered ranged from 46.7 to 236.7 tons of carbon per hectare (tC/ha). Net income benefits due to converting fields from maize cultivation to farm forestry ranged from $500-1000/ha depending on the value assigned to the sequestered carbon.(1)
   Forests and farm woodlands that are sustainably managed have substantial economic and carbon sequestration potential. The principal barrier to communal forest management appears to be sociopolitical rather than economic. Because forest management requires longterm investments, good planning is essential and includes community control of projects, selection of appropriate tree species, and management techniques that are specific to the ecological and social conditions of the area.

TI  - Phyllostomid Bat Occurrence in Successional Stages of Neotropical Dry Forests
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Tropical dry forests (TDFs) are highly endangered tropical ecosystems being replaced by a complex mosaic of patches of different successional stages, agricultural fields and pasturelands. In this context, it is urgent to understand how taxa playing critical ecosystem roles respond to habitat modification. Because Phyllostomid bats provide important ecosystem services (e. g. facilitate gene flow among plant populations and promote forest regeneration), in this study we aimed to identify potential patterns on their response to TDF transformation in sites representing four different successional stages (initial, early, intermediate and late) in three Neotropical regions: Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil. We evaluated bat occurrence at the species, ensemble (abundance) and assemblage level (species richness and composition, guild composition). We also evaluated how bat occurrence was modulated by the marked seasonality of TDFs. In general, we found high seasonal and regional specificities in phyllostomid occurrence, driven by specificities at species and guild levels. For example, highest frugivore abundance occurred in the early stage of the moistest TDF, while highest nectarivore abundance occurred in the same stage of the driest TDF. The high regional specificity of phyllostomid responses could arise from: (1) the distinctive environmental conditions of each region, (2) the specific behavior and ecological requirements of the regional bat species, (3) the composition, structure and phenological patterns of plant assemblages in the different stages, and (4) the regional landscape composition and configuration. We conclude that, in tropical seasonal environments, it is imperative to perform long-term studies considering seasonal variations in environmental conditions and plant phenology, as well as the role of landscape attributes. This approach will allow us to identify potential patterns in bat responses to habitat modification, which constitute an invaluable tool for not only bat biodiversity conservation but also for the conservation of the key ecological processes they provide.

TI  - Effects of diverse mangrove management practices on forest structure, carbon dynamics and sedimentation in North Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
AB  - For decades, mangrove forests have been under tremendous pressure due to deforestation and conversion. To sustainably manage the mangroves that remain, an ecosystem approach to management is essential. Two different management regimes - conservation and restoration - were assessed, looking at their respective effects on forest structure and carbon cycling capacity, when compared with degraded mangrove. We found that mangrove restoration enhanced tree density, while mangrove conservation was able to maintain species diversity. In terms of carbon budgets, aboveground carbon was lower in restored mangrove (79.40 +/- 37.41 Mg C ha(-1)) when compared with conserved mangrove (92.26 +/- 22.65 Mg C ha(-1)), but was almost double that found in degraded mangrove (39.89 +/- 27.49 Mg C ha(-1)). Although conserved mangrove had higher aboveground carbon, lower amounts of soil carbon were found in conserved mangrove (127.49 +/- 33.21 Mg C ha(-1)) than in restored and degraded mangrove (236.26 +/- 20.33 Mg C ha(-1) and 139.17 +/- 25.44 Mg C ha(-1), respectively). The elevation change was highest in degraded mangrove (41.7 +/- 24.0 mm yr(-1)), followed by restored (20.7 +/- 14.6 mm yr(-1)) and conserved mangrove (12.2 +/- 3.9 mm yr(-1)). Carbon burial in conserved mangrove (1.20 +/- 1.90 Mg C ha(-2) yr(-1)) was double that of degraded mangrove (0.63 +/- 0.60 Mg C ha(-2) yr(-1)). Ultimately, we conclude that although a conserved mangrove is not always the end result of mangrove restoration and sustainable management, finding balance between structural development and ecosystem function is essential to serve different objectives, including biodiversity maintenance.

TI  - Tree species diversity relative to human land uses in tropical rain forest margins in Central Sulawesi
T2  - STABILITY OF TROPICAL RAINFOREST MARGINS: LINKING ECOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONSTRAINTS OF LAND USE AND CONSERVATION
CP  - International Symposium on Stability of Tropical Rainforest Margins
AB  - The large-scale exploitation and conversion of tropical forests causes growing concern about the continued existence of the rich biodiversity of these forests. In the framework of the interdisciplinary STORMA project in Lore Lindu National Park area in Central Sulawesi, we studied tree diversity in six different land use types in the margins of submontane rain forest: undisturbed forest, forest with rattan extraction, selectively logged forest, cacao forest gardens, cacao plantations with mixed canopy of planted trees, and cacao plantations with a monospecific canopy. By analyzing such a finely subdivided use gradient it was attempted to answer the question how human usage and biodiversity conservation in the study area may be reconciled. Tree species (dbh > 10 cm) were sampled in 24 plots of 0.25 ha in all six land use types (4 replicates each). In total, 251 tree species (143 genera, 59 families) were recorded. Number of tree species per 0.25 ha was 51-63 in primary forest and gradually decreased towards the studied cacao systems. However, when native and cultivated tree species were considered separately, significant differences were detected among plantation types in terms of tree diversity. Tree endemism in forest plots totalled ca. 15% and was in good accordance with endemism in woody plants of Sulawesi. The number of endemic species was strongly reduced in cacao systems, although percentage endemism did not decline significantly in cacao forest gardens. Roughly one third of tree species in the forest plots were of economic importance as commercial timber trees; timber diversity was little affected by moderate human use of the forest but was significantly reduced in cacao forest gardens and dropped to near zero in other plantation types. The mean basal area of 57 m(2) (36-80 m(2)) per ha in natural forest was lower than the previously recorded value from the study area but is still almost double as high as the mean value typical for tropical lowland forests in Southeast Asia.
   The results of this study support the notion that tree diversity in the sub-montane forests of Central Sulawesi is unusually high and rich in large-sized timber trees, although tree size varies locally. Moderate human use of the forest ecosystems does not significantly affect tree diversity. We conclude that conservation of tropical tree diversity is compatible with human exploitation of tropical forest as long as a canopy of native trees is maintained. Future conservation policies in rain forest margin areas should therefore focus on developing measures aimed at sustainable use of the natural resources. Promotion of such activities may help to stabilize tropical rain forest margins in Central Sulawesi.

TI  - Protection measures for the Araucaria Forest and their efficiencyin the conservation of Araucaria angustifolia in southern Brazil
T2  - BOSQUE
AB  - Forests require sustainable management because of the long cycle of the species, the balance of the ecosystem, the structure or processes on which the species depend, and socioeconomic development. This study shows the effect of adopting protection measures (non-management and conservation) and their results on the forest structure of a Mixed Ombrophylous Forest, specifically for Araucaria angustifolia available in official publications and scientific articles. Bibliometric analysis was used to obtain and evaluate scientific publications based on their statistical methods, forest inventory techniques, modeling and, which contributed valuable information and scientific impact on the development of the topic. We argue that there are uncertainties about the threat of extinction and that lack of management may increase the disregard for forest resources. The losses of ecosystem services, economic structure, diversity, reproduction, and production of the forest due to non-use of resources are larger than the benefits.The results indicate the need for sustainable forest management as a public policy for the conservation of the species and the Mixed Ombrophilous Forest in southern Brazil.

TI  - Booming markets for Moroccan argan oil appear to benefit some rural households while threatening the endemic argan forest
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Morocco's argan oil is now the most expensive edible oil in the world. High-value argan markets have sparked a bonanza of argan activity. Nongovernmental organizations, international and domestic development agencies, and argan oil cooperatives aggressively promote the win-win aim of simultaneously benefiting local people and the health of the argan forest. This paper tests some of these win-win claims. Analysis of a panel of detailed household data suggests that the boom has enabled some rural households to increase consumption, increase their goat herds (which bodes poorly for the argan forest), and send their girls to secondary school. The boom has predictably made households vigilant guardians of fruit on the tree, but it has not incited investments in longer term tree and forest health. We evaluate landscape-level impacts of these changes using commune-level data on educational enrollment and normalized difference vegetation index data over the period from 1981 to 2009. The results of the mesoanalysis of enrollment are consistent with the microanalysis: the argan boom seems to have improved educational outcomes, especially for girls. Our normalized difference vegetation index analysis, however, suggests that booming argan prices have not improved the forest and may have even induced degradation. We conclude by exploring the dynamic interactions between argan markets, local institutions, rural household welfare, and forest conservation and sustainability.

TI  - Forest buffer-strips mitigate the negative impact of oil palm plantations on stream communities
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The global area cultivated with oil palm has doubled in the past two decades, causing deforestation, land-use change, freshwater pollution, and species loss in tropical ecosystems worldwide. Despite the palm-oil industry been linked to severe deterioration of freshwater ecosystems, most studies have focused on terrestrial environments, while freshwa-ters have been significantly less studied. We evaluated these impacts by contrasting freshwater macroinvertebrate communities and habitat conditions in 19 streams from primary forests (7), grazing lands (6), and oil palm plantations (6). In each stream, we measured environmental characteristics, e.g., habitat composition, canopy cover, substrate, water temperature, and water quality; and we identified and quantified the assemblage of macroinvertebrates. Streams in oil palm plantations lacking riparian forest strips showed warmer and more variable temperatures, higher turbidity, lower silica content, and poorer macroinvertebrate taxon richness than primary forests. Grazing lands showed higher conductivity and temperature, and lower dissolved oxygen and macroinvertebrate taxon richness than primary forests. In contrast, streams in oil palm plantations that conserved a riparian forest, showed a substrate composition, temper-ature, and canopy cover more similar to the ones in primary forests. These habitat improvements by riparian forests in the plantations increased macroinvertebrate taxon richness and maintained a community resembling more the one in primary forests. Therefore, the conversion of grazing lands (instead of primary forests) to oil palm plantations can in-crease freshwater taxon richness only if riparian native forests are safeguarded.

TI  - EFFECTS OF SHORT ROTATION NATURAL FALLOW ON DIVERSITY OF PLANT SPECIES AND POPULATION OF SOIL MICROBES IN APONMU, ONDO STATE, NIGERIA
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - OKE DO. 2012. Effects of short rotation natural fallow on diversity of plant species and population of soil microbes in Aponmu, Ondo State, Nigeria. Bush fallowing is a common farming system in the humid zone of West and Central Africa. However, population pressures have resulted in shortened fallow periods with consequent effects on soil nutrients and biodiversity. To assess the effect of the shortened fallow period on plant species diversity, data were collected in a primary forest (forest reserve) and an adjoining 5-year-old bush fallow in Aponmu, Ondo State, Nigeria. Four plots of 25 x 25 m each were sampled from the forest reserve and one each from four abandoned fallow lands around the forest reserve. All trees with diameter at breast height greater than or equal to 5 cm were identified. A total of 0.25 ha of bush fallow and 0.25 ha of primary forest were surveyed. Ground vegetation was assessed from a subsample of 5 x 5 m in each of the sampled area. In the 0.25 ha of bush fallow surveyed, 64 individual trees were encountered (256 trees ha(-1)) representing 34.2% of the tree density found in 0.25 ha of primary forest, which contained 187 individual trees (748 trees ha(-1)). A higher value of Shannon's index (2.95) for the primary forest is an indication that it contains more variety of tree species per unit area than the bush fallow (2.37). There were slight differences in bacterial and fungal populations from the two ecosystems. This study indicated a lower number and variety of tree species under short rotation fallow. This may imply gradual loss of many of the benefits associated with trees.

TI  - The Importance of Defining 'Forest': Tropical Forest Degradation, Deforestation, Long-term Phase Shifts, and Further Transitions
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - While research continues on the causes, consequences, and rates of deforestation and forest degradation in the tropics, there is little agreement about what exactly is being lost, what we want back, and to whom the 'we' refers. Particularly unsettling is that many analyses and well-intended actions are implemented in fogs of ambiguity surrounding definitions of the term 'forest'-a problem that is not solely semantic; with development of markets for biomass carbon, vegetation classification exercises take on new relevance. For example, according to the basic implementation guidelines of the Kyoto Protocol, closed canopy natural forest could be replaced by monoclonal plantations of genetically engineered exotic tree species and no deforestation would have occurred. Following these same guidelines, carbon credits for afforestation could be available for planting trees in species-rich savannas; these new plantations would count towards a country moving towards the 'forest transition,' the point at which there is no net 'forest' loss. Such obvious conflicts between biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration might be avoided if 'forest' was clearly defined and if other vegetation types and other ecosystem values were explicitly recognized. While acknowledging that no one approach to vegetation classification is likely to satisfy all users at all scales, we present an approach that recognizes the importance of species composition, reflects the utility of land-cover characteristics that are identifiable via remote sensing, and acknowledges that many sorts of forest degradation do not reduce carbon stocks (e. g., defaunation) or canopy cover (e. g., over-harvesting of understory nontimber forest products).

AB  - Maintaining soil functions is crucial for human well-being, but there is a lack of integration between soil, water security, ecosystem services, and climate change. To bridge this knowledge gap and address erosion-induced soil and water losses and considering intrinsic impacts of soil structure, a three-year-long study was conducted focused on three dominant soil types (Typic Hapludult, Typic Dystrudept, and Typic Usthortent) combined with different land uses (native forest, eucalyptus plantation, rotational grazing, and extensive grazing) in a critical water supply region for the S & atilde;o Paulo metropolitan area in Southeastern Brazil. Surface runoff, evaluated for erosion resistance, was measured using the Cornell infiltrometer, and soil electrical resistivity tomography estimated soil water content to a depth of 1.5 m for groundwater recharge analysis. Soil hydraulic properties were also measured. The results revealed that native forest soils had higher hydraulic conductivity, particularly in the surface layer, compared to eucalyptus and pastures. Native forests in Typic Hapludult showed a higher runoff rate (200 to 250 mm h(-1)) due to a naturally dense subsoil layer that negatively impacted water infiltration and recharge with a high erosion potential, therefore reducing the amount of water stored. Typic Usthortent maintained a higher soil water content in pastures than in other land uses and also showed a low rate of water infiltration, resulting in perched water in the surface layer. In Typic Dystrudept, the native forest presented higher hydraulic conductivity (0-5 cm: 115.9 cm h(-1)) than eucalyptus (0-5 cm: 36.4 cm h(-1)), rotational grazing (0-5 cm: 19.4 cm h(-1)), and extensive grazing (0-5 cm: 2.6 cm h(-1)), but there were no significant differences in soil water content among land uses. This work illustrates the crucial role of native forests in affecting deep water recharge, reducing the soil surface erosion, mainly in soils without naturally subsoil layer, maintaining recharge potential. For Ultisols, pastures preserved soil structure and are therefore less impacted by soil management. With these results, a contribution is made to soil and water conservation, providing support for sustainable management practices in erosion-prone areas.

TI  - CONGO BASIN FOREST COVER CHANGE ESTIMATE FOR 1990, 2000 AND 2005 BY LANDSAT INTERPRETATION USING AN AUTOMATED OBJECT-BASED PROCESSING CHAIN
T2  - GEOBIA 2010: GEOGRAPHIC OBJECT-BASED IMAGE ANALYSIS
CP  - Conference on Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA)
AB  - Central Africa contains the second largest area of contiguous moist tropical forest of the world. In the framework of the Observatory of Forests in Central Africa (OFAC) and the Forest Resources Assessment (FRA-2010) led by Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), each country is invited to provide an estimation of forest cover change for years 1990-2000-2005 (and later 2010). In this context, developing efficient methods to detect forest changes by processing remote sensing data is more than ever a challenging need. At the moment, only satellite images can provide enough information on processes such as deforestation at the scale of Congo basin. An automatic method has been designed to map and quantify forest change in Central Africa. 1168 subsets of 20 x 20 km of 30 m resolution Landsat or Aster are required to cover the different countries. The different steps of the method are a (1) multi-date segmentation, applied on each extracts triplet (1990-2000 and 2005), (2) an unsupervised classification and an (3) automatic pre-labeling. (4) Change is detected by a statistical object-based method. (5) The involvement of national experts is an essential part of the intepretation process. The OFAC team together with Joint Research Centre (JRC-EU) and FAO invited in Kinshasa (September 2009) 13 national experts from the 6 countries of the Congo Basin to validate the land cover mapping and change maps. National experts check, and change if needed, the pre-interpretation of each sample using an object-based validation tool developed by the JRC. This unique exercise estimates not only deforestation and reforestation but also degradation and regeneration which are particularly important in Central Africa. These results are expected to contribute to the discussion on the reduction of CO2 emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (UN-REDD).

TI  - Evolution and Conservation of Central African Biodiversity: Priorities for Future Research and Education in the Congo Basin and Gulf of Guinea
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - The tropical forests of the Congo Basin and Gulf of Guinea harbor some of the greatest terrestrial and aquatic biological diversity in the world. However, our knowledge of the rich biological diversity of this region and the evolutionary processes that have shaped it remains limited, as is our understanding of the capacity for species to adapt or otherwise respond to current and projected environmental change. In this regard, research efforts are needed to increase current scientific knowledge of this region's biodiversity, identify the drivers of past diversification, evaluate the potential for species to adapt to environmental change and identify key populations for future conservation. Moreover, when evolutionary research is combined with ongoing environmental monitoring efforts, it can also provide an important set of tools for assessing and mitigating the impacts of development activities. Building on a set of recommendations developed at an international workshop held in Gabon in 2011, we highlight major areas for future evolutionary research that could be directly tied to conservation priorities for the region. These research priorities are centered around five disciplinary themes: (1) documenting and discovering biodiversity; (2) identifying drivers of evolutionary diversification; (3) monitoring environmental change; (4) understanding community and ecosystem level processes; (5) investigating the ecology and epidemiology of disease from an evolutionary perspective (evolutionary epidemiology). Furthermore, we also provide an overview of the needs and priorities for biodiversity education and training in Central Africa.
   Resume Les forets tropicales du bassin du Congo et du Golfe de Guinee abritent une grande partie de la diversite terrestre et aquatique dans le monde. Pourtant, notre connaissance de la riche diversite biologique de cette region et les processus evolutifs qui l'ont faconnee demeurent encore peu compris, tout comme notre comprehension de la capacite des especes a s'adapter ou a repondre aux changements environnementaux actuels et a venir. De ce fait, des efforts de recherche sont necessaires pour ameliorer les connaissances scientifiques actuelles sur la biodiversite de cette region, determiner les causes des processus de diversifications passees, evaluer le potentiel des especes a repondre aux changements environnementaux et identifier les populations cles pour la conservation dans le futur. Par ailleurs, lorsque la recherche dans le domaine de l'evolution est combinee aux efforts de suivi continu de l'environnement, elle peut aussi fournir un ensemble d'outils importants pour l'evaluation et l'attenuation des impacts des activites de developpement. S'appuyant sur une serie de recommandations elaborees lors de l'atelier international qui s'est tenu au Gabon en 2011, nous soulignons les axes majeurs pour la recherche future dans le domaine de l'evolution qui pourraient etre lies directement aux priorites de la conservation dans la region. Ces priorites de recherche s'articulent autour de cinq thematiques: (1) l'inventaire et la decouverte de la biodiversite; (2) l'identification des causes de la diversification; (3) le suivi des changements environnementaux; (4) la comprehension des processus au niveau des communautes et des ecosystemes; (5) l'etude ecologique et epidemiologique des maladies d'un point de vue evolutif (epidemiologie evolutive). Toutefois, nous donnons egalement un apercu des besoins et des priorites en matiere d'education et de formation dans le domaine de la biodiversite en Afrique centrale.

TI  - Biomass allocation and growth indicators for quality evaluation of seedlings of native forest species
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
AB  - Procedures and methodologies for evaluating the quality and uniformity of seedlings are essential for homogenizing lots in forest nurseries and successful planting for reforestation. A study was made in order to evaluate the correlations between the allocation of biomass and the Dickson Quality Index (IQD) for seedlings from six native tree species of the Atlantic Forest as well as to select quality indicators that most affect the IQD and which can be used in a practical and precise fashion for the evaluation of native forest seedlings. Seedlings from six tropical forest species were used: Calophyllum brasiliense, Eriotheca macrophylla, Inga laurina, Psidium cattleyanum, Roupala montana and Sloanea obtusifolia. The following characteristics were evaluated: dry leaf (MSF), dry stem (MSC) and dry root (MSR) mass, as well as the aerial part height (H) and the stem diameter (D). Based on these variables, the following calculations were made: ratios of root (RMR), stem (RMC) and leaf (RMF) mass, as well as the total dry mass (MST), that of the aerial part (MSPA), the ratio of the aerial part dry mass to the dry root mass (MSPA/MSR), and that of the aerial part height to the stem diameter (H/D), and the IQD. The results were analyzed via correlation analyses. Based on the conditions of this study it is possible to conclude that: (a) the differences between the average IQD values of the species studied were not explained by the allocation pattern of biomass characterizing each species; (b) the MSR, MST and the D are the best variables for predicting the IQD of the seedlings from the forest species analyzed in this study; and (c) because it is a non-destructive method, D can be considered the best practical indicator for estimating IQD values for Atlantic Forest seedling species lots.

TI  - Relative fire-proneness of land cover types in the Brazilian Atlantic forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Fires are increasingly affecting tropical biomes, where landscape-fire interactions remain understudied. We investigate the fire-proneness-the likelihood of a land use or land cover (LULC) type burning more or less than expected based on availability-in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (AF). This biodiversity hotspot is increasingly affected by fires due to human activities and climate change. Using a selection ratio-based approach, we analyzed fire-LULC interactions in 40,869 fires over a 35-year period (1987-2022) across various ecoregions in the AF. Our findings revealed that secondary forests, forest areas that have regrown after major disturbances, burned 61% more than expected by chance, whereas old-growth forests, native forests that have developed over very long periods, burned 57% less than expected, highlighting a nearly inverse relationship in their fire-proneness. Interestingly, our data indicate that pastures in the AF are less prone to fire than expected, despite being considered among the land uses that burn the most in Brazil. Other LULCs showed variable fire-proneness, with some differences between ecoregions. Over time, the fire-proneness of secondary forests decreased, likely due to forest aging and changes in land management practices. We emphasize the necessity for tailored fire management strategies that address the unique vulnerabilities of secondary forests, particularly in the context of ongoing restoration efforts aimed at increasing native forests. Effective measures, including the implementation of 'firesmart management' practices and enhancing the perceived value of secondary forests among local communities, are crucial for mitigating fire risks. Integrating these strategies with incentive-based approaches can bolster fire prevention, ensuring the long-term success of restoration programs. Our study provides a framework for understanding fire-landscape dynamics in tropical forests and offers actionable insights for practitioners working to safeguard these biomes from the escalating threat of wildfires.

TI  - Soil properties of thickets and adjacent land use types in coastal savanna landscape of Ghana
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
AB  - Thicket vegetation may be of great importance in soil carbon (C) storage and in provision of other ecosystem services such as soil erosion control and biodiversity conservation. However, it is less studied in tropical ecosystems due to limited understanding of its ecological importance. This study reports soil C pools and nutrient concentrations [nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), exchangeable calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and potassium (K)] of unique thicket formations on Vertisol in comparison with adjacent land use types viz. rangeland, dry forest, and farmland at Kpong in the coastal Accra plains of Ghana. We also examined soil particle and nutrient distributions of termitarium associated with the thicket clumps on the Vertisols. Soils were sampled from each land use at 0-30 cm depth in addition to deep coring up to 100 cm. In the rangeland, forest and farmland, we demarcated 1600 m(2) area each and established 4 subplots measuring 20 x 20 m (400 m(2)) and selected for the thicket vegetation, 4 thicket clumps each of approximately 400 m(2) for soil sampling. The thicket clumps had greater soil total N, available P, exchangeable Ca and Mg concentrations than the rangeland and farmland but the levels in the thicket were similar (p > 0.05) to that of the adjacent dry forest. Soil C stock varied from 59 Mg ha(-1) in the rangeland to 111 Mg ha(-1) in the thicket clumps. The C stored in the silt + clay (S + C) fraction did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) in both the thicket and the dry forest, indicating similar C sequestration abilities. The S + C fraction contributed 89.6, 82.8, 81.3, and 73.7% to total soil organic C content in the rangeland, farmland, dry forest, and thickets, respectively. Soils of the termite mounds in the thickets were more clayey (ca. 38-41% clay) than the surrounding thicket soils (ca. 32% clay). We conclude that Vertisols in thicket areas store soil C and nutrients comparably as tropical dry forest, underscoring their ecological importance and the need for their conservation to enhance soil quality in the Anthropocene.

TI  - Plant functional traits under cattle grazing and fallow age scenarios in a tropical dry forest of Northwestern Mexico
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Evaluating plant functional traits helps to understand how plants respond to changing environmental conditions and resource availability associated with disturbance events. Livestock production is one of the primary drivers of tropical forest loss and degradation. Livestock alter environmental conditions within the forest by grazing, trampling and nutrient inputs, which in turn can influence species composition and functional traits of species. Understanding how livestock influence functional traits along a successional gradient is poorly understood. Here, we studied the effect of cattle grazing and fallow age on plant functional traits and soil nutrients in secondary and old-growth tropical dry forests. We analyzed plant functional traits of the most important species in successional and old-growth forest communities in both cattle present and cattle excluded plots. Our results showed the effects of cattle grazing and fallow age on plant functional traits, with fallow age explaining more variation than cattle grazing. In early succession, functional traits were associated with water conservation (thicker leaves, lower specific leaf area), and in later successional they were linked with sunlight conservation (larger height, higher specific leaf area). The presence of large fruits and seeds in advanced successional sites suggests high resource availability, which may help plants to successfully reproduce. Moreover, under cattle grazing some functional traits are associated with herbivory defense (high foliar dry weight and thick leaves). Even though N and C increased as succession advanced, the sites with cattle grazing had higher NH4 and NO3 concentrations as a result of fecal deposition. Plant functional traits responded to fallow age than to cattle grazing. Our study showed that cattle exclusion, as a management and biodiversity conservation strategy, contributes positively to soil nutrition. Thus, fallow age and cattle exclusion facilitate soil recovery and allows establishing species with suitable functional attributes for overcoming environmental filters in abandoned cattle fields.

TI  - Ecosystem impacts of disturbance in a dry tropical forest in southern India
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
AB  - Indian forests provide a multitude of services to vast populations. Common human activities including livestock grazing, fuelwood extraction and burning have the potential to impact forest ecosystem structure and function. The effects of these activities on vegetation, ecology and soil properties were investigated in Bandipur National Park (BNP) in southern India. Data were collected from 200 sites in four watersheds within the park. Sample sites spanned a degradation gradient measured by a field disturbance index (FDI). This paper focusses on the impacts on vegetation structure, diversity and composition, and integrates impacts on soil. Shrub and tree species were inventoried and evaluated in plots 10-m in diameter. The tree layer was dominated by Anogeissus-Emblica-Tectona species. The understory was dominated by invasives Chromolaena odorata and Lantana camara, and native gymnosporia emarginata. Vegetation plot heights, canopy cover and tree diameters were negatively correlated with field disturbance resulting in stunted forest stature in degraded sites. Vegetation composition in degraded watersheds was dominated by small woody tree species and a greater diversity of shrub species. Ordination analysis was used to integrate soil data with vegetation and disturbance, revealing that deciduous forest in the park is degrading to scrub forest along with negative impacts on soil characteristics. Consequences of services currently enjoyed by local populations are discussed. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Satellite based integrated approaches to modelling spatial carbon stock and carbon sequestration potential of different land uses of Northeast India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
AB  - The study aims to estimate and predict the aboveground biomass, carbon stock and carbon sequestration potential of different land uses of Northeast India and relate these estimates with the land use changes. Many applications such as carbon stock and sequestration monitoring, forest degradation monitoring, and climate change mitigation, require precise and timely estimation of forest biomass. Although traditional field inventory can reliably estimate forest biomass, remote sensing is emerging as an alternate and fast approach to cover larger area with relative precision for biomass estimation. In this study, a combined approach of field inventory and Landsat OLI derived vegetation indices were used in spatial modelling of aboveground biomass and carbon stock in different land uses. A stepwise multilinear regression algorithm was used to derive the model that used Landsat derived NDVI, SAVI and ARVI as predicators. The predicted AGB ranged from 14.32 to 185.95 Mg ha(-1) with an average of 148.78 Mg ha(-1). The developed model that used combined vegetation indices showed correlation of R-2 = 0.79 with an RMSE of 51.04 Mg ha(-1). The present study also applied the empirical model (CO2FIX) to simulate the future scenario of carbon stock and carbon sequestration potential of the different land uses. The carbon stock potential of different land uses were 182.31 Mg ha(-1), 158.91 Mg ha(-1), 134.98 Mg ha(-1), 169.26 Mg ha(-1), 133.84, 89.95 Mg ha(-1), 128.3 Mg ha(-1) and 61.36 Mg ha(-1) in Tropical forest, Subtropical forest, Temperate forest, Tropical plantation, Subtropical plantation, Temperate plantation, Shifting fallows and Agricultural land, respectively.

T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Aims This study was designed to determine if planting the leguminous tree Inga punctata in previously cleared former tropical premontane wet forests changed the Nitrogen (N)-fixer and Lignin Degrader community compositions resulting in increased accumulation of soil carbon (C) and N components. Methods Soils were collected near the base of old growth (> 50 years old), 4, 8 and 11-year-old I. punctata trees, and assessed for differences in various soil C and N metrics, and the mean proportion of sequences (MPS, as "relative abundance " via 16S rRNA V3, V4 sequencing), composition, stability and evenness of the N-fixer and Lignin Degrader community genera. Results The N-fixer MPS decreased, and Lignin Degraders increased, while evenness and stability of both increased in soils along the tree age gradient. The Lignin Degrader MPS were positively correlated with TN, NO3-, TOC, and Biomass C, and negatively correlated with N-fixer MPS and NH4+. The N-fixer MPS were negatively correlated with TN, NO3-, TOC, Biomass-C and Lignin Degrader MPS, and positively correlated with NH4+. Evenness, stability, and dissimilarity increased for both groups in soils along the tree age gradient. Conclusions This is the first evidence that I. punctata facilitates changes in tree-soil N-fixer and Lignin Degrader communities over time by increasing the dissimilarity, evenness and stability of both groups, and increases the accumulation of tree soil C and N. This suggests I. punctata facilitates soil recovery such that it can serve as C and N sinks and support its future use in reforestation management strategy.

TI  - Planting exceptional tropical tree species to increase long-term carbon storage in assisted secondary succession
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - With rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, strategies for greater carbon sequestration and long-term storage are urgently needed. Current reforestation schemes typically use fast-growing tree species with low wood density, limiting the amount of carbon stored. In most tropical forests, there are native species with relatively fast growth rates, high wood density and low mortality rates that also achieve large adult size-'exceptional species'.We present a simulated assessment of the carbon sequestration potential using these exceptional species in assisted secondary succession in the Neotropics.In our example, the selected exceptional species could add up to 16.2 Mg C/ha of sequestered carbon in secondary wet forests at maturity.Synthesis and applications. By increasing the representation of exceptional species in reforestation efforts, we could potentially boost long-term carbon storage in reforestation projects focussed on carbon sequestration. However, our approach is not a substitute for protecting existing old primary forests and reforested lands plus reducing deforestation and emissions.
   Con el aumento de las concentraciones atmosfericas de CO2, se necesitan urgentemente estrategias para una mayor captura y almacenamiento a largo plazo del carbono. Los esquemas de reforestacion actuales suelen utilizar especies de arboles de rapido crecimiento con baja densidad de madera, lo que limita la cantidad de carbono almacenado. En la mayoria de los bosques tropicales, hay especies nativas con tasas de crecimiento relativamente rapidas, alta densidad de madera y bajas tasas de mortalidad que tambien alcanzan un gran tamano adulto-'especies excepcionales'.Presentamos una evaluacion simulada del potencial de secuestro de carbono usando estas especies excepcionales en la sucesion secundaria asistida en el Neotropico.En nuestro ejemplo, las especies excepcionales seleccionadas podrian sumar hasta 16.2 Mg C/ha de carbono secuestrado en bosques humedos secundarios en su madurez.Sintesis y aplicaciones. Al aumentar la representacion de especies excepcionales en los esfuerzos de reforestacion, podriamos impulsar potencialmente el almacenamiento de carbono a largo plazo en proyectos de reforestacion centrados en el secuestro de carbono. Sin embargo, nuestro enfoque no reemplaza la proteccion de los bosques primarios antiguos existentes y las tierras reforestadas, ni reduce la necesidad de disminuir la deforestacion y las emisiones.

TI  - Exploring Local Perspectives for Conservation Planning: A Case Study from a Remote Forest Community in Indonesian Papua
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Reconciling conservation and livelihoods is a concern wherever forests are important in local people's lives. We plead for engaging these people in survey activities to clarify what is important to them, as a first step in conservation planning. This will help to address their priorities and gain their guidance and support for interventions. This paper presents the results of such a survey with the community of Kwerba in Mamberamo, a remote and little known part of Indonesian Papua. Views and priorities were explored through interviews, scoring exercises, community mapping and a field survey. Whereas small gardens provided most staple food, culture and livelihoods were linked to the forest. People scored primary forest highest for nearly all use categories. Primary forest was particularly highly valued as a source of construction materials, ornaments and rituals, and as a hunting place. We developed a list of the overall most important plants and animals. Many natural resources were used, but few were commercially exploited. The community had rules to control access to certain areas and resources. Taboos to restrict access to sacred places were also maintained. Our evaluation identified opportunities to achieve conservation outcomes jointly with the Kwerba people. In follow-up activities, the community presented local government with a land-use plan for their territory. The government recognized the value of our approach and requested training to implement it more widely in the region.

TI  - Fire shapes mammal abundance at the Cerrado-Pantanal ecotone: Scale of effect, species traits and land-cover interaction
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
AB  - In tropical regions, which harbour the majority of the Earth's biodiversity, land-cover change emerges as the primary driver of biodiversity loss. However, despite the propensity for many tropical biomes to experience fires, and the rapidly accelerating pace of intensification in fire regimes, the role of fire in shaping ecological communities has largely been overlooked. We examined whether and how fire regime affected the abundance of mammal species, the scale at which these putative effects operated and how fire effect interacted with land cover. Using camera traps, we studied four mammal species with different ecological traits in the Kadiwe<acute accent>u indigenous territory, a Cerrado-Pantanal ecotone. Specifically, we used abundance models to analyse the response of mammal species to fire frequency, spatial extent, and time since fire. Our results showed that mammals responded to fire at scales that align with the scale of responses to land cover. We found that the type of response to fire, and the scale at which fire effects operate, depended on species and possibly on their traits. The smallest species Sylvilagus brasiliensis demonstrated a clear response to fire, as well as to the mean patch area of savanna, exclusively at the smallest scale studied (i.e., within 500-m radius buffers). The abundance of this species decreased with increasing proportion of land burned in the 12 months preceding the monitoring. In contrast, larger species, including Mazama gouazoubira and Tapirus terrestris, showed no response to fire, while Pecari tajacu would exhibit a marginal response, at the larger scale of 1000 m. Our results emphasize the importance of adopting trait-based approaches that consider the multiple aspects of fire regimes, at multiple scales, to disentangle the mechanisms governing the effects of fire on biodiversity. This should promote effective and sustainable fire management compatible with systemic conservation of species and ecological traits in fire-prone biomes.

TI  - From eco-catastrophe to zero deforestation? Interdisciplinarities, politics, environmentalisms and reduced clearing in Amazonia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Brazil's rate of deforestation has declined by more than 70% since 2004, a dynamic unimaginable even a decade ago. Even the worst drought in more than 100 years (2010) produced a flat clearing profile from 2009-2010, an unexpected result, since dry periods usually have clearing spikes. While deforestation continues throughout the tropics (and Amazonia), and the recent change in Brazil's Forest Code has produced a modest increase in deforestation, there are significant processes that are slowing clearing and fostering woodland recovery. This paper outlines the multiplicities and interdisciplinarities of political ecologies, policies, politics scientific approaches and technologies that have moderated forest conversion and shaped Amazonia's unusual, and unusually effective development and conservation conjunctures in Brazil's post-authoritarian period. New institutional framings, ideologies, political decentralization, globalizations and an expanded arena for new social movements and civil society provided the context for this transformation. Changing environmental institutions, discourses and the relatively redistributive social pact that underpinned President Ignacio (Lula) da Silva's administration had a significant role in promoting more resilient land uses, monitoring, compliance and new markets, while regional social movements and national and international commodity boycotts affected more damaging ones. Finally, other forms of payment for environmental services, such as REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) and REDD+ are changing the value of standing forests. This paper describes how complex interdisciplinarities shaped the politics, policies and practices that slowed forest clearing. However, Amazonia's politics are extremely dynamic: destabilizing processes, violence and indifferent national leadership could still reverse this remarkable turnaround.

TI  - Land related grievances shape tropical forest-cover in areas affected by armed-conflict
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - Armed-conflicts often occur in tropical areas considered to be of high 'conservation-value', termed as such for their biodiversity or carbon-storage functions. Despite this important overlap, few studies have assessed how forest-biomass is affected by armed-conflicts. Thus, in this paper we develop a multinomial logit model to, examine how outcomes of the interactions between carbon-storage, armed-conflict and deforestation rates are linked to social, institutional and economic factors. We use Colombia as a case study because of its protracted armed-conflict, high forest-cover, sustained deforestation rates and ongoing peace processes. Our empirical results show that the impacts of armed-conflicts on forest-cover are connected to specific socio-economical processes, such as unequal land distribution and land grabbing, which typically occurs as part of 'agricultural colonization'. Findings address a research gap by providing statistically sound evidence for associations between armed-conflicts and land-related grievances, which has rarely been demonstrated empirically. Our results also suggest that forest commons are associated with reduced armed-conflict, and simultaneously provide contributions to carbon storage and to meeting basic needs. Moreover, our forest-conflict transition models provide useful visual means to capture and relay to policymakers-the causes of forest cover-changes in a conflict-affected country. Finally, our findings imply that in dedicating their efforts to resolving land-ownership disputes, the Colombian government might uphold their international climate change commitments via reducing deforestation and hence forest based carbon emissions, while pursuing their national security objective via undermining opportunities for guerrilla groups to operate.

TI  - Contrasting patterns of local richness of seedlings, saplings, and trees may have implications for regeneration in rainforest remnants
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Remnants of lowland rain forest remain following deforestation, but the longer-term effects of fragmentation remain poorly understood, partly due to the long generation times of trees. We study rain forest trees in three size classes: seedlings (<1 cm dbh), saplings (1-5 cm dbh), and trees (>5 cm) that broadly reflect pre- and post-fragmentation communities, and we examine the impacts of fragmentation on forest regeneration in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We found that seedling richness (measured as the number of genera per plot) in fragments was about 30 percent lower than in plots in undisturbed forest, and about 20 percent lower than in an extensive tract of selectively logged forest, providing evidence of recruitment declines in fragments. Seedling richness was lowest in small, isolated, and disturbed fragments, potentially signaling an extinction debt given that these fragmentation impacts were not observed in trees. Unlike seedlings, saplings showed no declines in richness in fragments, suggesting that density dependent mortality (where rare individuals have a higher survival rate) and/or year-to-year variation in which species are recruiting could potentially compensate for the reductions in seedling richness we observed. Longer-term studies are required to determine whether sporadic or failed recruitment in small fragments will eventually translate into reduced richness of mature trees, or whether the processes that currently retain high sapling richness will continue in fragments.

TI  - India's biodiversity hotspot under anthropogenic pressure: A case study of Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
AB  - This paper presents data on the impact of biotic pressure in terms of grazing by livestock and wood cutting by humans on the plant community in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve of India. Grass, and herbaceous plant biomass, number of cattle dung piles, number of woody stems available and damaged by human activities and weed biomass were assessed at different proximity along transects radiating from village-forest boundary to forest interior to measure the ecological impact of livestock grazing and fire wood collection. The grass biomass was positively correlated to overgrazing indicating the adverse effect on natural vegetation by cattle. Woodcutting was intense along the forest boundary and significantly declined as distance increased. Similarly, weed biomass and number of thorny species declined positively with proximity from village-forest boundary and the weed biomass was significantly higher in the pastoral sites compared to residential sites. The results suggest that human impact adversely affects natural vegetation and promotes weed proliferation in forest areas adjoining human settlements in the ecologically important Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. Continued anthropogenic pressure could cause reduction in fodder availability to large herbivores like elephants, which in turn leads to an increase in human-elephant conflict.

TI  - Fertilization and seasonality influence on the photochemical performance of tree legumes in forest plantation for area recovery in the Amazon
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - N-fixing leguminous species can reach atmospheric dinitrogen gas (N-2), having an advantage under N-limited degraded environments. These N-fixers are constantly used as facilitative species. Chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChF) acknowledges how different species take up and use light energy during photosynthesis. These techniques assess stress and performance responses to photosynthesis and are used for the selection of species with potential for reforestation. Six Fabaceae species were selected for this study: three nonfixing species (Cenostigma tocantinum, Senna reticulata and Dipteryx odorata) and three N-fixing species (Clitoria fairchildiana, Inga edulis and Acacia spp.). Variations in chlorophyll fluorescence under high vs. low water and nutrient conditions were studied. Multivariate analysis was performed to detect the effects of seasonality and fertilization on dark-adapted ChF two years after the experiment was established. The correlation among ChF variables and growth, photosynthesis and foliar nutrient concentrations was evaluated. Under high water- and nutrient-availability conditions, plants exhibited an enhanced performance index on absorption basis values correlated with electron transport fluxes. Under drought and nutrient-poor conditions, most species exhibit increased energy dissipation as photoprotection. High interspecific variation was found; therefore, species-specific responses should be considered in future ChF studies. Corroborating the ability to colonize high-light environments, N-fixers showed an increased performance index correlated with electron transport and Zn and N foliar concentrations. Negative correlations were found between photosynthesis and trapped fluxes. Diameter growth was positively correlated with electron transport fluxes. Given the different responses among species, ChF is an effective technique to screen for seasonality, fertilization and species effects and should be considered for use during forest restoration. Finally, the addition of fertilization treatments may facilitate tropical forest restoration due to the importance of nutrients in physiological processes. N-fixers showed high photochemical performance and tolerance to abiotic stress in degraded areas and therefore should be included to support ecosystem biomass restoration.

TI  - Soil macrofauna communities in Brazilian land-use systems
T2  - BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL
AB  - Background Soil animal communities include more than 40 higher-order taxa, representing over 23% of all described species. These animals have a wide range of feeding sources and contribute to several important soil functions and ecosystem services. Although many studies have assessed macroinvertebrate communities in Brazil, few of them have been published in journals and even fewer have made the data openly available for consultation and further use. As part of ongoing efforts to synthesise the global soil macrofauna communities and to increase the amount of openly-accessible data in GBIF and other repositories related to soil biodiversity, the present paper provides links to 29 soil macroinvertebrate datasets covering 42 soil fauna taxa, collected in various land-use systems in Brazil. A total of 83,085 georeferenced occurrences of these taxa are presented, based on quantitative estimates performed using a standardised sampling method commonly adopted worldwide to collect soil macrofauna populations, i.e. the TSBF (Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility Programme) protocol. This consists of digging soil monoliths of 25 x 25 cm area, with handsorting of the macroinvertebrates visible to the naked eye from the surface litter and from within the soil, typically in the upper 0-20 cm layer (but sometimes shallower, i.e. top 0-10 cm or deeper to 0-40 cm, depending on the site). The land-use systems included anthropogenic sites managed with agricultural systems (e.g. pastures, annual and perennial crops, agroforestry), as well as planted forests and native vegetation located mostly in the southern Brazilian State of Parana (96 sites), with a few additional sites in the neighbouring states of Sao Paulo (21 sites) and Santa Catarina (five sites). Important metadata on soil properties, particularly soil chemical parameters (mainly pH, C, P, Ca, K, Mg, Al contents, exchangeable acidity, Cation Exchange Capacity, Base Saturation and, infrequently, total N), particle size distribution (mainly % sand, silt and clay) and, infrequently, soil moisture and bulk density, as well as on human management practices (land use and vegetation cover) are provided. These data will be particularly useful for those interested in estimating land-use change impacts on soil biodiversity and its implications for below-ground foodwebs, ecosystem functioning and ecosystem service delivery. New information Quantitative estimates are provided for 42 soil animal taxa, for two biodiversity hotspots: the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and Cerrado biomes. Data are provided at the individual monolith level, representing sampling events ranging from February 2001 up to September 2016 in 122 sampling sites and over 1800 samples, for a total of 83,085 ocurrences.

TI  - People plant trees for utility more often than for biodiversity or carbon
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Tree planting is both a promising and controversial solution to climate change and biodiversity loss. However, this controversy is largely theoretical because we lack detailed information of how tree planting is proceeding onthe-ground. Here, we compiled a pantropical dataset of 174 tree planting organizations to determine the type of organizations involved in tree planting, their geographic locations and tree planting approaches. We found that the number of organizations have increased by 288% in the past 30 years, especially for-profit organizations. These organizations reported planting nearly 1.4 billion trees across 74 countries since 1961. Most frequently organizations reported establishing agroforestry systems or mixed species and single species plantations or using assisted natural regeneration, suggesting that tree planting programs are designed to support local communities as well as environmental objectives. Moreover, the most frequently reported species were commercial or utilitarian, with the top five including cacao, teak, moringa, mango and coffee. Finally, despite widespread efforts to plant more trees, there was a pronounced lack of monitoring on websites and in reports; only 18% of organizations mention monitoring at all, and only 5% mention measuring survival rate of plantings. Greater transparency and greater communication are needed between planting organizations and researchers to apply the most effective ways to restore forest cover. Further, while organizations often aimed to counter environmental problems, the use of the same sets of commercially useful species to meet economic development goals across the global indicates a need for greater coordination among organizations to avoid biotic homogenization.

TI  - Biodiversity impacts of land use simplification: a case study of dung beetles in a landscape of the Brazilian Atlantic forest
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
AB  - Unplanned and invasive use of natural resources can have irreversible implications for the environment. Appropriate strategies for adequate management could have utmost importance for the conservation of biodiversity. Environments that harbor a huge structural complexity, such as agroforestry systems, even the simplest ones, may host a high species diversity and may therefore ensure the provision of important ecological services. To examine the effect of vegetation structure loss by land use simplification on biodiversity, we evaluate dung beetle (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) diversity in different land uses, considering: Brazilian Atlantic Forest, cacao-rubber agroforestry, and rubber monoculture. We found a decreasing gradient of dung beetle diversity from forest to monoculture, as cacao-rubber agroforestry maintaining an intermediate level of dung beetle diversity that is lower than that of the native forest but significantly higher than rubber monoculture. Species composition is rather similar when comparing forest and agroforestry, whereas monoculture holds a different assemblage. Although monoculture farming is still encouraged by the agribusiness market, our results support the idea that agroforestry is a reasonable option to be considered and adapted to compensate the deleterious effects of agriculture intensification on dung beetle diversity. We suggest that such land use would be the best choice to ensure dung beetle diversity maintenance in agricultural landscapes.

TI  - The first rapid forest inventory and resource use assessment of Dashtijum Nature Reserve, Tajikistan: a mixed methods approach
T2  - ORYX
AB  - There is critical need for more information on the status of forests in Central Asia, to inform conservation management. Here we assess the status and use of the globally important, threatened walnut-fruit forests of Dashtijum Nature Reserve, Tajikistan. We use a mixed methods approach combining a semi-structured interview based socio-economic survey with statistical analysis. Thirty-three tree species were recorded, with Rosaceae the most common family. The mean basal area of the forest was 20.8 m(2)per ha and most tree species exhibited stable population structures. Resource use was prevalent throughout the community; most households harvested at least one fruit or nut species (78%), firewood (88%) and grazed livestock (85%). Most respondents noted declines in availability of fruits, nuts and firewood and reported a decrease in the overall area and quality of grazing. Statistical analysis and machine learning identified that distance to nearest settlement significantly affected forest total basal area, tree species richness and the Shannon index, a metric of diversity sensitive to rare species. Our results suggest that conservation management by the government and NGOs is partly effective but there is a need for increased enforcement of grazing restrictions, to prevent further forest degradation.

TI  - Southeast Asian biodiversity is a fifth lower in deforested versus intact forests
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Southeast Asia is highly biodiverse and currently experiences among the highest rates of tropical deforestation globally, but impacts on biodiversity are not well synthesized. We use Bayesian multi-level modeling to meta-analyse 831 pairwise comparisons of biodiversity in sites subject to land-use driven deforestation (for example, plantations or logged forest) versus undisturbed sites (control sites). After controlling for hierarchical dependencies, we show that biodiversity is a fifth lower in sites with these land-use driven deforestation (95% credible interval = 16%-28%, mean = 22%). This reduction was greater when forest losses were of high-intensity (34% reduction in biodiversity) compared to low-intensity (18% reduction), and effects were consistent across biogeographic regions and taxa. Oil-palm plantations led to the greatest reduction in biodiversity (39%, CI 27%-48%), and agroforests the least (24%, CI 10%-37%). We also find that biodiversity was reduced by 26% (CI 4%-42%) in secondary forest sites compared to undisturbed control sites, but biodiversity was the same in intermediate or mature-aged secondary forest compared to control sites (although species composition was potentially altered). Overall, our study provides a new line of evidence of the substantial detrimental impacts of land-use driven deforestation and particular types of land-use on the biodiversity of Southeast Asia.

TI  - Agroforestry orchards support greater butterfly diversity than monoculture plantations in the tropics
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Large-scale deforestation in the tropics, triggered by logging and subsequent agricultural monoculture has a significant adverse impact on biodiversity due to habitat degradation. Here, we measured the diversity of butterfly species in three agricultural landscapes, agroforestry orchards, oil palm, and rubber tree plantations. Butterfly species were counted at 127 sampling points over the course of a year using the point count method. We found that agroforestry orchards supported a greater number of butterfly species (74 species) compared to rubber tree (61 species) and oil palm plantations (54 species) which were dominated by generalist (73%) followed by forest specialists (27%). We found no significant difference of butterfly species composition between agroforestry orchards and rubber tree plantation, with both habitats associated with more butterfly species compared to oil palm plantations. This indicates butterflies were able to persist better in certain agricultural landscapes. GLMMs suggested that tree height, undergrowth coverage and height, and elevation determined butterfly diversity. Butterfly species richness was also influenced by season and landscape-level variables such as proximity to forest, mean NDVI, and habitat. Understanding the factors that contributed to butterfly species richness in an agroecosystem, stakeholders should consider management practices to improve biodiversity conservation such as ground vegetation management and retaining adjacent forest areas to enhance butterfly species richness. Furthermore, our findings suggest that agroforestry system should be considered to enhance biodiversity in agricultural landscapes.

TI  - Monitoring the rewilding of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest on tree and mammal diversity: From a biodiversity hotspot to a biodiversity hopespot
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
AB  - The implementation of rewilding initiatives is crucial for biodiversity recovery, particularly in biodiversity hotspots such as the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Long-term monitoring of rewilding initiatives is critical for assessing progress and informing management choices. This study assesses the efficiency of different reforestation practices for biodiversity recovery, including passive restoration, active reforestation with different native seedlings, and plantations of exotic species. We applied an ecosystem approach to estimate the tree and mammal diversity, collected through forest plots and camera traps. We selected differently managed areas and included the oldest forest patches as reference points for the assessment of biodiversity; a naturally disturbed montane forest in the area was included as a control category for the disturbance analysis. Moreover, we investigated the influence of ecological variables, such as biodiversity, aboveground biomass, and altitude, on rewilding processes. Our results suggest that Eucalyptus plantations, a simplified ecosystem made up of monocultures of exotic species, support lower biodiversity. On the contrary, active reforestation with different native species resulted in an ecological status comparable to naturally regrown secondary forests. We show that active reforestation can reduce the time required for rewilding. We also found a positive correlation between tree and mammal species richness. These results underscore the importance and potential of responsible restoration efforts in recovering local biodiversity, contributing to the vision of a future where the Brazilian Atlantic Forest can be acknowledged not only as a biodiversity hotspot but also as a "hopespot."

TI  - Monoculture plantations impede forest recovery: Evidence from the regeneration of lowland subtropical forest in Hong Kong
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Anthropogenic disturbance has led to widespread clearance and degradation of tropical forests, and tree planting has been promoted as an effective solution for recovery. However, trees have been overwhelmingly planted in monocultures or low-diversity mixes and this is expected to have profound, lasting impacts on forest structure, diversity, and functioning. In this study, we tested the extent to which historical vegetation transition types (VTTs) constrain forest recovery in a secondary tropical landscape in Hong Kong, South China. To do so, we overlaid vegetation types (forest, shrubland, pine plantation, grassland) identified in aerial photographs taken in 1956 and 1963 of a 20-ha plot situated in Tai Po Kau Nature Reserve, allowing us to define six historic VTTs, namely: FF (forest to forest), GP (grassland to plantation), GS (grassland to shrubland), SS (shrubland to shrubland), SF (shrubland to forest), and SP (shrubland to plantation). We compared present-day forest structure and species diversity among these VTTs, as determined from a census conducted in 2015, using incidence- and abundance-based rarefaction and extrapolation, and we assessed species' association within VTTs using a torus translation test. Our results reveal that stem density and species diversity in naturally regenerated forests were more similar to those of old-growth forest, whereas species diversity in areas occupied by pine plantations was significantly lower as compared with naturally regenerated areas. Despite 60 years of recovery, pine plantations were characterised by a significantly greater proportion of negatively associated species, and late-seral species were still predominantly confined to old-growth patches. Present-day species distribution is chiefly explained by the combined effects of topography and VTT (17.1%), with VTT alone explaining 4.4%. Our study demonstrates that VTT has a significant long-term impact on forest regeneration and community assembly and, importantly, that monocultural plantations (forest plantation) can greatly impede forest recovery. Remnant old-growth forest patches merit priority protection, and active restoration, including thinning and enhancement planting, is necessary to facilitate forest succession.

TI  - Contemporary forest restoration: A review emphasizing function
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The forest restoration challenge (globally 2 billion ha) and the prospect of changing climate with increasing frequency of extreme events argues for approaching restoration from a functional and landscape perspective. Because the practice of restoration utilizes many techniques common to silviculture, no clear line separates ordinary forestry practices from restoration. The distinction may be that extra-ordinary activities are required in the face of degraded, damaged, or destroyed ecosystems. Restoration is driven by the desire to increase sustainability of ecosystems and their services and restoration is likely to have multiple goals arising from the motivations of those involved. The process of setting restoration objectives translates vague goals into feasible, measurable targets and ultimately actions on the ground. Our objective for this review is to synthesize the science underpinning contemporary approaches to forest restoration practice. We focus on methods and present them within a coherent terminology of four restoration strategies: rehabilitation, reconstruction, reclamation, and replacement. While not a consensus terminology, these terms have a logical foundation. Rehabilitation restores desired species composition, structure, or processes to a degraded ecosystem. Reconstruction restores native plant communities on land recently in other resource uses, such as agriculture. Reclamation restores severely degraded land generally devoid of vegetation, often the result of resource extraction, such as mining. Replacement of species (or their locally-adapted genotypes) with new species (or new genotypes) is a response to climate change. Restoration methods are presented as available tools; because adding vegetation is an effective restoration technique, the discussion of methods begins with a description of available plant materials. We then discuss altering composition under different initial overstory conditions, including deployment methods depending upon whether or not an overstory is present, how much of the landscape will be restored, and the complexity of the planting design. We present some major approaches for altering structure in degraded forest stands, and describe approaches for restoration of two key ecosystem processes, fire and flooding. Although we consider stand-level designs, what we describe is mostly scalable to the landscape-level. No restoration project is undertaken in a social vacuum; even stand-level restoration occurs within a system of governance that regulates relationships among key agents. Gathering information and understanding the social dimensions of a restoration project is as necessary as understanding the biophysical dimensions. Social considerations can trump biophysical factors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Arthropod responses to the experimental isolation of Amazonian forest fragments
T2  - ZOOLOGIA
AB  - Arthropods are the most diverse and abundant group of animals found in tropical lowland forests, and in light of ongoing global change phenomena, it is essential to better understand their responses to anthropogenic disturbances. Here we present a review of arthropod responses to forest deforestation and fragmentation based on studies conducted at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP), located in central Amazonia. These studies involved a wide range of arthropod groups. All but one of the studies evaluated changes in total species number or species density in relation to fragment size, (i.e. area effects), and one-third also evaluated edge effects. Our review indicates that almost every arthropod group studied showed some kind of response to reduction in forest area, including altered abundances, species richness or composition in comparisons of different-sized fragments, fragmented and non-fragmented areas, or comparisons of forest edges and forest interiors. These responses tended to be idiosyncratic, with some groups showing predicted declines in abundance or diversity in the fragments while others show no response or even increases. However, some of the observed effects on arthropods, or on the ecological processes in which they are involved, were transient. The most likely explanation for this was the rapid development of secondary growth around fragments, which greatly increased the connectivity between fragments and the remaining forest. Although the BDFFP has provided many insights regarding the effects of forest fragmentation on arthropod assemblages, many diverse groups, such as canopy arthropods, have received scant attention. For those that have been studied, much remains to be learned regarding the long-term dynamics of these assemblages and how landscape context influences local biodiversity. The BDFFP remains an exceptional site in which to investigate how the ecological interactions in which arthropods are engaged are altered in fragmented landscapes.

TI  - Distribution of Ormosia macrocalyx in Mexico and delimitation of its occupation areas
T2  - REVISTA MEXICANA DE BIODIVERSIDAD
AB  - The geographic-ecological distribution of Ormosia macrocalyx Ducke was analyzed to delimit the occupation areas (AO) in Mexico, in order to recognize the ecological requirements of this tree species, which can contribute to the development and establishment of appropriate protection programs. All georeferenced species records were obtained from national and international herbaria as well as national forest inventories. Each record was correlated with the ecological variables from database of National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity and National Institute of Statistics and Geography and maps of the AO were drawn up. The AO were calculated and delimited by the Cartographic method by conglomerates. This species is distributed in the southern states of Mexico, occupying zones of high precipitation (>= 800 mm), at elevations lower than 1,150 m asl and mainly on Gleysol soils. It has been recorded in forest remnants in agroforestry systems and as isolated individuals. Five AO and 6 satellites were delimited, the 2 largest areas located within Tabasco and Chiapas. Due to its specialized habitat and the fragmented ecosystems in which it is found, this species can be categorized as vulnerable.

TI  - Disturbance and climate affect species richness and aboveground biomass relationship in a forest-savanna transition ecosystem
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The relationship between species richness and aboveground biomass (richness-biomass relationship) is a major facet of ecosystem functions and has stimulated debates over the past decades. However, we still lack basic knowledge on whether this relationship has consistent patterns across natural and human-impacted vegetation cover types. More importantly, the effects of disturbance and climatic conditions on species richness and aboveground biomass remain controversial. Using data from 197 0.5-ha plots established within a forest-savanna transition ecosystem, we determined three ecological vegetation covers via non-metric multidimensional scaling, obtained gridded climate data and calculated disturbance index from species succession guilds. We examined the consistency of the richness-biomass relationship across the vegetation covers using general linear models and further analysed the effects of disturbance and climatic conditions on this relationship using non-mixed and mixed linear models. We identified three vegetation cover types corresponding to Old-growth forests, Cocoa agroforests and Woodland savannas, suggesting a succession gradient from late-, mid-, and early-successions, respectively. Aboveground biomass consistently increased with species richness across the three vegetation cover types (i.e. positive relationship). Species richness interacts with climate humidity to increase aboveground biomass while interaction of species richness and disturbance rather decreases aboveground biomass consistently across the vegetation cover types. Our results provide insights into the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functions, having implications for ecosystem restoration and understanding ecological consequences of disturbance and climate change in the forest-savanna ecosystem.

TI  - Changes in floristic composition, diversity and anthropogenic perturbations in an east African tropical forest
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - We assessed changes in floristic composition, diversity and anthropogenic activities in an East African forest; Echuya Central Forest Reserve (ECFR). Using 272 permanent sample plots, comparisons between 2015 and 2021 were made. Twenty-two tree species were recorded with Macaranga capensis being the most dominant. Tree species density increased significantly from 152 stems/ha in 2015 to 306 stems/ha in 2021. Similarly, trees basal area increased significantly from 19 m(2)/ha in 2015 to 38 m(2)/ha in 2021. The bamboo stem density decreased significantly from 11,931 stems/ha in 2015 to 1807 stems/ha in 2021. Shrubs, lianas, vines and herbs' densities did not show significant differences between 2015 and 2021. Furthermore, a number of human activities significantly increased from 22 activities per hectare in 2015 to 83 per hectare in 2021. The Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) ordination shows that the human activities with the strongest impact on tree species composition and basal areas were fuelwood collection, human trails, livestock grazing and pole cutting. In conclusion, ECFR is floristically poor; secondary forest tree species are replacing the bamboo forest and human activities could be negatively affecting the ECFR flora. We recommend interventions of increasing people's livelihood incomes to decrease their dependence on forest resources.

TI  - Scenario-modelling for the sustainable management of non-timber forest products in tropical ecosystems
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - Ecosystems degradation, and consequently biodiversity loss, has severe impacts on people around the world. The Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is one of the international initiatives that have emerged to inform policy makers and aid decisions to prevent further global biodiversity loss, focusing on the interdependence between natural systems and human culture. IPBES promotes the use of scenarios and modelling approaches as a fundamental tool to advance the understanding of the relationships between drivers of change, Nature's Contributions to People (NCP), and social systems. Local-scale case studies with a system approach demonstrating how current knowledge can be used to inform decision-making are still scarce. Here, we present a comprehensive conceptual model and a series of four scenarios under different policies for shea tree species management, as a case-study of applying systems thinking and the NCP concept to a local-scale socio-ecological system. We first characterized the central processes, NCP, drivers and pressures affecting the shea tree system, to investigate the impacts of the multiple uses of the shea tree species on the system as a whole. We then described potential policy options, developed four scenarios, and evaluated them by a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN). We predicted qualitative outcomes of the proposed scenarios: Business-as-usual (BAU), "Conservation and fair trade", "Agroforestry and fair trade" and "Industrial development". We found that the scenarios focussing on conservation, fair trade and agroforestry, can improve the conservation status of shea trees, and enhance well-being in the local communities. In this case study, we demonstrate that the development of a comprehensive conceptual model at a local scale can be a useful exercise to identify opportunities for effective policy strategies and social innovation. The shea tree case study can provide an example for modelling non-timber forest products in other regions around the world that face similar drivers and pressures. Species for which this model could be adapted include Central and South American species such as the Brazilian nut (Bertholletia excelsa), cocoa (Theobroma cacao), andiroba (Carapa guianensis), acai (Euterpe oleracea) and the wax palm (Ceroxylon quindiuense). The model and workflow applied here may thus be used to understand similar socio-ecological systems with local and international economic value across the Neotropical region.

TI  - Land cover changes and greenhouse gas emissions in two different soil covers in the Brazilian Caatinga
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The Caatinga biome covers an area of 844,453 km(2) and has enormous endemic biodiversity, with unique characteristics that make it an exclusive Brazilian biome. It falls within the earth's tropical zone and is one of the several important ecoregions of Brazil. This biome undergoes natural lengthy periods of drought that cause losses in crop and livestock productivity, having a severe impact on the population. Due to the vulnerability of this ecosystem to climate change, livestock has emerged as the main livelihood of the rural population, being the precursor of the replacement of native vegetation by grazing areas. This study aimed to measure GHG emissions from two different soil covers: native forest (Caatinga) and pasture in the municipality of Sao Joao, Pernambuco State, in the years 2013 and 2014. GHG measurements were taken by using static chamber techniques in both soil covers. According to a previous search, so far, this is the first study measuring GHG emissions using the static chamber in the Caatinga biome. N2O emissions ranged from -1.0 to 4.2 mg m(-2) d(-1) and -1.22 to 3.4 mg m(-2) d(-1) in the pasture and Caatinga, respectively, and they did not significantly differ from each other. Emissions were significantly higher during dry seasons. Carbon dioxide ranged from -1.1 to 14.1 and 1.2 to 15.8 g m(-2) d(-1) in the pasture and Caatinga, respectively. CO2 emissions were higher in the Caatinga in 2013, and they were significantly influenced by soil temperature, showing an inverse relation. Methane emission ranged from 6.6 to 6.8 and -6.0 to 4.8 mg m(-2) d(-1) in the pasture and Caatinga, respectively, and was significantly higher only in the Caatinga in the rainy season of 2014. Soil gas fluxes seemed to be influenced by climatic and edaphic conditions as well as by soil cover in the Caatinga biome. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Primary productivity and resource partitioning in model tropical ecosystems
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - The diversity of plant life forms in tropical forests affords the opportunity for assembly of plant combinations, both natural and managed, that make full use of resources and sustain high productivity. The influence of combining life forms on productivity and resource use was evaluated using three fast-growing tree species (Hyeronima alchorneoides, Cedrela odorata, and Cordia alliodora); each species was grown alone and with two perennial, large-stature, self-supporting monocots (Euterpe oleracea and Heliconia imbricata).
   Aboveground net primary productivity was extremely high in all stands. The monocots did not contribute significantly to the productivity of the Hyeronima polycultures, which was 4.5-8.4 g.m(-2).d(-1) between 18 and 36 mo. In contrast, the monocots accounted for 57% of the productivity (9.7 g.m(-2).d(-1)) of Cedrela polycultures and 67% of the productivity (6.8 g.m(-2).d(-1)) of the Cordia polycultures, by age 3 yr. The leaf area and density of fine roots in the Cedrela and Cordia polycultures were also significantly increased by the presence of the monocots, reaching or surpassing the levels found in the Hyeronima stands.
   The high productivity of Hyeronima, coupled with poor growth of its interplanted monocots, indicated that Hyeronima was able to achieve nearly complete use of resources. Ecosystem productivity and resource capture were increased when the monocots were grown with the other two tree species, and this occurred because of the inability of the tree species to completely utilize available resources, which provided an opportunity for the monocots to flourish in the understory. Monocot productivity in the Cedrela stands was additive to that of the trees, indicating complementary resource use between the monocots and this tree species. In the case of Cordia, tree productivity was slowed by the monocots, but this decline was more than compensated for by the high productivity of the associated monocots.
   Whether in natural forests or human-constructed agroforestry systems, the presence of dominant species that do not fully exploit all available resources allows the coexistence of other species and creates the potential for complementary resource use. The resource use characteristics of such species should be a key consideration in forest restoration efforts and in the design of sustainable land use systems.

TI  - Rapid colonization of a Hawaiian restoration forest by a diverse avian community
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Deforestation of tropical forests has led to widespread loss and extirpation of forest bird species around the world, including the Hawaiian Islands which have experienced a dramatic loss of forests over the last 200-800 years. Given the important role birds play in forest ecosystem functions via seed dispersal and pollination, a bird community's response to forest restoration is an important measure of the success of such conservation actions. We evaluated the bird response to reforestation at an important bird sanctuary, Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge, Hawaii Island, using 26 years of bird count data. We show that most species from within the diverse avian community increased significantly, but species colonized the restoration forest at different rates. Distance from intact forest and time since restoration were both important predictors of colonization rate, interacting such that for most species it took more time to colonize areas farther from the intact forest. In addition, both forest cover and understory diversity helped to explain bird densities, but the effect varied among species, suggesting that different habitat requirements may help drive variation in colonization rates. This article provides the first detailed evaluation of how a diverse community of birds has responded to one of the largest, ongoing reforestation projects in Hawaii.

TI  - Few functionally acquisitive big-sized trees restrict but soil nutrients promote soil organic carbon storage in temperate deciduous forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) storage plays a crucial role in mitigating global climate change while maintaining forests and sustaining environmental conditions. Recent studies have shown that plant species diversity increases SOC storage in experimental grasslands and natural forests. Here, we aim to show how an integrating tree-size and trait-based ecological approach leads to mechanistic insights into SOC storage that may be overlooked in previous studies. We hypothesized that tree functional diversity effects on SOC storage would change with tree -sized-based species' functional strategies driven by soil properties in natural temperate deciduous forests. We used the forest inventory data, site-specific measured traits and soil properties from 99 temperate deciduous forest plots in northwestern Iran. We investigated the joint effects of topographic factors, soil chemical prop-erties, and the functional attributes (multi-trait functional diversity indices and community-weighted trait mean indices) of big-sized trees (BsT; individual tree diameter = 50 cm) and remaining-sized trees (RsT) on topsoil (0-30 cm) SOC storage. The multiple linear regression models showed that SOC storage increased with increasing soil available phosphorus (r = 0.36), soil exchangeable potassium (r = 0.27 to 0.31) and soil total nitrogen (r = 0.27). In contrast, SOC storage declined with increasing the community-weighted mean of specific leaf area (r =-0.38 to-0.40). The structural equation model showed that SOC storage was directly driven by the positive effect of soil nutrients (i.e. a latent variable of soil total nitrogen and available phosphorus; r = 0.42) and the negative effect of the community-weighted mean of specific leaf area (r =-0.31). The topographic factors as well as the other several functional attributes of BsT and RsT showed non-significant direct and indirect effects on SOC storage in both types of statistical modelling. Our study suggests that the mass ratio and soil fertility rather than the niche complementarity effects along with the big-sized trees effect regulates SOC storage through the acquisitive trait identity of BsT species as compared to RsT species in temperate deciduous forests. We argue that maintaining high levels of species diversity with the most efficient trait identity across tree sizes is important for biodiversity conservation and multiple forest functions such as SOC storage which should be a priority for plantation management plans or silvicultural practices in natural forests.

TI  - Diversity, Population Structure and Distribution of Trees in Tropical Dry Forests, East Godavari District, Eastern Ghats, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Tree diversity and population structure were analysed in two dry tropical forest sites of the Eastern Ghats in East Godavari District, Andhra Pradesh. One-hectare area (4 plots of 0.25ha each) was selected in each study site for quantitative tree inventory. A total of 99 species (71 in the site 1 and 77 in site II) from 31 families were recorded. Of which the adults (>= 10 cm DBH) and juvenile (>= 3-<10cm DBH) population of tree species were greater in the site 1 (45 and 49) than site 11 (34 and 35) while saplings (<3 cm DBH) contribution showed a reverse trend (55 in site I and 72 in site II). The basal area ranged 20.6-29.4 m(2)/ha. The mean stem density was 506 stems/ha. Diameter class-wise distribution showed reverse "J" shaped curve. Leguminosae was most speciose family. Maximum species showed contagious distribution pattern in all the stages except for adult and juvenile populations in the site 1 where the maximum distribution was random. Xylia xylocarpa is a single dominant species in both the study sites which indicates that these forest sites were subjected to disturbances in the past. Population structure enlightens that the sites have a good regeneration potential. The present study reveals that the tropical dry forest sites in East Godavari region restore substantial tree diversity as similar to other parts Eastern Ghats and tropics. There is a variation in species richness, abundance, basal area and distribution pattern between the sites could be attributed to differences in topographical position of sites, soil moisture, microclimate, human activities, grazing and seasonal fires.

TI  - No evidence of local deforestation leakage from protected areas establishment in Brazil's Amazon and Atlantic Forest
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Establishing Protected areas (PAs) could displace or cause 'leakage' of deforestation into adjacent areas. Such leakage would potentially offset PAs' conservation effort by jeopardizing forest conservation goals and impeding financial mechanisms such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation -REDD+. Here we investigate forest loss inside PAs' borders and whether leakage occurred following the establishment of new PAs (n = 425) within the Amazon and the Atlantic forests in Brazil between 2004 and 2017. We applied a Before -After-Control-Intervention statistical design with a matching approach to evaluate deforestation leakage from PAs' establishment using a spatial (inside and outside PAs)- temporal (before and after PA establishment) measure of deforestation rates. We also used "Random Forest " to investigate the drivers of the effect of PAs' establishment on their surrounding areas. We found that when PAs' establishment led to reducing deforestation inside their boundaries, their surrounding also experienced a reduction in deforestation ( "blockage "). Similarly, when PAs' establishment could not reduce deforestation inside their boundaries, their surroundings also experienced increased deforestation. Such a pattern was most common for Indigenous territories, especially in the deforestation arch in the Amazon. However, we did not find significant evidence for leakage as PAs' surroundings with a significant increase in deforestation were associated with PAs unable to significantly reduce deforestation within their boundaries. Therefore, "leakage " should not limit the establishment of new PAs. Instead, greater investments into reinforcement are needed for existing PAs, with high priority given to Indigenous Territories.

TI  - Forest fragmentation in China and its effect on biodiversity
T2  - BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
AB  - Land-use change is fragmenting natural ecosystems, with major consequences for biodiversity. This paper reviews fragmentation trends - historical and current - in China, the fourth largest country on Earth, and explores its consequences. Remote sensing makes it possible to track land-use change at a global scale and monitor fragmentation of dwindling natural landscapes. Yet few studies have linked fragmentation mapped remotely with impacts on biodiversity within human-modified landscapes. Recent reforestation programs have caused substantial increases in forest cover but have not stopped fragmentation, because the new forests are mostly monocultures that further fragment China's remnant old-growth lowland forests that harbour the highest levels of biodiversity. Fragmentation - and associated biodiversity declines - is unevenly distributed in China's forests, being most problematic where agricultural expansion is occurring in the southwest and northeast, serious in the densely populated eastern regions where urbanisation and transport infrastructure are modifying landscapes, but less of a problem in other regions. Analyses of temporal trends show that the drivers of forest fragmentation are shifting from mainly agricultural expansion to urbanisation and infrastructure development. Most of China's old-growth forests persist in small, isolated fragments from which many native species have disappeared, on land unsuitable for human utilisation. Fragmentation throughout China is likely to have major consequences on biodiversity conservation, but few studies have considered these large-scale processes at the national level. Our review fills this research gap and puts forward a systematic perspective relevant to China and beyond.

TI  - Combining silvopastoral systems with forest conservation: The caiva system in the Araucaria Forest, Southern Brazil
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - In Southern Brazil, caivas, agroforestry systems within patches of Araucaria Forest that include cattle production, have been used historically throughout the region. Despite their importance for biodiversity conservation, this system is being progressively replaced with high-yield agricultural crops, resulting in forest loss. However, such a loss of native vegetation could be avoided by developing appropriate technologies to optimize production and conservation, thus making caivas more attractive to farmers. This research tested two alternatives to traditional caiva (TC) management to identify strategies to increase pasture yield while also maintaining forest regeneration potential. The two alternative strategies are: (1) winter overseeding of cultivated pasture on natural pasture (WOC); (2) replacing natural pasture with giant missionary perennial pasture (GMC). The experiment was conducted in eight caivas, from October 2014 to February 2017. Pasture yield was evaluated monthly, and soils were analyzed at the beginning and end of the experiment. Richness and density of forest regeneration were also assessed through surveys carried out every six months in all plots. Results show that both alternative strategies were effective in increasing pasture yield, pH, and base saturation in soil. Further, these alternatives showed no impact on the total organic carbon content in the soil or on forest seedling diversity and richness, but with TCs showing a higher rate of forest regeneration. These results indicate how research that develops strategies to optimize use can help to improve traditional productive systems, preserving their social, economic, and environmental importance for communities.

TI  - Life after logging: post-logging recovery of a neotropical bat community
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. There is considerable debate about whether tropical forests can be managed for timber production and to conserve biodiversity. Few 'sustainable forestry' systems have been evaluated adequately in this respect. Microchiropteran bats may be model taxa for this purpose. They are an important component of mammalian diversity, play key roles in forest dynamics and are indicators of disturbance in neotropical forests.
   2. We investigated the effect of Trinidad's periodic block system (PBS) on bat species diversity and community organization. PBS is a polycyclic system of selective logging with a 30-year harvesting rotation. We captured bats in primary forest and PBS-managed forest logged 33, 31, 21, 20 and 10 years previously.
   3. Selective logging did not affect species diversity but did affect community structure. Frugivorous bats were significantly more abundant in logged forest whereas gleaning animalivores were more abundant in primary forest, suggesting that frugivores benefited and gleaning animalivores were adversely affected by logging.
   4. The bat community showed evidence of recovery. The number of years since forest disturbance was positively correlated with the abundance and number of species of gleaning animalivores and negatively correlated with the proportional abundance of the most common species. Gleaning animalivores increased in abundance with forest regeneration, whereas the community became less dominated by a single generalist frugivore.
   5. Synthesis and applications. PBS selective logging appears to be compatible with the conservation of bat diversity. This provides evidence that neotropical forests can be managed for timber production in an ecologically sustainable way and that significant biodiversity conservation efforts can occur outside national parks and nature reserves in areas set aside for sustainable development. PBS could serve as a basic blueprint for sustainable forestry in the Guianan Shield where there are forests similar in species composition to those of Trinidad. Key attributes that could be adopted by many tropical countries to manage their forests in an ecologically sustainable way are a low intensity harvest, a long rotation and multiple controls on harvesting.

TI  - Litter and soil arthropod colonization in reforested semi-deciduous seasonal Atlantic forests
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - The recovery of soil ecological processes during the restoration of tropical forests is greatly influenced by arthropods that live in the litter and soil. However, these communities present complex dynamics, and their colonization patterns are not well understood. In this study, we examined the response patterns of litter and soil arthropods to the ecosystem regeneration process by assessing reforestation sites from two regions of Sao Paulo State, Brazil, and we compared the data obtained from these sites with data from mature forests. We assessed the arthropod communities using similarity indices and high-level taxa abundance, with the level of forest succession and the locations of the restoration areas as factors. Forest succession correlated with the species composition as communities from the reforestation sites gradually became more similar to communities from the mature forests, while their quantitative patterns were minimally related. Forest maturation positively affected the richness of the litter community and the abundance of some minor groups, such as Protura, Diplura, and Symphyla. The region influenced the species composition but did not influence the manner in which the communities changed during the maturation process. We also found a convergent soil colonization pattern as arthropod communities from different sites became more similar during forest succession. This finding is consistent with both empirical data and theoretical predictions from the specialized literature, although the subject has been poorly explored until now. We conclude that reforestation allows the colonization of soil and litter fauna in a biased manner.

TI  - BIOECONOMY based on non-timber forest products for development and forest conservation - untapped potential or false hope? A systematic review for the BRAZILIAN amazon
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - The continuing destruction of the Amazonian forest, the largest remaining tropical forest ecosystem, has massive social and environmental consequences for local populations, but also for the climate, global food security and biodiversity. With some 20% of the forest already lost and the Amazon region likely approaching a tipping point, the conservation of its forests is a burning issue. High expectations are vested in the sustainable use of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) as a means to reconcile conservation and development. Accordingly, hundreds of initiatives have been launched over the decades that rely on NTFPs. With the proliferation of the bioeconomy discourse in recent years, they have received a new impetus. But are these expectations justified and backed-up by facts? Based on a systematic literature review, this article assesses the state of knowledge on NTFPs as a basis for sustainable local development in the Brazilian Amazon. The analysis reveals that while the number of studies has been growing continuously, the knowledge base is rather patchy. Coverage is limited mostly to a few NTFPs with high commercial value. The literature mostly attests positive effects of NTFP use on forest conservation and contributions to meeting socio-cultural needs of local communities. By contrast, existing studies identify limitations in terms of local income generation and suggest to combine the use of NTFPs with the commercial management for timber and the sale of environmental services. In terms of biodiversity conservation, some studies also point to risks of initiatives that emphasize income generation and stress the importance of diversifying production. It is worrying, that empirical knowledge on the effects of such combined and diversified approaches is scarce. A research agenda is crucial to support the successful promotion of NTFP-based value chains in the Brazilian Amazon. This agenda should include a comprehensive analytical framework that enables robust evaluations of past and future interventions. A better understanding of the actual impacts of such initiatives is vital as evidence for proof of concept and for deploying them at scale.

TI  - TEK and biodiversity management in agroforestry systems of different socio-ecological contexts of the Tehuacan Valley
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
AB  - Transformation of natural ecosystems into intensive agriculture is a main factor causing biodiversity loss worldwide. Agroforestry systems (AFS) may maintain biodiversity, ecosystem benefits and human wellbeing, they have therefore high potential for concealing production and conservation. However, promotion of intensive agriculture and disparagement of TEK endanger their permanence. A high diversity of AFS still exist in the world and their potentialities vary with the socio-ecological contexts. We analysed AFS in tropical, temperate, and arid environments, of the Tehuacan Valley, Mexico, to investigate how their capacity varies to conserve biodiversity and role of TEK influencing differences in those contexts. We hypothesized that biodiversity in AFS is related to that of forests types associated and the vigour of TEK and management. We conducted studies in a matrix of environments and human cultures in the Tehuacan Valley. In addition, we reviewed, systematized and compared information from other regions of Mexico and the world with comparable socio-ecological contexts in order to explore possible general patterns. Our study found from 26 % to nearly 90 % of wild plants species richness conserved in AFS, the decreasing proportion mainly associated to pressures for intensifying agricultural production and abandoning traditional techniques. Native species richness preserved in AFS is influenced by richness existing in the associated forests, but the main driver is how people preserve benefits of components and functions of ecosystems. Elements of modern agricultural production may coexist with traditional management patterns, but imposition of modern models may break possible balances. TEK influences decisions on what and how modern techniques may be advantageous for preserving biodiversity, ecosystem integrity in AFS and people's wellbeing. TEK, agroecology and other sciences may interact for maintaining and improving traditional AFS to increase biodiversity and ecosystem integrity while improving quality of life of people managing the AFS.

TI  - Woody Plant Conservation Value of Three Contrasting Forest Management Regimes in Southwest Ethiopia
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - The future of the Afromontane forest of southwest Ethiopia is highly influenced by coffee management intensity. The study was conducted to investigate the woody species conservation value of a human-modified forest in southwest Ethiopia. We assessed woody species composition, regeneration and forest stand structure across three different management regimes (i.e., natural forest, coffee forest and coffee agroforest using 189 plots of 400 m(2) (20 m x 20 m). A total of 64 species belonging to 33 families were identified and recorded across the three forest management regimes. About 83% of the recorded woody species were maintained in the coffee agroforest. The three forest types shared 61% of the recorded woody species. The coffee agroforest had maintained four strata or layers of stand structure. Nevertheless, the total abundance, density and basal area of woody species decreased from the natural forest to coffee forest and coffee agroforest. The Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM) showed significant difference between the natural forest, coffee forest and coffee agroforest (Global R-Anosim = 0.36, p < 0.001). Similar regeneration patterns were recorded under the forest management regimes. Coffee agroforests simplify the woody plant composition and stand structure of the Afromontane forest in southwest Ethiopia.

TI  - Trees outside forests as climate change mitigation champions: evaluating their carbon sequestration potential and monetary value in Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak (Haryana), India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB  - The annual average increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration is touching new heights every year. Global climate change and warming are twin outcomes of record-breaking CO2 levels. The trees outside forests (TOF) are the most promising and suitable components in the ecosystem for combating global warming via carbon (C) sequestration. Urban university campuses are the hotspot regions of TOF. We have attempted to quantify the C stock, C sequestration potential, and C credit value of dominant tree species at Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU), Rohtak. Different volumetric and biomass equations were used for biomass computation. We assessed a total of 29,442 trees (top 10) for measuring phytosociological parameters like total tree count, age, height (H), and diameter at breast height (DBH) to quantify the amount of C stored. The total C stock, C sequestration rate, and monetary value were 78.67 (Mg C ha(-1)), 19.05 (Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1)), and 23,101.59 $ year(-1), respectively. Eucalyptus globulus is the most dominant tree species on the campus and topped almost all the quantitative characteristics like total tree count (similar to 40 %), age (25 years), density (D) (55.35 trees ha(-1)), and total C stock (16.06 & PLUSMN; 9.90 Mg C ha(-1)). Tree basal area (BA), D, diversity, and H positively affected the total C stocks. When the C market becomes operational, these C credits can be traded while generating additional income for the university. The results from this study can also help calculate the total C footprint of the campus.

TI  - Genetic structure and demographic history of the endangered tree species Dysoxylum malabaricum (Meliaceae) in Western Ghats, India: implications for conservation in a biodiversity hotspot
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - The impact of fragmentation by human activities on genetic diversity of forest trees is an important concern in forest conservation, especially in tropical forests. Dysoxylum malabaricum (white cedar) is an economically important tree species, endemic to the Western Ghats, India, one of the world's eight most important biodiversity hotspots. As D.malabaricum is under pressure of disturbance and fragmentation together with overharvesting, conservation efforts are required in this species. In this study, range-wide genetic structure of twelve D.malabaricum populations was evaluated to assess the impact of human activities on genetic diversity and infer the species' evolutionary history, using both nuclear and chloroplast (cp) DNA simple sequence repeats (SSR). As genetic diversity and population structure did not differ among seedling, juvenile and adult age classes, reproductive success among the old-growth trees and long distance seed dispersal by hornbills were suggested to contribute to maintain genetic diversity. The fixation index (F-IS) was significantly correlated with latitude, with a higher level of inbreeding in the northern populations, possibly reflecting a more severe ecosystem disturbance in those populations. Both nuclear and cpSSRs revealed northern and southern genetic groups with some discordance of their distributions; however, they did not correlate with any of the two geographic gaps known as genetic barriers to animals. Approximate Bayesian computation-based inference from nuclear SSRs suggested that population divergence occurred before the last glacial maximum. Finally we discussed the implications of these results, in particular the presence of a clear pattern of historical genetic subdivision, on conservation policies.

TI  - Sustainable Financing for Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) to Conserve Peat Swamp Forest Through Enterprises Based on Swiftlets' Nests: An Awareness Survey in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
AB  - In recent years, the proliferation of small-scale enterprises based on sales of edible swiftlets' nests harvested in peat swamp forests in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia has occurred. This study focuses on enterprises that might offer a promising opportunity as a user-side financing system for payments for ecosystem services (PES) to balance forest conservation priorities with local communities' livelihood needs. Two possible sustainable user financing systems for PES were designed. The first entailed a modification of an existing tax structure in limiting usage of its revenue (an earmarked tax). The second entailed a community-level business structure based on customary village practices. Receptiveness to the first system was assessed using questionnaire and interview-based surveys carried out on 50 respondents. The second system was assessed using questionnaire and interview-based surveys with five representatives in each of nine villages in the region. Findings revealed a reasonably high potential for developing each of the two options. Enterprise owners and workers demonstrated a high level of awareness of the model's conservation and societal benefits and were incentivized to pay the same level of tax redirected to conservation and fire prevention activities. However, few were willing to pay a higher tax level. The overall reception of the cooperative business model was positive, but start-up financial concerns and negative community dynamics such as low trust among community members were the main constraining factors. Financial and technical support from governmental and non-governmental organizations as well as research-based support from universities would be required to promote these financing systems.

TI  - Designing protected area networks that translate international conservation commitments into national action
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Most countries have committed to protect 17% of their terrestrial area by 2020 through Aichi Target 11 of the Convention on Biological Diversity, with a focus on protecting areas of particular importance for biodiversity. This means national-scale spatial conservation prioritisations are needed to help meet this target and guide broader conservation and land-use policy development. However, to ensure these assessments are adopted by policy makers, they mist also consider national priorities. This situation is exemplified by Guyana, a corner of Amazonia that couples high biodiversity with low economic development. In recent years activities that threaten biodiversity conservation have increased, and consequently, protected areas are evermore critical to achieving the Aichi targets. Here we undertake a cost-effective approach to protected area planning in Guyana that accounts for in-country conditions. To do this we conducted a stakeholder-led spatial conservation prioritisation based on meeting targets for 17 vegetation types and 329 vertebrate species, while minimising opportunity costs for forestry, mining, agriculture and urbanisation. Our analysis identifies 3 million ha of priority areas for conservation, helping inform government plans to double the current protected area network from 8.5 to 17%. As part of this, we also develop a new technique to prioritise engagement with local communities whose lands are identified as important to conservation. Our study both provides a scientifically robust, politically acceptable protected area expansion strategy for Guyana, and illustrates the importance of conservation planning at the country-scale to translate international commitments into national action.

TI  - Calling for landscape-level assessments of participatory forestry?s role in improving forest biophysical conditions
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Participatory forest management (PFM) has been applied to address declining tropical forest conditions. In the literature, there is a mixed evidence on PFM's role in improving forest conditions. However, most assessments ignore a relationship between household distance from PFM forests and impacts to non-PFM forests albeit being an essential aspect. Some PFM assessments show that distance matters in determining an individual's participation But, sparsely discussing the distance in relation to forest biophysical conditions in a landscape context. Drawing on the landscape approach and insights from Miombo forests of Kilwa in southern Tanzania, we illustrate the importance of studying PFM schemes in a landscape context to illuminate the relationship between household distance from PFM forests and impacts to non-PFM forests. Our study villages have forest abundances in areas between households and PFM forests. The average distance between households and PFM forests is 7.8 km. The long distances and forest abundances produce an 'outbound effect', whereby degrading and deforesting activities shift from PFM to non-PFM forests. Our analysis calls for landscape-level assessments that include forests under different governance regimes even those in unreserved landscapes - non-PFM forests. This is important for two reasons. First, for generating locally grounded contextual insights necessary for developing understandings of global forest conservation efforts from the 'ground up'. Second, for revealing correct forest conditions in the entire landscape critical in the light of ongoing national and international interests to manage trees inside and outside designated forest reserves for both carbon sequestration and landscape restoration.

TI  - Certification of acai agroforestry increases the conservation potential of the Amazonian tree flora
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - The harvesting of acai berries (palm fruits from the genus Euterpe) in Amazonia has increased over the last 20 years due to a high local and global market demand and triggered by their widely acclaimed health benefits as a 'superfood'. Although such increase represents a financial boom for local communities, unregulated extraction in Amazonia risks negative environmental effects including biodiversity loss through acai intensification and deforestation. Alternatively, the introduction of certified sustainable agroforestry production programs of acai has been strategically applied to reduce the exploitation of Amazonian forests. Local acai producers are required to follow principles of defined sustainable management practices, environmental guidelines, and social behaviors, paying specific attention to fair trade and human rights. In this study we investigate whether sustainable agroforestry and certification effectively promotes biodiversity conservation in Amazonia. To address this question, we conducted a forestry inventory in two hectares of long-term certified acai harvesting areas to gain further knowledge on the plant diversity and forest structure in acai managed forests and to understand the contribution of certification towards sustainable forest management. On average, we found that certified managed forests harbor 50% more tree species than non-certified acai groves. Trees in certified areas also have significantly higher mean basal area, meaning larger and hence older individuals are more likely to be protected. Certified harvesting sites also harbor dense populations of threatened species as classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (e.g. Virola surinamensis, classified as 'endangered'). Besides increasing the knowledge of plant diversity in acai managed areas, we present baseline information for monitoring the impact of harvesting activities in natural ecosystems in Amazonia.

TI  - Designing multifunctional landscapes for forest conservation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - A multifunctional landscape approach to forest protection has been advocated for tropical countries. Designing such landscapes necessitates that the role of different land uses in protecting forest be evaluated, along with the spatial interactions between land uses. However, such evaluations have been hindered by a lack of suitable analysis methodologies and data with fine spatial resolution over long time periods. We demonstrate the utility of a matching method with multiple categories to evaluate the role of alternative land uses in protecting forest. We also assessed the impact of land use change trajectories on the rate of deforestation. We employed data from Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) at three different time periods during 2000-2012 to illustrate our approach. Four single land uses (protected areas (PA), natural forest logging concessions (LC), timber plantation concessions (TC) and oil-palm plantation concessions (OC)) and two mixed land uses (mixed concessions and the overlap between concessions and PA) were assessed. The rate of deforestation was found to be lowest for PA, followed by LC. Deforestation rates for all land uses tended to be highest for locations that share the characteristics of areas in which TC or OC are located (e.g. degraded areas), suggesting that these areas are inherently more susceptible to deforestation due to foregone opportunities. Our approach provides important insights into how multifunctional landscapes can be designed to enhance the protection of biodiversity.

TI  - Anthropogenic activities affect forest structure and arthropod abundance in a Kenyan biodiversity hotspot
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Land-use change remains the main threat to tropical forests and their dependent fauna and flora, and degradation of existing forest remnants will further accelerate species loss. Forest degradation may result directly from human forest use or through spatial effects of land-use change. Understanding the drivers of forest degradation and its effects on biodiversity is pivotal for formulating impactful forest management and monitoring protocols, but such knowledge is lacking for many biodiversity hotspots, such as the Taita Hills in southeast Kenya. Here we first quantify effects of social factors (human activity and presence) at plot and landscape level, forest management (gazetted vs. non-gazetted) and spatial factors (fragment size and distance to forest edge) on the vegetation structure of indigenous Taita forest fragments. Next, we quantify effects of degraded vegetation structure on arthropod abundance and diversity. We show that human presence and activity at both the plot and landscape level explain variation in vegetation structure. We particularly provide evidence that despite a national ban on cutting of indigenous trees, poaching of pole-sized trees for subsistence use may be simplifying vegetation structure, with the strongest effects in edge-dominated, small forest fragments. Furthermore, we found support for a positive effect of vegetation structure on arthropod abundance, although the effect of daily maximum temperature and yearly variation was more pronounced. Maintenance of multi-layered forest vegetation in addition to reforestation maybe a key to conservation of the endangered and endemic fauna of the Taita Hills.

TI  - Recovery of soil macrofauna communities after forest clearance in Eastern Amazonia, Brazil
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - As primary forest is cleared, pastures and secondary forest occupy an increasing space in the Amazonian landscape. We evaluated the effect of forest clearing on a soil macrofauna (invertebrate) community in a smallbolder farming system of southeastern Amazonia. We sampled the soil macrofauna in 22 plots of forest, upland rice fields, pastures, and fallows of different ages. In total, we collected 10, 728 invertebrates. In cleared plots the species richness per plot of the soil macrofauna fell from 76 to 30 species per plot immediately after forest clearance, and the composition of the new community was different. Ants, termites, and spiders were most affected by the disturbance. In plots deforested several years before, the effect of forest clearance was highly dependent on the type of land use (pasture or fallow). In fallows, the community was similar to the initial state. The species richness per plot in old fallows rose to 66, and the composition was closer to the primary forests than to the other types of land use. On the contrary, in the pastures the species richness per plot remained low at 47. In fallows, all the groups showed a richness close to that in primary forest, whereas in the forest only the richness of earthworms and Coleoptera recovered. Our results show that forest clearing constitutes a major disturbance for the soil macrofauna and that the recovery potential of the soil macrofauna after 6 or 7 years is much higher in fallows than in pastures. Thus, fallows may play a crucial role in the conservation of soil macrofauna.

TI  - Post-logging effects on nest predation and avian predator assemblages in a subtropical forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Logging represents one of the main threats to bird populations breeding in subtropical forests because the resulting changes in forest structure influence nesting sites and predator-prey interactions. Nest site selection in birds is critical to their survival and reproductive success, because site characteristics can affect predation rates. The aim of this study is to evaluate the abundance of avian nest predators and the rate of predation on artificial nests in post-logging piedmont forests from the southern Yungas. Predation rate on artificial nests was lower in logged forest when compared to unlogged forest. This result may not only be explained by the influence of both micro- and meso-site which provided greater nest concealment, but also by the decrease in density of generalist predators at logged sites. As generalist predators were associated with vegetation cover, lower coverage may be affecting predator density at logging forests. The density of nestling predators, however, was higher in logging forests and was associated with this treatment. Our study suggests that post-logging effects changes the nesting sites and reduce the predation rate on artificial nests as well as the density of nest avian predators like Plushcrested Jay (Cyanocorax chrysops).

TI  - A critical review of exploring the recent trends and technological advancements in forest biomass estimation
T2  - PLANT SCIENCE TODAY
AB  - Biomass estimation is pivotal in understanding and managing global carbon stocks, offering vital insights into climate change and environmental ecology. It serves as a critical tool for evaluating carbon sequestration potential, a natural mechanism for regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Accurate estimation of forest biomass not only aids in quantifying carbon stocks but also provides a basis for sustainable forest management, conservation efforts, and policymaking to mitigate climate change impacts. This article provides a comprehensive review of various biomass estimation methods, including ground-based measurements, remote sensing technologies, and hybrid approaches. Each method's strengths, limitations, and practical applications are critically examined, highlighting their suitability for different spatial scales and ecological contexts. Traditional methods, while precise at small scales, are often labour-intensive and limited in coverage. In contrast, remote sensing technologies such as LiDAR, RADAR, and hyperspectral imaging have revolutionized biomass estimation by enabling large-scale and high-resolution assessments. Additionally, recent advancements in machine learning, data fusion, and satellite-based monitoring systems are transforming the field, offering unprecedented accuracy and efficiency. By presenting these trends and innovations, this article provides valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, emphasizing the importance of integrating advanced technologies into biomass estimation for sustainable development and climate resilience.

TI  - Assessing the Economic Contribution of Forest Use to Rural Livelihoods in the Rubi-Tele Hunting Domain, DR Congo
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Forest utilization makes a significant economic contribution to the livelihoods of rural households, especially those living in developing countries. This study was conducted to determine the absolute and relative forest income and measure the distributional impact of forest income on economic inequalities among rural households in the Rubi-Tele Hunting Domain (RTHD), Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). Household socioeconomic data and other qualitative informations were collected using structured household-level surveys, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. The study used descriptive statistical analysis, Gini coefficient, and Lorenz curve computation. Additionally, the non-parametric alternative Kruskal-Wallis Test was also used. Findings revealed that 89.76% of the households' sample were involved in forest-based activities. The annual average income from these forest-based activities was estimated at CDF 1,219,951.58 (USD 659.08) per household, contributing 32.46% to total annual household income. Other income sources share constituted 37.09%, 10.04%, 8.30%, 7.63%, 2.41%, and 2.08% from crop, livestock keeping, business activities, fishing, and non-forest environmental activities, paid employment, and other income sources, respectively. There was a significant difference between annual household income in terms of income sources (p < 0.5). Forest income constituted the second most crucial income portfolio after crop income. Bushmeat income share was higher than other forest products income share. However, the proportion of households involved in firewood extraction was substantial (80.70%). Gini coefficient and Lorenz curve analysis proved that forest income helped reduce economic inequality among the sampled households by 11%. Therefore, reducing access to forest would significantly impact rural households' welfare and could increase income disparities. The present study provides valuable information for developing sustainable forest management policies and strategies to maintain and enhance the economic benefit of forest use without damaging biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Epiphytic bromeliads as key components for maintenance of ant diversity and ant-bromeliad interactions in agroforestry system canopies
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Cocoa is produced in a wide range of land use systems, with the traditional shaded systems in Bahia (Brazil) as the most forest-like and biodiverse. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of different cocoa agroforestry systems (AFSs) in maintaining community structure and interactions between ants and epiphytic bromeliads. The study was conducted at four sites in the cocoa producing region of the southeastern of the state of Bahia, Brazil, and comprised a native forest and three different cocoa AFSs. We found a total of 103 ant species associated with epiphytic bromeliads, with 83% of the species occurring in native forest canopy bromeliads also occurring in cocoa AFSs. The Cocoa Cabruca System (CAB) and the Rustic-Planted Shade System (RPS) had ant community structural components of biodiversity similar to those found in the native forest environment. The alpha and gamma diversity of ants found in Monospecific-Shaded Cocoa Agroforestry System (MCA) associated with Erythrina spp. shade trees were significantly different from the diversity found in the other AFSs and native forest. The presence of epiphytic bromeliads, regardless of the system and scale, maintained ant diversity in agroforestry system canopies similar to that of native forest. Using metrics derived from graph theory, we found a high level of specialization regarding ant-bromeliad interactions in native West, with a gradual decrease in specialization with environmental homogenization. Agroforestry systems thus represent an important strategy for maintaining the structure of canopy-associated ant communities by enabling the establishment of numerous bromeliad species, thus contributing to the maintenance of ant diversity and services in a mosaic landscape AFSs and native forest.

TI  - Forest Policy Innovation at the Subnational Scale: Insights from Acre, Brazil
T2  - CONSERVATION & SOCIETY
AB  - REDD+ is often characterised as a 'global' environmental framework implemented in tropical forests around the world. Yet studying actual cases of REDD+ can reveal complex interactions between scales, including under-recognised innovations at subnational and local scales. To understand these dynamics, this article brings together academics and policymakers to analyse the System of Incentives for Environmental Services (SISA)-a pioneering subnational policy in the Amazonian state of Acre, Brazil that includes a prominent jurisdictional REDD+ programme. While institutions, people, and ideas from outside of Acre contributed to its formulation, SISA is not a standardised local expression of a global policy. Rather, key aspects of it originated in ongoing and historical Acrean forest-use and governance. This analysis shows how innovative, place-based conservation policy can be influential, both within and beyond specific localities, in ways that challenge analyses of REDD+ that are primarily top-down. Our study of SISA also shows how topics of importance in contemporary REDD+ and forest conservation scholarship-efforts to make the living forest valuable, non-carbon social and environmental "co-benefits," and landscape- and jurisdiction-wide approaches to combating deforestation-are connected to Acrean forest governance and history. Overall, this analysis elucidates the strengths and challenges of subnational forest governance and the complex inter-scalar dynamics in REDD+ and other conservation and climate policies.

TI  - Diversity and abundance of arbuscular-mycorrhizal fungus spores in tropical forest and pasture
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - As Neotropical forests are increasingly converted to agriculture (especially pastures), little is known about the impacts on microbial biodiversity. To assess such impacts, I compared spore abundance and diversity of arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF) in soils from lowland evergreen forests and pastures in Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Species composition, dominance-diversity curves, and Simpson's diversity indices were similar for both forest and pasture soils. Of 28 distinct fungus morphospecies, 11 produced more spores in pasture, while only 1 produced more spores in forest. According to species-accumulation curves, local AMF species richness did not significantly decline following conversion of forest to pasture. Because pastures contained a surprising abundance and diversity of AMF spores compared to native forest, a lack of mycorrhizal fungi is unlikely to limit plant succession, restoration, or reforestation in the pastures studied. At the regional scale, however, species-accumulation curves showed significantly greater gamma (G) diversity of spores in forest. In addition to these trends in diversity, species that sporulated more in pasture tended to have small spores, while the one species that sporulated more in forest had the largest spores. Similarly, only large-spored fungi (>300 mum) showed any seasonal variation in spore abundance, being more common in the wet season.

TI  - Ecological Analysis of Community and Private Partnership in Tree Planting Program to Rehabilitate Degraded Lands: A Case Study in East Java, Indonesia
T2  - JURNAL MANAJEMEN HUTAN TROPIKA
AB  - Community and private partnership (CPP) in tree planting initiative is potential to accelerate rehabilitation of degraded lands. Yet, empirical studies to analyse such programs are limited. Here, we analysed a CPP tree planting program in East Java, Indonesia by focusing on ecological aspects, i.e. vegetation cover changes, floristic diversity, above-ground carbon storage, and soil and microclimate conditions. Results showed that there was a striking increase in vegetation cover, yielding a total carbon sequestration of 3,853 tons, or equivalent to the reduction of 14,140 tons of CO2 emissions. On the other hand, co-benefits in term of floristic diversity at a landscape scale was low, and soil and micro-climate conditions were still marginal. This study provided empirical evidence that collaboration between communities and private entities in tree planting program can be effective in rehabilitation of degraded lands. Improvement in land management systems applied in tree planting through the implementation of mixed gardens or complex agroforestry is suggested if aiming for co-benefits in floristic diversity and soil properties. Our study recommends a broader adoption of a similar scheme in rehabilitation of degraded lands across Indonesia.

TI  - Carbon, Fossil Fuel, and Biodiversity Mitigation With Wood and Forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
AB  - Life-cycle analyses, energy analyses, and a range of utilization efficiencies were developed to determine the carbon dioxide (CO2) and fossil fuel (FF) saved by various solid wood products, wood energy, and unharvested forests. Some products proved very efficient in CO2 and FF savings, while others did not. Not considering forest regrowth after harvest or burning if not harvested, efficient products save much more CO2 than the standing forest; but wood used only for energy generally saves slightly less. Avoided emissions (using wood in place of steel and concrete) contributes the most to CO2 and FF savings compared to the product and wood energy contributions. Burning parts of the harvested logs that are not used for products creates an additional CO2 and FF savings. Using wood substitutes could save 14 to 31% of global CO2 emissions and 12 to 19% of global FF consumption by using 34 to 100% of the world's sustainable wood growth. Maximizing forest CO2 sequestration may not be compatible with biodiversity. More CO2 can be sequestered synergistically in the products or wood energy and landscape together than in the unharvested landscape. Harvesting sustainably at an optimum stand age will sequester more carbon in the combined products, wood energy, and forest than harvesting sustainably at other ages.

TI  - Forest law enforcement in the Brazilian Amazon: Costs and income effects
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - Despite recent success in reducing forest loss in the Brazilian Amazon, additional forest conservation efforts, for example, through 'Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation' (REDD+), could significantly contribute to global climate-change mitigation. Economic incentives, such as payments for environmental services could promote conservation, but deforestation often occurs on land without crucial tenure-security prerequisites. Improving the enforcement of existing regulatory disincentives thus represents an important element of Brazil's anti-deforestation action plan. However, conservation law enforcement costs and benefits have been much less studied than for conditional payments. We develop a conceptual framework and a spatially explicit model to analyze field-based regulatory enforcement in the Brazilian Amazon. We validate our model, based on historical deforestation and enforcement mission data from 2003 to 2008. By simulating the current conservation law enforcement practice, we analyze the costs of liability establishment and legal coercion for alternative conservation targets, and evaluate corresponding income impacts. Our findings suggest that spatial patterns of both deforestation and inspection costs markedly influence enforcement patterns and their income effects. Field-based enforcement is a highly cost-effective forest conservation instrument from a regulator's point of view, but comes at high opportunity costs for land users. Payments for environmental services could compensate costs, but will increase budget outlays vis-A-vis a command-and-control dominated strategy. Both legal and institutional challenges have to be overcome to make conservation payments work at a larger scale. Decision-makers may have to innovatively combine incentive and disincentive-based policy instruments in order to make tropical forest conservation both financially viable and socially compatible.

TI  - Tropical Rainforest and Human-Modified Landscapes Support Unique Butterfly Communities That Differ in Abundance and Diversity
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Tropical forests account for at least 50% of documented diversity, but anthropogenic activities are converting forests to agriculture and urban areas at an alarming rate, with potentially strong effects on insect abundance and diversity. However, the questions remain whether insect populations are uniformly affected by land conversion and if insect conservation can occur in agricultural margins and urban gardens. We compare butterfly populations in tropical secondary forests to those found in sugarcane and urban areas in coastal Guyana and evaluate the potential for particular butterfly communities to inhabit human-modified landscapes. Butterflies were sampled for 1 yr using fruit-baited traps in three separated geographical locations on the coast. We used nonmetric multidimensional scaling to assess differences in species assemblages and a generalized linear mixed model to evaluate abundance, species richness, evenness, and diversity. The secondary forests in all three locations supported higher butterfly abundance and diversity than other human-modified areas, although the magnitude of this effect varied by season and location. However, each land use supported its own type of butterfly community, as species composition was different across the three land uses. Sugarcane field margins and urban gardens supported populations of butterflies rarely found in our tropical secondary forest sites. Land management practices that encourage forest conservation along with butterfly-friendly activities in human settlements and agricultural areas could improve butterfly conservation. To this end, butterfly conservation in Guyana and other tropical landscapes would benefit from a shift from inadvertently to actively making the landscape attractive for butterflies.

TI  - Cryptogamic epiphytes as indicators of successional changes in megadiverse lowland rain forests of western Amazonia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - The Amazonian rain forests of Yasuni National Park, Ecuador (YNP), count among the world's forests regions with highest biodiversity, but are strongly threatened by deforestation. Cryptogams (bryophytes and lichens) are common and characteristic organisms in these forests, are sensitive to environmental changes, and are considered effective ecological indicators. The objective of this study was to explore the response of epiphytic cryptogams to forest succession in the Amazonian forests of YNP. We hypothesized that alteration of structural and micro-environmental characteristics of the forest, including reduction of canopy cover and lowering of tree species richness, lead to a reduction of species richness and changes in species composition of epiphytic cryptogams. We assessed species richness and composition of cryptogams on the bases of 442 trees in three stage of forest succession (early, intermediate, late), using generalized linear mixed models, multivariate analysis, beta diversity components and Mantel test. We registered 146 species of cryptogams, including 50 of lichens and 96 of bryophytes (39 mosses, 57 liverworts). Diversity of epiphytic cryptogams was highest in late succession forest, and lowest in early succession forest. Major changes in species richness and composition correlated with changes in canopy openness relative to the shift from early to late stages of forest succession. The results demonstrate for the first time the importance of tree species richness for cryptogamic epiphyte richness in Amazonian rain forests. Maintenance of high tree species diversity and structural heterogeneity in late succession forests can considerably contribute to the conservation of the cryptogamic epiphytes of Amazonian rain forests.

TI  - Social network ties predict land use diversity and land use change: a case study in Ghana
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB  - While it is well documented that informal social ties play a role in information exchange on land management practices, the structural features of such networks that govern individual choice on land use change remain elusive. This study aims to correlate information network structures with localized or "micro-level" land use diversification and land use change. We ask the following: (i) what is the network structure of producers who manage diverse land use types? and (ii) are network topologies and the emergence of new network ties related to land use change? This work draws on a longitudinal study with producers in the transition zone of Ghana. We use social network analysis to assess the social relationships of 40 focal producers embedded in networks of 116 producers, combined with field observation to chart land use types and size. Land use ordered across eight types, from forest and agroforests to crops and grasslands. Converting land to crop production was correlated to the addition of ties in a focal producer's network, while the diversity of land use types was correlated to the number of institutional ties as well as gender of the focal producer. We illustrate that local networks relate to land use change whereas external ties drive the introduction of new land use types. Given that the diversity of land use types may be a signature of livelihood resilience, the promotion of external, bridging ties can contribute to an increase in land use diversification. However, a strong local network is needed to implement this change.

TI  - Can local use assist in controlling invasive alien species in tropical forests? The case of Lantana camara in southern India
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Many invasive alien species (IAS) are used by local communities for a variety of subsistence and income generating purposes. This frequently poses a conflict of interest for their removal due to forest conservation and biodiversity concerns. However, if local use can simultaneously check or control specific IAS, the conflict can be avoided and both development and forest conservation perspectives accommodated in the short to medium term. We examine this for Lantana camara invasion in southern India through assessment of the demand for and impacts of harvesting on this globally problematic IAS. We interviewed local artisans regarding their knowledge and quantities of Lantana used, along with forest surveys to estimate Lantana densities and size classes in harvested and unharvested sites, and lastly we undertook controlled cutting in moist and dry deciduous forests in both the wet and dry seasons to examine rate of regrowth and mortality. Over the entire study area the abundance of Lantana far outweighed local demand, but at small scales around villages, density and size classes were significantly reduced through harvesting. The controlled cutting experiment showed marked seasonal differences, with the most severe cutting intensity resulting in significant mortality when Lantana plants were cut in the wet season, but with limited effect when cut in the dry season. We conclude that promoting local use of IAS may be a feasible approach in controlling them and thereby limiting their impacts in forests. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Combining behavioural and LiDAR data to reveal relationships between canopy structure and orangutan nest site selection in disturbed forests
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Primary tropical forests are becoming increasingly disturbed and fragmented, making it critically important to understand the conservation value of degraded forests. Many populations of even the largest and most iconic species are now found outside of primary habitats, and the long-term survival of these and many other species depends on appropriate management of degraded areas, whether protected or not. However, for conservation in degraded habitats to be successful, an adequate understanding of the minimal ecological requirements necessary for species persistence within them is required. We combined ground and helicopter nest surveys of critically endangered Bornean orangutans with high-resolution measurements of forest canopy structure from airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to understand orangutan nest site selection across multiple spatial scales in degraded forests of the Lower Kinabatangan region, Malaysian Borneo. We found orangutans to be selective when choosing nest sites, with nests more likely to be observed in canopies of tall and uniform height and closer to full canopy gaps, which was consistent across spatial scales and orangutan age and sex classes. These sites likely offer orangutans an improved vantage point and/or shelter from wind and rain. In contrast, no discernible relationships between nest site selection and canopy complexity, or nest abundance and landscape forest structure or aboveground carbon density were recorded. Our findings suggest that although orangutans do nest across a range of forest conditions, their optimum requirement for nesting strongly depends on forest patches with sufficient tall canopy of uniform height. These results serve to inform degraded forest conservation strategies across Borneo, particularly where orangutans are a focal species.

TI  - The responses of leaf litter ant communities to wildfires in the Brazilian Amazon: a multi-region assessment
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Fire is frequently used as tool for land management in the Amazon, but often escapes into surrounding forests, with potentially severe impacts for forest biodiversity. We investigated the effects of single wildfires on ant communities in four geographically distinct regions of the Brazilian Amazon (Roraima, Para, Acre and Mato Grosso) where forests had burned between 8 months and 10 years before our sampling. We established 7-12 transects, 500 m each, in burned and unburned forests in each region to investigate the effects of fire on forest structure and leaf litter ant communities, which were sampled using Winkler sacks. Fire effects on forest structure were more drastic in the most recently burned forests in Acre and Mato Grosso, while the impacts of older burns in Roraima and Para were more subtle. Ant species richness was not different between burnt and unburned areas, but community composition differed between burned and control forests in all regions except Mato Grosso. At the species level, indicator species analysis showed that a limited number of species were significant indicators of unburned control forests in all regions, except Acre. Forests structure variables and leaf litter volume were all important in shaping ant communities, but their relative importance varied between regions. Our results indicate that burned forest have different ant species communities from unburned forests, and those differences are still apparent 10 years after the disturbance, highlighting the importance of effective policies for fire management in Amazon.

TI  - Management of Protected Areas and Its Effect on an Ecosystem Function: Removal of Prosopis flexuosa Seeds by Mammals in Argentinian Drylands
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The ecological function of animal seed dispersal depends on species interactions and can be affected by drivers such as the management interventions applied to protected areas. This study was conducted in two protected areas in the Monte Desert: a fenced reserve with grazing exclusion and absence of large native mammals (the Man and Biosphere Nacunan Reserve; FR) and an unfenced reserve with low densities of large native and domestic animals (Ischigualasto Park; UFR). The study focuses on Prosopis flexuosa seed removal by different functional mammal groups: "seed predators", "scatter-hoarders", and "opportunistic frugivores". Under both interventions, the relative contribution to seed removal by different functional mammal groups was assessed, as well as how these groups respond to habitat heterogeneity (i.e. vegetation structure) at different spatial scales. Camera traps were used to identify mammal species removing P. flexuosa seeds and to quantify seed removal; remote sensing data helped analyze habitat heterogeneity. In the FR, the major fruit removers were a seed predator (Graomys griseoflavus) and a scatter-hoarder (Microcavia asutralis). In the UFR, the main seed removers were the opportunistic frugivores (Lycalopex griseus and Dolichotis patagonum), who removed more seeds than the seed predator in the FR. The FR shows higher habitat homogeneity than the UFR, and functional groups respond differently to habitat heterogeneity at different spatial scales. In the FR, because large herbivores are locally extinct (e.g. Lama guanicoe) and domestic herbivores are excluded, important functions of large herbivores are missing, such as the maintenance of habitat heterogeneity, which provides habitats for medium-sized opportunistic frugivores with consequent improvement of quality and quantity of seed dispersal services. In the UFR, with low densities of large herbivores, probably one important ecosystem function this group performs is to increase habitat heterogeneity, allowing for the activity of medium-sized mammals who, behaving as opportunistic frugivores, did the most significant seed removal.

TI  - Restoration of Pasture to Forest in Brazil's Mata Atlantica: The Roles of Herbivory, Seedling Defenses, and Plot Design in Reforestation
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - In this study, seedling growth and herbivory were monitored during the first 4 years of plot development in a large-scale reforestation experiment in Brazil's Atlantic Rainforest (Mata Atlantica). Seedlings were planted in a factorial design testing two levels of density, three levels of diversity, and the presence or absence of pioneer species at the Reserva Natural Vale in the Brazilian state of Espirito Santo. In addition, we studied the effect of herbivory on seedling growth and the potential for plant defenses to limit herbivory. Seedling growth was higher in the low-density plantings, and seedlings attained the greatest height in the low-diversity plots, which had a higher density of fast-growing species. The inclusion of pioneer species resulted in a significant decrease in the growth of neighboring seedlings. Interactions between herbivory, plant defenses, and seedling growth were complex. In general, defenses such as saponins and leaf toughness reduced herbivory, but when herbivory was high, seedling growth was reduced. Across treatments, mean height without herbivore damage was 240.8 cm, and with 50% herbivory mean height was 101.5 cm. Overall, to limit insect damage and promote seedling success, plant defense characteristics and ecological interactions should be carefully considered in reforestation projects.

TI  - Impact of land-use zoning for forest protection and production on forest cover changes in Bhutan
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - Bhutan is characterized by a landscape dominated by forests. A substantial share of these forests is dedicated to nature conservation, with an extensive protected area network connected by biological corridors. Forestlands are also partly allocated to timber production, including forest management units subjected to strict regulations. We assessed the effectiveness of these various land-use zoning units to protect forest cover. We used a matching procedure to control for covariates and obtain robust estimates of the impact of each type of unit on forest cover changes during the 2000s. We also investigated subsets of the protected area network to test for effectiveness heterogeneities within this network. Our results showed that protected areas prevented 63% of the forest loss expected in forestlands under this protection status. These units also curtailed forest gain. Long-established protected areas were more effective at avoiding forest loss than recent ones, while the levels of stringency and operationality of protected areas had no differentiable impact on forest loss. We detected more forest loss in forests surrounding protected areas compared to more distant forestlands, showing a leakage effect. Biological corridors had no impact on forest loss and gain. Forest management units decreased forest loss by half. After accounting for the selection bias, this study demonstrated the effectiveness of land use zoning for forest conservation in Bhutan.

TI  - Nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment accelerates soil organic carbon loss in alpine grassland on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Anthropogenic activities have substantially increased soil nutrient availability, which in turn affects ecosystem processes and functions, especially in nutrient-limited ecosystems such as alpine grasslands. Although considerable efforts have been devoted to understanding the responses of plant productivity and community composition to nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) enrichment, the nutrient enrichment effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) and microbial functions are not well understood. A four-year field experiment was established to evaluate the influence of continuous N and P enrichment on plant growth and SOC content in an alpine grassland of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The study included four treatments: Control without addition, N addition, P addition, and N plus P addition. N addition strongly increased aboveground plant biomass and decreased species richness by promoting growth of the dominant grasses species. In contrast, N and P enrichment significantly decreased SOC, especially the recalcitrant organic C content in the surface layer (0-10 cm) by reducing the slow C pool and enlarging the active C pool. Microbial biomass and activities of C-degrading enzymes (beta-glucosidase, cellulase and polyphenol oxidase) and an N-degrading enzyme (chitinase) increased with nutrient inputs. The CO2 emissions during a 300 d incubation period were positively correlated with the cellulase and chitinase activities, while the slow C pool was negatively correlated with the cellulase and polyphenol oxidase activities. Consequently, N and P enrichment accelerated decomposition of the recalcitrant C by stimulating microbial growth and increasing enzyme activities, leading to negative impacts on soil C sequestration. Overall, the results indicate that alpine grassland soils of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau may be changing from a C sink to a C source under increasing N and P availability, and improvement of alpine grassland management through nutrient inputs should consider not only the aboveground biomass for grazing, but also the soil C sequestration and ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Shade tree diversity, carbon sequestration, and epiphyte presence in coffee agroecosystems: A decade of smallholder management in San Ramon, Nicaragua
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Coffee smallholder management practices have received attention for their potential to conserve biodiversity and sequester carbon by maintaining structural complexity, high canopy diversity, and minimal external inputs. We conducted shade tree surveys on 95 1000 m(2) research plots over a 10-year period to identify patterns of shade tree density and diversity, epiphyte presence, and carbon stocks within smallholder shade coffee systems of northern Nicaragua. We also analyzed each of these parameters with respect to management by comparing collectively-and individually-managed farms. Our results indicate that the overall shade tree density has decreased over time (F = 42.597, p < 0.001), but that diversity remained constant. Carbon stocks in coffee systems also showed a decreasing trend over time (F = 2.981, p = 0.056), most likely due to the decreasing tree densities. Epiphytic plant presence increased over time despite decreased host tree densities, suggesting either a change in management or improved habitat conditions for epiphytes. Research plots on individually-managed coffee farms generally had higher shade tree densities than those on collectively managed farms (t = 2.141, p = 0.037), but we found no differences in shade tree species richness or carbon stocks (t = 0.573, p = 0.568). We conclude that smallholder coffee farmers continue to conserve both shade tree diversity and epiphyte communities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Remote Sensing Approach to Understanding Patterns of Secondary Succession in Tropical Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Monitoring biodiversity on a global scale is a major challenge for biodiversity conservation. Field assessments commonly used to assess patterns of biodiversity and habitat condition are costly, challenging, and restricted to small spatial scales. As ecosystems face increasing anthropogenic pressures, it is important that we find ways to assess patterns of biodiversity more efficiently. Remote sensing has the potential to support understanding of landscape-level ecological processes. In this study, we considered cacao agroforests at different stages of secondary succession, and primary forest in the Northern Range of Trinidad, West Indies. We assessed changes in tree biodiversity over succession using both field data, and data derived from remote sensing. We then evaluated the strengths and limitations of each method, exploring the potential for expanding field data by using remote sensing techniques to investigate landscape-level patterns of forest condition and regeneration. Remote sensing and field data provided different insights into tree species compositional changes, and patterns of alpha- and beta-diversity. The results highlight the potential of remote sensing for detecting patterns of compositional change in forests, and for expanding on field data in order to better understand landscape-level patterns of forest diversity.

TI  - Evaluation of Forest Recovery over Time and Space Using Permanent Plots Monitored over 30 Years in a Jamaican Montane Rain Forest
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Conservation of tropical forest biodiversity increasingly depends on its recovery following severe human disturbance. Our ability to measure recovery using current similarity indices suffers from two limitations: different sized individuals are treated as equal, and the indices are proportionate (a community with twice the individuals of every species as compared with the reference community would be assessed as identical). We define an alternative recovery index for trees - the Tanner index, as the mean of the quantitative Bray-Curtis similarity indices of species composition for stem density and for basal area. We used the new index to compare the original (pre-gap) and post-gap composition of five experimental gap plots (each 90-100 m(2)) and four control plots over 24-35 years in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica. After 24-35 years, these small gaps surrounded by undisturbed forest had recovered 68% of the sum of per species stem density and 29% of the sum of per species basal area, a recovery index of 47%. Four endemic species were especially reduced in density and basal area. With the incorporation of basal area and stem density, our index reduces over-estimations of forest recovery obtained using existing similarity indices (by 24%-41%), and thus yields more accurate estimates of forest conservation status. Finally, our study indicates that the two kinds of comparisons: 1) over time between pre-gap and post-gap composition and 2) over space between gap plots and spatial controls (space-for-time substitution) yield broadly similar results, which supports the value of using space-for-time substitutions in studying forest recovery, at least in this tropical montane forest.

TI  - Governance and Deforestation: Understanding the Role of Formal Rule-Acknowledgement by Residents in Brazilian Extractive Reserves
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS
AB  - Brazil has one of the most extensive and effective sets of deforestation control policies in the world. One of the main deforestation control policies implemented by the Brazilian government over the last 15 years has been the creation of an extensive system of protected areas, including extractive reserves. Our study addresses the challenges of reducing deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. We analyze the role of institutions in controlling deforestation, focusing on the formal rules contained within the Management Agreements of extractive reserves. We chose two extreme cases: the Rio Ouro Preto Extractive Reserve and the Rio Cautario Extractive Reserve, in the state of Rondonia, Brazil. Within each case, we analyzed the association between the recognition of the formal rules and the extent of deforestation. We collected data through eight focus groups, with a total of 61 reserve residents, which used a didactic story to understand reserve residents' familiarity with the Management Agreement rules. In both cases, there was high recognition of the formal rules governing natural resource use in the reserves, although there was heterogeneity among communities and in the mechanisms that facilitate recognition. The factors contributing to the recognition and non-recognition of the formal rules by reserve residents included: learning strategies (theoretical and practical); speed of institutional change; rules content (ambiguous and not well-adapted); endogenous factors (e.g. leadership, relationships); and exogenous factors (e.g. economic change, conflict and pressures).

TI  - Trade-offs between bird diversity and abundance, yields and revenue in smallholder oil palm plantations in Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Global land-use change has drastic consequences for biodiversity leading to losses of ecological functioning, ecosystem services and human well-being. While species dependent on undisturbed natural habitat are most affected by conversion to agriculture, even populations of disturbance-tolerant species can be endangered in landscapes dominated by high-input mono-cultural cropping systems. This has raised the question of how, and at what cost, a diversity of species can be conserved in such habitats. Focusing on birds of smallholder oil palm-dominated landscapes, we investigated the relationship between the ecological and economic outcomes of remnant or planted trees in smallholder oil palm plantations. The study comprised a household and a field component. We gathered plot specific data on yields, revenue and inputs from 120 households owning productive oil palm plantations in the Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia. Bird diversity and abundance as well as vegetation structure was assessed on the same oil palm plots. We tested the effects of a set of economic and ecological variables on measures of bird diversity, bird abundance, oil palm yield, and total revenue. Our results show that a gain in bird diversity and bird abundance conditional on increases in number of trees comes along with a loss in revenue for farmers indicating that there is a win lose relationship between ecological and economic functions. However, since the relationship is non-linear, costs for bird species gain or gain in bird abundance change depending on the number of trees within an oil palm plantation: in a relatively extensively managed oil palm plantation (high number of trees, low oil palm yields), a further increase in the number of bird species or individuals leads to a relatively high loss in total revenue, whereas in an intensively managed oil palm plantation the same increase in number of bird species results in a smaller loss in revenue. An increase in bird abundance can be fostered at smaller costs when compared to the costs for increasing biodiversity. This suggests that there is room for tree-based enrichment of intensively managed oil palm plantations, where a relatively high increase in bird species richness or bird abundance could be achieved at relatively low cost.

TI  - Crossing the threshold: Invasive grasses inhibit forest restoration on Hawaiian islands
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Forest removal for livestock grazing is a striking example of human-caused state change leading to a stable, undesirable invasive grass system that is resistant to restoration efforts. Understanding which factors lead to resilience to the alternative grass state can greatly benefit managers when planning forest restoration. We address how thresholds of grass cover and seed rain might influence forest recovery in a restoration project on HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai Island, USA. Since the 1980s, over 400,000 Acacia koa (koa) trees have been planted across degraded pasture, and invasive grasses still dominate the understory with no native woody-plant recruitment. Between this koa/grass matrix are remnant native Metrosideros polymorpha ('ohi'a) trees beneath which native woody plants naturally recruit. We tested whether there were threshold levels of native woody understory that accelerate recruitment under both tree species by monitoring seed rain at 40 trees (20 koa and 'ohi'a) with a range of native woody understory basal area (BA). We found a positive relationship between total seed rain (but not bird-dispersed seed rain) and native woody BA and a negative relationship between native woody BA and grass cover, with no indication of threshold dynamics. We also experimentally combined grass removal levels with seed rain density (six levels) of two common understory species in plots under koa (n = 9) and remnant 'ohi'a (n = 9). Few seedlings emerged when no grass was removed despite adding seeds at densities two to 75 times higher than naturally occurring. However, seedling recruitment increased two to three times once at least 50% of grass was removed. Existing survey data of naturally occurring seedlings also supported a threshold of grass cover below which seedlings were able to establish. Thus, removal of all grasses is not necessary to achieve system responses: Even moderate reductions (similar to 50%) can increase rates of native woody recruitment. The nonlinear thresholds found here highlight how incremental changes to an inhibitory factor lead to limited restoration success until a threshold is crossed. The resources needed to fully eradicate an invasive species may be unwarranted for state change, making understanding where thresholds lie of the utmost importance to prioritize resources.

TI  - Trajectories of cocoa agroforests and their drivers over time: Lessons from the Cameroonian experience
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
AB  - Since its origins, cocoa growing has gone through a series of crises and booms, with a shift in production areas at the expense of tropical forests. Nowadays, the recent sharp rise in the global demand for cocoa more than ever calls into question the future of these forest resources. Nevertheless, in contrast with the dominant technical models, often unsustainable, part of global cocoa growing is based on complex agroforestry systems which are, in many cases, very old and still managed by farmers. To better understand the genesis and the functioning of these systems over time, we analysed the evolution of 30 cocoa agroforests, most of which were several decades old, located in central Cameroon. In this region, cocoa growing has been developing since the 1930s and experienced major changes in contexts, including the severe crisis of the 1990s. By combining field observations and historical survey data, we reconstructed the impacts of these changes over time on management practices, agroforestry structures and cocoa yields. We formalized five cocoa agroforests trajectories closely linked to main phases of cocoa growing in central Cameroon, each phase leading to changes in farmers' practices. These trajectories explain the current agroforests structures, with low (1180 in. ha(-1)) or high cocoa tree densities (2190 in. ha(-1)), mean basal area per cocoa tree which ranged from 29.4 cm(2) to 92.7 cm(2), and finally cocoa yields which varied from 542.7 to 1275.7 kg ha(-1). Our results show how the management of interacting species allows a system balance that can be temporarily broken or redesigned, suggesting the resilient and flexible nature of these complex cocoa agroforests. The properties of these cocoa agroforests gradually built over time enable adaptations and their transmission during difficult times. To cope with current challenges facing global cocoa production, we recommend that these cocoa agroforests serve as a basis to promote new cocoa cropping models to better reconcile cocoa production and the preservation of forest resources.

TI  - Evaluating extinction debt in fragmented forests: the rapid recovery of a critically endangered primate
T2  - ANIMAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Fragmented tropical forests can be highly dynamic, with the spatial configuration of forest patches changing through time. Yet, the lack of longitudinal studies limits our understanding of how patch dynamics affect biodiversity, especially when there is a time lag in species extinctions (extinction debt). We assessed how temporal changes in patch size, shape complexity and isolation affect populations of the Mexican howler monkey (Alouatta palliata mexicana), hypothesizing that we would find an extinction debt in this relatively long-lived species. We assessed patch occupancy, subpopulation size and immature-to-female ratio in 39 forest patches from Los Tuxtlas, Mexico, in both 2001 and 2013. To identify time-lag responses to habitat disturbance, we related demographic attributes in 2013 to patch metrics in 2001 and 2013 and tested whether primate subpopulations were better predicted by current or historical patch characteristics. We also assessed how changes in patch metrics affected each demographic attribute between 2001 and 2013. Patch size and shape complexity increased over time, whereas isolation decreased. These positive spatial changes were accompanied by a 1.6-fold increase in mean subpopulation size over the same period. In addition, occupancy and immature-to-female ratio were similarly related to patch attributes in both years, suggesting that there is no extinction debt. Our findings are 'good news', suggesting that forest recovery over a relatively short period can promote the recovery of this Critically Endangered taxon. They also highlight the importance of preventing forest loss and promoting forest regeneration in human-modified tropical landscapes.

TI  - Environmental performance of agroforestry systems in the Cerrado biome, Brazil
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Agriculture and land use practices must be significantly improved to satisfy the needs of future generations without placing further pressure on global ecosystems. Agroforestry systems (AFS) have been quoted as one of the best options to mitigate environmental impacts and at the same time, improve smallholders' livelihoods in agricultural areas. However, studies investigating the environmental aspects and yield of agroforestry systems in rural settlements, established by governmental initiatives, are still uncommon in the literature. Therefore, the goal of this paper was to assess the contribution of five bio-diverse AFS, located in the Cerrado biome, to global warming mitigation and the provision of ecosystem services to smallholder farmers. Additionally, the importance of agroforestry projects to family farms in Brazil was discussed. Relying on data from forestry inventory and in-depth interviews with farmers, the crop yield (including fruit) was estimated; and the life cycle assessment method was used to determine the Global Warming Potential (GWP), accounting for all emissions to establish and manage the AFS up until the date of analysis. The results show the significant capacity of AFS sequester carbon, represented by the negative values of GWP, ranging from (-263) to (-496) t CO2 equivalents per hectare. Each farmer adopted different tree and crop species at the AFS establishment what influenced yields and GWP. The high number of fruit trees contributed positively to the AFS outputs, allowing farmers to consume and sell a large variety of products. Furthermore, the households also benefit from microclimate and aesthetic benefits provided by the AFS5. Future agroforestry projects in rural settlements can contribute significantly to improve household livelihoods, as well as environmental protection. However, efforts should be taken to provide farmers with sound knowledge, financial support, and access to markets to thrive. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ecohydrological impacts of oil palm expansion: a systematic review
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Global demand for vegetable oil and high oil palm yield have driven the rapid expansion of oil palm plantations in tropical countries. The research literature widely recognizes the effects of forest cover conversion into oil palm on biodiversity, deforestation, and carbon dynamics. However, research on the ecohydrological impacts of oil palm plantations is sparse, despite studies indicating that oil palm development may reshape land-water interactions and the availability and movement of water at different spatial and temporal scales. We address this gap by conducting a systematic literature review on oil palm development and its relation to ecohydrological processes. We found 139 relevant papers up to the year 2021, addressing different ecohydrological processes related to oil palm. We reviewed their spatiotemporal scales, geographic distribution, oil palm species and age, and the effects of land conversion from forest, cropland, and pastures. We also incorporated societal aspects regarding community perceptions of water. Our review highlights the effects of oil palm plantations on three main components of the water cycle: (i) land-atmosphere, (ii) fluvial systems, and (iii) soils and groundwater. Most studies include analyses of the Indo-Malayan and Australasian biogeographical regions (113), followed by the Neotropics (49) and the Afrotropics (15). Compared to rainforests, oil palm monocultures are warmer and drier. They have higher evapotranspiration (ET) rates, lower runoff regulation and infiltration capacity, and lower soil organic carbon (SOC). Although less often implemented, alternative oil palm management practices, including oil palm agroforestry, can help to mitigate some of these effects. Forest to oil palm conversion is the most studied land transition, while conversions from croplands, pastures, and grasslands are less studied. Overall, we identify gaps in understanding the long-term effects of management on ecohydrological processes under different land conversions, especially in the Neotropics and the Afrotropics, precluding research-informed policy to manage impacts of this expanding crop.

TI  - Beyond CO2: Multiple Ecosystem Services From Ecologically Intensive Grazing Landscapes of South America
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Sustainability assessments to inform the design of multifunctional grazing landscapes need to look beyond greenhouse gas emissions to simultaneously embrace other social and environmental criteria. Here I briefly examine trade-offs and synergies between the productivity of graze-based livestock systems and the environment, and share a few generic guidelines to design pathways for the ecological intensification of livestock systems following agroecological principles. I draw from experience on livestock farming in the Rio de la Plata Grassland Biome of South America (Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil). Livestock systems based on native grasslands in this region may have greater carbon footprints (13-29 kg CO2 eq. kg LW-1) than intensive grass-feedlot systems in the region (9-14 kg CO2 eq. kg LW-1) or the average range reported for OECD countries (c. 10-20 kg CO2 eq. kg LW-1) when calculated per unit product, but only 20% greater when expressed on an area basis. Yet they use less external energy (10x) or nitrogen inputs (5x) per kg live weight (LW) produced, provide ecosystem services of local and global importance, such as carbon storage, habitat protection for biodiversity, watershed regulation, clean water, food and textiles, livelihoods and local cultures, and provide better living conditions for grazing animals. Traditional graze-based systems are less economically attractive than intensive livestock or grain production and they are being replaced by such activities, with negative social and environmental consequences. An ecological intensification (EI) of graze-based livestock systems is urgently needed to ensure economic profits while minimising social-ecological trade-offs on multifunctional landscapes. Examples of such EI systems exist in the region that exhibit synergies between economic and environmental goals, but a broad and lasting transition towards sustainable multifunctional landscapes based on agroecological principles requires (co-)innovation at both technical and institutional levels.

TI  - Forest Conservation with Deep Learning: A Deeper Understanding of Human Geography around the Betampona Nature Reserve, Madagascar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Documenting the impacts of climate change and human activities on tropical rainforests is imperative for protecting tropical biodiversity and for better implementation of REDD+ and UN Sustainable Development Goals. Recent advances in very high-resolution satellite sensor systems (i.e., WorldView-3), computing power, and machine learning (ML) have provided improved mapping of fine-scale changes in the tropics. However, approaches so far focused on feature extraction or the extensive tuning of ML parameters, hindering the potential of ML in forest conservation mapping by not using textural information, which is found to be powerful for many applications. Additionally, the contribution of shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands in forest cover mapping is unknown. The objectives were to develop end-to-end mapping of the tropical forest using fully convolution neural networks (FCNNs) with WorldView-3 (WV-3) imagery and to evaluate human impact on the environment using the Betampona Nature Reserve (BNR) in Madagascar as the test site. FCNN (U-Net) using spatial/textural information was implemented and compared with feature-fed pixel-based methods including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). Results show that the FCNN model outperformed other models with an accuracy of 90.9%, while SVM, RF, and DNN provided accuracies of 88.6%, 84.8%, and 86.6%, respectively. When SWIR bands were excluded from the input data, FCNN provided superior performance over other methods with a 1.87% decrease in accuracy, while the accuracies of other models-SVM, RF, and DNN-decreased by 5.42%, 3.18%, and 8.55%, respectively. Spatial-temporal analysis showed a 0.7% increase in Evergreen Forest within the BNR and a 32% increase in tree cover within residential areas likely due to forest regeneration and conservation efforts. Other effects of conservation efforts are also discussed.

TI  - Land-use change differentially affects endemic, forest and open-land butterflies in Madagascar
T2  - INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY
AB  - The conversion of tropical forests into agriculture reduces biodiversity dramatically. However, species might differ in their responses, depending on their habitat specialisation and geographic origin. In this study, we assess how butterfly assemblages differ between old-growth forests, forest fragments, forest-derived vanilla agroforests, fallow-derived vanilla agroforests, woody fallows, herbaceous fallows, and rice paddies in Madagascar. We recorded 88 butterfly species, of which 65 species are endemic to Madagascar. Land-use types with woody vegetation sustained many endemic (mean: 6.8 species) and forest butterfly species (mean: 4.8 species). Rice paddies and herbaceous fallows were richer in open-land species (mean: 7.6 species) and poorer in forest species (mean: 1.7 species) compared to other land-use types. Compared to herbaceous fallows, fallow-derived vanilla agroforests hosted more endemic (+164%) and forest (+239%) species. Richness of open-land species in forest-derived vanilla agroforests was six times higher than in forest fragments. Overall, 27% of species occurred exclusively in one land-use type and 19% of all species when old-growth forests were excluded. We found the highest number of exclusive species in forest-derived vanilla agroforests. We conclude that all studied land-use types contribute to butterfly conservation in our study region. Especially the woody vegetation in forest fragments, vanilla agroforests, and woody fallows supports a high butterfly diversity and is pivotal for maintaining a broad diversity of forest butterflies in the agricultural matrix. Our study highlights the importance of preserving the diversity of small-scale land-use types, including agroforestry, forests and fallow land in this tropical biodiversity hotspot.

TI  - Reforestation and smallholder livelihoods in the humid tropics
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Smallholder livelihoods and the restoration of tropical forests are intimately intertwined. To address the question of how reforestation affects livelihoods and how they in turn affect reforestation, a meta-synthesis was undertaken of 339 scientific publications identified from a systematic literature search. This study is focused on smallholders in the humid tropics, and uses the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework, which was developed by the UK Department for International Development as the framework for analysis. The links between reforestation and livelihoods are found to be diverse and highly interconnected. Reforestation is only one of a smallholder's activities and typically forms part of a mosaic of land uses across a landscape. Therefore, reforestation should be designed, managed and evaluated under the perspective of a diverse livelihood portfolio, and not as a single activity isolated from other portfolio components, especially under current landscape approaches. It is important for reforestation to be a complementary rather than a competitive livelihood activity. Reforestation has great potential to address poverty, and to increase smallholder socio-ecological resilience and local social equity. However, reforestation outcomes are often suboptimal. Assessing smallholder capacity and the surrounding environment prior to reforestation, and addressing limiting local capacities and conditions in a timely manner, may enhance the likelihood of optimal benefits.

TI  - Landscape forest cover and regional context shape the conservation value of shaded cocoa agroforests for bees and social wasps
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB  - ContextThe expansion of agricultural lands threatens biodiversity maintenance across the tropics. Although some agroforestry systems may be biodiversity-friendly, their conservation value likely depends on the landscape and regional contexts in which they are embedded-a poorly tested hypothesis.ObjectivesWe assessed the conservation value of shaded cocoa agroforests for bees and social wasps, and evaluated whether such value depends on the remaining forest cover at the landscape and/or regional scales.MethodsUsing a paired design, we compared alpha- (species number) and beta-diversity of each taxon between cocoa agroforests and neighbouring rainforests in 30 landscapes from three regions with different deforestation levels from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We assessed whether the species number ratio (cocoa/forest) and beta-diversity related to landscape-scale forest cover, and whether such a relationship differed among regions (interacting effect).ResultsCocoa agroforests held more bee and wasp species than forests, and beta-diversity between habitats was moderate (bees) to high (wasps). Bees' species number ratio peaked at the intermediate-deforested region, and beta-diversity decreased with increasing forest cover, indicating that both land uses shared more species in more forested landscapes, especially in the high- and intermediate-deforested regions. Yet, for social wasps, beta-diversity varied only within regions, with habitats sharing more species in the low-deforested region.ConclusionsOur findings highlight that the conservation value of shaded cocoa agroforests for bees and social wasps depends on local and regional landscape forest cover. With cocoa agroforest being highly permeable matrix which increases with higher forest cover especially for bees in high- and intermediate-deforested regions.

TI  - Riparian forest recovery following a decade of cattle exclusion in the Colombian Andes
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - To meet their large-scale forest and landscape restoration targets, countries must find ways to accommodate areas for conservation alongside agricultural production. In some pasture-dominated regions of Latin America, intensive silvopastoral systems (SPS) are being promoted to increase cattle productivity on certain lands while facilitating the removal of cattle from marginal areas for forest restoration. However, the recovery of these forests and their contribution to the overall conservation value of the landscape has not been assessed rigorously. We evaluated forest structure and composition in 20 sites in a region of the Colombian Andes where a decade ago farmers transitioned to SPS and fenced off riparian areas to enable forest recovery. We compared these restored forests to a reference model based on the remaining riparian forest across the region, all of which has been subjected to human management. We found that woody species richness was higher in restored than in reference forests, and the proportion of large-seeded, later successional, animal-dispersed species were similar in both forest types. Whereas we found a similar suite of dominant tree species in restored and reference forest, Guadua angustifolia, a native giant bamboo was more abundant in the reference forests due to human management. Total tree basal area was higher in restored forests due to a small number of very large trees likely present in the pastures at the time of site protection. These findings highlight (1) the potential for recovery of diverse forests in riparian sites despite previous grazing use and (2) the role of remnant trees in facilitating natural succession. Overall, rapid forest recovery with minimal intervention in previously fanned lands is good news for conservation in a region that still harbors significant biodiversity despite high levels of fragmentation and the influence of human management.

TI  - Assessment of multifaceted environmental issues and model development of an Indo-Burma hotspot region
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB  - The present article provides a multifaceted critical research review on environmental issues intimately related with the socio-economy of North East India (NE), a part of Indo-Burma hotspot. Further, the article addresses the issue of sustainable development of NE India through diverse ecological practices inextricably linked with traditional ecological knowledge (TEK). The biodiversity of NE India comprises endemic floral diversity, particularly medicinal plants of importance to pharmaceutical industry, and unique faunal diversity. Nevertheless, it is very unfortunate that this great land of biodiversity is least explored taxonomically as well as biotechnologically, probably due to geographical and political constraints. Different anthropogenic and socio-economic factors have perturbed the pristine ecology of this region, leading to environmental degradation. Also, the practice of unregulated shifting cultivation (jhooming), bamboo flowering, biological invasions and anthropogenic perturbations to biodiversity exacerbate the gloomy situation. Instead of a plethora of policies, the TEK of NE people may be integrated with modern scientific knowledge in order to conserve the environment which is the strong pillar for socio-economic sector here. The aforesaid approach can be practiced in NE India through the broad implementation and extension of agroforestry practices. Further, case studies on Apatanis, ethnomedicinal plants use by indigenous tribal groups and sacred forests are particularly relevant in the context of conservation of environmental health in totality while addressing the socioeconomic impact as well. In context with the prevailing scenarios in this region, we developed an eco-sustainable model for natural resource management through agroforestry practices in order to uplift the social as well as environmental framework.

TI  - Land Changes Fostering Atlantic Forest Transition in Brazil: Evidence from the Paraiba Valley
T2  - PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER
AB  - The Atlantic Forest biome has only 13 percent of its pristine vegetation cover left. This article analyzes the consequences of land changes on forest cover in the Paraiba Valley, SAo Paulo state, Brazil, from 1985 to 2011. Multitemporal satellite image classifications were carried out to map eight land use and land cover classes. The forest cover increased from 2,696 km(2) in 1985 to 4,704 km(2)in 2011, mostly over areas of degraded pastures. The highest rates of afforestation were observed within protected areas around eucalyptus plantations. On the other hand, deforestation processes were concentrated on areas covered by secondary forests. Socioeconomic changes taking place in particular Brazilian settings, such as industrialization and agricultural modernization, allied to the Paraiba Valley's natural biophysical constraints for agricultural production, have led the region to experience a remarkable case of forest transition.

TI  - Straw Removal Affects Soil Physical Quality and Sugarcane Yield in Brazil
T2  - BIOENERGY RESEARCH
AB  - Industrial use of sugarcane straw for bioenergy production represents a promising opportunity for the Brazilian sugarcane sector. Nonetheless, intensified straw removal may aggravate the effects of mechanized harvesting and increase the risks of soil compaction, declining sugarcane yield. An experiment was designed, and four field studies were conducted to evaluate the cumulative effects of straw removal on soil physical attributes (bulk density, BD; soil resistance to penetration, SRP; macroporosity, MaP; microporosity, MiP, and mean weight diameter of soil aggregates, MWD) and their relationship with crop yield under clayey and sandy soils in the Sao Paulo state, Brazil. In each field study, four straw removal rates (no removal, NR; low removal, LR, removal of 5 Mg ha(-1); high removal, HR, removal of 10 Mg ha(-1); and total removal, TR, removal of 15 Mg ha(-1)) were arranged in a randomized block design with four replicates. The 4-year intensive management of straw removal (HR and TR) resulted in an increased soil compaction (BD and SRP values) and reduced the MWD in both sandy and clayey soils. Our findings also showed that these effects are more significant in sandy soils, where soil carbon content was substantially reduced in HR and TR treatments. Sites with higher BD and SRP induced by straw removal were strongly associated with lower sugarcane yields, especially in sandy soils. Conversely, our findings indicate that LR was not detrimental to soil physical quality and sugarcane yield. Nevertheless, considering the multifunctionality of straw in sustaining multiple ecosystem services in different soil types, straw management should be defined taking into consideration site-specific conditions. We advocate that recommendations for straw removal should also be combined with other conservationist soil management practices in order to minimize soil compaction and its negative implications on sugarcane yield and other ecosystem services.

TI  - Shade trees and agrochemical use affect butterfly assemblages in coffee home gardens
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Agroforestry systems have been recognised as a possible refuge for biodiversity especially when bordering intact landscapes. The intensification of crop management to increase yields is usually associated with a reduction of shade trees and heavy use of chemicals, typically correlated with a decrease in biodiversity. The relationship between intensity of crop management and biodiversity, however, is not clear-cut and is dependent on environmental and geographical differences. We assessed the influence of different shade cover, shade tree richness, richness of other crops, distance from the forest, and use of chemicals on the diversity, richness and abundance of butterflies, a bioindicator in coffee home gardens. We collected data in 42 coffee home gardens in West Java, Indonesia, via Pollard transects, totalling 15.1 km (July-August 2019 and July-August 2020). We found 54 species of butterflies in the gardens. Via Generalised Additive Mixed Models, we found that the use of chemicals negatively influenced the abundance (p = 0.001) and richness (p = 0.039) of butterflies, while shade tree richness positively influenced the abundance (p < 0.001), diversity (p = 0.046) and richness (p < 0.001) of butterflies. The other predictors did not have a significant effect. The high diversity of butterflies in the study area suggests that the agroforestry environment is now resilient, but the relationship between butterfly abundance, diversity, and richness with shade tree richness indicates an urgency to maintain and improve current ecosystem complexity. The negative relationship between butterfly abundance and richness and the use of chemicals further indicates that organic farming should be promoted to preserve ecosystem services provided by pollinators. Coffee production in Indonesia has dramatically increased in the last 10 years and producers are keener to use more intensive farming techniques with a consequent reduction of ecosystem complexity. This process can break the resilience of agroforestry habitats if actions are not taken immediately.

TI  - The anthropocene landscape and ecosystem services in the closure of sand mining: Paraiba do Sul River basin - Brazil
T2  - RESOURCES POLICY
AB  - Geodiversity is a determinant of mining patterns, because its nature defines the interaction with humans, type of exploitation, and, consequently, ecosystem services (ES) of the final landscape. The environmental recovery obligations defined in the legislation serve as a good guidance, but sand mining companies are not always able to finalize their activity entirely and to comply with the laws. To take this into account, the present study was developed with an objective of analyzing the changes observed in the ES after 70 years of sand exploitation in the Paraiba do Sul River Valley, Brazil. The services of the floodplain soil formation and associated components, such as the quality and quantity of water and refuges provided by the riparian forest, are highlighted in this study. To evaluate the different ESs modified by mining, socio-environmental variables were studied, and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was applied to assign significance to each variable in the phase of closing activities, thus creating a compound index for ES evaluation at mine closure. The closure conditions were analyzed against the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6, 8, 9, and 11. The results showed that the companies are small, that they met the legislation in equal criteria of environmental rehabilitation, and that they were induced to a closure standard, reflecting the reforestation with native forest variable, related to the ES of provisioning of habitat to wild fauna. However, the mine facilities variable, associated with the cultural ES of recreation, predominated, because the buildings and access roads were preserved, even though the movable assets were demobilized quickly. It was concluded from the analysis that the scenario of the ES at mine closure is generally linked to geodiversity, company size, and compliance with legal duties.

TI  - The cost of restoring carbon stocks in Brazil's Atlantic Forest
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Knowing which restoration approach provides the best returns on investment for accumulating carbon is essential to foster restoration planning, financing, and implementation. Here, we explored the cost-effectiveness and drivers of aboveground and soil carbon accumulation in restored forests across an agricultural landscape of Brazil's Atlantic Forest. The recovery of aboveground and soil carbon stocks, as well as the implementation and land opportunity costs, was assessed across chronosequences (10-60 years) of second-growth forests and mixed-species tree plantings and old growth, reference forest remnants. Plantations accumulated approximately 50% more aboveground carbon than second-growth forests throughout the chronosequence. When controlling for soil clay content, soil carbon stocks were higher in reference than in restored forests, but they were comparable between plantations and second-growth forests. After 60 years of stand development, recovery of total carbon stocks in both restoration approaches reached only half of the average stocks of reference forests. Total cost-effectiveness for carbon accumulation, including both implementation and land opportunity costs, was on average 60% higher for second-growth forests than for plantations (15.1 and 9.4 kgC US$(-1), respectively). Although tree plantations initially showed higher rates of carbon storage than second-growth forests, their higher implementation and land opportunity costs make them less cost-effective for carbon farming. Our results further suggest that, at current pricing levels, carbon markets alone have a limited potential to up-scale restoration efforts in Brazil's Atlantic Forest.

TI  - Forest Degradation: When Is a Forest Degraded?
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - The concept of forest degradation tends to be addressed in broad terms, and existing definitions are difficult to apply in practice. These definitions are based on a reduction in the production of ecosystem goods and services, but fail to address how, when and to what degree this reductionwhich ultimately leads to degradation of a forestoccurs. Generally speaking, degradation is the result of a progressive decline in the structure, composition and functions upon which the vigor and RESILIENCE of a forest is based. A degraded forest is one whose structure, function, species composition, or productivity have been severely modified or permanently lost as a result of damaging human activities. So far, no guidelines have been developed for classification and evaluation of a degraded forest at the stand level, nor are there methodologies for assessing the degree of degradation found. The present work proposes stand-level guidelines for identification of a degraded forest according to a list of structural, compositional and regeneration criteria and characteristics. Emphasis is put on the need for local definitions of forest degradation, and identification of thresholds that determine the points where the processes of degradation finalize into degraded forests. Finally, the present work makes a call to move forwards in sustainable management in order to prevent degradation, and in implementation of restoration or rehabilitation practices in degraded forests.

TI  - Fostering a Wildlife-Friendly Program for Sustainable Coffee Farming: The Case of Small-Holder Farmers in Indonesia
T2  - LAND
AB  - There is an urgent need for a global transition to sustainable and wildlife-friendly farming systems that provide social and economic equity and protect ecosystem services on which agriculture depends. Java is home to 60% of Indonesia's population and harbors many endemic species; thus, managing agriculture alongside human well-being and biodiversity is vital. Within a community of similar to 400 coffee farmers in the province of West Java, we assessed the steps to develop a wildlife-friendly program until reaching certification between February 2019 and October 2020. We adopted an adaptive management approach that included developing common objectives through a process of stakeholder consultation and co-learning. We firstly investigated via interviews the expectations and the issues encountered by 25 farmers who converted to organic production in 2016. Their main expectations were an increase in income and an increase in coffee quality, while they had issues mainly in finding high quality fertilizers, reducing pests, and increasing productivity. We used this information to establish a problem-solving plan for the transition to community-wide wildlife-friendly practices. As part of the adaptive evaluation, we assessed the quality of coffee plantations before and after the implementation of coproduced actions. The quality of coffee significantly improved after our interventions to reduce the coffee berry borer, especially in the fields that started as inorganic and converted to organic. We uncovered additional issues to meet the standards for certification, including banning hunting and trapping activities and increasing coffee quality for international export. We describe the coproduced actions (agroforestry, conservation education, local law, organic alternatives) and phases of the program and discuss the potential barriers. We provide novel evidence of adaptive management framework successfully used to implement management actions and reach shared goals.

TI  - Multifunctional soil recovery during the restoration of Brazil's Atlantic Forest after bauxite mining
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Ecosystem restoration is a global priority, currently promoted by several ambitious commitments. Most of the research to guide restoration practices was so far put on the recovery of above-ground functions and services, although soil health is increasingly recognized as a fundamental condition to restoration success. Soil restoration is particularly needed in mining areas, in which the surface soil layers are removed and the left over, highly deprived substrate does not support vegetation recovery.
   2. Here, we evaluated the potential of active restoration to recover soil attributes after bauxite mining in the Brazil's Atlantic Forest. We specifically studied how physical, chemical and microbiological soil attributes down to 40 cm depth respond to restoration (i.e. topsoil spreading and tree planting) by comparing newly mined areas, areas undergoing restoration for similar to 7 years and conserved forests. We further explored the associations between microbiological and physico-chemical soil attributes.
   3. Restoration interventions resulted in a 10-fold increase in the soil organic matter content compared to mined areas, as well as in the recovery of P content. Restoration was also shown to be associated with the recovery of the activity and diversity of soil bacterial communities, reaching similar levels to those observed in conserved forest. Restored and conserved forests were characterized by a higher proportion of Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia. All bacterial attributes were correlated with soil physical attributes, except for microporosity, and with organic matter and cation exchange capacity.
   4. Within a few years, restoration allowed recovering crucial physical, chemical and microbiological soil attributes, reaching levels comparable to those found in conserved forests.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that intensive management can result in the fast restoration of tropical forest soils after mining, at least at small scales. Our results stress the need to consider soil recovery both as a driver and a measure of ecosystem restoration success, and support the development of more holistic monitoring protocols to be used during the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.

TI  - Agroforestry systems conserve species-rich but modified assemblages of tropical birds and bats
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Although an increasing number of studies have shown that diverse, multi-strata agroforestry systems can contribute to the conservation of tropical biodiversity, there is still debate about how the biodiversity within agroforestry systems compares to that of intact forest and alternative land uses. In order to assess the relative importance of agroforestry systems for biodiversity conservation, we characterized bat and bird assemblages occurring in forests, two types of agroforestry systems (cacao and banana) and plantain monocultures in the indigenous reserves of Talamanca, Costa Rica. A total of 2,678 bats of 45 species were captured, and 3,056 birds of 224 species were observed. Agroforestry systems maintained bat assemblages that were as (or more) species-rich, abundant and diverse as forests, had the same basic suite of dominant species, but contained more nectarivorous bats than forests. Agroforestry systems also contained bird assemblages that were as abundant, species-rich and diverse as forests; however the species composition of these assemblages was highly modified, with fewer forest dependent species, more open area species and different dominant species. The plantain monocultures had highly modified and depauperate assemblages of both birds and bats. Across land uses, bird diversity and species richness were more closely correlated with the structural and floristic characteristics than were bats, suggesting potential taxon-specific responses to different land uses. Our results indicate that diverse cacao and banana agroforestry systems contribute to conservation efforts by serving as habitats to high numbers of bird and bat species, including some, but not all, forest-dependent species and species of known conservation concern. However, because the animal assemblages in agroforestry systems differ from those in forests, the maintenance of forests within the agricultural landscape is critical for conserving intact assemblages at the landscape level.

TI  - Species selection and plantation management in enrichment planting with native timber species in the Panama Canal watershed
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Large areas of the Panama Canal Watershed have been converted to monocultures of teak (Tectona grandis), a non-native timber species that is generally not providing hoped-for economic and ecological benefits of Forest Landscape Restoration. Enrichment planting offers a potential strategy for revitalizing these underperforming plantations through the addition of high-value, native species to the understory, but more information is needed to guide implementation and management in this region and other tropical areas. We assessed the performance of six promising native species (Byrsonima crassifolia, Dalbergia retusa, Dipteryx oleifera, Hyeronima alchorneoides, Platymiscium pinnatum, Terminalia amazonia) as an enrichment planting in teak plantations, and specifically considered how light availability, crowding pressure and annual fertilization affected seedling performance, we measured survival and growth for the first 30 months post-planting for similar to 3,000 seedlings; half received annual fertilization and half did not. We found that growth rate did not significantly affect survival among- or within-species, except for a positive relationship for D. oleifera. Overall seedling survival was high (83%), and, while species varied widely, there was not a strong effect of light, crowding or fertilization on survival. In contrast, overall growth of species was significantly affected by these factors. Across all species growth was negatively related to crowding and positively related to light availability and fertilization. There were among-species differences; while all but one species (D. oleifera) were negatively affected by crowding, only half responded positively to light availability (D. retusa, P. pinnatum, and B. crassifolia) and fertilization (D. retusa, P. pinnatum, and T. amazonia). Our findings suggest that all study species except for B. crassifolia, which suffered unacceptably high mortality, have high potential for use in enrichment planting in Panama teak plantations. Among-species differences in response to fertilization and growing environment highlight the need for continued studies to establish specific silvicultural guidelines for species in the enrichment planting context.

TI  - Cross-scale spatial variability and associations of carbon pools provide insight into regulating carbon sequestration in tropical montane rainforests
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - The spatial distribution of plant, soil, and microbial carbon pools, along with their intricate interactions, presents a great challenge for the current carbon cycle research. However, it is not clear what are the characteristics of the spatial variability of these carbon pools, particularly their cross-scale relationships. We investigated the crossscale spatial variability of microbial necromass carbon (MNC), soil organic carbon (SOC) and plant biomass (PB), as well as their correlation in a tropical montane rainforest using multifractal analysis. The results showed multifractal spatial variations of MNC, SOC, and PB, demonstrating their adherence to power-law scaling. MNC, especially low MNC, exhibited stronger spatial heterogeneity and weaker evenness compared with SOC and PB. The cross-scale correlation between MNC and SOC was stronger than their correlations at the measurement scale. Furthermore, the cross-scale spatial variability of MNC and SOC exhibited stronger and more stable correlations than those with PB. Additionally, this research suggests that when SOC and PB are both low, it is advisable for reforestations to potentiate MNC formation, whereas when both SOC and PB are high some thinning can be advisable to favour MNC formation. Thus, these results support the utilization of management measures such as reforestation or thinning as nature-based solutions to regulate carbon sequestration capacity of tropical forests by affecting the correlations among various carbon pools.

TI  - Impact of cocoa agricultural intensification on bird diversity and community composition
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - To meet the growing demand for chocolate, cocoa (Theobroma cacao) agriculture is expanding and intensifying. Although this threatens tropical forests, cocoa sustainability initiatives largely overlook biodiversity conservation. To inform these initiatives, we analyzed how cocoa agriculture affects bird diversity at farm and landscape scales with a meta-analysis of 23 studies. We extracted 214 Hedges' g* comparisons of bird diversity and 14 comparisons of community similarity between a forest baseline and 4 farming systems that cover an intensification gradient in landscapes with high and low forest cover, and we summarized 119 correlations between cocoa farm features and bird diversity. Bird diversity declined sharply in low shade cocoa. Cocoa with >30% canopy cover from diverse trees retained bird diversity similar to nearby primary or mature secondary forest but held a different community of birds. Diversity of endemic species, frugivores, and insectivores (agriculture avoiders) declined, whereas diversity of habitat generalists, migrants, nectarivores, and granivores (agriculture associates) increased. As forest decreased on the landscape, the difference in bird community composition between forest and cocoa also decreased, indicating agriculture associates replaced agriculture avoiders in forest patches. Our results emphasize the need to conserve forested landscapes (land sparing) and invest in mixed-shade agroforestry (land sharing) because each strategy benefits a diverse and distinct biological community.

TI  - Tree cover increase mitigation strategy: implications of the "replacement approach" in carbon storage of a subtropical ecosystem
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Worldwide tree cover increase (TCI) is one the most important climate change mitigation strategies, given the role of the ecosystems as carbon (C) reservoirs. Reforestation could be key to achieving TCI. However, there is still a knowledge gap about its real mitigation effects when it is applied through its replacement approach (REP-app). We evaluate the REP-app effects (replace native forest cover-NFC-by forestry plantation cover-FPC) on magnitude and direction of ecosystem C stock changes. By means of a field study, we quantified the C stock through a space-for-time substitution method, using eight paired sites (NFC/FPC) in a northern Argentinian subtropical forest (SAY). We studied C in saplings, lianas, above and belowground biomass, dead organic biomass, and soil. Through a metaanalysis, we evaluated the reliableness within the response of C sequestration (gain or loss) in international study cases and, therefore, the robustness of outcomes analyzing some main moderator variables that may influence the result. A significant effect of C loss was revealed by both, the field study (- 50%) and the metaanalysis (- 20.4%), and this response was consistent through stands of ages and species different. SAY sequestered 285 MgC ha(-1). Only 35-year-old Eucalyptus stand reached similar values, but they are reservoirs of doubtful permanence with functional attributes that could affect long-term ecosystem functioning. Given that the TCI strategy seek to achieve interconnected efforts in relation to climate, biodiversity, and sustainable development, the REP-app must not be considered a mitigation strategy in subtropical ecosystems. Global programs promoting TCI must be redirected urgently.

TI  - Gender influences decisions to change land use practices in the tropical forest margins of Jambi, Indonesia
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - This study explores the role of gender as a factor in decision making about alternative land use options and in responses to new investment opportunities, which has received little attention to date. An observational study to determine the different factors affecting male and female decisions to change land use at the individual level in a forest margin landscape in Jambi (Sumatra, Indonesia) was combined with a set of role playing games (RPGs) designed to assess participant responses in a simulated social setting of women-only and men-only groups. The RPG included simulated agents offering new opportunities to convert or conserve agroforest. In the study area, rubber (Hevea braziliensis) agroforests that support high biodiversity and carbon storage are giving way to monoculture rubber and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantations. When women from both the upland and lowland villages played the RPGs, external investors proposing logging or oil palm conversion were approached very positively and the resulting land use change was more dynamic and extensive than in the equivalent men-only groups. Consequently, women outperformed men in achieving income targets. In lowland areas gender is strongly associated with land use change, while in the uplands the level of conservation awareness plays a more crucial role in the maintenance of rubber agroforests. Based on the data, and contrary to expectations and gender stereotypes, it is expected that the greater involvement of women in landscape level decision making will increase emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in the area, posing further challenges to efforts to reduce such emissions.

TI  - Primary forest loss and degradation reduces biodiversity and ecosystem functioning: A global meta-analysis using dung beetles as an indicator taxon
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Because of continuing degradation or deforestation in areas of undisturbed primary forest, there is a need to study the relative merit of strategies that mitigate their impacts on biodiversity and associated ecological functionality. Here, we provide a global synthesis of forest degradation or deforestation using 48 studies published in peer-reviewed journals that use dung beetles as indicators given their sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbance and their relevance in performing essential ecological functions in terrestrial ecosystems. We evaluated forest cover associated with undisturbed primary forest degradation (i.e. degraded primary forest) and undisturbed primary forest deforestation (i.e. secondary forest, forestry plantations and forestry restoration implementation) on species richness, total abundance, biomass, functional groups' presence and ecological functions provided by dung beetles. Additionally, we determined whether if dung beetle responses to forest disturbances were geographically dependent. We found lower diversity and a decrease in ecological functions associated with all classes of disturbance in primary forest. However, the effects were less severe in the case of forest degradation compared to complete deforestation with natural regeneration of secondary forest, development of forest plantations or active forest restoration by planting indigenous trees. The Neotropical and Oriental regions are particularly vulnerable, given the elevated rates of undisturbed primary forest deforestation and its negative impact on their assemblages' diversity and ecological functions. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that efforts for the conservation of remaining undisturbed primary forests need to be prioritized, especially in tropical latitudes. However, in regions where primary forest conservation is not feasible, logging management programs in degraded primary forest may have a potential role in reducing negative impacts for dung beetle diversity and ecological functions. Moreover, we conclude that despite the negative effect of primary forest deforestation and implementation of secondary forest, forestry plantation and forestry restoration, they can be useful for partial recovery of diversity and ecological functions performed by dung beetles in areas lacking any primary forest (undisturbed or degraded) vegetation cover.

TI  - Hidden Tenants: Microbiota of the Rhizosphere and Phyllosphere of Cordia dodecandra Trees in Mayan Forests and Homegardens
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
AB  - During domestication, the selection of cultivated plants often reduces microbiota diversity compared with their wild ancestors. Microbiota in compartments such as the phyllosphere or rhizosphere can promote fruit tree health, growth, and development. Cordia dodecandra is a deciduous tree used by Maya people for its fruit and wood, growing, to date, in remnant forest fragments and homegardens (traditional agroforestry systems) in Yucatdn. In this work, we evaluated the microbiota's alpha and beta diversity per compartment (phyllosphere and rhizosphere) and per population (forest and homegarden) in the Northeast and Southwest Yucatdn regions. Eight composite DNA samples (per compartment/population/region combination) were amplified for 16S-RNA (bacteria) and ITS1-2 (fungi) and sequenced by Illumina MiSeq. Bioinformatic analyses were performed with QIIME and phyloseq. For bacteria and fungi, from 107,947 and 128,786 assembled sequences, 618 and 1092 operating taxonomic units (OTUs) were assigned, respectively. The alpha diversity of bacteria and fungi was highly variable among samples and was similar among compartments and populations. A significant species turnover among populations and regions was observed in the rhizosphere. The core microbiota from the phyllosphere was similar among populations and regions. Forests and homegarden populations are reservoirs of the C. dodecandra phyllosphere core microbiome and significant rhizosphere biodiversity.

TI  - Canopy recovery four years after logging: a management study in a southern brazilian secondary forest
T2  - CERNE
AB  - Background: Understanding forest dynamics after logging is essential to define forest management cycles and intensities. In secondary forest, especially in the Atlantic Forest Domain, these studies are still scarce. Monitoring of the canopy structure after tree harvesting can be performed by hemispherical photographs, where canopy opening is commonly analyzed. This study evaluated changes in canopy opening four years after tree harvesting in a secondary Atlantic Rainforest in southern Brazil. We used hemispherical photographs to determine the Canopy Openness (CO), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Diffuse Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Absorbed Radiation (FAPAR(dif)) in eleven permanent plots.
   Results: We found that harvesting resulted in a momentary increase in canopy opening and light availability in the understory. Four years after harvesting, CO, LAI and FAPAR dif recovered or even exceeded the original values of the forest. We observed a significant correlation between CO and number of trees harvested with DBH > 30 cm. Weak correlations were found between these canopy related variables and the logging intensity.
   Conclusion: In conclusion, we recognized that changes of CO, LAI and FAPAR(dif) after timber harvesting presented short duration. This indicates that the applied logging intensities, 21.8 to 51.1% of the total basal area, did not exceed the resilience of the forest canopy and it's recovering four years later. However, additional studies should be carried out to observe vegetation dynamics, such as species composition, vertical structure, productivity and community stability, in order to improve management schemes of secondary stands in the Atlantic Forest.

TI  - Decay of similarity across tropical forest communities: integrating spatial distance with soil nutrients
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Understanding the mechanisms that drive the change of biotic assemblages over space and time is the main quest of community ecology. Assessing the relative importance of dispersal and environmental species selection in a range of organismic sizes and motilities has been a fruitful strategy. A consensus for whether spatial and environmental distances operate similarly across spatial scales and taxa, however, has yet to emerge. We used censuses of four major groups of organisms (soil bacteria, fungi, ground insects, and trees) at two observation scales (1-m(2) sampling point vs. 2,500-m(2) plots) in a topographically standardized sampling design replicated in two tropical rainforests with contrasting relationships between spatial distance and nutrient availability. We modeled the decay of assemblage similarity for each taxon set and site to assess the relative contributions of spatial distance and nutrient availability distance. Then, we evaluated the potentially structuring effect of tree composition over all other taxa. The similarity of nutrient content in the litter and topsoil had a stronger and more consistent selective effect than did dispersal limitation, particularly for bacteria, fungi, and trees at the plot level. Ground insects, the only group assessed with the capacity of active dispersal, had the highest species turnover and the flattest nonsignificant distance-decay relationship, suggesting that neither dispersal limitation nor nutrient availability were fundamental drivers of their community assembly at this scale of analysis. Only the fungal communities at one of our study sites were clearly coordinated with tree composition. The spatial distance at the smallest scale was more important than nutrient selection for the bacteria, fungi, and insects. The lower initial similarity and the moderate variation in composition identified by these distance-decay models, however, suggested that the effects of stochastic sampling were important at this smaller spatial scale. Our results highlight the importance of nutrients as one of the main environmental drivers of rainforest communities irrespective of organismic or propagule size and how the overriding effect of the analytical scale influences the interpretation, leading to the perception of greater importance of dispersal limitation and ecological drift over selection associated with environmental niches at decreasing observation scales.

TI  - Use of response guilds of understory birds in threatened subtropical forest to monitor selective logging impact
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Unplanned logging is one of the greatest current threats to native forests biodiversity. About 90% of the pied-mont forest in the Southern Andean Yungas has been converted to other land-use types and the remaining forests fragments are being intensively logged without management plans. Bird species, especially understory birds, are good indicators of forest diversity and integrity. The aim of this study was to identify understory bird species associated with changes in the forest structure caused by selective logging and to explore whether it is possible to use these species as a monitoring tool. We observed that Sittasomus griseicapillus, Turdus rufiventris, Lepidocolaptes angustirostris, Casiornis rufus, Thraupis sayaca, and Tolmomyias sulphurescens were associated to unlogged sites with higher density of timber-yielding and standing dead trees. Thamnophilus caerulescens, Leptotila megalura, Synallaxis scutata, Poecilotriccus plumbeiceps, and Catharus ustulatus were favoured by logging activities and associated with understory visual obstruction. Mean cut-off abundance thresholds were 2.74 ind/ha for the avian guild associated with unlogged forest and 1.79 ind/ha for the guild associated with logged forest. Sustainable forest management schemes need to retain the understory visual obstruction at values similar to those of unlogged forest (43.75%), together with an adequate density (>= 10 ind/ha) of standing dead trees with at least 19.5 cm in DBH, and a minimum of 210 ind/ha of timber tree species. Bird species identified in this study can be used in monitoring schemes to evaluate the implementation of these guidelines.

   Methods We used photographic data from three commercial forest reserves to show how community occupancy modelling can be used to quantify mammalian diversity conservation co-benefits of forest certification. These reserves had different management histories, and one was certified by the Forest Stewardship Council.
   Results Many threatened species occupied larger areas in the certified reserve. Species richness, estimated per 200x200-m grid cell throughout all reserves, was higher in the certified site, particularly for threatened species. The certified reserve held the highest aboveground biomass. Within reserves, aboveground biomass was not strongly correlated with patterns of mammal richness (Spearman's rho from 0.03 to 0.32); discrepancies were strongest along reserve borders.
   Main conclusions Our approach provides a flexible and standardized tool to assess biodiversity and identify winners of sustainable forestry. Inferring patterns of species richness from camera-trapping carries potential for the objective designation of high conservation value forest. Correlating species richness with aboveground biomass further allows evaluating the biodiversity co-benefits of carbon protection. These advantages make the present approach an ideal tool to overcome the difficulties to rigorously quantify biodiversity co-benefits of forest certification and carbon storage payments.

TI  - Antioxidant and photoprotective defenses in response to gradual water stress under low and high irradiance in two Malvaceae tree species used for tropical forest restoration
T2  - TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB  - Key message This study provides a mechanistic basis of the tolerance to light and water stress in two tropical tree species of the Malvaceae used for the reforestation in the tropics. G. ulmifolia is more sensitive to high irradiance than C. speciosa . Thus, C. speciosa is more appropriate for the reforestation of degraded areas with potential excess light or water deficit.
   Reforestation programs in tropics are necessary to mitigate the impacts of climate change, the preservation of biodiversity and for recovery of degraded areas. However, little is known about the abiotic stress tolerance of the major tropical tree species used in reforestation. This study was aimed at evaluating antioxidant defenses and photoprotective pigments against excess light and water deficit in Guazuma ulmifolia Lam. and Ceiba speciosa (A.St.-Hil) Ravenna. Plantlets of 6-month-old were exposed to progressive water deficit by withholding water under high and low irradiance growth conditions and then re-irrigated. G. ulmifolia leaves under high irradiance showed increased photo-oxidative damage, as indicated by a decreased Fv/Fm ratio and 5-12-fold increases in MDA levels, which correlated with a 14-fold increase in SOD activity, a 90 % decrease in POD activity and a 3-4-fold increases in hydrogen peroxide levels. Water deficit combined with high irradiance caused stronger chronic photoinhibition, indicating a synergistic effect that cannot be counterbalanced by antioxidant or photo-protective mechanisms. In contrast, to avoid photo-oxidative damage, C. speciosa enhanced SOD activity, maintained POD and CAT activities, and increased xanthophyll cycle pool size and DPS and beta-carotene accumulation. These results indicate that G. ulmifolia is more sensitive to high irradiance than C. speciosa at early stages of development. Thus, C. speciosa is more appropriate for the reforestation of degraded areas with potential excess light or water deficit. In conclusion, this study provides a mechanistic basis of the tolerance abiotic stress in two tropical trees, thereby contributing for management strategies in reforestation projects.

TI  - Interactive effects of land use history and natural disturbance on seedling dynamics in a subtropical forest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Human-impacted forests are increasing in extent due to widespread regrowth of secondary forests on abandoned lands. The degree and speed of recovery from human disturbance in these forests will determine their value in terms of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem function. In areas subject to periodic, severe natural disturbances, such as hurricanes, it has been hypothesized that human and natural disturbance may interact to either erase or preserve land use legacies. To increase understanding of how interactions between human and natural disturbance influence forest regeneration and recovery, we monitored seedlings in a human-and hurricane-impacted forest in northeastern Puerto Rico over a; 10-yr period and compared seedling composition and dynamics in areas that had experienced high-and low-intensity human disturbance during the first half of the 20th century. We found that land use history significantly affected the composition and diversity of the seedling layer and altered patterns of canopy openness and seedling dynamics following hurricane disturbance. The area that had been subject to high-intensity land use supported a higher density, but lower diversity, of species. In both land use history categories, the seedling layer was dominated by the same two species, Prestoea acuminata var. montana and Guarea guidonia. However, seedlings of secondary-successional species tended to be more abundant in the high-intensity land use area, while late-successional species were more abundant in the low-intensity area, consistent with patterns of adult tree distributions. Seedlings of secondary-forest species showed greater increases in growth and survival following hurricane disturbance compared to late-successional species, providing support for the hypothesis that hurricanes help preserve the signature of land use history. However, the increased performance of secondary-forest species occurred predominantly in the low-intensity land use area, suggesting that hurricanes act to homogenize differences in species composition between areas with differing land use histories by increasing secondary-forest species regeneration in areas that experienced little direct human disturbance. Our results suggest that, through effects on seedling dynamics, hurricanes may extend the signature of land use history beyond the average recovery time of forests not subject to intense natural disturbance events.

TI  - Does soil variation between rainforest, pasture and different reforestation pathways affect the early growth of rainforest pioneer species?
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Rainforest deforestation and subsequent reforestation not only alter above-ground vegetation, but also lead to significant changes in the physical and chemical characteristics of soil and in biochemical cycles, which in turn are likely to influence the growth of rainforest plants However, little research has directly linked soil condition to seedling growth under different forms of rainforest restoration
   This study compared the early growth of three rainforest pioneer species (Alphitonia excelsa, Gutoa semiglauca, Omalanthus nutans) among soils collected from three different reforestation pathways, and from reference sites in remnant rainforest and pasture in subtropical eastern Australia. The types of reforestation were tree-planting for ecological restoration purposes, autogenic regrowth dominated by the non-native tree species camphor laurel (Cinnamomum camphora), and management of this regrowth to encourage native regeneration Growth was measured in a shade-house, using soil from five sites in each site-type and three replicate plants of each species Fifteen physical and biochemical properties were also measured in soil from each site; five of which were related to carbon and eight to nitrogen-dynamics
   Two-factor ANOVA of the exponential growth coefficients of seedling height and diameter showed that there was no interaction between tree species and site-type, but there were significant main effects of both these factors Seedling growth rates did not differ between pasture and rainforest soils, but were around 25% lower in soils from camphor-dominated regrowth sites than in soils from treated camphor and replanted sites Seedling growth rates were correlated with two independently-varying soil properties soil pH and plant-available nitrate-nitrogen, whose inclusion as covariates in the ANOVA largely removed the significant site-type effect. These results indicate that reforestation pathways can affect seedling growth by altering the physical and biochemical properties of soil. However, the absolute magnitude of this effect was not large. (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

TI  - Uncertainty in below-ground carbon biomass for major land covers in Southeast Asia
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Owing to difficulties associated with measuring root biomass accurately in space and time, below-ground root biomass is often calculated indirectly from above-ground biomass measurements via general allometric equations. Of concern is that general equations may not provide accurate site-specific calculations for accurate carbon stock assessments. This review comparing more than 100 root-related studies conducted in SE Asia shows highly variable and uncertain below-ground woody carbon (BGC) biomass estimates for many vegetation types associated with on-going land-use changes throughout the region. Most BGC data exist for Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand; only a few studies have been conducted for Brunei, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, Timor Leste and Vietnam. While substantial data exist for a variety of forests and timber-plantations, little work has focused on key transition land-covers including rubber, oil palm, swidden fallows, agroforests, grasslands, and croplands. Mangroves (12-219 Mg C ha(-1)), peat forests (11-71 Mg C ha(-1)) and other forest types (11-74 Mg C ha(-1)) have the highest BGC values. The limited data for rubber plantations (5-32 Mg C ha(-1)), oil palm plantations (4-22 Mg C ha(-1)), swidden fallows (3-16 Mg C ha(-1)), and non-swidden agroforestry (316 Mg C ha(-1)) indicate modest differences in the amount of BGC for several land covers that are at the heart of ongoing debates regarding the human and environmental impacts of agricultural intensification. The paucity of data currently in existence for the region highlights the need for additional field investigations following accepted protocols of root biomass to facilitate efforts to improve carbon stock estimates. Government agencies, private enterprises, and development agencies could help lead the way in developing a better forest carbon database by teaming with researchers to assess total ecosystem carbon stocks prior to vegetation being removed for construction, mining, or stand rotations.

TI  - Protection measures for the Araucaria Forest and their efficiency in the conservation of Araucaria angustifolia in southern Brazil
T2  - BOSQUE
AB  - Forests require sustainable management because of the long cycle of the species, the balance of the ecosystem, the structure or processes on which the species depend, and socioeconomic development. This study shows the effect of adopting protection measures (non-management and conservation) and their results on the forest structure of a Mixed Ombrophylous Forest, specifically for Araucaria angustifolia available in official publications and scientific articles. Bibliometric analysis was used to obtain and evaluate scientific publications based on their statistical methods, forest inventory techniques, modeling and, which contributed valuable information and scientific impact on the development of the topic. We argue that there are uncertainties about the threat of extinction and that lack of management may increase the disregard for forest resources. The losses of ecosystem services, economic structure, diversity, reproduction, and production of the forest due to non-use of resources are larger than the benefits. The results indicate the need for sustainable forest management as a public policy for the conservation of the species and the Mixed Ombrophilous Forest in southern Brazil.

TI  - Strong seasonal variations in net ecosystem CO2 exchange of a tropical pasture and afforestation in Panama
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - Pasture and afforestation are land-use types of major importance in the tropics, yet, most flux tower studies have been conducted in mature tropical forests. As deforestation in the tropics is expected to continue, it is critical to improve our understanding of alternative land-use types, and the impact of interactions between land use and climate on ecosystem carbon dynamics. Thus, we measured net ecosystem CO2 fluxes of a pasture and an adjacent tropical afforestation (native tree species plantation) in Sardinilla, Panama from 2007 to 2009. The objectives of our paired site study were: (1) to assess seasonal and inter-annual variations in net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) of pasture and afforestation, (2) to identify the environmental controls of net ecosystem CO2 fluxes, and (3) to constrain eddy covariance derived total ecosystem respiration (TER) with chamber-based soil respiration (R-Soil) measurements. We observed distinct seasonal variations in NEE that were more pronounced in the pasture compared to the afforestation, reflecting changes in plant and microbial activities. The land conversion from pasture to afforestation increased the potential for carbon uptake by trees vs. grasses throughout most of the year. R-Soil contributed about 50% to TER, with only small differences between ecosystems or seasons. Radiation and soil moisture were the main environmental controls of CO2 fluxes while temperature had no effect on NEE. The pasture ecosystem was more strongly affected by soil water limitations during the dry season, probably due to the shallower root system of grasses compared to trees. Thus, it seems likely that predicted increases in precipitation variability will impact seasonal variations of CO2 fluxes in Central Panama, in particular of pasture ecosystems.

TI  - Indigenous, colonist, and government impacts on Nicaragua's Bosawas reserve
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - We studied the impacts of colonists, two groups of indigenous residents (Miskitu and Mayangna), and management by the Nicaraguan Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARENA) on the forest of the Bosawas International Biosphere Reserve. Indigenous people and colonists subsist on the natural resources of the reserve, and MARENA is responsible for protecting the area from colonization and illicit exploitation. Using geostatistical procedures and Landsat images at three different time periods, we compared per capita deforestation and boundary stabilization in areas with colonists and areas with indigenous peoples. We also examined whether the Mayangna deforested less than the Miskitu and whether the Nicaraguan government has effectively defended the Bosawas boundary against the advance of the agricultural frontier. In addition, we analyzed the current distribution of land uses within the reserve and its contiguous indigenous areas with a supervised classification of current land cover. Indigenous demarcations protected the forest successfully, whereas the Bosawas boundary itself did not inhibit colonization and consequent deforestation. Indigenous farmers deforested significantly less per capita than colonists, and the two indigenous groups in Bosawas did not differ significantly in their effects on the forest. Our results show that indigenous common-property institutions and indigenous defense of homeland have been powerful factors in protecting the forests of Bosawas and that the difficult evolution of a nested cross-scale governance system in Bosawas-under pressure from indigenous peoples-is probably the key to the forest's survival thus far.

TI  - Reduction of mangrove carbon stock ecosystems due to illegal logging using a combination of unmanned aerial vehicle imagery and field surveys
T2  - GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Mangrove habitats play a vital role in the global carbon cycle, decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the effects of climate change. Satellite images and aerial photography have been widely utilized to map the dynamics of mangrove ecosystems. These photos were used as inputs for international policy agreements, including Indonesia, in defining regulations about carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere caused by deforestation and land use changes. This study aimed to map forest to identify deforested areas and assess the effect of illegal logging on mangrove forest carbon stocks in Lubuk Kertang Village, North Sumtera, Indonesia using unmanned aerial vehicle imagery and field. METHODS: Photometric data analysis was obtained from high-resolution satellite imagery using a da-Jiang innovations Phantom 4 Professional at 150 meters' altitude. Careful deployment of flight paths to obtain high accuracy in optimal image capture overlapped with 90 percent was conducted from August 5 to 8, 2023. Satellite imagery was captured in some areas considered important, such as rehabilitated mangrove forests and oil palm plantations. Both research sites produced orthophotos and digital surface models, and the integration of unmanned aerial vehicle with the photometry approach led to the development of the structure from motion method of data processing. FINDINGS: This study compared carbon stores in the mangrove forest of Lubuk Kertang Village in 2022 with carbon stock in 2023 or after the recurrence of illegal logging using an unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetric field survey. The distribution of aboveground biomass in the mangrove covers an area of 253.4 hectares with total carbon in 2022 of 15.819 megagrams per hectare. Meanwhile, in 2023, the aboveground biomass was 70.94 megagrams per hectare with total carbon of 8.927 megagrams per hectare. This study shows that the mangrove forest in Lubuk Kertang Village has lost around 56 percent from the previous year. CONCLUSION: Illegal logging poses a significant threat to carbon sequestration/stock lost. This phenomenon highlights the need for improved monitoring and conservation strategies. The combination of remote sensing techniques and field surveys offers a powerful tool for blue carbon inventories, mangrove conservation planning, and monitoring climate, community, and biodiversity projects in coastal ecosystems.

TI  - Safeguarding Local Communities for REDD plus Implementation in Ghana
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - In this study, we primarily assess the relationship between social safeguards and the living standards of local communities in different ecological zones of Ghana, relying on data from the seventh round of the Ghana Living Standard Survey (GLSS 7) and publicly available policy documents from the Ghana Statistical Service and the Forestry Commission of Ghana, respectively. This research aims to assist policymakers and stakeholders to make informed and appropriate decisions when developing social safeguards for emission reduction projects. The GLSS 7 covers 14,009 households, comprising 59,864 individuals in 892 enumeration areas or communities across the 10 regions of Ghana, now divided into 16. The data were collected using a stratified random sampling technique. Principal component analysis was employed to develop a living condition index, after which we generated a second construct based on the number of factors affecting living conditions. The results showed that access to sharecropping, literacy, extension services, financial institutions, a mobile phone network, and markets have significant positive relationships with the living conditions of local communities in Ghana. In addition, 78% of the social safeguards described in Ghana's REDD+ strategy, Forest and Wildlife Policy, Benefits Sharing Mechanism, and Forest Plantation Development Strategy are aligned with the determinants of local communities' living conditions. The findings suggest a need to enforce the Benefit Sharing Mechanism, better forest governance, and tenancy reforms in order to prevent the overexploitation of landowners and avoid elite capture. Furthermore, farmers must be linked to financial institutions in order to obtain credits. Additionally, we must seek to provide local communities with better access to markets and mobile phone networks in a way that allows them to carry out their livelihood activities effectively and efficiently. These measures help to reduce the risk of REDD+ actions and ensure sustainability.

TI  - Fire triggers reestablishment of invasive grasses in a neotropical savanna under restoration
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Excluding invasive grasses is a significant challenge for neotropical savanna restoration. Invasive grasses alter fire regimes with feedbacks on soil nutrient pools, favoring their own dominance over native species. Here we combine remote sensing with an opportunistic experiment to monitor a savanna under restoration before and after a large natural fire. We measured vegetation and soil fertility in a 4-year-old restoration area in Central Brazil, which was subsequently hit by a lightning fire. The restoration area was originally utilized as pasture, dominated by invasive grasses. Over the restoration period, native fast-growing grasses replaced the invasive species. Within the first year after the fire, we found that the fire had reduced aboveground biomass, species diversity, and abundance of native species with acquisitive resource-use strategies. Soil phosphorus and pH increased after the fire and favored the re-invasion of exotic grass species. Our findings suggest that fire occurrence early in the restoration process may trigger exotic grass re-invasion driven by soil nutrient enrichment. To diminish the re-invasion risk from exotic grasses in savannas undergoing restoration, managers should beware of the early fire or manage soil fertility after fire events. Successful restoration may also benefit by incorporating native species with high post-fire recovery capacity.

TI  - Home range and habitat use by pacas in a montane tropical forest in Bolivia
T2  - ACTA AMAZONICA
AB  - We studied the home range and habitat use of paca (Cuniculus paca) in a rural agricultural community in the Alto Beni region, in La Paz department, Bolivia, where game meat is the main source of protein for a large portion of local inhabitants. We captured and radio collared five individual paca (4 females and 1 male), which were followed for six months in 2012 to estimate home range of the individuals and assess their habitat use and selection. The total mean home range (95% Minimum Convex Polygon) was 2.26 ha (SD = 0.80), and ranged from 1.5 to 2.96 ha. The mean female home range (2.04 ha) was smaller than the male's (2.95 ha). Pacas used two (crops and fallows) of the three available habitats (secondary forest patches), and appeared to positively select crops over the other two. The importance of crops may be linked to the type of agriculture conducted in the area (i.e. mainly cacao in agroforestry systems), which may offer more food and shelter for pacas. Given that, the importance of habitats may change seasonally; this topic should be examined in future studies. Our results suggest that agroforestry systems may be important for the species since they offer a variety of food resources throughout the year.

TI  - Influence of soil and topography on aboveground biomass accumulation and carbon stocks of afforested pastures in South East Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - In light of the devastating loss of forest cover, biodiversity, and ecosystem services in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, people are endeavoring to restore this fragmented forest system. The afforestation of abandoned or degraded land is a practical approach to restore regional ecological functions and to sequester atmospheric carbon to help mitigate the global imbalance of atmospheric carbon associated with climate change. Large gaps, however, remain in understanding the dynamics of afforested tree communities. In this study, the effect of topographical relief and soil properties on growth performance of planted trees has been assessed. Above ground dry biomass (AGB(dry)) accumulation was estimated to evaluate the performance of afforested tree communities on formerly abandoned pastures at the Reserva Ecologica de Guapiacu, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The study revealed large discrepancies in AGBdry and respective organic carbon accumulationThe afforested tree community located on the sloped terrain stored only half the carbon (21.70 +/- 7.3 Mgha(-1)) that the planted trees on the flat terrain stored. (46.67 +/- 8.7 Mgha(-1)). Our results suggest that differences in tree growth performance are complex, depending largely on topography and related soil conditions. These circumstances should be considered to prevent misleading carbon sink estimates when developing regional strategies for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) that promote afforestation activities.

TI  - Evaluation of anthropogenic pressure on the occupancy patterns of large mammals in the Western and Eastern Ghats
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB  - Context Habitat loss limits the dispersal of wide-ranging large mammals. It is pivotal to study the ecological and anthropogenic factors driving the habitat occupancy of large mammals for their long-term conservation and reduction of negative human-wildlife interactions.Objective To evaluate how the habitat occupancy pattern of the large mammals varies across a gradient of anthropogenic pressures.Methods We conducted ecological sign surveys across nine forest divisions including, Protected Areas (PAs) and outside PAs, along the Western and Eastern Ghats of Tamil Nadu, India. We used systematic grid-based Markovian occupancy model to study the effect of ecological and anthropogenic variables (prey abundance, habitat features, direct human disturbance and habitat fragmentation) on tiger (Panthera tigris), leopard (Panthera pardus), dhole (Cuon alpinus), elephant (Elephas maximus) and gaur (Bos gaurus) occupancy at 100 km(2) scale.Results Tiger and dhole occupancy was driven by the abundance of large and medium-sized prey. However, leopards also relied on the available small prey species and utilised fragmented forest patches. Large mammal occupancy increased in contiguous forests with water availability and decreased in landscapes with increased human disturbances and habitat fragmentation. Tiger occupancy was highly confined towards contiguous PA network while the rest of them had scattered but concentrated occupancy towards PAs.Conclusions The dependency of large mammals on contiguous forests suggests improving the quality and connectivity of forested habitats for their dispersal and reducing negative human-wildlife interactions. The low occupancy areas require urgent habitat management intervention to reduce grazing pressure and restore degraded habitats to sustain viable large mammal population at landscape-level.

TI  - Who will win where and why? An ecophysiological dissection of the competition between a tropical pasture grass and the invasive weed Bracken over an elevation range of 1000 m in the tropical Andes
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - In tropical agriculture, the vigorously growing Bracken fern causes severe problems by invading pastures and out-competing the common pasture grasses. Due to infestation by that weed, pastures are abandoned after a few years, and as a fatal consequence, the biodiversity-rich tropical forest is progressively cleared for new grazing areas. Here we present a broad physiological comparison of the two plant species that are the main competitors on the pastures in the tropical Ecuadorian Andes, the planted forage grass Setaria sphacelata and the weed Bracken (Pteridium arachnoideum). With increasing elevation, the competitive power of Bracken increases as shown by satellite data of the study region. Using data obtained from field measurements, the annual biomass production of both plant species, as a measure of their competitive strength, was modeled over an elevational gradient from 1800 to 2800 m. The model shows that with increasing elevation, biomass production of the two species shifts in favor of Bracken which, above 1800 m, is capable of outgrowing the grass. In greenhouse experiments, the effects on plant growth of the presumed key variables of the elevational gradient, temperature and UV radiation, were separately analyzed. Low temperature, as well as UV irradiation, inhibited carbon uptake of the C4-grass more than that of the C3-plant Bracken. The less temperature-sensitive photosynthesis of Bracken and its effective protection from UV radiation contribute to the success of the weed on the highland pastures. In field samples of Bracken but not of Setaria, the content of flavonoids as UV-scavengers increased with the elevation. Combining modeling with measurements in greenhouse and field allowed to explain the invasive growth of a common weed in upland pastures. The performance of Setaria decreases with elevation due to suboptimal photosynthesis at lower temperatures and the inability to adapt its cellular UV screen.

TI  - Does REDD plus Complement Law Enforcement? Evaluating Impacts of an Incipient Initiative in Madre de Dios, Peru
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Subnational initiatives to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation and enhance carbon stocks (REDD+) have been implemented across the tropics over the last decade. Such initiatives are often embedded within pre-existing conservation policies, such as forest law enforcement, making it challenging to disentangle attributable impacts. In this article, we analyze a new REDD+ project implemented in Brazil nut concessions in the southeastern Peruvian Amazon. Public law enforcement to verify compliance with Peru's Forest Law was already ongoing and intensified locally during our study period. Thus, we combine longitudinal data from remote sensing and household surveys of 197 concessionaires in a before-after control-intervention (BACI) study design to: a) evaluate the project's impacts during the 2012-2018 period on deforestation, forest degradation, and the participants' wellbeing and b) assess how the law-enforcing field inspections may have complemented the project effects. Our results show that the REDD+ initiative had insignificant effects on deforestation and forest degradation, but confirm the curbing effects of the field inspection measures on forest loss. The non-significance of the REDD+ effects may reflect delays in cash incentive payments to enrolled concessionaires, lack of careful alignment of benefit provision with project participants, and limited enforcement of project conditionalities. Most REDD+ participants reported a reduced subjective wellbeing, which may reflect the frustrated expectations associated with project implementation. We discuss the implications of our results and outline lessons for similar tropical forest conservation initiatives.

TI  - Land use land cover change detection through geospatial analysis in an Indian Biosphere Reserve
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
AB  - The present study examines the land use land cover (LULC) and change detection impacts on forest ecosystem in Achanakmaar Amarkantak Biosphere Reserve (AABR - area 626.76 km(2)) of Central India. Results revealed that there has been a change in AABR land use pattern from 2008 to 2018. The major changes include loss of 19.72 km(2) of vegetation cover in various forest types due to increasing biotic interference and over grazing, conversion of 14.77 km(2) of Dense Sal mixed forest to open mixed forest and cultivable land, and 5.0 km(2) teak plantation and Bamboo brakes to agricultural land. Despite losing many plant species due to anthropogenic pressure, the present study found that the AABR as a unique repository of plant species rich in biodiversity. Many spots of this area are invaded or replaced by exotic species which is causing the loss of ecology and diversity of this region. Based on our study Sal mixed forest reduced by 2.88% (5.23 km(2)), Dense mixed forest 4.02% (9.54 km(2)), Teak plantation 6.77% (2.61 km(2)) and Bamboo brakes reduced by 7.66% (2.34 km(2)). The study concludes that the Landsat 7 TM and Resourcesat 2A satellite images are the most suitable for studying the LULC change on forest ecosystem of AABR. We advocate that by adopting the rigorous conservation measures, especially in open & dense forest and young under-stocked teak forests can restore the vegetation density and diversity in the area. Moreover, Sal natural regeneration of vegetation would remain crucial, and invasion of exotic species over native species needs to be restored in the forest area. Such findings on major changes occurring in forest ecosystem hold tremendous implications in relation to the welfare of the resource-poor tribal communities who are greatly dependent on the natural resources available in AABR for their livelihood.

TI  - Intensification and diversification of pasturelands in Brazil: Patterns and driving factors in the soil carbon stocks
T2  - CATENA
AB  - The extensive system of pasture management in Brazil can reduce soil C stocks and increase CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. However, the adoption of sustainable management systems can change these conditions and enact modern practices of natural resource management as defined by the concept of ecosystem services. A field study was therefore carried out to assess the effects of adopting more intensive and diversified systems of pasture management on the quality and stocks of soil C. Treatments included fertilized pasture (FP), integrated crop -livestock (ICL), and integrated livestock-forest (ILF) and were compared to conventional management systems (CS) under different soil and climate conditions (tropical humid, subtropical dry and subtropical humid). Soil carbon stocks and soil organic matter (SOM) fractions were determined in the top one-meter layer. With the SOM fractions, we calculated the C lability (LI), pool (CPI) and management (CMI) indices. The results showed that adopting ICL systems under the conditions of a tropical humid and subtropical humid climate produced increases in soil C stocks of 0.75 Mg ha-1 yr- 1 (P < 0.01) and 0.15 Mg ha-1 yr- 1 (P < 0.05), respectively, relative to the CS. Similarly, the conversion of a CS to FP (tropical humid climate) and ILF (subtropical dry climate) led to increases in soil C stocks of 2 and 0.55 Mg ha-1 yr- 1 (P < 0.05), respectively. In general, the adoption of more intensive and diversified systems of pasture management can also afford increases in the LI, CPI and CMI indices. These results can serve as a scientific basis for government initiatives that focus on recovering degraded pastures in Brazil through the use of more sustainable management systems and can also help to sequester more C in soils.

TI  - Selective logging emissions and potential emission reductions from reduced-impact logging in the Congo Basin
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - To estimate carbon emissions from selective logging in Central Africa, we employed the reduced-impact logging for carbon emissions reductions (RIL-C) protocol to quantify baseline carbon emissions from legal timber harvests by source (i.e., hauling, skidding, and felling). We modeled the relationships between emissions and biophysical conditions, logging practices, and forest policies and then used these models to estimate potential emission reductions from full implementation of RIL-C practices. We applied the method in 8 forest management enterprises (FMEs; i.e., concessions) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), 9 in Gabon, and 6 in the Republic of Congo (RoC). Committed logging emissions expressed per cubic meter of timber harvested (to control for differences in logging intensities) ranged from 0.63 Mg C m(-3) in a FME in RoC to 4.8 Mg C m(-3) in a FME in Gabon, with an overall average of 2.1 Mg C m(-3). Logging emissions were dominated by damage caused by road and log landing construction (i.e., hauling; 50%) and felling (43%; includes carbon in extracted logs). Total emissions represented only about 9% of unlogged forest biomass carbon stocks. Average emissions were highest in Gabon (2.65 Mg C m(-3)) followed by DRC (1.84 Mg C m(-3)) and RoC (1.54 Mg C m(-3)). Emissions from concessions certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC, N = 6) and those that were not certified (N = 17) did not differ. Nearly half (51%) of logging emissions could be avoided without reducing timber yields if all best examples of RIL-C logging practices observed were applied in the same FME. At the country level, if all FMEs were to utilize these practices, emissions reductions would be 34% in RoC, 45% in DRC, and 62% in Gabon. When combined with country-level logging statistics, emissions from selective logging as currently practiced in the six countries of the Congo Basin are equivalent to 40% of the region's total emissions from deforestation.

TI  - Forest biomass recovery after conventional and reduced-impact logging in Amazonian Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Growing concerns about unnecessarily destructive selective logging of tropical forests and its impacts on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions motivated this study on post-logging biomass dynamics over a 16-year period in a control plot and in plots subjected to conventional logging (CL) or reduced-impact logging (RIL) in Paragominas, Para State, Brazil. All trees >25 cm were monitored in 25.4 ha plots of each treatment, each with a subplot of 5.25 ha for trees >10 cm dbh. The commercial timber volumes in felled trees were 38.9 and 37.4 m(3) ha(-1) in the RIL and CL plots, respectively, but the extracted volumes were 38.6 and 29.7 m(3) ha(-1), respectively. Immediately after logging, plots subjected to RIL and CL lost 17% and 26% of their above-ground biomass, respectively. Over the 16 years after logging, the average annual increments in above-ground biomass (recruitment plus residual tree growth minus mortality) were 2.8 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) in the RIL plot but only 0.5 Mg ha(-1) year in the CL plot. By 16 years post-logging, the RIL plot recovered 100% of its original above-ground biomass while the CL plot recovered only 77%; over the same period, biomass in the control plot maintained 96% of its initial stock. These findings reinforce the claim that conversion from CL to RIL would represent an efficient forest-based strategy to mitigate climate change under the REDD+ and would be an important step towards sustainable forest management.

TI  - Developing Cost-Effective Field Assessments of Carbon Stocks in Human-Modified Tropical Forests
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Across the tropics, there is a growing financial investment in activities that aim to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, such as REDD+. However, most tropical countries lack on-the-ground capacity to conduct reliable and replicable assessments of forest carbon stocks, undermining their ability to secure long-term carbon finance for forest conservation programs. Clear guidance on how to reduce the monetary and time costs of field assessments of forest carbon can help tropical countries to overcome this capacity gap. Here we provide such guidance for cost-effective one-off field assessments of forest carbon stocks. We sampled a total of eight components from four different carbon pools (i.e. aboveground, dead wood, litter and soil) in 224 study plots distributed across two regions of eastern Amazon. For each component we estimated survey costs, contribution to total forest carbon stocks and sensitivity to disturbance. Sampling costs varied thirty-one-fold between the most expensive component, soil, and the least, leaf litter. Large live stems (>= 10 cm DBH), which represented only 15% of the overall sampling costs, was by far the most important component to be assessed, as it stores the largest amount of carbon and is highly sensitive to disturbance. If large stems are not taxonomically identified, costs can be reduced by a further 51%, while incurring an error in aboveground carbon estimates of only 5% in primary forests, but 31% in secondary forests. For rapid assessments, necessary to help prioritize locations for carbon-conservation activities, sampling of stems >= 20cm DBH without taxonomic identification can predict with confidence (R-2 = 0.85) whether an area is relatively carbon-rich or carbon-poor-an approach that is 74% cheaper than sampling and identifying all the stems >= 10cm DBH. We use these results to evaluate the reliability of forest carbon stock estimates provided by the IPCC and FAO when applied to human-modified forests, and to highlight areas where cost savings in carbon stock assessments could be most easily made.

TI  - Growth and drought resilience of four native tree species suitable for reforestation of Brazil's Atlantic Forest
T2  - FORESTRY
AB  - Deforestation of tropical forests has been a critical issue affecting climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation. Reforestation strives to remedy this situation, yet it is futile as long as deforestation of primary forests continues. Since deforestation is partly motivated by the demand for valuable tropical wood, reforestation should focus not only on planting native tree species, but specifically on a high diversity of native tree species with high-quality wood. However, the eco-physiological information required for growing such species is limited, and their resilience to drought events is unknown.Here, we focused on four native tropical wood tree species identified as suitable for Brazil's Atlantic Forest reforestation. Growth, carbon assimilation, water-use and xylem hydraulics were studied in seedlings of the two legume species Dalbergia nigra and Plathymenia foliolosa and the two non-legume species Cariniana legalis and Zeyheria tuberculosa. Seedlings were monitored weekly for 9 consecutive weeks, three to five weeks of which under induced drought. Growth and carbon assimilation were 25-65 per cent higher in the legume vs. non-legume species. In turn, non-legume species mostly avoided the drought by stomatal closure, producing a 50 per cent higher water-use efficiency (WUE) compared with the legume species. The average water potential at 50 per cent stomatal conductivity (?(gs50)) for legume species was -2.6 MPa, whereas for non-legume species it was -0.85 MPa. Still, each species showed a unique set of responses, indicating different growth strategies under mesic and xeric conditions. Our results indicate a divergence among legume and non-legume species, driven by a trade-off between plant productivity (carbon assimilation and growth) and plant safety (stomatal regulation and WUE). All in all, the four species of juvenile potted plants demonstrated a high capacity for recovery from drought, which supports their potential role in future reforestation under climate change.

TI  - Carbon Storage and Land-Use Strategies in Agricultural Landscapes across Three Continents
T2  - CURRENT BIOLOGY
AB  - The loss of carbon stocks through agricultural landuse change is a key driver of greenhouse gas emissions [1-4], and the methods used to manage agricultural landwill havemajor impacts on the global climate in the 21 st century [4-9]. It remains unresolvedwhether carbon losses would be minimized by increasing farm yields and limiting the conversion of natural habitats (''landsparing''), ormaximizingon-farmcarbonstocks, even at the costof reduced yields andtherefore greater habitat clearance (''landsharing''). In thispaper, weuse field surveys of over 11,000 trees, in-depth interviews with farmers, and existing agricultural data, to evaluate the potential impacts of these contrastingapproaches, and plausible intermediate strategies, on aboveground carbon stocks across a diverse range of agricultural and natural systems. Our analyses include agroforestry and oil palm plantations in the humid tropics of Ghana; cattle ranching in dry tropical forest in Mexico; and arable cropping in temperate wetlands and forests in Poland. Strikingly, despite the range of systems investigated, land sparing consistently had a higher potential to sustain regional above-ground carbon stocks than any other strategy. This was the case in all three regions and at all plausible levels of food production, including falls in demand. However, if agricultural production increases to meet likely future demand levels, we project large decreases in aboveground carbon stocks, regardless of land-use strategy. Our results strongly suggest that maintaining above-ground carbon stocks will depend on both limiting future food demand and minimizing agricultural expansion through linking high-yield farming with conserving or restoring natural habitats.

TI  - Evidence of Incipient Forest Transition in Southern Mexico
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Case studies of land use change have suggested that deforestation across Southern Mexico is accelerating. However, forest transition theory predicts that trajectories of change can be modified by economic factors, leading to spatial and temporal heterogeneity in rates of change that may take the form of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). This study aimed to assess the evidence regarding potential forest transition in Southern Mexico by classifying regional forest cover change using Landsat imagery from 1990 through to 2006. Patterns of forest cover change were found to be complex and nonlinear. When rates of forest loss were averaged over 342 municipalities using mixed-effects modelling the results showed a significant (p< 0.001) overall reduction of the mean rate of forest loss from 0.85% per year in the 1990-2000 period to 0.67% in the 2000-2006 period. The overall regional annual rate of deforestation has fallen from 0.33% to 0.28% from the 1990s to 2000s. A high proportion of the spatial variability in forest cover change cannot be explained statistically. However analysis using spline based general additive models detected underlying relationships between forest cover and income or population density of a form consistent with the EKC. The incipient forest transition has not, as yet, resulted in widespread reforestation. Forest recovery remains below 0.20% per year. Reforestation is mostly the result of passive processes associated with reductions in the intensity of land use. Deforestation continues to occur at high rates in some focal areas. A transition could be accelerated if there were a broader recognition among policy makers that the regional rate of forest loss has now begun to fall. The changing trajectory provides an opportunity to actively restore forest cover through stimulating afforestation and stimulating more sustainable land use practices. The results have clear implications for policy aimed at carbon sequestration through reducing deforestation and enhancing forest growth.

TI  - Voisin Rational Grazing as a Sustainable Alternative for Livestock Production
T2  - ANIMALS
AB  - Simple Summary To meet current global food supply challenges, researchers and technicians are searching for alternative livestock systems that promote highly sustainable animal productivity and farm profitability, while having a positive environmental footprint. In this narrative review, we highlight one such system, Voisin Rational Grazing (VRG). VRG is a regenerative livestock farming system proposed by French scientist Andre Voisin in the 1950s and further developed in Brazil in the 1970s. VRG has been applied in many countries with vastly different ecosystems. Like other regenerative systems, VRG provides a range of ecosystem services, including negative net carbon emission, reduced soil erosion, and increased biodiversity. Because VRG is also focused on animal performance, farmers applying VRG are more resilient against the adversities confronting farmers practicing more conventional farming systems. VRG requires a paradigm shift from the farmers and thus its uptake may be hindered if there is not enough support within the community. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of VRG, along with its benefits and constraints. Current livestock practices do not meet current real-world social and environmental requirements, pushing farmers away from rural areas and only sustaining high productivity through the overuse of fossil fuels, causing numerous environmental side effects. In this narrative review, we explore how the Voisin Rational Grazing (VRG) system responds to this problem. VRG is an agroecological system based on four principles that maximise pasture growth and ruminant intake, while, at the same time, maintaining system sustainability. It applies a wide range of regenerative agricultural practices, such as the use of multispecies swards combined with agroforestry. Planning allows grazing to take place when pastures reach their optimal resting period, thus promoting vigorous pasture regrowth. Moreover, paddocks are designed in a way that allow animals to have free access to water and shade, improving overall animal welfare. In combination, these practices result in increased soil C uptake and soil health, boost water retention, and protect water quality. VRG may be used to provide ecosystem services that mitigate some of the current global challenges and create opportunities for farmers to apply greener practices and become more resilient. It can be said that VRG practitioners are part of the initiatives that are rethinking modern livestock agriculture. Its main challenges, however, arise from social constraints. More specifically, local incentives and initiatives that encourage farmers to take an interest in the ecological processes involved in livestock farming are still lacking. Little research has been conducted to validate the empirical evidence of VRG benefits on animal performance or to overcome VRG limitations.

TI  - Conservation and development projects in the Brazilian Amazon: Lessons from the community initiative program in Rondonia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Community-based conservation and development has become the prevailing programmatic paradigm of conservation organizations and development donors over the last 20 years, spawning a myriad of integrated conservation and development projects (ICDP) around the world. Appealing for its ambitious aspiration to harmonize sustainable economic development at the local level with the conservation of legally established protected areas (e.g., parks and reserves), the ICDP approach recently has drawn criticism from conservation biologists for failing to ensure adequate protection of biodiversity. Development planners and economists have also raised questions about the financial sustainability of ICDPs in practice and the replicability of the model from highly local contexts to larger regional scales, This paper briefly reviews the central elements of the concept of integrated conservation and development and the emerging debate over its effectiveness, A description of the Community Initiative Program (CIP), a pilot program of the Rondonia Natural Resources Management project (PLANAFLORO) in the western Brazilian Amazon state of Rondonia, follows. The CIP is a significant experiment because it boldly attempted to apply the principles of ICDP to the regional scale involving numerous different communities in one program simultaneously. Based on the author's mid-term review of the CIP in 1999, the development and conservation impacts of the program are considered. While the CIP has not significantly curbed the degradation of protected areas in Rondonia as intended, the evidence suggests lower rates of deforestation in municipios (i.e. counties) with the highest concentrations of CIP projects, Although the economic development impacts are mixed, approximately 50% of the projects delivered tangible benefits to local communities. Lessons learned from the CIP are presented in the final section. Among the lessons learned from the CIP, detailed in the final section, are several that will be familiar to other ICDP evaluators: the importance of thematic coherence in initial project design, the need for explicit attention on environmental conservation objectives, deficient institutional capacity of implementing organizations, inadequate attention to women's concerns and roles in community projects, and lack of technical criteria for measuring project sustainability.

TI  - The importance of grain and cut-off size in shaping tree beta diversity along an elevational gradient in the northwest of Colombia
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Background Species turnover (beta-diversity) along elevational gradients is one of the most important concepts in plant ecology. However, there is a lack of consensus about the main driving mechanisms of tree beta-diversity at local scales in very diverse ecosystems (e.g., Andean mountains), as well as how the sampling effect can alter beta-diversity estimations. Recently, it has been hypothesized that patterns of change in beta-diversity at local scales along elevational gradients are driven by sampling effects stemming from differences in the size of the species pool rather than by underlying community assembly mechanisms. Thus, we aim to evaluate the relative extent to which sampling effects, such as species pool size, grain size, and tree size cut-off, determine species sorting, and thus, the variability of beta-diversity at local scales along elevational gradients in the northwest of Colombia. Results Using 15 1-ha permanent plots spread out along a 3000 m elevational gradient, we used standardized beta-deviation to assess the extent to which either sampling effects or the community assembly mechanisms determine the changes in species composition at local scales. Standardized beta-deviation was measured as the difference between the observed and null beta-diversity divided by the standard deviation of the null beta-diversity. We found that the magnitude of change in local beta-deviation along the elevational gradient was significant and dependent on the employed spatial grain size and tree size cut-off. However, beta-deviation increased with elevation in all sampling designs, which suggests that underlying community assembly mechanisms play a key role in shaping local beta-diversity along the elevational gradient. Conclusions Our findings suggest that grain size enlargement and the inclusion of trees with small diameters will improve our ability to quantify the extent to which the community assembly mechanisms shape patterns of beta-diversity along elevational gradients. Overall, we emphasize the scale-dependent nature of the assessment of beta-diversity. Likewise, we call for the need of a new generation of enlarged forest inventory plots along gradients of elevation in tropical forests that include small individuals to improve our understanding about the likely response of diversity and function to global change.

TI  - Estimating Aboveground Biomass of Two Different Forest Types in Myanmar from Sentinel-2 Data with Machine Learning and Geostatistical Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The accurate estimation of spatially explicit forest aboveground biomass (AGB) provides an essential basis for sustainable forest management and carbon sequestration accounting, especially in Myanmar, where there is a lack of data for forest conservation due to operational limitations. This study mapped the forest AGB using Sentinel-2 (S-2) images and Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) based on random forest (RF), stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) and Kriging algorithms in two forest reserves (Namhton and Yinmar) in Myanmar, and compared their performance against AGB measured by the traditional methods. Specifically, a suite of forest sample plots were deployed in the two forest reserves, and forest attributes were measured to calculate the plot-level AGB based on allometric equations. The spectral bands, vegetation indices (VIs) and textures derived from processed S-2 data and topographic parameters from SRTM were utilized to statistically link with field-based AGB by implementing random forest (RF) and stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) algorithms. Followed by an evaluation of the algorithmic performances, RF-based Kriging (RFK) models were employed to determine the spatial distribution of AGB as an improvement of accuracy against RF models. The study's results showed that textural measures produced from wavelet analysis (WA) and vegetation indices (VIs) from Sentinel-2 were the strongest predictors for evergreen forest reserve (Namhton) AGB prediction and spectral bands and vegetation indices (VIs) showed the highest sensitivity to the deciduous forest reserve (Yinmar) AGB prediction. The fitted models were RF-based ordinary Kriging (RFOK) for Namhton forest reserve and RF-based co-Kriging (RFCK) for Yinmar forest reserve because their respective R-2, whilst the RMSE values were validated as 0.47 and 24.91 AGB t/ha and 0.52 and 34.72 AGB t/ha, respectively. The proposed random forest Kriging framework provides robust AGB maps, which are essential to estimate the carbon sequestration potential in the context of REDD+. From this particular study, we suggest that the protection/disturbance status of forests affects AGB values directly in the study area; thus, community-participated or engaged forest utilization and conservation initiatives are recommended to promote sustainable forest management.

TI  - Coupled forest zoning and agricultural intervention yields conflicting outcomes for tropical forest conservation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Agricultural intensification and forest conservation are often seen as incompatible. Agricultural interventions can help boost food security for poor rural communities but in certain cases can exacerbate deforestation, known as the rebound effect. We tested whether coupling agricultural interventions with participatory forest zoning could improve food security and promote forest conservation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Simple agricultural interventions led to a >60% increase in cassava yields and a spill-over effect of improved cassava variety uptake in non-intervention zones. Household surveys conducted at the end of the 8 year project implementation period revealed that households that received agricultural interventions had more favorable attitudes toward forest zoning and conservation. The surveys also showed that farmers in the intervention domain practiced less land-intensive field and fallow management strategies compared to those practiced in the non-intervention domain. However, an 18 year time series analysis of Landsat satellite data revealed that agricultural expansion persisted in areas both with and without intervention assistance, and there is risk of a rebound effect. Approximately 70% of the tree cover loss that occurred outside of the agricultural areas was located within a 3 km buffer zone surrounding the outermost edges of the agricultural areas, which suggested that the majority of tree cover loss was caused by agricultural expansion. Within that 3 km buffer, average annual tree cover loss during the post-intervention period was higher in the intervention domain compared to the non-intervention domain (0.17% yr(-1) compared to 0.11% yr(-1) respectively, p < 0.001), suggesting risk of a rebound effect. The disconnection between household perceptions of zoning adherence and actual behavior indicates the importance of strengthening governance structures for community-based monitoring and enforcement.

TI  - Degradation of tropical forest in Hainan, China, 1991-2008: Conservation implications for Hainan Gibbon (Nomascus hainanus)
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - The Hainan gibbon (Nomascus hainanus) is one of the most endangered primates in the world, confined to mature natural forest in Hainan Island, China. We assessed changes in habitat condition on the island between 1991 and 2008, using vegetation maps generated by remote-sensing images. We defined forest suitable for gibbons based on composition, tree size and canopy cover. During the 17-year period, the area of suitable gibbon forest decreased by 540 km(2) (35%) across the whole island, and by 6.3 km(2) (7%) in the locality of the sole remaining gibbon population at Bawangling National Nature Reserve. The forest patches large enough (>1 km(2)) to support a gibbon group decreased from 754 km(2) to 316 km(2) in total area, and from 92 to 64 in number. Suitable natural forest was mainly replaced by plantations below 760 m, or degraded by logging, grazing and planting of pines above 760 m. Meanwhile, forests in former confirmed gibbon areas became more fragmented: mean area of patches decreased by 53%. We mapped the patches of natural forest in good condition which could potentially support gibbons. We recommend a freeze on further expansion of plantations between core patches at Bawangling, Jiaxi-Houmiling and Yinggeling Nature Reserves in accordance with forest protection regulations; establishment of nature reserves in currently unprotected natural forest patches elsewhere in line with the local government's nature reserve expansion policy; and active natural-forest restoration between remaining fragments at Bawangling.

TI  - Modelling Spatial and Temporal Forest Cover Change Patterns (1973-2020): A Case Study from South Western Ghats (India)
T2  - SENSORS
AB  - This study used time series remote sensing data from 1973, 1990 and 2004 to assess spatial forest cover change patterns in the Kalakad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve (KMTR), South Western Ghats (India). Analysis of forest cover changes and its causes are the most challenging areas of landscape ecology, especially due to the absence of temporal ground data and comparable space platform based data. Comparing remotely sensed data from three different sources with sensors having different spatial and spectral resolution presented a technical challenge. Quantitative change analysis over a long period provided a valuable insight into forest cover dynamics in this area. Time-series maps were combined within a geographical information system (GIS) with biotic and abiotic factors for modelling its future change. The land-cover change has been modelled using GEOMOD and predicted for year 2020 using the current disturbance scenario. Comparison of the forest change maps over the 31-year period shows that evergreen forest being degraded (16%) primarily in the form of selective logging and clear felling to raise plantations of coffee, tea and cardamom. The natural disturbances such as forest fire, wildlife grazing, invasions after clearance and soil erosion induced by anthropogenic pressure over the decades are the reasons of forest cover change in KMTR. The study demonstrates the role of remote sensing and GIS in monitoring of large-coverage of forest area continuously for a given region over time more precisely and in cost-effective manner which will be ideal for conservation planning and prioritization.

TI  - The impact of land use on the acoustic behaviour of cicadas in the Chocó lowland tropical forest of Ecuador
T2  - INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY
AB  - The biodiversity of tropical rainforests is under extreme pressure due to the expansion of agricultural land. Beyond the immediate risk of species extinction, the intensification of land use can alter species' behaviour with consequences for the entire ecosystem. In this study we investigated the impact of land use on the acoustic behaviour of cicadas in the highly biodiverse Ecuadorian Choc & oacute; region. We used passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) for the collection of audio data, from which we identified and analysed the sound activity of cicadas and the structure of daily patterns along a chronosequence of forest recovery. At landscape scale we studied the impact of a surrounding either dominated by agricultural land use or forests on the acoustic behaviour of cicadas. Cicada sound activity was significantly lower in active agriculture compared to undisturbed old-growth forest and increased along the forest recovery gradient. The diurnal pattern changed from simple in active agriculture to more complex and highly synchronized along the recovery gradient towards old-growth forests. A surrounding dominated by agricultural land use additionally reduced the sound activity of cicadas and simplified the diurnal pattern in old-growth forests. Taken together, agricultural land use at local and landscape scales affects overall activity, diurnal patterns and synchrony of vocalizing song cicadas. This is a concerning trend considering the direct link between chorusing and fitness for cicadas. However, mature restoration forests embedded in forest dominated landscape surroundings showed restored cicada song behaviours similar to those of old-growth forests, which underlines the conservation value of advanced secondary forests and the importance to support forest regeneration in the tropics.

TI  - Too rare for non-timber resource harvest? Meso-scale composition and distribution of arborescent palms in an Amazonian sustainable-use forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Arborescent palms can provide an important source of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) within tropical forest REDD+ frameworks. To identify the NTFP potential of arborescent palms, we examined mesoscale patterns of abundance and distribution within a sustainable-use protected area in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. To understand the environmental correlates of observed patterns we evaluated the effects of topography, hydrography and geographic space on the presence, density and biomass of adult arborescent palms. Adult palms were sampled in 30 (250 x 20 m) plots systematically distributed within a 25-km(2) grid. Topographic and hydrographic variables were derived from a remotely sensed digital elevation model. Spatial correlations in the explanatory and response variables were examined using Mantel tests and GLMs. To test for evidence of dispersal limitation, semi-variograms were used to examine spatial patterns in GLM residuals. Adult arborescent palms were rare occurring in only 12 of the 30 plots. In total, we recorded 118 individuals from six species (Bactris maraja, Euterpe oleracea, Iriartella setigera, Oenocarpus bacaba, Oenocarpus bataua and Oenocarpus minor). This corresponded to a mean live above-ground biomass per plot of 0.85 Mg ha(-1) (range: 0-28.1 Mg ha(-1)). Hydrographic and topographic variables suggest that environmental conditions are suitable for E. oleracea, an economically important species. The presence, biomass, and density of palms were uncorrelated with geographic distances among plots. The hydrographic model significantly explained variation in palm presence and biomass, whereas density was only explained by the topographic model. Our findings indicate that arborescent palms are currently too rare to be efficiently harvested as NTFPs in the study area. Yet, comparisons with published estimates suggest that there is significant potential for agroforestry to facilitate the commercialization of palm NTFPs for community based extractive activities.

TI  - The development of a forestry geodatabase for natural forest management plans in Costa Rica
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Forest management data is available for many tropical countries, representing a large and spatially rich source of tree level data. Over the past decade, we have collected and digitized over 1000 Costa Rican natural forest management plans, spanning 30 years and spread out over approximately 26,700 km(2) along the country's Atlantic coast, northern lowlands, and southern Pacific coast. In order to analyze this unique collection of tree inventory data we developed a system to ensure the standardization, quality control, and reliable management of the dataset. We developed a relational geodatabase, forming logical associations between and within the spatial and tabular components of the forest management data. In this study, we outline the data standardization procedures established to permit the comparison of data across time and space. Further, we describe quality checks built-into the database's functionality to identify and reduce the presence of errors. The final customized forest management geodatabase efficiently stores a large and diverse dataset through the integration of logical relations, quality checks, and flexible data access across 32 tables and over 250,000 tree records. Through the use of quality tests, the database provides a means to improve overall data integrity and illustrates the magnitude, sources, and types of errors present in the initial dataset. Finally, the value of a comprehensive database for the management of forest data is demonstrated through an exploratory analysis of standardized tree taxonomic information. With this analysis, we begin to explore the potential strengths, weaknesses, and applications of forest management data for future ecological studies (e.g. species diversity assessment). For instance, although most of the forest management data (tree inventories and censuses) is collected using common names in the field, our standardization process has allowed us to depict trends similar to those found in ecological studies (e.g. dominant species for different ecosystems). Overall, our forestry geodatabase represents the most complete record of natural forest management practices in Costa Rica to date. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Lessons learned from 25 years of operational large-scale restoration: The Sow-A-Seed project, Sabah, Borneo
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - While restoration projects globally scale-up to meet the growing demand to restore degraded ecosystems, data on the long-term benefits of restoration are still rare. Here, we describe the lessons learned from the Sow-A-Seed project in Sabah, Borneo: a long-term and large-scale restoration project launched in 1998 with the aim to rehabilitate 18,500 ha of tropical rainforest degraded by logging and forest fires. The project was built from the ground-up, including establishment of essential infrastructure and knowledge creation via trial-and-error. Three restoration techniques were used depending on the level of degradation; 1) Assisted Natural Regeneration (weeding, climber cutting and selective girdling) to promote natural regeneration of late-successional species in the least disturbed forests, and; 2) Enrichment Planting in gap-clusters in moderately disturbed forests, and; 3) Enrichment Planting in rows (i.e, line-planting) throughout heavily degraded forests with no- or few late successional tree species in the overstory. The project includes successful propagation of 92 native tree species including dipterocarps and fruit trees, and planting of over 5 million trees during the last 25 years. Long-term monitoring shows that the mortality rate of planted seedlings is -15% per year up to 3 years, but decreases to -2% between years 3-10 and 10-20. One of the largest trees, a Shorea leprosula planted in 1998, is now 74 cm in DBH and some planted trees have reached reproductive age and are contributing to natural regeneration. A range of wildlife including orangutans, elephants, hornbills and all five wildcat species in Sabah have been documented in the area. In 2015, the area was classified as a Class 1 protected forest, the highest level of conservation status in Malaysia, and removed from commercial forestry. We highlight that there is much knowledge to be gained by research dove-tailing with operational activities, and we encourage that the lessons learned from operational restoration are shared among practitioners and restoration ecologists. We present 8 key lessons learned from the Sow-a-Seed project.

TI  - Allometric relationships and reforestation guidelines for Maclura tinctoria, an important multi-purpose timber tree of Latin America
T2  - NEW FORESTS
AB  - As reforestation and restoration processes gain momentum across the world native tree species are being established for production, conservation and restoration purposes in agricultural landscapes. One such tree with promise is dinde [Maclura tinctoria (L.) D. Don ex Steud]; a multi-purpose, Neotropical tree species that is being widely introduced on to farms of the coffee axis region in the Latin American Andes. No formal studies have been made that examine its potential for reforestation. In this study we aim to measure and define the relationships between age, bole size (dbh), tree height, and crown size of planted dinde trees for the development of spacing guidelines at time of planting and for thinning. We also sought to identify whether tree growth is influenced by various measures of soil fertility. We studied these relationships on dinde trees planted at twelve farms in the central Andean foothills of Colombia. Our results are the first to show dinde has comparable growth to other native and exotic trees used for reforestation in Latin America. Strong relationships exist for tree age and diameter at breast height (DBH) with crown size and height. Based on these relationships we developed spacing and thinning guidelines for timber production in plantation and silvo-pastoral circumstances. Soils were generally fertile but varied between farms. Growth varied with soil primarily related to pH and calcium, and secondly to soil nitrogen and organic matter. Our results provide preliminary information for the forester and/or the farmer on expected growth and size relationships for given ages in relation to soil fertility for planted trees. As more trees are planted on a wider array of soils and providing a greater diversity of ages further studies are necessary for refining guidelines.

TI  - Impact of Fire on Secondary Forest Succession in a Sub-Tropical Landscape
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - In Hong Kong, as in many tropical areas, grasslands are maintained by fire on disturbed and abandoned land. However, Hong Kong's native forests are regenerating in many areas, alongside frequent burning of the hillsides, and are in different stages of structural succession to closed canopy forest patches. Understanding the major determinants of secondary succession is a vital input to forest management policies. Given the importance of forests for biodiversity conservation, watershed protection and carbon cycling. This study examines the relationship between burning regimes and structural forest succession over 42 years from 1973 to 2015, using an archive of satellite images, aerial photographs and field plot data. Overlay of a fire frequency map with maps of forest structural classes at different dates indicates the number of fires undergone by each successional class as well as the time taken to progress from one class to another under different fire regimes. Results indicate that the native sub-tropical evergreen forests, which are naturally fire intolerant, can regenerate alongside moderate burning, and once the shrub stage is reached, succession to closed forest is relatively rapid and can occur within 13 years. More than one burn, however, is more destructive, and twice-burnt areas were seen to have only one-third of the woody biomass of once-burnt plots. The most frequent fires occurred in areas where mono-cultural plantations had been destroyed by disease in the 1960s and were subsequently invaded by grasslands. These former plantation areas remained in early successional stages of grass and open shrubland by 2015. Other plantations from the 1970s and 1980s remain as plantations today and have acted as a barrier to natural forest succession, attesting to the greater effectiveness of fire control over re-afforestation measures.

TI  - Post-Crackdown Effectiveness of Field-Based Forest Law Enforcement in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Regulatory enforcement of forest conservation laws is often dismissed as an ineffective approach to reducing tropical forest loss. Yet, effective enforcement is often a precondition for alternative conservation measures, such as payments for environmental services, to achieve desired outcomes. Fair and efficient policies to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) will thus crucially depend on understanding the determinants and requirements of enforcement effectiveness. Among potential REDD candidate countries, Brazil is considered to possess the most advanced deforestation monitoring and enforcement infrastructure. This study explores a unique dataset of over 15 thousand point coordinates of enforcement missions in the Brazilian Amazon during 2009 and 2010, after major reductions of deforestation in the region. We study whether local deforestation patterns have been affected by field-based enforcement and to what extent these effects vary across administrative boundaries. Spatial matching and regression techniques are applied at different spatial resolutions. We find that field-based enforcement operations have not been universally effective in deterring deforestation during our observation period. Inspections have been most effective in reducing large-scale deforestation in the states of Mato Grosso and Para, where average conservation effects were 4.0 and 9.9 hectares per inspection, respectively. Despite regional and actor-specific heterogeneity in inspection effectiveness, field-based law enforcement is highly cost-effective on average and might be enhanced by closer collaboration between national and state-level authorities.

TI  - Does the intervention of regional authorities contribute to sustainable mangrove ecotourism? Case study on mangrove management at Karansong, West Java, Indonesia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS
AB  - Mangrove ecotourism, as one of the tools for mangrove forest conservation, indeed has a large impact on the protection of mangrove forests. This paper assesses the intervention of local authorities in the management of mangrove ecotourism by the local community. This paper used a qualitative method with in-depth interviews, using local communities' involvement, including local leaders, local resource users, and local authorities. This paper's findings show that the intervention of local authorities in mangrove rehabilitation management can cause a threat to mangrove sustainability in terms of environmental protection. The involvement of the community in the mangrove ecotourism management has become indeed remarkable. The government's intervention in the mangrove ecotourism management through a policy believed to reduce community participation. Co-management is an approach to engaging the community in mangrove management can mediate the management conflict between the local community and the government. Furthermore, the development of the relevant policy is necessary following the successful implementation of the community-based mangrove rehabilitation and preservation of mangrove forests as part of environmental protection.

TI  - Simplification of a coffee foliage-dwelling beetle community under low-shade management
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Coffee agroforests may be structurally and floristically complex and may contain a significant fraction of species from biodiverse and threatened tropical montane forest biotas; hence, understanding the dynamics of tropical forest biodiversity in coffee agroecosystems has emerged as a centrally important area of tropical conservation biology research. We conducted a morphospecies analysis on foliage-dwelling beetles collected from coffee plants on four coffee farms in southern Chiapas, Mexico, to characterize variation in the abundance, species richness, and species composition of this mega-diverse taxon in relation to coffee cultivation system, spatio-temporal variation, and predator removal. We constructed thirty-two cages to exclude birds and bats on four farms, each enclosing 7-10 coffee plants and paired with an adjacent uncaged control plot, and then collected beetles from coffee foliage with D-Vac aspirators in each plot once every 3 months for one year.
   We classified the 2662 beetles collected into 293 morphospecies, representing 42 families of beetles. Extrapolation and interpolation analyses revealed a very high level of species richness, with no plateau and only a slight leveling trend observed in our species accumulation curves. We found that low-shade systems contain equal or higher beetle abundance, lower species richness, more highly homogenized species composition, and higher abundance of coffee berry borer pests on coffee foliage than do high-shade systems. We observed no effect of flying vertebrate exclusion on the coffee foliage beetle assemblage, but did find significant variation in abundance, species richness, and species composition of coffee foliage beetles across seasons and Study sites.
   The increased beetle biodiversity of high-shade coffee cultivation systems has important implications both for the preservation of native biodiversity in coffee growing regions and for the control of agricultural pests such as the coffee berry borer.

TI  - Fragmentation and matrix contrast favor understory plants through negative cascading effects on a strong competitor palm
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Understanding the patterns and processes driving biodiversity maintenance in fragmented tropical forests is urgently needed for conservation planning, especially in species-rich forest reserves. Of particular concern are the effects that habitat modifications at the landscape scale may have on forest regeneration and ecosystem functioning: a topic that has received limited attention. Here, we assessed the effects of landscape structure (i.e., forest cover, open area matrices, forest fragmentation, and mean inter-patch isolation distance) on understory plant assemblages in the Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve, Mexico. Previous studies suggest that the demographic burst of the strong competitor palm Astrocaryum mexicanum in the core area of this reserve limits plant recruitment and imperils biodiversity conservation within this protected area. Yet, the local and landscape predictors of this palm, and its impact on tree recruitment at a regional scale are unknown. Thus, we used structural equationmodeling to assess the direct and cascading effects of landscape structure on stem and species density in the understory of 20 forest sites distributed across this biodiversity hotspot. Indirect paths included the effect of landscape structure on tree basal area (a proxy of local disturbance), and the effects of these variables on A. mexicanum. Density of A. mexicanum mainly increased with decreasing both fragmentation and open areas in the matrix (matrix contrast, hereafter), and such an increase in palm density negatively affected stem and species density in the understory. The negative direct effect of matrix contrast on stem density was overridden by the indirect positive effects (i.e., through negative cascading effects on A. mexicanum), resulting in a weak effect of matrix contrast on stem density. These findings suggest that dispersal limitation and negative edge effects in more fragmented landscapes dominated by open areas prevent the proliferation of this palm species, enhancing the diversity and abundance of understory trees. This "positive" news adds to an increasing line of evidence suggesting that fragmentation may have some positive effects on biodiversity, in this case by preventing the proliferation of species that can jeopardize biodiversity conservation within tropical reserves.

AB  - Combining protected areas with natural forest timber concessions may sustain larger forest landscapes than is possible via protected areas alone. However, the role of timber concessions in maintaining natural forest remains poorly characterized. An estimated 57% (303,525 km(2)) of Kalimantan's land area (532,100 km(2)) was covered by natural forest in 2000. About 14,212 km(2) (4.7%) had been cleared by 2010. Forests in oil palm concessions had been reduced by 5,600 km(2) (14.1%), while the figures for timber concessions are 1,336 km(2) (1.5%), and for protected forests are 1,122 km(2) (1.2%). These deforestation rates explain little about the relative performance of the different land use categories under equivalent conversion risks due to the confounding effects of location. An estimated 25% of lands allocated for timber harvesting in 2000 had their status changed to industrial plantation concessions in 2010. Based on a sample of 3,391 forest plots (161 km; 100 ha), and matching statistical analyses, 2000-2010 deforestation was on average 17.6 ha lower (95% C. I.: -22.3 ha--212.9 ha) in timber concession plots than in oil palm concession plots. When location effects were accounted for, deforestation rates in timber concessions and protected areas were not significantly different (Mean difference: 0.35 ha; 95% C. I.: -0.002 ha-0.7 ha). Natural forest timber concessions in Kalimantan had similar ability as protected areas to maintain forest cover during 2000-2010, provided the former were not reclassified to industrial plantation concessions. Our study indicates the desirability of the Government of Indonesia designating its natural forest timber concessions as protected areas under the IUCN Protected Area Category VI to protect them from reclassification.

TI  - Phylogenetic age is positively correlated with sensitivity to timber harvest in bornean mammals
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - The reasons that forest vertebrates differ in their response to selective timber extraction in tropical forests remain poorly characterized. Understanding what determines response and sensitivity can indicate how forest management might yield greater conservation benefits, and help us identify which lesser-known species may be especially vulnerable. We assessed the response of 41 Bornean mammals to selective timber harvest and tested eight hypotheses regarding the correlation between those responses and a range of species characteristics. Multivariate analyses show that phylogenetic species age is a key variable determining sensitivity. Older species are less able to cope with the effects of selective timber harvest. Most of these species are endemic to insular southeast Asia, and do not occur on the Asian mainland. These species are more specialized, and appear less able to cope with habitat change. In contrast, species tolerant to logging evolved more recently. This group tends to be omnivorous or herbivorous, to use all vegetation strata, and to be regionally widespread. This finding allows the sensitivity to habitat disturbance of lesser-known species to be predicted, and therefore has important conservation implications. These new insights also help in the design of large-scale forest landscapes that combine sustainable forest management and species conservation requirements. We recognize that these functions can be compatible, but that some species still need completely protected areas for their survival.

TI  - Household land management and biodiversity: Secondary succession in a forest-agriculture mosaic in southern Mexico
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - This study evaluates anthropogenic and ecological dimensions of secondary forest succession in Mexico's southern Yucatan peninsular region, a hotspot of biodiversity and tropical deforestation. Secondary succession in particular constitutes an ecologically and economically important process, driven by and strongly influencing land management and local ecosystem structure and dynamics. As agents of local land management, smallholding farmers in communal, i.e., ejido lands affect rates of forest change, biodiversity, and sustainability within and beyond their land parcels. This research uses household surveys and land parcel mapping in two ejidos located along the buffer of the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve to analyze how household socioeconomics and policy institutions drive allocations to successional forests in traditional crop fallows and in enriched fallows. Results indicate that household tenancy, livestock holdings, labor-consumer ratios, and receipts of agricultural subsidies are the strongest determinants of traditional fallow areas. Whereas the latter two factors also influence enriched successions, local agroforestry and reforestation programs were the strongest drivers of fallow enrichment. Additionally, the study conducts field vegetation sampling in a nested design within traditional and enriched fallow sites to comparatively assess biodiversity consequences of fallow management. Although enriched fallows display greater species richness in 10x10 m plots and 2x2 m quadrats, plot-scale data reveal no significant differences in Shannon-Wiener or Simpson's diversity indices. Traditional fallows display greater species heterogeneity at the quadrat scale, however, indicating a complex relationship of diversity to fallow management over time. The article discusses the implications of the social and ecological analyses for land change research and conservation policies.

TI  - Tree performance in a biodiversity enrichment experiment in an oil palm landscape
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Large-scale conversion of tropical forests into oil palm monocultures has led to dramatic losses of biodiversity and ecosystem functions. While ecological restoration is urgently needed in many oil palm landscapes, there is a lack of scientific knowledge of sustainable management strategies. We established experimental tree islands of varying sizes (25 m(2) to 1,600 m(2)) and diversity levels (1, 2, 3 and 6 species) in an oil palm plantation in Sumatra, Indonesia. Six native multi-purpose tree species including Archidendron pauciflorum (Jengkol), Durio zibethinus (Durian), Parkia speciosa (Petai), Shorea leprosula (Meranti), Peronema canescens (Sungkai) and Dyera polyphylla (Jelutung) were planted between living and felled oil palms. Here, we analyse the controlling factors of tree growth and survival during the first 4 years at the level of local neighbourhood and tree island. We found a significant effect of diversity levels on tree productivity, that is, basal area was higher in multi-species than in single-species tree islands. This overyielding was attributed to enhanced tree growth, while mortality had no effect. In the local neighbourhood, tree species richness had a positive effect on tree growth during the first year only, indicating that selection and dominance of well-performing species at high level of diversity are most likely driving overyielding. Trees grew better away from living oil palms, suggesting tree-palm competition. Proximity to felled oil palms increased growth especially during the first years, during which the planted trees might have benefited from the additional available space and resources. Despite positive edge effects from the conventional oil palm management in the surrounding, tree island size had an overall positive effect on tree growth. Synthesis and applications. We planted native trees in an oil palm landscape following a tree island pattern. The establishment success differed widely among the six planted species. The selection of particular species is a decisive factor to foster a positive relationship between diversity and tree growth. Planting larger tree islands (e.g. 1,600 square metres) is a better option to enhance tree growth, but tree-palm competition implies a trade-off between tree growth and palm oil production in the tree islands.

TI  - Soil Mesofauna in Differents Systems of Land Use Soil in Upper River Solimoes, AM, Brazil
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - The mesofauna has an important function in the soil and it is represented mainly by Acari Oribatida and Collembola. We report the first data on the density and diversity of the soil mesofauna in Benjamin Constant, Amazonas State, Brazil. The following systems were evaluated: primary forest, secondary forest, agroforestry system, cultivated areas and pastures. A total of 101 samples were collected 100 m apart from each other and specimens were collected by using Berlese-Tullgren method. The highest density was registered in secondary forest (29,776 specimens.m(-2)). Acari Oribatida was the dominant group (7.072 specimens.m(-2)) in the pasture, suggesting that mites show higher capacity of adaptation to disturbed environments and/or due to the presence of gregarious species. The density of Collembola (5,632 specimens.m(-2)) was higher in secondary forest. Formicidae was the dominant group (27,824 specimens.m(-2)) and its highest density occurred in the secondary forest (12,336 specimens.m-2). Seven species and ten morphospecies of Isoptera and three species of Symphyla were identified. The highest density and diversity were found in secondary forest. One supposes that the low density of mesofauna found in all of the studied systems is being influenced by soil structure and composition as well as litter volume. For SUT, the composition of taxonomic groups in the cultivated areas is similar to the one found in primary forest, while the groups found in the agroforestry system are similar to those in the pasture, which may help to decide on land use strategies.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of plant and animal biodiversity indicators in tropical forest and agroforest habitats
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - P>1. Biodiversity data are needed for conservation and management of tropical habitats, but the high diversity of these ecosystems makes comprehensive surveys prohibitively expensive and indicator taxa reflecting the biodiversity patterns of other taxa are frequently used. Few studies have produced the necessary comprehensive data sets to assess the quality of the indicator groups, however, and only one previous study has considered the monetary costs involved in sampling them.
   2. We surveyed four plant groups (herbs, liverworts, trees, lianas) and eight animal groups (ants, canopy and dung beetles, birds, butterflies, bees, wasps and the parasitoids of the latter two) in 15 plots of 50 x 50 m2 each, representing undisturbed rainforest and two types of cacao agroforest in Sulawesi, Indonesia. We calculated three biodiversity measures (alpha and beta diversity; percentage of species indicative of habitat conditions), built simple and multiple regression models among species groups (single groups, combinations of 2-11 groups, averaged relative diversity of all 12 groups), and related these to three measures of survey cost (absolute costs and two approaches correcting for different sampling intensities).
   3. Determination coefficients (R2 values) of diversity patterns between single study groups were generally low (< 0 center dot 25), while the consideration of several study groups increased R2 values to up to 0 center dot 8 for combinations of four groups, and to almost 1 center dot 0 for combinations of 11 groups. Survey costs varied 10-fold between study groups, but their cost-effectiveness (indicator potential versus monetary cost) varied strongly depending on the biodiversity aspect taken into account (alpha or beta diversity, single or multiple groups, etc.).
   4. Synthesis and applications. We found that increasing the number of taxa resulted in best overall biodiversity indication. We thus propose that the most cost-efficient approach to general tropical biodiversity inventories is to increase taxonomic coverage by selecting taxa with the lowest survey costs.

TI  - Potential of dendrochronology in assessing carbon sequestration rates of Vitellaria paradoxa in southern Mali, West Africa
T2  - DENDROCHRONOLOGIA
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the applicability of dendrochronology for assessing the growth dynamics and response to climate variability and to estimate the aboveground carbon stock and carbon sequestration potential of Vitellaria paradoxa in southern Mali. Twenty stem disks were collected from three land-use types (parklands, fallows and protected areas) in Koutiala and Yanfolila districts. We cornbined a standard dendrochronological approach with biomass allometric equations to estimate the growth and carbon stocks. The results showed that V. paradoxa forms distinct growth ring boundaries but most of the disks from parklands did not successfully cross-date due to management operations like pruning. The tree-ring width showed a significant standardized coefficient of regression with rainfall (r(2) = 0.66, p < 0.001) but insignificant correlation with temperature. One-way analysis of variance showed no significant difference (p > 0.05) for C-sequestration as well as for carbon stocks in aboveground biomass for both land-use types and sites. Mean values of the amount of C-sequestered in Yanfolila were 0.112 +/- 0.0.065 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in parklands, 0.075 +/- 0.018 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in fallows and 0.064 +/- 0.028 Mg C ha-(1) yr(-1) in protected areas. In Koutiala, the values were 0.068 +/- 0.020 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in the parklands and 0.053 +/- 0.017 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in the fallows. These results clearly indicate that dendrochronology can be applied to assess growth and carbon sequestration potential of V. paradoxa. These results also suggest that climate change could affect the growth and carbon sequestration potential of V. paradoxa. Given the limited size of our sample, figures on the amount of carbon are indicative calling for applying the tested approaches to larger samples and also to other tree species in West Africa.

TI  - Assessing the effectiveness of a land zoning policy in the Dry Chaco. The Case of Santiago del Estero, Argentina
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Land use zoning has been proposed as an instrument to steer sustainable land use and reduce deforestation. Its effectiveness is a growing concern among researchers and decision makers. Nowadays, the dry forests of the Argentine Chaco are a global hotspot of deforestation, where a zoning policy has been established through the enactment of a National Forest Law. The law imposed on the provinces the obligation to define land use zones in their native forests. Ten years after the enforcement of the National Forest Law, we assessed the effectiveness of the zoning policy of Santiago del Estero, one of Argentina's provinces with higher deforestation rates. For this, we combined the provincial forest zoning with the extent of forest cover and a plot level land transformation geodatabase. The deforested area halved during the five-year period after the enactment of the law, decreasing from 910 10(3) ha in 2003-2008 (i.e. before the law) to 450 10(3) ha in 2009-2014. Most of this forest cover loss (257 10(3) ha) occurred in areas classified under categories where deforestation was forbidden. After the enactment of the Law, annual deforestation rates decreased mostly in areas that allowed deforestation, slightly decreased in areas where deforestation was forbidden and increased in areas where a certain level of deforestation was allowed, although above that level. Despite the reductions in deforestation rates, our results suggest that the zoning policy in Santiago del Estero was not effective enough, since deforestation occurred in forbidden areas and generally surpassed the level of deforestation permitted. Alternative coercive mechanisms (e.g. more severe penalties for offenders) and greater efforts to detect illegal clearings are needed to enhance the effectiveness of the Forest Law.

TI  - Implementing REDD plus (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation): evidence on governance, evaluation and impacts from the REDD-ALERT project
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - The REDD-ALERT (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation from Alternative Land Uses in the Rainforests of the Tropics) project started in 2009 and finished in 2012, and had the aim of evaluating mechanisms that translate international-level agreements into instruments that would help change the behaviour of land users while minimising adverse repercussions on their livelihoods. Findings showed that some developing tropical countries have recently been through a forest transition, thus shifting from declining to expanding forests at a national scale. However, in most of these (e.g. Vietnam), a significant part of the recent increase in national forest cover is associated with an increase in importation of food and timber products from abroad, representing leakage of carbon stocks across international borders. Avoiding deforestation and restoring forests will require a mixture of regulatory approaches, emerging market-based instruments, suasive options, and hybrid management measures. Policy analysis and modelling work showed the high degree of complexity at local levels and highlighted the need to take this heterogeneity into account-it is unlikely that there will be a one size fits all approach to make Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) work. Significant progress was made in the quantification of carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes following land-use change in the tropics, contributing to narrower confidence intervals on peat-based emissions and their reporting standards. There are indications that there is only a short and relatively small window of opportunity of making REDD+ work-these included the fact that forest-related emissions as a fraction of total global GHG emissions have been decreasing over time due to the increase in fossil fuel emissions, and that the cost efficiency of REDD+ may be much less than originally thought due to the need to factor in safeguard costs, transaction costs and monitoring costs. Nevertheless, REDD+ has raised global awareness of the world's forests and the factors affecting them, and future developments should contribute to the emergence of new landscape-based approaches to protecting a wider range of ecosystem services.

TI  - Close-to-nature management of tropical timber plantations is economically viable and provides biodiversity benefits
T2  - FORESTRY
AB  - Reforestation of tropical forests is crucial to mitigate the climate crisis and restore ecosystems. However, past efforts have been criticized for establishing monoculture timber plantations with exotic tree species. Close-to-nature (CTN) practices aim to minimize negative forest management impacts on forests ecosystems by mimicking natural dynamics. So far, CTN management practices are rarely applied in tropical plantation forestry. This study evaluates the economic, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity potential of CTN management in tropical mixed-species plantations in Central America using a simulation-optimization approach. To our knowledge, this study is the first to assess the potential of tropical CTN-managed plantations on the basis of detailed process-based forest growth simulations. CTN practices such as selective harvesting, retention forestry, and shelterwood cutting of mixed-species stands were compared to even-aged mixtures and conventional monoculture practices. Results showed that CTN management was economically viable for certain species mixtures and management practices at an 8 % discount rate and had the potential to increase carbon storage and biodiversity in the modeled plantations. At current carbon prices, CTN-managed plantations may only become financially competitive with monocultures, if monocultures are excluded from carbon certification schemes that increasingly aim at co-producing non-carbon benefits like biodiversity conservation. If carbon prices increase, the sale of carbon credits could finance the transformation of monocultures to CTN-managed mixed-species stands. The competitiveness of CTN management could also be improved through performance-based biodiversity payments, such as the sale of biodiversity credits.

TI  - SELECTION OF SPECIES FROM NATURAL FOREST AND INDICATION OF PLANTING DENSITY FOR RECLAMATION OF DEGRADED AREAS IN THE AMAZON FOREST
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
AB  - The identification of species influencing the occurrence of other associated species is of fundamental importance for the success of forest restoration of degraded areas. The objective of this work is to present a phytosociological and socioeconomic index (IFSE), obtained by techniques of factor analysis, modeling six quantitative variables (abundance, frequency, dominance, biomass, the commercial value of timber and amount of non-timber forest products) and equal number of qualitative variables, whose dummy variable is equal to one, assumed value for those species whose higher earnings amounted to 50 % of the total for each quantitative variables analyzed. Sampling of the dense rain forest (407 ha) was composed by 80 plots of 0.25 ha (4.91 % of sampling intensity) and all individuals with diameter at 1.30 m above the ground (DBH) >= 10 cm were identified and measured. It was recorded 10,105 individuals, including 493 species covering 58 families. The species were ranked by the index proposed in three categories of priority phytosociological and socioeconomic status (high, medium and low). The appropriateness of factor analysis was determined by tests of Bartlett and KMO. The Bartlett's test evaluated the overall significance of the correlation matrix and indicated that correlations were significant at 1 % probability. The KMO test showed that the variables were correlated and the model of variance showed a very good level of fitness to the data. These results endorsed the use of factor analysis to extract factors and estimate the factor scores. The results were statistically validated for construction of the index IFSE and 25 species were selected as the priority ones (key species). And also, it was recomended the planting density for these forest species for restoration of degraded areas in Amazonia.

TI  - Impermanence and failure: the legacy of conservation-based payments in Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Projects that pay communities or individuals to conserve natural areas rarely continue indefinitely. When payments cease, the behaviors they motivate can change. Previous research on conservation-based payments recognizes the impermanence of conservation success, but it does not consider the legacy of payments that failed to effect change. This research assesses impermanence and failure by investigating the legacy of village-level conservation payments made through one of the largest Integrated Conservation and Development Projects in Indonesia. The Kerinci-Seblat Integrated Conservation and Development Project aimed to conserve forest area and promote local development through voluntary conservation agreements (VCAs) that provided payments for pro-conservation pledges and activities from 2000 through 2003. Project documentation and previous research find that payments failed to incentivize additional forest conservation, producing nonsignificant differences in forest-cover change during the project period. To examine the legacy of these payments in the post-project period, this research uses matched difference-in-differences and triple differences models to analyze forest cover change in villages (n = 263) from 2000 through 2016 as well as matched binary logistic regression models to assess enduring differences in household (n = 1303) livelihood strategies within VCA villages in 2016. The analysis finds that VCA villages contained significantly more forest loss than the most similar non-VCA villages outside the national park, and greater payments predict increased forest loss in the post-project period. In addition, farming high-value tree crops and cultivating private land were the most important attributes for modeling VCA affiliation among randomly selected households. These results demonstrate that, after payments ceased, project failures increased in severity over time.Those who design and implement conservation-based payments bear great responsibility to ensure their projects are informed by local voice, align with community preferences, and provide sufficient benefits, lest they result in a conservation legacy of increased failure.

TI  - Mixed-species allometric equations and estimation of aboveground biomass and carbon stocks in restoring degraded landscape in northern Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Accurate biomass estimation is critical to quantify the changes in biomass and carbon stocks following the restoration of degraded landscapes. However, there is lack of site-specific allometric equations for the estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB), which consequently limits our understanding of the contributions of restoration efforts in mitigating climate change. This study was conducted in northwestern Ethiopia to develop a multi-species allometric equation and investigate the spatial and temporal variation of C-stocks following the restoration of degraded landscapes. We harvested and weighed 84 trees from eleven dominant species from six grazing exclosures and adjacent communal grazing land. We observed that AGB correlates significantly with diameter at stump height D-30 (R-2 = 0.78; P<0.01), and tree height H (R-2 = 0.41, P<0.05). Our best model, which includes D-30 and H as predictors explained 82% of the variations in AGB. This model produced the lowest bias with narrow ranges of errors across different diameter classes. Estimated C-stock showed a significant positive correlation with stem density (R-2 = 0.80, P<0.01) and basal area (R-2 = 0.84, P<0.01). At the watershed level, the mean C-stock was 3.8 (+/- 0.5) MgCha(-1). Plot-level C-stocks varied between 0.1 and 13.7MgCha(-1). Estimated C-stocks in three-and seven-year-old exclosures exceeded estimated C-stock in the communal grazing land by 50%. The species that contribute most to C-stocks were Leucaena sp. (28%), Calpurnia aurea (21%), Euclea racemosa (20.9%), and Dodonaea angustifolia (15.8%). The equations developed in this study allow monitoring changes in C-stocks and C-sequestration following the implementation of restoration practices in northern Ethiopia over space and time. The estimated C-stocks can be used as a reference against which future changes in C-stocks can be compared.

TI  - Earthworm species in public parks in Curitiba, Parana, Brazil
T2  - ZOOTAXA
AB  - Earthworms are important macroinvertebrates that provide soil ecosystem services and are also useful environmental bioindicators. Urban areas around the world have major impacts on biodiversity and the objective of the present study was to assess the role of urban parks of Curitiba, Parana State, in preserving native earthworm species. Earthworm populations were sampled in five parks (Barigui, Tingui, Barreirinha, Passauna and the Botanic Garden), in two land use systems (grass lawns and secondary forest fragments) in two seasons, summer (November 2013) and winter (June 2014). A total of twelve earthworm species were identified, belonging to six families: Glossoscolex sp. 1, Fimoscolex sp. 1, sp. 2 and sp. 3 (Glossoscolecidae), Pontoscolex corethrurus (Rhinodrilidae), Eukerria tucumana (Ocnerodrilidae), Amynthas gracilis, Amynthas corticis, Metaphire californica (Megascolecidae), Aporrectodea rosea and Lumbricus rubellus (Lumbricidae), the latter being the first record for this species in Brazil. In addition, a single unidentified juvenile Dichogaster sp. (Acanthodrilidae) was found. Four new species were found and three out of five urban parks of Curitiba (especially the Botanic Garden) were able to preserve native species, though their abundance was low and exotic species (n=8) predominated, attributed to human disturbance that favors invasion and colonization of exotic earthworms.

TI  - Soil Physical Quality in Agricultural Systems on the Cerrado of Piaui State, Brazil
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
AB  - Soil quality is essential for maintaining the sustainability of agro-ecosystems and ecosystem services provided by this natural resource. The present study aimed to assess the physical quality of soil through the characterization of the physical properties in grain production systems in the Southwest region of Piaui State, Brazil. The study was carried out in the Cerrado region of Piaui in four cities in areas of expansion of the agricultural frontier of the state: Baixa Grande do Ribeiro, Sebastiao Leal, Urueui and Bom Jesus. Soil samples were collected in April 2012. in areas of grain production under conventional and no-tillage systems. Adjacent areas with native vegetation were also sampled as reference. Bulk density, effective saturation, hydraulic conductivity, penetration resistance, porosity and aggregation were measured. Regardless of the type of soil management used, agricultural systems degrade soil physical quality. No-tillage showed higher bulk density, penetration resistance and aggregation, with lower total porosity, macroporosity and hydraulic conductivity. The physical quality of soil in the agricultural areas of the Cerrado region of Piaui was dependent on the soil texture, while silt, clay and organic matter were determinant for soil aggregation, mechanical resistance, total porosity and microporosity.

TI  - Phenological trends and associated climate drivers of a tree community in lowland dipterocarp forest, Western Ghats, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
AB  - Understanding phenological responses of tropical forest plant communities is crucial for identifying climate-induced changes in ecosystem dynamics. Monitoring phenology across diverse species in natural habitats provides cost-effective insights for conserving both species and forests. We studied tree phenology in a lowland evergreen dipterocarp forest in the Western Ghats, India. About 719 tree individuals representing 95 species were monitored for their vegetative and reproductive phenology from April 2021 to September 2023. Circular statistics detected seasonality in phenological events and Generalized Linear Mixed Modelling (GLMM) identified influence of climate variables on the phenological responses of the tree community. We also assessed how the activity and intensity of phenophases vary over the study period. Our results showed that leaf flushing and flowering peaked during the dry season, with mass flowering observed in two dominant dipterocarps. Fruit production peaked before the monsoon. We also observed diversity in vegetative and reproductive phenodynamics across species groups (forest strata, sexual system, and seed size). Leaf flushing was positively correlated with maximum relative humidity and negatively correlated with maximum temperature and the number of rainy days. Flowering had negative correlations with maximum relative humidity, rainfall days, and maximum temperature but showed a positive correlation with minimum temperature. Fruiting was positively correlated with maximum temperature and negatively correlated with rainy days. This detailed phenological information provides critical knowledge on resource availability and insights into how climate and seasonal changes affect plant growth cycles thereby aiding reforestation and biodiversity conservation strategies in vulnerable forest areas.

TI  - Establishment success of Brazil nut trees in smallholder Amazon forest restoration depends on site conditions and management
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - 1. Forest landscape restoration (FLR) has gained momentum globally and guidance is needed to identify those species, sites and planting methods that increase restoration success. Incorporating native Non-Timber Forest Product (NTFP) species in FLR approaches provides an opportunity to simultaneously deliver ecological and economic benefits. The Brazil nut tree is one of the most valuable Amazonian NTFP species and could fulfil a cornerstone role in Amazon FLR. However, the factors defining establishment success within Brazil nut restoration activities remain unknown. 2. Here, we evaluate the effect of management practices, restoration site (pastures, agroforestry, secondary forest and canopy gaps in old growth forest) and environmental conditions on the establishment success (tree growth, survival and fruit production) of Brazil nut restoration projects implemented by smallholders in the Peruvian Amazon. We performed a field study at 25 restoration sites of 1-38 years in age, where we conducted measurements on 481 trees and interviewed 21 smallholders. We used mixed effect models to identify drivers of performance. 3. Twenty years after planting, diameter growth in secondary forests was 38%, 34%, and 24% higher than in canopy gaps, pastures, and agroforestry sites, respectively. Survival rate was similar for trees planted in pastures and secondary forests, but 15-20% higher there than trees planted in agroforestry sites, and 7-12% higher than in canopy gaps. Fruit production was 262% higher for reproductive trees in secondary forest sites compared to pastures, but production probability did not differ between restoration sites. These results show that secondary forests are the most suitable sites for planting Brazil nut trees. 4. In addition to restoration site effects, we also found significant effects of management practices. Survival rate increased with application of fire for clearing and weeding and economic investments and decreased with potentially inefficient herbivore protection. Fruit production was lower for trees planted further away from smallholders' homes. These results show that smallholders' management has a substantial effect on establishment success. 5. Our findings suggest a significant importance of post-planting maintenance of trees to increase success of FLR projects. Further, our study shows that evaluation of past restoration activities can guide future forest restoration in tropical landscapes.

TI  - Biodiversity Conservation in Southeast Asian Timber Concessions: a Critical Evaluation of Policy Mechanisms and Guidelines
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - Tropical deforestation is leading to a loss of economically productive timber concessions, as well as areas with important environmental or socio-cultural values. To counteract this threat in Southeast Asia, sustainable forest management (SFM) practices are becoming increasingly important. We assess the tools and guidelines that have been developed to promote SFM and the progress that has been made in Southeast Asia toward better logging practices. We specifically focus on practices relevant to biodiversity issues. Various regional or national mechanisms now inform governments and the timber industry about methods to reduce the impact of production forestry on wildlife and the forest environment. However, so many guidelines have been produced that it has become difficult to judge which ones are most relevant. In addition, most guidelines are phrased in general terms and lack specific recommendations targeted to local conditions. These might be reasons for the generally slow adoption of SFM practices in the region, with only a few countries having incorporated the guidelines into national legislation. Malaysia, Indonesia, and Laos are among the frontrunners in this process. Overall there is progress, especially in the application of certification programs, the planning and management of high conservation value forests, the regulation and control of hunting, and silvicultural management. To reduce further forest loss, there is a need to accelerate the implementation of good forest management practices. We recommend specific roles for governments, the forestry industry, and nongovernmental organizations in further promoting the implementation of SFM practices for biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Seed Dispersal Patterns by Large Frugivorous Mammals in a Degraded Mosaic Landscape
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Seed dispersal by Red fox (Vulpes vulpes), Stone marten (Martes foina), and Wild boar (Sus scrofa) was analyzed in an extensively degraded mosaic landscape in Sierra Nevada (SE Spain). The main objective was to determine whether seed dispersal by mammals was related to habitat degradation within a mosaic of adjacent degraded patches mixed with native forest and thereby to determine the potential role of mammals as seed dispersers in degraded landscape units. For three consecutive years, mammal feces were collected in the fruit production period, extracting all seeds of woody species found therein and analyzing their viability. Feces were collected in three different plots for each of five different landscape units: shrubland, native forest, and dense, cleared, and fenced reforestation stands. Seeds from 16 woody species (which represent more than a half of the total fleshy-fruited woody species available) were recorded, although some agrarian species are also introduced in a low percentage of the scats. Seeds showed a high viability rate for all dispersed species, irrespective of the mammal disperser. No differences in species composition appeared in the overall landscape units or in the seed density between degraded habitats. Due to the small patch size, the high viability of dispersed seeds, and the large home range of the large mammals, these three animal species act as efficient seed dispersers for a diverse assemblage of woody plant species regardless of the habitat type within this degradation framework. This fact has important consequences for the biodiversity recuperation in these degraded habitats, principally in pine plantations.

TI  - How does FSC forest certification affect the acoustically active fauna in Madre de Dios, Peru?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Despite several efforts to quantify the effectiveness of forest certification in developing sustainable use of forest resources, there is little evidence that certified forests are more effective in conserving fauna than non-certified managed forest. To evaluate the impact of forest certification on the fauna, we compared the biodiversity in reference sites (n = 23), Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified management sites (n = 24) and non-FSCmanagement sites (n = 20) in the Tahuamanu region of Peru, during the dry season of 2017. Specifically, we determined if the acoustic space used (ASU), soundscapes composition, and the bird richness and composition significantly varied among the three management types. Variation inASUwas best explained by management type and meanASUin theFSCsites was significantly greater than the reference and non-FSCsites, possibly suggesting greater richness of acoustically active species. An ordination analysis of the soundscapes showed that there was a significant difference among the three management types. There was greater dissimilarity in soundscape composition between theFSCand non-FSCsites, and greater overlap betweenFSCand reference sites. Bird identifications resulted in 11,300 detections of 226 bird species. Bird species richness and composition were not significantly different among the management types, indicating, in this context, that birds may not be the best indicators of different management strategies. The weak discrimination by the bird community is likely due to their dispersal ability, undisturbed primary forest matrix, and the occurrence of bamboo patches. The differences inASUamong the management types were most likely due to differences in acoustically active insects, which may be more sensitive to changes in microhabitat differences. Our findings correspond with the conclusions of other studies that certified forests can maintain levels of fauna biodiversity similar to those of undisturbed primary forest in the Amazon region.

TI  - Floristic diversity and stocking rate in tropical dry forest secondary vegetation used for grazing
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - The natural process of ecological regeneration in tropical regions in conjunction with local livestock management practices creates grazing environments with high floristic diversity and structural complexity. Yet, these environments are being neglected despite the opportunities and benefits for domestic herbivores. Voisin grazing (VG) is better in such highly biodiverse environments, as this management system seeks to improve forage utilization by coupling forage allowance with livestock needs for forage, using small paddocks, high stock densities over short occupation periods, and allowing plants to fully recover after grazing. Floristic diversity, biomass and stocking rate were assessed in sites having tropical dry forest secondary vegetation undergoing grazing. Six sites having extensive seasonal grazing were studied by placing 10 x 10 m(2) quadrats across sites to list woody species and nested 2 x 2 m(2) frames for listing herbaceous vegetation. The response of vegetation to Voisin grazing (VG) was evaluated in one of the six sites (split into 15 paddocks having 400-m(2) each). A total of 191 species (from all sites) including 50 potential forage species were listed. Quadrats were classified into two groups, one contained more preserved vegetation dominated by woody species, and the other a less preserved group dominated by herbaceous and shrub species. Available forage biomass across sites ranged from 1000 to 1200 kg DM ha(-1) (30-70% woody biomass), supporting low stocking rates (0.2-0.3 AU ha(-1)). In the site where VG was implemented, most of the identified species were forage (56/58). After one year of VG, the most productive paddocks (2500-3800 kg DM ha(-1)) were dominated by forbs and the least productive ones (800 2000 kg DM ha(-1)) were dominated by woody species, yielding an overall stocking rate of 1.2 AU ha(-1). Based on forage botanical composition, three groups of paddocks were identified: 1) dominated by grasses, 2) heterogeneous forage diversity, and 3) dominated by forbs and shrubs. Pastures recovered in 47-89 d during the 2017 rainy season, 50 123 d during the transition to the dry season, and 210-290 d during the 2018 dry season. Secondary vegetation provides high floristic diversity and a large number of forage plant species, but low forage yield and stocking rates. Yet, implementation of a proper grazing system such as VG gradually enhances yield and stocking rates. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Aboveground Carbon Storage and Its Links to Stand Structure, Tree Diversity and Floristic Composition in South-Eastern Tanzania
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - African savannas and dry forests represent a large, but poorly quantified store of biomass carbon and biodiversity. Improving this information is hindered by a lack of recent forest inventories, which are necessary for calibrating earth observation data and for evaluating the relationship between carbon stocks and tree diversity in the context of forest conservation (for example, REDD+). Here, we present new inventory data from south-eastern Tanzania, comprising more than 15,000 trees at 25 locations located across a gradient of aboveground woody carbon (AGC) stocks. We find that larger trees disproportionately contribute to AGC, with the largest 3.7% of individuals containing half the carbon. Tree species diversity and carbon stocks were positively related, implying a potential functional relationship between the two, and a 'win-win' scenario for conservation; however, lower biomass areas also contain diverse species assemblages meaning that carbon-oriented conservation may miss important areas of biodiversity. Despite these variations, we find that total tree abundance and biomass is skewed towards a few locally dominant species, with eight and nine species (5.7% of the total) accounting for over half the total measured trees and carbon, respectively. This finding implies that carbon production in these areas is channelled through a small number of relatively abundant species. Our results provide key insights into the structure and functioning of these heterogeneous ecosystems and indicate the need for novel strategies for future measurement and monitoring of carbon stocks and biodiversity, including the use for larger plots to capture spatial variations in large tree density and AGC stocks, and to allow the calibration of earth observation data.

TI  - Signals of forest degradation in the demography of common Asian amphibians
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Background. Lowland areas in tropical East and Southeast Asia have a long history of conversion from forestland to agricultural land, with many remaining forests being chronically degraded by wood cutting, livestock grazing, and burning. Wetland-breeding amphibians that have evolved in lowland forests in the region have adjusted to changes in habitat composition caused by humans' activities, and populations continue to persist. However, we have little understanding of the impacts of forest disturbance on these species beyond assessments of abundance and distribution, and species considered to be common and widespread have been largely neglected.
   Methods. We examined body condition and sex ratios of toads (Duttaphrynus melanostictus), predation risk in treefrogs (2 Polypedates spp.), and growth and survival of leaf litter frogs (2 Microhyla spp.) in agricultural land, degraded forest, and intact forest in two study areas, Thailand and Hong Kong.
   Results. Toad populations exhibited higher body condition and female-biased sex ratios in intact forest. Predation of treefrog embryos by flies was lower in intact and degraded forests than in agricultural land. Embryonic survival and larval growth and survival in leaf litter frogs were lower in intact forests than in agricultural land.
   Results for each study were similar between study areas. Discussion. For three of five of these common amphibian species, we documented signals of forest loss and disturbance in their populations. Although these species occur in disturbed habitats, loss of forest cover continues to degrade aspects of their population demography. We urge conservation biologists to consider that populations of species appearing to be common, widespread, and tolerant of human disturbance may be eroding over time.

TI  - Fire Management and Carbon Programs: A Systematic Literature Review and Case Study Analysis
T2  - SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES
AB  - Fire management influences the global carbon balance. This systematic literature review of proactive fire management programs as nature-based climate solutions synthesizes findings into four case studies to bring insight to these programs and their additional benefits. We review 136 papers, mostly from Australia, Brazil, Southern Africa, and the USA, reflecting the relevance of proactive fire management to savanna ecosystems. Four themes emerged: governance and policies; methodologies; reduced wildfire and GHG emissions; and co-benefits. Australia provides most literature on methodologies to account for greenhouse gas emissions abated. Australia and the USA focus on the social co-benefits, typically among Indigenous peoples. Biodiversity outcomes are largely discussed in Brazilian and African studies. Evidence of a shift to proactive fire management is documented in the case studies analyzed, but political, technical, and cultural barriers prevent further implementation at broader scales.

TI  - Biomass and soil carbon stocks of indigenous agroforestry systems on the south-eastern Rift Valley escarpment, Ethiopia
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Biomass carbon (C) and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in three indigenous agroforestry (AF) systems (Enset [Ensete ventricosum, Musaceae], Enset-Coffee and Fruit-Coffee) practiced on the Rift Valley escarpment of Ethiopia are presented and evaluated. These unique AF systems are characterised by a high proportion and diversity of trees.
   Data were collected from six smallholdings per AF system. Above- and belowground biomass of trees (fruit and non-fruit), enset and coffee plants were calculated using allometric equations while the biomasses of herbs, litter and fine roots (< 2 cm) were determined by destructive sampling techniques. SOC stocks (0-30 and 30-60 cm) were calculated from measured C contents and bulk density values.
   Smallholding total biomass C stocks averaged 67 Mg ha(-1) with trees accounting for 39-93 %. Herbs accounted for < 4 % of aboveground biomass. Coffee accounted for 11 % and enset 9 % of total biomass C on average. SOC stocks (0-60 cm) were 109-253 Mg ha(-1) (52-91 % of total C stocks) and uncorrelated to biomass C stocks. Biomass C or SOC stocks did not significantly differ between AF systems but biomass C stocks were significantly correlated to elevation.
   The C stocks of the three studied AF systems were found to be amongst the highest reported for tropical forests and agroforestry systems. These unique AF systems are therefore well suited to REDD+ projects. However, the C stocks were more determined by individual smallholder management practice than by AF system or climate (elevation).

TI  - A trait-based plant economic framework can help increase the value of reforestation for conservation
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - While reforestation is gaining momentum to moderate climate change via carbon sequestration, there is also an opportunity to use tree planting to confront declining global biodiversity. Where tree species vary in support of diversity, selecting appropriate species for planting could increase conservation effectiveness. We used a common garden experiment in Borneo using 24 native tree species to examine how variation among tree species in their support of beetle diversity is predicted by plant traits associated with "acquisitive" and "conservative" resource acquisition strategies. We evaluate three hypotheses: (1) beetle communities show fidelity to host identity as indicated by variation in abundance and diversity among tree species, (2) the leaf economic spectrum partially explains this variation as shown by beetle preferences for plant species that are predicted by plant traits, and (3) a small number of selected tree species can capture higher beetle species richness than a random tree species community. We found high variation among tree species in supporting three highly intercorrelated metrics of beetle communities: abundance, richness, and Shannon diversity. Variation in support of beetle communities was predicted by plant traits and varied by plant functional groups; within the dipterocarp family, high beetle diversity was predicted by conservative traits such as high wood density and slow growth, and in non-dipterocarps by the acquisitive traits of high foliar K and rapid growth. Using species accumulation curves and extrapolation to twice the original sample size, we show that 48 tree species were not enough to reach asymptote levels of beetle richness. Nevertheless, species accumulation curves of the six tree species with the highest richness had steeper slopes and supported 33% higher richness than a random community of tree species. Reforestation projects concerned about conservation can benefit by identifying tree species with a disproportional capacity to support biodiversity based on plant traits.

TI  - Influence of Plot Size on Efficiency of Biomass Estimates in Inventories of Dry Tropical Forests Assisted by Photogrammetric Data from an Unmanned Aircraft System
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Applications of unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) to assist in forest inventories have provided promising results in biomass estimation for different forest types. Recent studies demonstrating use of different types of remotely sensed data to assist in biomass estimation have shown that accuracy and precision of estimates are influenced by the size of field sample plots used to obtain reference values for biomass. The objective of this case study was to assess the influence of sample plot size on efficiency of UAS-assisted biomass estimates in the dry tropical miombo woodlands of Malawi. The results of a design-based field sample inventory assisted by three-dimensional point clouds obtained from aerial imagery acquired with a UAS showed that the root mean square errors as well as the standard error estimates of mean biomass decreased as sample plot sizes increased. Furthermore, relative efficiency values over different sample plot sizes were above 1.0 in a design-based and model-assisted inferential framework, indicating that UAS-assisted inventories were more efficient than purely field-based inventories. The results on relative costs for UAS-assisted and pure field-based sample plot inventories revealed that there is a trade-off between inventory costs and required precision. For example, in our study if a standard error of less than approximately 3 Mg ha(-1) was targeted, then a UAS-assisted forest inventory should be applied to ensure more cost effective and precise estimates. Future studies should therefore focus on finding optimum plot sizes for particular applications, like for example in projects under the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, plus forest conservation, sustainable management of forest and enhancement of carbon stocks (REDD+) mechanism with different geographical scales.

TI  - Carbon dynamics in slash-and-burn agriculture and land use alternatives of the humid forest zone in Cameroon
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - One of the environmental consequences of slash-and-burn farming is the loss of forest system carbon which in turn contributes to atmospheric change and impacts upon global climates. International attention has become focused upon the development of alternatives to slash-and-burn agriculture to alleviate poverty, protect biodiversity and reduce climate change. Before alternative land use systems can be evaluated in terms of carbon sequestration, baseline measurements of carbon dynamics resulting from current practices are required. We have characterized the carbon stocks in six slash-and-burn chronosequences in the humid forest zone of Cameroon, Each chronosequence consisted of original forest, two year-old cropland, a cacao plantation, bush fallow, tree fallow and secondary forest. Four, nine and seventeen years, respectively, had passed since the original forest was cleared for the latter three land uses. At each of 36 site x land use combinations, tree, understorey, litter, root and soil (0-50 cm) carbon were measured in five 100 m(2) quadrates, The original forest contained 308 t C ha(-1) and lost 220 t C ha(-1) upon conversion to agriculture, The most vulnerable carbon pool was the above ground tree biomass and the most stable was soil organic matter. Carbon reaccumulated in the recovering fallows at a rate of 9.4 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) (r = 0.83). When these results were extrapolated using a geographic information system, deforestation rates in Southern Cameroon were estimated to be 1,355 km(-2) yr(-1) between 1973 and 1988 resulting in annual forest system carbon losses of 13.5 million t C. During the course of this study, three alternatives to slash-and-burn were identified: commercial cassava cultivation, improved forest conversion, and stratified agroforestry. These alternative land uses have the potential to reduce C losses over current practices by 10, 55 and 75 t C ha(-1), respectively, and also differ greatly in their potential to alleviate rural poverty, protect biodiversity and deflect additional deforestation.

TI  - Are Dung Beetles Driving Dung-Fly Abundance in Traditional Agricultural Areas in the Amazon?
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - We evaluated the effects of different land-use systems on the ability of dung beetles to control the population of detritus-feeding flies. We tested the hypotheses that intensification of land use will reduce dung beetles richness, abundance and biomass and, consequently, their dung burial ability, affecting the interaction between dung beetles and flies and reducing its effectiveness as a natural biological control. In the Brazilian Amazon we sampled dung beetles, fly larvae and adults; and recorded the rate of dung removal by dung beetles across a gradient of land-use intensity from primary forest, secondary forest, agroforestry, agriculture to pasture. Our results provide evidence that land-use intensification results in a reduction of the richness, abundance and biomass of dung beetles, and this in turn results in lower rates of dung removal in the most simplified systems. We found no significant differences in the abundance of fly larvae between the different systems of land use. However, the number of adult flies differed significantly between land-use systems, presenting higher abundance in those sites with greater intensity of use (pasture and agriculture) and a lower abundance of adult flies in forested systems (primary and secondary forests, and agroforestry). Information-theoretic model selection based on AICc revealed strong support for the influence of land-use systems, dung removal rates and dung beetle abundance, biomass and richness on adult dung-fly abundance. Our results also reveal that dung beetles are not solely responsible for fly control and that other factors linked to land use are influencing the populations of these detritus-feeding insects.

TI  - Fire effects on anurans: What we know so far?
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Fire is a powerful environmental disturbance with the ability to shape many biomes worldwide. However, global warming, land-use changes and other anthropogenic factors have strongly altered natural fire regimes worldwide. Despite the growing number of studies evaluating the effects of fire on biodiversity, little is understood about how burn affects certain groups that are particularly sensitive to climatic extremes, such as anurans. Here, we conducted a global and systematic literature review of studies assessing anurofauna responses to fire disturbances. We used Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models and theoretical information criteria to assess how fire affects anuran assemblages. We analyzed 68 studies, widely distributed in the globe, which examined the fire effects on abundance, richness and/or species behavior. In total, 191 species were considered, being Gastrophryne carolinensis and Lithobates catesbeianus the most evaluated. We reveal a lack of general anurofauna response to fire, as species and assemblages were either negatively or positively affected by burns. We observed that the fire treatments (Prescribed fire, Wildfire and without fire) and the biome where the study was conducted did not explain the variation in species abundance. Most studies were conducted in biomes classified as Temperate Forests, followed by Tropical Savannas and Tropical Forests. We highlight that future studies should consider factors associated to fire (e.g. fire treatment, fire properties), research design and species biology to explain patterns of species persistence and community structure. Although fire plays a key role in shaping several natural ecosystems, we have recently witnessed drastic changes in natural burning regimes all over the world, which imply leading to severe population reductions and even species extinctions. Given this scenario, government authorities should urgently support and invest in scientific studies that evaluate, monitor and test fire management practices in natural ecosystems and therefore establish mitigation actions to preserve the biota constantly threatened by the imbalance of this environmental disturbance.

TI  - Plant community composition and disturbance in Caspian Fagus orientalis forests: which are the main driving factors?
T2  - PHYTOCOENOLOGIA
AB  - The oriental beech forests along the southern Caspian Sea shores of Iran are characterized by high biodiversity and high ecological value. However, there is little information concerning factors governing community composition and the presence and abundance of invasive plants. In the present study we aimed to evaluate the main drivers of community composition, diversity, and establishment of invasive plants in disturbed and undisturbed Fagus orientalis communities.
   We sampled 104 vegetation releves in undisturbed and disturbed sites of the "Kheiroud Investigation Forest" in northern Iran and collected data on a large number of environmental variables concerning soil properties, light conditions, and topography. Data analysis consisted of a forward selection of significant explanatory variables followed by partial CCA analyses. Additionally, we carried out indicator species analysis of groups of releves affected by different disturbance types and analyzed effects of disturbance on species richness, diversity, and evenness using general linear models.
   CCA results showed that disturbance, soil properties, light conditions and elevation explained 22.6% of the total variation in floristic composition. Gap and gap + grazing were the most important disturbance types affecting community composition. Disturbance had significant but rather weak effects on species richness, evenness, and the Shannon index. The most obvious effect of disturbance was on species composition, as revealed by significant groups of indicator species for different disturbance types. Most of the indicator species in grazed sites were unpalatable, poisonous, and creeping species, which are avoided by cattle. Grazing led to decreased abundance of indicator species and species characteristic of old-growth Fagus forests. The most intensive disturbance type "harvesting + gap + grazing" was associated with invasion by native vascular plant species not typically found in beech forests (apophytes).

TI  - Examining diversity of terrestrial mammal communities across forest reserves in Sabah, Borneo
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Tropical forest reserves have conservation value for terrestrial mammals and are threatened by anthropogenic pressures, especially conversion to other land-use types. To assess mammalian biodiversity of forest reserves in Sabah, Borneo, we used camera trapping data to estimate species richness, beta diversity, phylogenetic and functional diversity in nine forest reserves with different management classifications and backgrounds. Multiregional multispecies occupancy models (MSOM) were used to differentiate species occupancy in the reserves, and the estimates were transformed into biodiversity metrics. We found a significant difference in mammal composition within each forest reserve, with various functional and phylogenetic clustering or dispersion levels indicated by the standard effect of mean pairwise distances (SES MPD). Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used for both the observed data and MSOM estimates, modeling numerous environmental covariates and the forest reserves as random effects, finding that the forest reserve random effects were mainly responsible for structuring the mammal communities. Deramakot Forest Reserve was found to have overall high species richness, phylogenetic and functional diversity compared to other reserves. This reserve has been particularly successful at sustainable forest management and long-term forest certification, highlighting long-term conservation gains of sustainability programs for terrestrial mammalian diversity. Conversely, several reserves showed lower diversity scores overall than IUCN presumed extant species lists, highlighting local defaunation while still retaining high profile (critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable) species. This study highlights the fragility of terrestrial mammal assemblages in forest reserves across the state and the need for mitigation, refaunation, and an integrated approach to forest management and biodiversity conservation to allow for comprehensive sustainable management programs to ensure long-term conservation.

TI  - Secondary forests as temporary carbon sinks?: The economic impact of accounting methods on reforestation projects in the tropics
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Tropical forestry is often not competitive with agricultural land uses such as pasture for cattle ranching. Additional revenues from carbon sequestration generated by the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol can change this situation. In three different zones of north-western Ecuador, minimum compensation payments for carbon sequestration were determined, which would make reforestation a feasible land-use alternative. Based on our findings that these minimum prices depend on the net benefit of the respective land-use alternatives, and on the accounting regimes for CDM sink projects, we applied the accounting rules for temporary and long-term Certified Emission Reductions (CER) to two reforestation projects: forest plantation and natural regrowth of secondary forest. A comparison of these alternatives showed that secondary forest is an attractive alternative under both accounting regimes because of its low establishment costs and relative early timber revenues. After identifying the zone most suitable for carbon sink projects, we calculated net benefits of land-use changes in the event that certain prices for emission reductions were actually paid. We found that secondary forest becomes economically attractive, if the price of permanent credits is above $4.5/tCO(2), whereas forest plantations require permanent CER prices of $7.0/tCO(2). In both cases, the results are within the price margins forecasted by various institutions for the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. The presented methodology is meant to support the decision making process on the supply side of a future CER market. Opportunity costs of land-use changes have to be analyzed carefully before deciding in favor of long binding forestry projects. Assigning temporary credits to naturally regrown secondary forests could-although excluded from CDM during the first commitment period-combine the advantages of a flexible accounting regime with the positive economic and ecological effects of this competitive land use.

TI  - Assessment of Soil Carbon Stock and Soil Quality in Different Forest Stands and Management Regimes in Terai Region of Nepal
T2  - SCIENTIFICA
AB  - Assessment of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock and soil quality for informed forest management is hindered by inadequate data across different forest stand types and management regimes. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess SOC stock and soil quality in two forest stand types, i.e., Shorea robusta (Sal) forest and Terai mixed hardwood (TMH) forest, and selected forest management regimes (leasehold forest, community forest, government-managed forest, and forest area under protected area) in Terai region of Nepal. Stratified random sampling method was adopted for soil sample collection across terai region following Forest Resource Assessment, Nepal. Altogether, 62 composite soil samples from 30 cm depth were taken from the entire Terai region which included these two forest stand types and four management regimes. Different physical (soil texture and bulk density) and chemical (pH, SOC (%), total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and available potassium) properties were analyzed to calculate SOC stock and soil quality. Our result found no significant differences in SOC stock among two forest stand types (p>0.05). Unexpectedly, leasehold forest had significantly (p<0.05) higher SOC stock than other forest management regimes. In terms of soil quality, among two forest stand types, Sal forest (0.50) was found to be superior compared with TMH forest (0.46). Similarly, community forest had superior soil quality (0.50) than government-managed forest (0.47), protected area (0.47), and leasehold forest (0.45). A longitudinal study approach is recommended to observe changes in soil properties over time due to climate change and human activities, offering valuable insights into their dynamics.

TI  - The institutional fit of peatland governance in Indonesia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - The Government of Indonesia has published a number of policies and regulations to better manage its vast amount of tropical peatland, yet the degradation and conversion of Indonesian peatlands still continues. This paper analyses the institutional fit between Indonesian regulations related to peatland use and the characteristics of peatland users. We reviewed Indonesian legal policies and regulations on peatland use and management and conducted questionnaires and interviews with peatland users and policy makers in order to understand their practices and incentives in relation to the implementation of the four main peatland regulations. We focus on two provinces with large peatland areas: Jambi and Central Kalimantan. Using a framework for assessing the degrees of fit between the rule creators and adopters for peatland management, this paper shows that the degree of technical, political, and cultural fit of Indonesian peatland regulations can be classified as low to moderate. The paper shows that many peatland users are insufficiently aware of peatland regulations. The lack of socialisation on the contents of the regulations and the alternatives for peatland best practices, together with the lack of field monitoring and law enforcement are the important causes of non-compliance with peatland regulations. However, there are ongoing processes of fitting visible that are largely driven by the local government and NGOs. We discuss the degrees of fit and present some lessons for increasing the degree of fit for peatland regulations.

TI  - Effects of nitrogen deposition on carbon sequestration in Chinese fir forest ecosystems
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Nitrogen deposition and its ecological effects on forest ecosystems have received global attention. We used the ecosystem model FORECAST to assess the effects of nitrogen deposition on carbon sequestration in Chinese fir planted forests in SE China. This topic is important as China is intensifying its reforestation efforts to increase forest carbon sequestration for combating climate change impacts, using Chinese fir as the most important plantation species. A series of scenarios including seven N deposition levels (1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 kg ha(-1) y(-1)), three management regime (rotation lengths of 15, 30 and 50 years) and two site qualities (nutrient poor and fertile sites) were defined for the simulations. Our results showed that N deposition increased carbon sequestration in Chinese fir forests, but the efficiency of the increasing effect is reduced as N deposition levels increase. When N deposition levels exceeded 20-30 kg ha(-1) y(-1), the incremental effects of N deposition on forest C pools were marginal. This suggests that N deposition levels above 20-30 kg ha(-1) y(-1) could lead to N saturation in Chinese fir forest soils. Any additional amounts of N input from deposition would likely be leached out. Total above-ground C was more sensitive to N deposition than to rotation length and site quality. It was also estimated that the contributions of N deposition to C sequestration in all Chinese fir forests in South-East China are 7.4 x 10(6) Mg Cy-1 under the current N deposition levels (5 to 10 kg ha(-1) y(-1)) and could reach up to 16 x 10(6) Mg Cy-1 if N deposition continues increasing and reaches levels of 7.5 to 15 kg N ha(-1) y(-1).

TI  - Metrics of water security, adaptive capacity, and agroforestry in Indonesia
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Mixed agroforestry systems offer opportunities to simultaneously meet the water, food, energy and income needs of densely populated rural and peri-urban areas in Indonesia. Water flows out of upland areas provide multiple ecosystem services to downstream areas that can be part of performance-based rewards, payments or co-investment in environmental stewardship. Metrics for measuring performance and negotiating accountability need to cover river (blue), soil + vegetation (green), recycled (gray) and atmospheric (rainbow) water in relation to specific stages in the water cycle and associated services. A typology of services and prototype payment mechanisms were derived from action research in Indonesia and elsewhere in Asia by the Rewarding Upland Poor for Environmental Services (RUPES) project. The ecological metrics of landscape performance can be combined with measures of human capacity to assess and support the resilience of social-ecological systems under climate change.

TI  - Sustainable intensification of dairy production can reduce forest disturbance in Kenyan montane forests
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Increasing demand for food and the shortage of arable land call for sustainable intensification of farming, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa where food insecurity is still a major concern. Kenya needs to intensify its dairy production to meet the increasing demand for milk. At the same time, the country has set national climate mitigation targets and has to implement land use practices that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from both agriculture and forests. This study analysed for the first time the drivers of forest disturbance and their relationship with dairy intensification across the largest montane forest of Kenya. To achieve this, a forest disturbance detection approach was applied by using Landsat time series and empirical data from forest disturbance surveys. Farm indicators and farm types derived from a household survey were used to test the effects of dairy intensification on forest disturbance for different farm neighbourhood sizes (r = 2-5 km). About 18% of the forest area was disturbed over the period 2010-2016. Livestock grazing and firewood extraction were the dominant drivers of forest disturbance at 75% of the forest disturbance spots sampled. Higher on-farm cattle stocking rates and firewood collection were associated with 1-10% increased risk of forest disturbance across farm neighbourhood sizes. In contrast, higher milk yields, increased supplementation with concentrated feeds and more farm area allocated to fodder production were associated with 1-7 % reduced risk of forest disturbance across farm neighbourhood sizes. More intensified farms had a significantly lower impact on forest disturbance than small and resource-poor farms, and large and inefficient farms. Our results show that intensification of smallholder dairy farming leads to both farm efficiency gains and reduced forest disturbance. These results can inform agriculture and forest mitigation policies which target options to reduce GHG emission intensities and the risk of carbon leakage.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variation of carbon stocks in a lowland tropical forest in West Africa
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Understanding the nature and cause of spatial and temporal variation in forest carbon is critical for implementation of climate mitigation strategies such as REDD. Such knowledge is lacking and hard to acquire in resource poor regions such as West Africa's Upper Guinea where benefits of such schemes for forest conservation could have great impact.
   We undertook a systematic and representative survey of an entire Upper Guinea forest - Gola Forest in southeast Sierra Leone - by measuring over 600 plots (0.125 ha) in order to quantify the level of spatial variation in C that might exist within a discrete forest type and relate this to historic and contemporary impacts on the forest. We modelled current C stocks and compared these with values calculated from historic surveys. Mean C content in above ground biomass was c. 160 Mg ha(-1). The southern part of the forest which was subject to heavier logging in the 1980s had a lower C content (121-144 Mg ha(-1)) compared to the less disturbed central areas (186 Mg ha(-1)). Volumes of extracted timber and distance to settlements around the forest explained 42% of the variation in C content. Elevation, slope and other metrics of human impact such as distance to roads did not explain significant additional variation. A survey from the 1950s recorded much higher carbon content than currently found in the south of the forest. This accords with evidence that commercial logging in this area was destructively high. However, old surveys from the late 1960s/early 1970s in less disturbed areas recorded lower carbon content than present. Most of the past surveys were in areas that had not yet been commercially logged so the accumulation in biomass in the last 40 years implies recovery from a much older disturbance event, or a change in environmental conditions promoting growth.
   As a typical Upper Guinean forest, our results from Gola demonstrate the long term impacts of disturbance events on carbon stocks and how these can vary greatly at small scales, highlighting the need for representative and regionally relevant empirical data to inform REDD type initiatives. Nonetheless these forests remain important for carbon sequestration and storage in the region despite this history and the parts of the forest with no recorded logging activity that increased in carbon in recent decades with levels now akin to undisturbed plots reported from elsewhere in the region demonstrate the sequestration potential these forests provide once adequately protected.

TI  - Carbon and nitrogen in a temperate agroforestry system: Using stable isotopes as a tool to understand soil dynamics
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Natural exchanges of carbon (C) between the atmosphere, the oceans, and terrestrial ecosystems are currently being modified through human activities as a result of fossil fuel burning and the conversion of tropical forests to agricultural land. These activities have led to a steady increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) over the last two Centuries. The goal of this study was to determine the potential of temperate agroforestry systems to sequester C in soil. Therefore, changes in the soil organic C (SOC) and nitrogen (N) pools were quantified and the delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotope technique was applied to assess soil C and N dynamics in a 13-year old hybrid poplar alley cropping system in Southern Canada. Results from this study showed that after 13 years of alley cropping the SOC and N pools did not differ significantly (p = 0.01) with distance from the tree row, although a trend of a larger SOC and N pool near the tree row could be observed. Soil organic C after 13 years of alley cropping, was 19 mg C g(-1) compared to 11 mg C g(-1) upon initiation of agroforestry. Soil organic C and N were not evenly distributed throughout the plow layer. The largest C and N pool occurred in the top 20 cm, which is due to the accumulation of organic material in the upper horizons as a result of no-till cultivation. The entire soil, to a 40 cm depth, showed a delta(13) C shift to that of C-3 residue. This shift reflects the greater input of residues from C3 plants such as that derived from beans, wheat, and hybrid poplar leaf litterfall. The proportion of C derived from a C-3 source ranged from 64 to 69% to a 40 cm depth. The soil delta N-15 signature of this study is similar to that of mineral soil, and reflect values characteristic of N mineralization processes. However, the entire soil shows a positive shift in delta N-15 as a result of historical additions of manure and current use of mineral fertilizers, and ongoing processes of denitrification and nitrate leaching, which leads to an enrichment of the soil.

TI  - Posts Supporting Anti-Environmental Policy in Brazil are Shared More on Social Media
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Weakening environmental laws supported by disinformation are currently of concern in Brazil. An example of disinformation is the case of the "firefighter cattle". Supporters of this idea believe that by consuming organic mass, cattle decrease the risk of fire in natural ecosystems. This statement was cited by a member of the Bolsonaro government in response to the unprecedented 2020 fires in the Pantanal, as well as in support of a new law that enables extensive livestock in protected areas of this biome. By suggesting that grazing benefits the ecosystem, the "firefighter cattle" argument supports the interests of agribusiness. However, it ignores the real costs of livestock production on biodiversity. We analysed the social repercussion of the "firefighter cattle" by analysing public reactions to YouTube, Facebook, and Google News posts. These videos and articles and the responses to them either agreed or disagreed with the "firefighter cattle". Supportive posts were shared more on social media and triggered more interactions than critical posts. Even though many netizens disagreed with the idea of "firefighter cattle", it has gone viral, and was used as a tool to strengthen anti-environmental policies. We advocate that government institutions should use resources and guidelines provided by the scientific community to raise awareness. These materials include international reports produced by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We need to curb pseudoscience and misinformation in political discourse, avoiding misconceptions that threaten natural resources and confuse global society.

TI  - Mammals Make Use of Cashew Plantations in a Mixed Forest-Cashew Landscape
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Heterogeneous landscapes harboring mosaics of natural habitat and agriculture are increasingly gaining conservation focus in the tropics. While research on cash crops such as coffee, rubber, and oil palm has led to an understanding of their role as supplementary habitats, such has remained limited in cashew plantations despite it being a cash crop of global significance. We conducted a study to understand the occurrence of terrestrial mammal species in a mixed forest-cashew landscape in the northern Western Ghats, India. During January to April 2016, we used trail cameras to sample a total area of 25 km(2) divided into 100 grid cells of 0.25 km(2) each. We deployed six trail cameras for a 24 h period in each grid cell and obtained photo-captures of 11 species in forests, of which nine were detected in cashew plantations, but most species showed low capture rates. For three of these species-Indian crested porcupine, sambar, and wild pig-we modeled habitat use as a function of site-specific attributes. Wild pig showed a higher probability of use of cashew than forest, while porcupine and sambar did not show any pronounced differences between the two land uses. The probability of habitat use by sambar and porcupine was positively influenced by undergrowth but not for the wild pig. Wild pig habitat use was positively related to increased proximity of human settlements and increasing distance to forests, but the pattern was unreliable for sambar and porcupine. Our preliminary study demonstrates that a subset of terrestrial mammals in the forest makes use of cashew plantations and highlights the need for further research in forest-cashew landscapes to assess conservation opportunities.

TI  - Evaluating the long-term impacts of promoting "green" agriculture in the Amazon
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Frontier development in the Brazilian Amazon has created vast areas of largely deforested landscapes. Conservation efforts in these post-frontier zones seek to protect the remaining forest fragments and promote sustainable agricultural practices that absorb labor, meet market demand, and generate ecosystem services. Assessments of these efforts often find that rates of sustained uptake are disappointingly low and that impacts are difficult to discern, but this could be due to the short-time frames of both the efforts themselves and their evaluation. We investigate the impacts of participation in an internationally sponsored farmer association that for 15 years promoted sustainable agricultural practices in the heavily deforested state of Rondonia, Brazil. Using data from a georeferenced four-period panel survey of farmers in combination with remote sensing data on land use spanning the life of the association, we apply matching methods to estimate the impacts of participation. We find that membership resulted in more diversified production systems, including more land allocated to agroforestry. Members also deforested less of their farms, but this difference is not statistically significant after we control for selection bias in membership.

TI  - Reduced availability of large seeds constrains Atlantic forest regeneration
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Secondary forests are expanding in defaunated fragmented tropical landscapes, but their resilience potential remains poorly understood. In this study we used a chronosequence of advancing (19-62-yr old) Atlantic forest regeneration following slash-and-burn agriculture to infer successional shifts in seed rain in terms of seed density, species richness, taxonomic and functional composition, and local spatial distribution. After monitoring seed rain during 12 months in 60 1-m(2) seed traps, we recorded over 400,000 seeds belonging to 180 morphospecies. From early to late-successional stage, seed rain decreased in density, increased in per capita species richness, gradually changed in species composition, and became less aggregated spatially. Regardless the age of forest stand, vertebrate-dispersed seeds accounted for 67-75% of all species recorded. Large-seeded species typical of old-growth forests, on the other hand, accounted for only 5-8% of the species recorded in the seed rain, a proportion around five times smaller than that reported for the old-growth forests of the same study site (31%). Our results suggest that the secondary forests considered, which are embedded in one of the largest (3500 ha) and best preserved remnant of the severely fragmented Atlantic forest of Northeast Brazil, may fail attaining older successional stages due to the reduced availability of large-seeded late-successional species. This regeneration constraint may be even stronger in smaller, more isolated forest remnants of the region, potentially reducing their ability to provide ecosystem services.

TI  - Characterization of wood from Schizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum Huber x Ducke trees from a multi-stratified agroforestry system established in the Amazon rainforest
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - In response to the challenge of harmonizing agricultural production with sustainable environmental management, setting up of agroforestry systems (AFSs) is an appealing alternative that combines crops and wood production with ecosystem services. In this context, Schizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum Huber x Ducke (parica) has shown good silvicultural performance in AFSs. Nevertheless, the properties of its wood when grown in AFSs are not widely reported in the literature. The present study aimed to characterize parica wood regarding its technological characteristics and industrial applications. Wood was obtained from a multi-stratified AFS in midwestern Rondonia state, northern Brazil. The AFS is composed of perennial crops and forest species cultivated in double rows with spacing of 5.0 m x 2.5 m. Experimental results showed parica wood had low extractives content and density along with good dimensional stability. However, the wood's mechanical performance was similar to that observed in material from pure plantations and pristine forests. Specific strength was similar to wood species with higher basic densities. Parica wood reached the minimum requirements for structural uses and had suitable characteristics to be employed to produce engineered wood panels.

TI  - Soil Respiration in Planted and Naturally Regenerated Castanopis carelesii Forests during Three Years Post-Establishment
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Reforestation through assisted natural regeneration usually accumulates more biomass carbon than through tree planting, but its effects on soil respiration (Rs) and its components, autotrophic respiration (Ra) and heterotrophic respiration (Rh), are poorly understood despite the importance in forest carbon cycling. In this study, we clear-cut part of a 35-year-old secondary Castanopsis carelesii (C. carelesii) forest and reforested the logged land with C. carelesii via two approaches-active tree planting and assisted natural regeneration-and measured Rs, Ra, and Rh as well as soil temperature and moisture in these forests. In the first two years following reforestation, Rs, Ra and Rh rates were mostly reduced in the two young forests compared to the secondary forest, likely due to reduced photosynthate production and thus carbon substrate input associated with the clear-cut. However, the Rh:Rs ratio was significantly greater in the young plantation than in the other two forests in the first two years, suggesting a greater loss of soil organic carbon from the young plantation. In the third year, the mean Rs, Rh, and Ra rates of the young forest established via assisted natural regeneration were similar to those of the secondary forest, but significantly greater than those of the young plantation. The rates of Rs, Rh, and Ra mostly increased exponentially with increasing soil temperature in all forests, but mostly lack significant relationships with soil moisture. These findings indicate that, compared with reforestation via tree plantation, assisted natural regeneration not only reduced the loss of soil organic carbon via soil respiration, but also had a more rapid recovery of soil respiration to the level of the secondary forest. Our study highlights that, in addition to temperature, carbon substrate availability is also important in regulating soil respiration following reforestation.

TI  - Conservation status of forests and wildlife in the Eastern Ghats, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
AB  - The Eastern Ghats (EGs) comprise a chain of ancient low hills in the state of Andhra Pradesh adjoining the east coast of India. These hill ranges are well known for a rich array of tropical forests with great conservation significance which support large human populations. A series of protected areas (PAs) have been established by the government along these ranges to conserve the regional biodiversity, but their effectiveness is often questionable. In order to assess the ecological status of the forests both within and outside the PAs and to assess the impacts of ongoing forestry practices a survey was conducted along the EGs. Plant species richness, and density of shrubs and trees, were estimated along disturbance gradients (core, buffer and fringe situations) using random plots of 10-m radius for trees, and 5-m radius (nested) plots for shrubs and saplings. Indirect evidence (spoor) of domestic and wild animals was recorded within the sample plots to compare habitat use by the animals.
   Srivenkateshwara National Park in the Seshachalam Hills, Gundlabrahmeshwaram Sanctuary in Nallamalais and some parts of Srisailam-Nagarjunasagar Tiger Reserve, had the least degraded forests due to their PA status. However, collection of non-timber forest products, bamboo harvesting and livestock grazing continues in all areas irrespective of legal status. All bamboo areas have been heavily worked. It is recommended that bamboo working should be stopped in core areas of the PAs and reduced from nine to six months (October to March) in the buffer zones. Summer is a period of potential water shortage for wild animals and bamboo workers' camps near water courses may affect habitat use by these species.
   The proposed Gudem Maripakhala Sanctuary, well known for its biogeographical value and diverse nora, is seriously threatened as a result of to extensive 'podu' (slash and burn) cultivation. It is suggested that an integrated approach to biodiversity conservation and better agricultural practices, should be adopted in this area. Some of the primary and old growth forests should be identified, mapped and given immediate protection, until a scientifically-based management plan is developed.

TI  - Monitoring vegetation dynamics with open earth observation tools: the case of fire-modulated savanna to forest transitions in Central Africa
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Woody encroachment and forest progression are widespread in forest-savanna transitional areas in Central Africa. Quantifying these dynamics and understanding their drivers at relevant spatial scales has long been a challenge. Recent progress in open access imagery sources with improved spatial, spectral and temporal resolution combined with cloud computing resources, and the advent of relatively cheap solutions to deploy laser sensors in the field, have transformed this domain of study. We present a study case in the Mpem & Djim National Park (MDNP), a 1,000 km(2) protected area in the Centre region of Cameroon. Using open source algorithms in Google Earth Engine (GEE), we characterized vegetation dynamics and the fire regime based on Landsat multispectral imagery archive (1975-2020). Current species assemblages were estimated from Sentinel 2 imagery and the open source biodivMapR package, using spectral dissimilarity. Vegetation structure (aboveground biomass; AGB) was characterized using Unmanned Aerial vehicle (UAV) LiDAR scanning data sampled over the study area. Savanna vegetation, which was initially dominant in the MDNP, lost about 50% of its initial cover in <50 years in favor of forest at an average rate of ca. 0.63%.year(-1) (6 km(2).year(-1)). Species assemblage computed from spectral dissimilarity in forest vegetation followed a successional gradient consistent with forest age. AGB accumulation rate was 3.2 Mg.ha(-1).year(-1) after 42 years of forest encroachment. In savannas, two modes could be identified along the gradient of spectral species assemblage, corresponding to distinct AGB levels, where woody savannas with low fire frequency store 40% more AGB than open grassy savannas with high fire frequency. A fire occurrence every five year was found to be the fire regime threshold below which woody savannas start to dominate over grassy ones. A fire frequency below that threshold opens the way to young forest transitions. These results have implications for carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation policies. Maintaining savanna ecosystems in the region would require active management actions to limit woody encroachment and forest progression, in contradiction with global reforestation goals.

TI  - Grassland vegetation and roads have dominant influence on decadal-scale spatial-temporal patterns of fires in a species-rich protected Terai habitat in northeastern India
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - The Terai ecoregion of the Himalayan foothills is among the most fire-affected ecosystems in the Indian subcontinent. Although most of the Terai has already been lost to agriculture and urbanization, the few remaining native habitats are strictly protected due to their high biodiversity and ecological importance. The use of fires to maintain vegetation and wildlife habitat in these protected areas is an integral part of forest management. Although fires are initiated by forest managers or local people, their eventual spread and behaviour are not controlled. We hypothesize that distributions of fires are determined by several direct and indirect drivers like fuel load, fuel moisture content, presence of natural or artificial fire breaks, and climatic attributes of precipitation and temperature. Using the moderate-resolution (375m) satellite sensor-based data we studied the environmental influence on the spatial-temporal patterns of fire events over 18 years (2000-2018) in a 519 km(2) protected area in northeastern India. The park has a mosaic of vegetation formations - including dry and swampy alluvial grassland, early successional woodland, and moist tropical forest. Despite high rainfall, there is an intense dry season that renders the herbaceous vegetation susceptible to fires. Using spatial and spatial-temporal Poisson regression models in a rigorous conditional autoregressive Bayesian framework, we found that net primary productivity (a proxy of vegetation type and fuel load), distance to roads (a measure of human influence), elevation (through its influence on floods and vegetation type), and river area extent (by determining the area under vegetation) had a significant influence on the spatial distributions of fires. The climatic signal on interannual variation in fires was weak, but dry season rainfall reduced fire incidence. The disproportionate distribution of fires adjacent to roads compared to the interior, and the repeated burning of some grassland patches need to be addressed in fire management.

TI  - Discerning Fragmentation Dynamics of Tropical Forest and Wetland during Reforestation, Urban Sprawl, and Policy Shifts
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Despite the overall trend of worldwide deforestation over recent decades, reforestation has also been found and is expected in developing countries undergoing fast urbanization and agriculture abandonment. The consequences of reforestation on landscape patterns are seldom addressed in the literature, despite their importance in evaluating biodiversity and ecosystem functions. By analyzing long-term land cover changes in Puerto Rico, a rapidly reforested (6 to 42% during 1940-2000) and urbanized tropical island, we detected significantly different patterns of fragmentation and underlying mechanisms among forests, urban areas, and wetlands. Forest fragmentation is often associated with deforestation. However, we also found significant fragmentation during reforestation. Urban sprawl and suburb development have a dominant impact on forest fragmentation. Reforestation mostly occurs along forest edges, while significant deforestation occurs in forest interiors. The deforestation process has a much stronger impact on forest fragmentation than the reforestation process due to their different spatial configurations. In contrast, despite the strong interference of coastal urbanization, wetland aggregation has occurred due to the effective implementation of laws/ regulations for wetland protection. The peak forest fragmentation shifted toward rural areas, indicating progressively more fragmentation in forest interiors. This shift is synchronous with the accelerated urban sprawl as indicated by the accelerated shift of the peak fragmentation index of urban cover toward rural areas, i.e., 1.37% yr(-1) in 1977-1991 versus 2.17% yr(-1) in 1991-2000. Based on the expected global urbanization and the regional forest transition from deforested to reforested, the fragmented forests and aggregated wetlands in this study highlight possible forest fragmentation processes during reforestation in an assessment of biodiversity and functions and suggest effective laws/regulations in land planning to reduce future fragmentation.

TI  - Adoption and Diversity of Agroforestry Systems in the Amazon Biome: A Bibliometric Overview
T2  - LAND
AB  - Agroforestry systems (AFSs) exhibit varied composition and dynamics as intrinsic characteristics of their specificities. In this context, a review of the adoption, composition, and dynamics of AFSs in the Amazon biome was conducted to identify the origin, institutions, and researchers of published studies with results on this scientific topic, focused on trends and characteristics of AFSs diversity in the Amazon. The methodology adopted was a scoping review, based on searches in the Scopus and Web of Science databases, using specific keywords to ensure that the articles addressed topics related to the adoption, composition, and dynamics of AFSs in the Amazon. Following the selection of subtopics, 66 articles were selected and analyzed. The analysis revealed that research on AFSs in the Amazon highlights interactions among traditional knowledge, innovations, and sustainability. The analysis of research published between 1996 and 2023 indicated growth in studies with an interdisciplinary focus, primarily from Brazil. However, internationalization, collaborative networks, and funding factors contribute to the prominence of foreign institutions. Research studies often address topics such as species diversity, agrobiodiversity, and tree growth in agroforestry intercrops. In this context, homegarden agroforestry (HAF) emerges as one of the main subjects of study, encompassing multifunctional environments, richness diversity, and ongoing experimentation with plant species. The choice of species for AFSs is influenced by factors such as labor, personal preferences, and market demands, although loggers and commercial forestry systems tend to have lower diversity, contrasting with HAF. AFSs implementation methods vary according to financing, management, and the farmer's education and gender. Environmental conservation, food security, ecosystem services, and production flexibility are highlighted as benefits of AFSs, while challenges include technical and economic limitations. This research highlights the strengthening and consolidation of AFSs by addressing scientific gaps and demonstrating the need for studies on the adoption, consolidation, and management of these systems, as well as the relationship between diversity and yield. Future research should be concentrated on deepening studies on the relationship between diversity and yield in AFSs, as well as on management strategies that support the consolidation of these systems in the Amazon biome, integrating innovation, public policy support, and traditional knowledge of farmers.

TI  - Can traditional selective logging secure tree regeneration in cloud forest?
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
AB  - Unplanned selective logging for charcoal and firewood is a common practice in tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF), a high priority ecosystem for biodiversity conservation at the global scale. However, limited information is available regarding the impact of such logging on forest regeneration. We evaluated the abundance and composition of tree regeneration in four TMCF sites subject to traditional selective logging in southern Mexico. At each site, we calculated a tree extraction index based on the number of stumps, logs and charcoal kilns and established six 200 m(2) plots where the abundance of adult, sapling and seedling trees were recorded and canopy cover estimated. Based on the extraction index and estimated basal area values, two sites each were classified as being of low (L) and high (H) logging intensity; the extraction index was three times lower in L (7.5 and 9.2) than in H (35 and 35) sites, while basal area was significantly higher in L than in H sites (80.2 +/- 10.2 vs. 41.9 +/- 4.96 m(2) ha(-1), respectively). No significant differences were found among sites in terms of canopy cover, diameter and density of adult trees or in the density of saplings and seedlings (0.72 individuals m(-2)). In all sites, species of intermediate shade-tolerance dominated the regeneration (76%), followed by the shade-tolerant (23%) and pioneer (1%) species. Regeneration of Quercus spp. (four species) dominated at all sites (50.5%); this is a group of particular interest to the local communities because of its utility for firewood and charcoal. The similarity in composition between adult and regenerating tree species was relatively high in all of the sites (Morisita-Horn Index L1=0.86, L2=0.64, H1=0.69 and H2=0.71). These results indicate that, under the evaluated selective logging intensities, TMCF can sustain sufficient regeneration of Quercus spp. and thus presents an opportunity for sustainable management. The legacy effects of traditional selective logging on TMCF tree regeneration are discussed.

TI  - Grassland afforestation with Eucalyptus affect Collembola communities and soil functions in southern Brazil
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Afforestation of subtropical grasslands increased during the last decade and their impacts on soil biota and functions are not well known. Here we investigated the effects of grassland afforestation with Eucalyptus on soil Collembola communities in southern Brazil. By using paired transects (native grassland vs. plantation), we assessed Collembola taxonomic and functional composition and diversity and their relations with plant diversity and soil microbial and physical-chemical parameters. Eucalyptus plantations significantly decreased plant richness, soil pH, and soil temperature. Microbial biomass, soil basal respiration and enzyme activities were negatively affected by grassland afforestation, which may indicate an effect on decomposition, soil fertility, and carbon stock. At a regional scale, grassland afforestation diminished the richness, and at a local scale changed the taxonomic and functional composition of Collembola communities. An environmental filtering mechanism is suggested triggering trait turnover from open (grassland) to a closed canopy habitat (tree plantation). While grassland presented high abundance of larger, eyed, and pigmented Collembola, Eucalyptus favored smaller, blind, and non-pigmented Collembola with shadow-adapted sensorial structures. Our results on afforestation effects in subtropical grasslands are similar to those described for temperate zone, and may underpin the development of conservation strategies for land-use on subtropical grasslands.

Government and other forest stakeholders in Nepal are, however, still reluctant to promote active management of production forests for fear of negative impacts on forest biodiversity. Moreover, Nepal's government is converting production forests into protected areas thus restricting the area available for multiple uses. To assess the implications of forest management practices on forest biodiversity at landscape level, we compared the richness and composition of tree species among regularly harvested community forests, irregularly harvested community forests, protected area and national forests in sub-tropical forested landscape of Nepal using tree species inventory and assessment of key environmental variables. Results showed that regularly harvested community forests could be effective in supporting tree species richness and composition compared to other management regimes. Results supported the hypothesis that high forest disturbance and no disturbance do not support tree species diversity and composition. In addition, this study found that regularly managed community forests also protect ecologically important and vulnerable tree species. Some possible explanations for the better performance of these community forests could be tenure security, frequency and regularity of silvicultural operations and sensitivity of forest users to the ecological aspects of forest management. Our study reaffirmed the need for active forest management at the local level to contribute to global conservation initiatives such as sustainable forest management, reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD+) and biodiversity conservation. Better compliance with forest management plans and capacity development of local forestry stakeholders in forest management operations are suggested for managing forests outside protected areas that is, in national and community forests.

TI  - Silvicultural opportunities for increasing carbon stock in restoration of Atlantic forests in Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Deforestation for urbanization and agriculture expansion drastically reduced the area of the Atlantic forest biome in Brazil. To reverse this process, rehabilitating degraded lands, restoration plantations with native tree species show significant potential to rebuild the forest habitat and promoting carbon sequestration. High input silviculture (intensive fertilization and weed control), similar to those applied in commercial production forest plantations can increase productivity, accelerating forest restoration process. We evaluated the effects of two contrasting silvicultural systems, "traditional" (based on common silviculture of forest reforestation in Brazil - low input) and "intensive" (based on commercial plantations - high input) on carbon (C) stocks of a restoration plantation. We also compared the plantations with a mature forest remnant. Six years after planting, forest C stock (coarse roots and aboveground biomass) under intensive silviculture reached 23.3 Mg C ha(-1), more than 3-fold the stock under traditional silviculture (6.9 Mg C ha(-1)). Under both silvicultural systems, soil showed constant C stock (average of 33 Mg C ha(-1)). The C accumulation in biomass with intensive silviculture reached 12.8% of that stored in the mature forest (181.5 Mg C ha(-1)), compared with just 3.8% for traditional silviculture. Intensive silviculture provided nutrients and reduced competition with weeds, increasing growth and carbon sequestration. Forest plantations aiming at restoration and also carbon sequestration are practicable, and are highly responsive to intensive silviculture. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Carbon sequestration potential of tropical pasture compared with afforestation in Panama
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Tropical forest ecosystems play an important role in regulating the global climate, yet deforestation and land-use change mean that the tropical carbon sink is increasingly influenced by agroecosystems and pastures. Despite this, it is not yet fully understood how carbon cycling in the tropics responds to land-use change, particularly for pasture and afforestation. Thus, the objectives of our study were: (1) to elucidate the environmental controls and the impact of management on gross primary production (GPP), total ecosystem respiration (TER) and net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE); (2) to estimate the carbon sequestration potential of tropical pasture compared with afforestation; and (3) to compare eddy covariance-derived carbon budgets with biomass and soil inventory data. We performed comparative measurements of NEE in a tropical C-4 pasture and an adjacent afforestation with native tree species in Sardinilla (Panama) from 2007 to 2009. Pronounced seasonal variation in GPP, TER and NEE were closely related to radiation, soil moisture, and C-3 vs. C-4 plant physiology. The shallow rooting depth of grasses compared with trees resulted in a higher sensitivity of the pasture ecosystem to water limitation and seasonal drought. During 2008, substantial amounts of carbon were sequestered by the afforestation (-442 gCm(-2), negative values denote ecosystem carbon uptake), which was in agreement with biometric observations (-450 gCm(-2)). In contrast, the pasture ecosystem was a strong carbon source in 2008 and 2009 (261 gCm(-2)), associated with seasonal drought and overgrazing. In addition, soil carbon isotope data indicated rapid carbon turnover after conversion from C-4 pasture to C-3 afforestation. Our results clearly show the potential for considerable carbon sequestration of tropical afforestation and highlight the risk of carbon losses from pasture ecosystems in a seasonal tropical climate.

TI  - Conservation of Plant Diversity in Agroforestry Systems in a Biodiversity Hotspot Region of Northeast India
T2  - AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
AB  - In Assam, a north-eastern state of India, most of the traditional agroforestry systems are still practised. The plant species composition of three agroforestry systems namely homegardens tea gardens and agrisilvicultural systems, were assessed using quadrat method. A total of 516 plant species belonging to 241 genera under 91 families were recorded, which consisted of 134 trees, 143 shrubs (67 shrub species and 76 species of saplings) and 239 herbs (93 herb species, 33 climber species and 113 species of seedlings). Homegardens had the highest species richness (475 plant species) belonging to 234 genera under 90 families. This was followed by agrisilvicultural systems (101 spp., 43 genera, 29 families), and the least was in tea gardens (79 spp., 41 genera, 25 families). The highest average number of plant species per system was recorded in homegarden (108.96 +/- 5.96, range 23-207 spp.). A negative correlation was found between the agroforestry system plot size and plant species richness. Sorenson's similarity index showed a very low degree of similarity in the plant species recorded among the three selected systems. Out of 516 plant species recorded across the different agroforestry systems, 1.0% species (n = 3) were vulnerable (Aquilaria malaccensis, Saraca asoca and Santalum album), 8.9% species (n = 46) were least concerned, 1.6% species (n = 8) were data deficient and 88.6% species (n = 457) were not assessed. Only homegarden recorded all the three plant species under the vulnerable category of IUCN Red List. It can be concluded that the agroforestry systems, specially the homegardens harbour rich plant diversity and act as miniature versions of natural forests by conserving rare, threatened and data-deficient plant species. The results suggest that the agroforestry systems with some management interventions need to be promoted as conservation models in areas with high pressure on tropical forests.

TI  - Quercus wutaishanica shrub affects temperate forest community composition and soil properties under different restoration stage
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Quercus wutaishanica is the dominant tree species in the natural ecosystem restoration of temperate forests in China, and it plays an active role in maintaining ecological balance. However, little is known about how ecosystem versatility develops during the restoration of forest ecosystems dominated by Q. wutaishanica. In this study, we investigated the species composition of the Q. wutaishanica community, soil nutrients, and their functional traits at various restoration stages, and comprehensively analyzed the correlations among them. At the early stage of restoration (10 years of restoration), there were Spiraea pubescens and Syringa pubescens in Q. wutaishanica community (87% of the total species), while had a larger niche width. In the middle of restoration (30 years of restoration), shannon and evenness indices were the largest, while soil total carbon, ammonium nitrogen and chlorophyll content of Q. wutaishanica leaves were the highest; among them, soil total carbon was 15.7% higher than that in 10 years of restoration, 32.4% higher than that in 40 years of restoration, ammonium nitrogen was 71.7% higher than that in 40 years of restoration, and chlorophyll content was 217.9% higher than that in 10 years of restoration, and 51.8% higher than that in 40 years of restoration. At the later stage of restoration (40 years of restoration), Lonicera ferdinandii occupied the dominant ecological niche, and soil available nitrogen, available phosphorus content and leaf thickness were the largest; while AN was 10.9% higher than that of 10 years of restoration, 16.5% higher than that of 30 years of restoration, AP was 60.6% higher than that of 10 years of restoration, 21.6% higher than that of 30 years of restoration, leaf thickness was 22.3% higher than that of 10 years of restoration, 84.9% higher than that of 30 years of restoration. However, the restriction of various soil nutrients was reduced. Our study highlighted the effectiveness of soil resource availability in plant communities during restoration, reduced competition for light among plants, and altered species richness. Furthermore, changes in the interrelationship between plant community composition and leaf functional traits of the dominant species responded positively to community restoration. These results further deepen our understanding of forest management and restoration of forest communities. In the future, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the influence of various factors on forest community restoration.

TI  - Quantifying landscape fragmentation and forest carbon dynamics over 35 years in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - The Brazilian Atlantic Forest (AF) covers 13% of Brazil but retains only 26% of its original forest area. Utilizing a Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA), we generated 30 m spatial resolution fragmentation maps for old-growth and secondary forests across the AF. We quantified landscape fragmentation patterns and carbon (C) dynamics over 35 years using MapBiomas data between the years 1985 and 2020. We found that from 1985 to 2020 the forest suffered continuous fragmentation, losing core (nuclei forest fragments) and bridge (areas that connect different core areas) components of the landscape. About 87.5% (290 468.4 km2) of the remaining forest lacked core areas, with bridges (38.0%) and islets (small, isolated fragments) (35.4%) being predominant. Secondary forests (1986-2020) accounted for 99 450.5 km2 and played a significant role in fragmentation pattern, constituting 44.9% of the areas affected by edge effects (perforation, edge, bridge, and loop), 53.7% of islets, and comprising only 1.4% of core forest. Additionally, regeneration by secondary forests contributed to all fragmentation classes in 2020. Even with the regrowth of forests, the total forested area in the biome did not increase between 1985 and 2020. Deforestation emissions reached 818 Tg CO2, closely paralleled by edge effects emissions at 810 Tg CO2, highlighting a remarkable parity in C emissions between the two processes. Despite slow changes, AF biome continues to lose its C stocks. We estimated that around 1.96 million hectares (19 600 km2) of regenerated forest would be required to offset the historical C emissions over the analysed period. Hence, MSPA can support landscape monitoring, optimizing natural or active forest regeneration to reduce fragmentation and enhance C stocks. Our study's findings are critical for guiding land-use policies focusing on minimizing emissions, promoting forest regrowth, and monitoring its permanence. This study offers biome scale, spatially explicit information, critical for AF conservation and management.

TI  - Tree diversity effects on soil microbial biomass and respiration are context dependent across forest diversity experiments
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB  - Aim Soil microorganisms are essential for the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Although soil microbial communities and functions are linked to tree species composition and diversity, there has been no comprehensive study of the generality or context dependence of these relationships. Here, we examine tree diversity-soil microbial biomass and respiration relationships across environmental gradients using a global network of tree diversity experiments. Location Boreal, temperate, subtropical and tropical forests. Time period 2013. Major taxa studied Soil microorganisms. Methods Soil samples collected from 11 tree diversity experiments were used to measure microbial respiration, biomass and respiratory quotient using the substrate-induced respiration method. All samples were measured using the same analytical device, method and procedure to reduce measurement bias. We used linear mixed-effects models and principal components analysis (PCA) to examine the effects of tree diversity (taxonomic and phylogenetic), environmental conditions and interactions on soil microbial properties. Results Abiotic drivers, mainly soil water content, but also soil carbon and soil pH, significantly increased soil microbial biomass and respiration. High soil water content reduced the importance of other abiotic drivers. Tree diversity had no effect on the soil microbial properties, but interactions with phylogenetic diversity indicated that the effects of diversity were context dependent and stronger in drier soils. Similar results were found for soil carbon and soil pH. Main conclusions Our results indicate the importance of abiotic variables, especially soil water content, for maintaining high levels of soil microbial functions and modulating the effects of other environmental drivers. Planting tree species with diverse water-use strategies and structurally complex canopies and high leaf area might be crucial for maintaining high soil microbial biomass and respiration. Given that greater phylogenetic distance alleviated unfavourable soil water conditions, reforestation efforts that account for traits improving soil water content or select more phylogenetically distant species might assist in increasing soil microbial functions.

TI  - Forest Conservation Through Markets? A Discourse Network Analysis of the Debate on Funding Mechanisms for REDD plus in Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNICATION-A JOURNAL OF NATURE AND CULTURE
AB  - One of the most contentious issues surrounding the forest conservation program REDD+ is the question whether it should be funded via international carbon markets. The controversy between market supporters and opponents has been especially marked in the public debate in Brazil, one of the main potential beneficiaries of REDD+ payments. In a remarkable shift of policy, the Brazilian Federal Government gave up its long-standing opposition to market-based funding in the run-up to the COP15, following several years of competition between two main discourse coalitions and their preferred story lines. These were analyzed here with discourse network analytical techniques. Brazil's policy change may in part be explained by the failure of market opponents to employ positive arguments about alternative funding mechanisms, such as a public fund model; and by the increasing discursive dominance of a third emerging discourse coalition, which adopted major arguments of both sides in the debate. The research presented here thus provides more general insights on the dynamics of public debates, discourse coalitions, and the impacts of discursive strategies on policy-making, as well as on the value of discourse network analysis as a research method.

TI  - Towards better use of Indonesian peatlands with paludiculture and low-drainage food crops
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The current drainage-based peatland management systems in Indonesia result in high fire risks, soil subsidence and CO2 emissions. This study aims to assess different alternatives of peatland crops in order to help prevent further degradation of peatlands in Indonesia. We focus on tropical peatland crops that provide food and that are of particular interest to smallholders. We compare various peatland food crops that are commonly grown with no drainage (paludiculture) or drainage below 50 cm in our study area, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia in terms of sustainability, profitability, scalability of the market and acceptability to farmers. Our results show that sago (Metroxylon sagu), banana (Musa paradisiaca) and pineapple (Ananas comosus) followed by water spinach/kangkong (Ipomoea aquatica), kelakai/edible fern (Stenochlaena palustris), illipe nut/tengkawang (Shorea spp.), dragon fruit (Hylocereus undatus), mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana) and sweet melon/melon (Cucumis melo) are the best options based on the aggregated scores for these criteria (but precaution should be taken when planting crops that require low drainage). Sago palm and illipe nut have the highest scores for both sustainability and scalability of market, whereas banana, pineapple and sweet melon have the highest scores in term of the scalability of market and acceptability to farmers. We also address key opportunities and bottlenecks for the development of paludiculture food crops and present recommendations for the implementation of paludiculture in Indonesian peatlands.

TI  - Effects of the herbicide trifluralin in the initial development of Piptadenia gonoacantha (Fabales: Fabaceae)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYTOREMEDIATION
AB  - Trifluralin, a pre-emergent herbicide, is widely used in Brazil in the weed grass management in restoration areas. The objective was to evaluate the tolerance of Piptadenia gonoacantha to trifluralin. The treatments had three trifluralin doses (445, 890, and 1335 g a.i. ha(-1)), applied in pre-sowing, as well as the control, without herbicide. Visual intoxication, seed germination, survival rate, emergence speed index (EMI), mean germination period, seedling height, and diameter, micromorphometric parameters of plant roots collected at 60 d after sowing, root length (RL) and volume, leaf area (LA), leaf numbers, root and shoot dry matter, and fluorescence of chlorophyll a at 30, 45, and 60 d after sowing were analyzed. Visual intoxication values above 50% were observed only with 1335 g a.i. ha(-1). The herbicide did not affect seed germination, EMI, average germination period, seedling height, and diameter, root micromorphometric parameters, length, dry matter or root volume, and chlorophyll a fluorescence. The dose 1335 g a.i. ha(-1) caused a reduction of 41.5% in survival, 50.3% in the LA, 36.7% in the number of leaves (LN), and 59.8% in the aerial dry mass of seedlings. The trifluralin presents potential for restoration programs of degraded areas with this forest species.

TI  - Exploring Futures for Amazonia's Sierra del Divisor: An Environmental Valuation Triadics Approach to Analyzing Ecological Economic Decision Choices in the Context of Major Shifts in Boundary Conditions
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This text presents a new methodological approach to ecological economic analysis, employing Georgescu-Roegen's flow-fund theory of economic process, It offers an alternative to monetary valuation based analyses and aims to contribute toward advancing work concerned with addressing complex ecological economic questions as complete wholes. The methodology is demonstrated through reference to the empirical case of a proposed rail link between Peru and Brazil, which would cut across the Sierra del Divisor of western Amazonia, connecting the Pacific and Atlantic coasts and further opening up the Amazon commodity frontier. In order to analyze the potential impacts of the rail-link, four flow-fund representations of economic process (two at the regional and two at the local level) are developed in order to juxtapose two alternative political economy contexts that might govern the rail-link's impacts in the region: one where conservation is prioritized over cash income and one where it is not. Our results suggest that completion of the rail-link under the current political economy context, which prioritizes cash income over conservation, is likely to have substantial negative consequences for forest conservation in both Peru and Brazil and for local livelihoods throughout the region.

TI  - What, when, who and how? A review of peatland research in Amazonia
T2  - MIRES AND PEAT
AB  - Amazonia is believed to harbour the world's most extensive tropical peatlands, storing significant amounts of carbon and having high value for biodiversity conservation, climate regulation and human welfare. However, a comprehensive assessment is hampered by fragmentary knowledge of the locations of peat -covered areas and this, in turn, prevents their protection and restoration in the face of ongoing anthropogenic destruction. The study reported here reviewed research activities on peatlands in Amazonia, which started with ecological studies in the 1950s. We found a broad and significant thematic increase since 2009, with growing focus first on carbon accumulation and greenhouse gas fluxes then, after 2017, on degradation and conservation, along with a spatial imbalance in favour of the Peruvian lowlands. Hitherto, very little scientific attention has been directed towards the peatlands of western Brazil, the Bolivian lowlands and the Guianas. Most research in Amazonia has been conducted by international institutions with, in recent times, increasing contributions from local institutes and research groups. Nevertheless, research on Amazonian peatlands is still in its early stages, and several scientific questions remain unanswered. Advancing the knowledge base with respect to various scientific disciplines (e.g., ecology, biology, geography, social sciences and economics) is, therefore, essential for understanding how and where peatlands developed, how they are used, which ecosystem services they provide, how climate change will affect them and, finally, what would be the most appropriate conservation, restoration and sustainable use strategies for safeguarding the wellbeing of both peatlands and people.

TI  - The impact of grazing on dung beetle diversity depends on both biogeographical and ecological context
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB  - AimWe analysed the effects of grazing on the diversity and structure of dung beetle communities to see whether the biogeographical and ecological contexts influence dung beetle responses. We hypothesized that the responses of dung beetle communities are modulated by both the ecological conditions resulting from the transformation of native vegetation into grazing areas, and the history of the species inhabiting different biogeographical provinces.
   LocationThe state of Hidalgo, in the Mexican Transition Zone, central Mexico.
   MethodsWe used a standardized hierarchical sampling procedure in three biogeographical provinces located in Hidalgo. Within each province, we identified the dominant vegetation types, and within these we identified the sites with native vegetation and those modified by grazing. The design included 800 baited pitfall traps, and allowed us to study the response of dung beetle communities with different biogeographical histories to ecological context.
   ResultsWe captured 8707 beetles belonging to 37 species and 17 genera in the subfamily Scarabaeinae. We found that grazing areas only had a negative effect on dung beetle diversity in tropical forest; conversely, in dry environments (pine-oak forest and xerophilous scrubland) diversity in grazing areas was higher than in the native vegetation sites. We did not detect a clear effect in cloud forest sites. Species turnover between the native vegetation and pastures was high locally, and low over larger spatial scales (vegetation type or biogeographical province). In all four vegetation types grazing was associated with differences in dung beetle community composition.
   Main conclusionsThe impact of grazing on dung beetle diversity is dependent to a considerable degree on the local ecological conditions and the biogeographical context that has shaped the composition of communities over time.

TI  - DETERMINATION OF AREAS VULNERABLE TO EROSION AND PRIORITY AREAS FOR RECOVERY IN THE WATERSHED OF POTENGI RIVER - RN
T2  - REVISTA DE GESTAO AMBIENTAL E SUSTENTABILIDADE-GEAS
AB  - Purpose: The study aims to identify areas vulnerable to soil loss in the Potengi River hydrographic basin (BHRP) in Rio Grande do Norte, through a multicriteria analysis involving various geo-environmental attributes, in order to guide efforts towards efficient actions for the Recovery of Degraded Areas (RAD). Methodology: Data on geology, climate, geomorphology, pedology, hydrographic network, and interpretation of land cover and land use were collected. Through map algebra, it was possible to model the landscape of the basin and locate the areas most vulnerable to soil loss. Originality/Relevance: After the investigation using geoprocessing, the results generated in the form of cartographic products were evaluated and validated through field inspections to verify all situations identified as critical and assess the accuracy of the method used. It is important to note that in other studies conducted in BHRP, there was no specific objective of evaluating and validating the reality. Results: It was found that approximately 76% of the 4,170 km2 area of the basin is moderately vulnerable to erosion, with nine critical areas of very high vulnerability identified, which need to reduce soil loss to avoid future effects such as drainage siltation and transport of soil nutrients. Social/Managerial contributions: Mapping the current state of land cover, land use, and preservation areas is essential to develop protection and monitoring measures. This allows for the implementation of initiatives such as Payment for Environmental Services (PSA) and the creation of a bank of priority areas, aiming to preserve water resources, especially in the semiarid region of Northeast Brazil.

TI  - Natural regeneration or tree planting in a tropical forest-to-pasture damaged area: which is more efficacious for soil ecosystem recovery?
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - This study assessed whether a natural regeneration or active tree-planting reforestation strategy better restored the C and N-cycle processes and associated microbiota within soils after 18 years in a Premontane Wet Life zone site in Monteverde, Costa Rica, compared to adjacent old secondary forest and pasture soils (both >60 years). Our findings apply to small-scale restoration sites (<0.5 ha plots) commonly used in Monteverde. Both restoration strategies showed recovering soil C and N-cycle processes with similar levels of TN, NH4+, NO3-, Biomass-C, and efficiency of organic C use. Both strategies appeared to positively influence the recovery of the levels and community compositional stability of the Actinobacterial, Acidobacterial, N-fixing (N-Fixer) bacterial, ammonium-oxidizing bacterial, and complex organic C-degrading fungal communities. The main differences between the two strategies were that the tree-planted and pasture soils had similar compositions of the Actinobacterial, N-Fixer, and Fungal complex organic C degrader, while the natural regeneration and pasture soils had similar compositions of these groups and the Acidobacteria. However, the community compositions of all five microbial groups were different between restored forest and the old secondary forest soils. These results suggest that while the soil ecosystems from both reforestation strategies are recovering, after 18 years, there is still more recovery to occur. Lastly, possible indicators of post-restoration soil ecosystem enhancement included increasing constancy of critical microbial group composition, efficiency of organic C conversion to biomass, Biomass-C,NH4+, NO3-, and levels of Acidothermus, Acidobacteria subgroups 2, 3, and 5, Archaeorhizomyces, Anaeromyxobacter, Bradyrhizobium, Nitrosomonas, Flavobacterium, and Nitrospira.

TI  - Assisted Natural Regeneration in slash-and-burn agriculture: Results in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
T2  - BOIS ET FORETS DES TROPIQUES
AB  - Human impacts on natural tropical forests in Central Africa are to a large extent linked to shifting cultivation and fuelwood extraction in pen-urban areas. This is especially true around the city of Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which is why research was conducted in 2010 by the Makala Project in the city's fuelwood supply basin. The aims were to adapt and test Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR), improve slash-andburn crop systems and contribute to the enrichment of forest fallows. Prior to slashing and burning, useful trees were selected for protection. Then, during cropping, the germination and multiplication of stump shoots and root suckers from existing local forest species were promoted by selective weeding, thinning, and pruning. Monitoring of the test areas found low survival rates for old trees conserved before the land was slashed and burned, due to the difficulty of controlling the fires. This means that the technique can only be used for the edges of plots, by gradually enriching hedgerows. In contrast, stumps shoots and root suckers from natural forest species protected by AN R during agricultural weeding grew rapidly inside the plots, thus rapidly establishing woody fallows without the need for costly inputs or heavy labour. In 2014, three and a half years after slashing and burning, biodiversity and biomass in these fallows is greater than in non-ANR fallows. Better charcoal and crop productivity and a slower rate of forest transition into savannah are expected. However, social acceptance, a critical factor in the large-scale dissemination of this innovation, must be investigated in the light of potential developments in traditional and modern land tenure rights.

TI  - From natural forest to tree crops, co-domestication of forests and tree species, an overview
T2  - NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
CP  - International Symposium on Processes and Stages in the Transition from Natural Forest Ecosystems to Tree Crop Plantations
AB  - The process of domestication of tree crops has only been given limited attention. This process starts with the protection of natural forests and ends with the cultivation of domesticated tree crops. In this evolutionary process three types of human-influenced forest environments may be distinguished: (a) conserved forests, (b) modified forests, (c) transformed forests. During the process of domestication an increasing input of human energy per unit of exploited forest takes place. Accordingly three phases in the domestication of forests may be distinguished: (a) an acculturalization phase in which social measures aimed at controlling the utilization of valuable tree species or patches of forests are implemented, (b) a phase of manipulation of wild tree species in which the socially-oriented management practices are enhanced with measures aimed at enhancing the (re)productive potential of valued species, (c) a phase of cultivation of genetically modified tree crops. As a result of the co-domestication of forests and trees various types of forests and/or tree cultivation systems can be distinguished. So far more attention has been given to understanding the characteristics of the early and end phases than to the various intermediate phases represented by indigenous forest management and agroforestry systems. These are characterized by a modification of the highly diverse natural forest ecosystems to a state in which the biodiversity has been somewhat reduced, but in which a larger proportion of useful resources are present. Such systems provide interesting examples of the wide range of options for managing forest resources with varying degrees of biodiversity and productive values.

TI  - Strategies for restoring tree seedling recruitment in high conservation value tropical montane forests underplanted with cardamom
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
AB  - Question: What strategies are most appropriate for restoring tree seedling recruitment whilst avoiding the spread of invasive plant species in high conservation value tropical forests disturbed by planting a shade-demanding crop?
   Location: Knuckles Forest Reserve, Sri Lanka (7 degrees 21-7 degrees 24N, 80 degrees 45-80 degrees 48E).
   Methods: An experiment was conducted to test the effects of clipping or removal of established cardamom plants on recruitment of native tree seedlings and spread of non-native plants in a tropical montane forest with abandoned cardamom stands in the understorey. The number and composition of tree seedling emergents, the cover of herbaceous plants and the recovery of cardamom were assessed for 3yr.
   Results: Tree seedling recruitment was higher in plots from which above-ground cardamom biomass had been removed through slashing (meanSE per 5m(2); 28.9 +/- 2.70) and those where cardamom plants had been removed completely through uprooting (32.2 +/- 3.17), or when dead cardamom leaves and stems were removed with small-scale extraction of pods (22.5 +/- 2.16), than in unmanipulated control plots (16.6 +/- 1.13) over 15mo. The species composition of tree seedling emergents did not differ in response to removal of cardamom. However, the cover of herbaceous plants, including the non-native invasive Ageratina riparia, increased in response to removal of cardamom. Recovery of cardamom was higher when the plants had been slashed than when entire plants were uprooted and removed.
   Conclusion: Slashing or uprooting cardamom plants is a potential strategy for restoring tree seedling recruitment in forests with abandoned cardamom stands in the understorey, but these interventions would need to be repeated annually over many years to be successful, and they risk promoting expansion of the cover of herbaceous plants, including non-native species. Hence, this approach would be labour-intensive and costly. An alternative approach to promoting tree seedling emergence and establishment is to clear dead cardamom leaves and stems, and to encourage small-scale extraction of pods from the residual cardamom plants. Harvesting pods reduces the likelihood that the crop will be sustained in situ through natural regeneration, and supplies an income to local communities, which would enhance the social acceptability of the intervention.

TI  - Performance Analysis of Dairy Farms Transitioning to Environmentally Friendly Grazing Practices: The Case Study of Santa Catarina, Brazil
T2  - LAND
AB  - The conflict between food production and environmental conservation demands alternative agriculture practices to maintain or increase food production, protect and restore critical ecosystem processes, and reduce dependence on non-renewable agricultural inputs. Deforestation in Brazil's Atlantic Forest, for which agriculture has been a primary driver, already threatens the biome's impressive biodiversity and the ecosystem services it helps sustain. Many small family farmers in Santa Catarina-located in the South of Brazil-have adopted the Voisin Rational Grazing System (VRG) as an alternative to conventional and environmentally detrimental dairy activities. This article presents the results of a research project designed to analyze the economic, social, and ecological VRG impacts based on farmers' perceptions and economic accounts. We compare farmer profitability and critical social and environmental aspects of both systems using detailed interviews and monthly accounting of revenues and expenditures on VRG and conventional farms. We found that VRG is more profitable than the conventional dairy system in Santa Rosa de Lima. However, most farmers combine VRG with some conventional practices, affecting profitability and potential ecological benefits. The adoption of VRG in Santa Rosa de Lima nonetheless correlates with reduced use of environmentally harmful inputs, compatible with a gradual transition to a more ecologically-friendly and sustainable system.

TI  - Genetic conservation of a threatened Neotropical palm through community-management of fruits in agroforests and second-growth forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The commercial exploitation of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) has been widely promoted to achieve both conservation and economic outcomes in the management of tropical forests by local communities, but monitoring the impacts of NTFPs harvesting is still challenging. Monitoring genetic diversity is a promising approach to assess harvesting impacts and guide best practices. Here, we evaluated the value of community-managed agroforests and secondary forests for conserving genetic structure and diversity of Euterpe edulis, an endemic palm explored for fruit and palm heart production. We used SSR markers to compare genetic diversity in populations growing in protected areas, in agroforests and in second-growth forests managed for fruit production in the coastal Atlantic Forest of Brazil. In addition, we investigated the genetic diversity of seeds extracted during pulp removal, which have been used in E. edulis reintroduction programs. Overall, high levels of genetic diversity were observed for all populations (mean allelic richness = 7.06; mean expected heterozygosity = 0.787), with no significant differences in genetic diversity among agroforests, second-growth forests and protected areas. Managed forests and protected areas had low to intermediate levels of genetic differentiation (global Fixation Index = 0.085), indicating the existence of gene flow among them. Seeds extracted during fruit pulp removal had as high genetic variability as populations growing in protected areas, thus evidencing the potential of using these seeds to recover overexploited populations. Thus, community-management of NTFPs in agroforests and second growth forests may support genetic conservation of this threatened species, complementing the conservation role of protected areas.

TI  - Small Landscape Elements Double Connectivity in Highly Fragmented Areas of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - The Atlantic Forest in Brazil is a biodiversity hotspot, yet its diverse ecosystems and species are becoming increasingly threatened by habitat loss and extreme habitat fragmentation. Most habitat patches of Atlantic Forest are dispersed across agricultural landscapes (e.g., grazing and cropping) in relatively small and isolated fragments (80% < 50 ha). Forest fragments < 1 ha, scattered trees in pastures, tree lines on trenches and fences, and remnant riparian forest, collectively called here Small Landscape Elements (SLEs), are very common in this context. While these SLEs make up much of the Atlantic Forests footprint, very little is known about their role or impact on the persistence and conservation of species. In this study, we investigate the role of SLEs on landscape configuration, particularly their contribution toward landscape connectivity of individual species and the genetic flow of species between larger forest fragments. We randomly selected 20 buffers of 707 hectares within a 411,670 hectare area of the Atlantic Forest that was completely covered by forest in the past located in the south of Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The forest cover randomly varied between these buffers. We used graph theory to measure landscape connectivity as the probability of connectivity for different disperser movement types between landscape knots (habitat patches). We used three estimated dispersal distances in the models: pollen disperser insect (50 m), low-mobility seed disperser bird (100 m) and high-mobility seed disperser bird (760 m). The SLEs together increased the probability of connection by roughly 50%, for all model dispersers, if compared to a theoretical baseline landscape containing no SLEs. Of all SLEs, riparian forests contribute the most toward enhancing landscape connectivity. In these highly fragmented landscapes, such as the Atlantic Forest (>70%), the position of SLEs within the landscapes was more important than their respective areas for connectivity. Although the landscapes were deeply fragmented, we showed that the presence of SLEs can increase connectivity and reduce further biodiversity loss in the Atlantic Forest.

TI  - Payment for Environmental Services and the Financial Viability of Agroforestry Systems: An Integrated Analysis of Socio-Environmental Projects in the Descoberto Basin-Federal District
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - The policy of payments for environmental services is implemented in public policies in Brazil, and there are many efforts to increase projects that subsidize rural producers, combining payments with incentives for good agricultural practices that promote these services. Thinking about ways to add these values in projects to restore degraded areas is an opportunity to generate monetary benefits for producers and attractiveness for stakeholders, aiming to increase investments in projects of this nature and gain scale in the restoration of these areas. In this way, this study evaluated the financial viability of a project to implement 16.9 hectares of agroforestry systems in agrarian reform settlements located in the Descoberto HydrographicBasin near Brasilia, Federal District, and the proposition of a scenario of payment for environmental services associated with adoption of this agricultural practice by producers. The results were promising for both investors and farmers, as demonstrated by the financial analysis criteria (NPV: USD 63,097.49, IRR: 71%, simple payback: 3 years). The PES scenario was even more attractive, proving to be an encouraging increase for the adoption of this practice by producers.

TI  - Soil restoration potential with corridor replanting engineering in the monoculture rubber plantations of Southwest China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Corridor engineering is a common approach for wildlife conservation. The influence of the practice on soil properties including nutrients and organic matter, however, remains poorly investigated. In order to predicate the long-term effects of Asian elephant (Elephas maximus L.) conservation corridors (AECC) of the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) on soil properties and functional recovery, we studied the soil comprehensive accumulation ability and estimated total recovery time under two major forest types on which the corridor is built (natural secondary forest and rubber plantation) and one forest type generated by ecological replanting on existing rubber plantation in comparison with soils under primary rain forest and fallow land in Xishuangbanna, Southwest China. Soil samples were taken from five research sites and fifteen soil properties were measured.
   On a 30-year basis, soil recovery differed significantly in the three regimes. The natural secondary forest regime had the highest comprehensive accumulation of about 92% and the shortest estimated recovery time (37-40 years). In contrast, the monoculture rubber plantation, despite constant fertilizer and management input, yielded the poorest recovery result of about 75% and the longest recovery time (95-100 years). From the perspective of soil recovery, this regime appears unsustainable. However, the ecological replanting using local rain forest trees and shrubs thereby to build forest structure complexity and diversity on the monoculture rubber plantation improved comprehensive accumulation ability of about 8% (from 75% to 83%) and shortened the recovery time (40 years). The results suggest that the corridor engineering by natural secondary forest regime or by ecological replanting of monoculture rubber plantation can serve as effective regimes for soil properties recovery.

TI  - Using the CENTURY model to assess the impact of land reclamation and management practices in oasis agriculture on the dynamics of soil organic carbon in the arid region of North-western China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY
AB  - Large-scale reclamation of arid land in North-western China over the past 50 years has converted the natural desert landscape into anthropogenic oasis, particularly in the lower part of watersheds. Drastic human activities may have caused the change of soil organic carbon (SOC) in anthropogenic oasis. This study employs the CENTURY model (Version 4.0) to investigate the effects of land reclamation and management practices in oasis agriculture on the dynamic of SOC at the lower part of Sangong river watershed, a typical anthropogenic oasis reclaimed at 50 years ago. Based on field investigation, history of crop rotations, and past farm practices in study area, land management practices were divided into five categories, corresponding five periods, 0-1958, 1959-1984, 1985-1992, 1993-1998 and 1999-2008. The model successfully simulated the SOC dynamics of the top layer soil (0-20 cm) in the different periods. The state of equilibrium of total SOC and the active, slow, and passive carbon pools were built by CENTURY model in 0-1959. Over the 50 years' cultivation (1959-2008), the mean change in total SOC exhibited complex ways. SOC increased rapidly in the first 2 years (1959-1960) after shrubland reclamation, and declined slowly during the period 1961-1984 and then decreased rapidly from 1985 to 1992. Between 1993 and 1998, it remained relatively stable, and climbed rapidly again during 1999-2008. The trend in total SOC showed "N" shape, i.e., increase, decrease, then increase. Finally, total SOC is greater (8.2%) in 2008 than the original level of SOC under the natural desert shrub. The improvements of land management practices such as ploughing being replaced with no tillage, straw being crushed before returning it to soil, and reasonable application of fertilizers, played a key role in the change in total SOC. Especially, soil carbon sequestration was obviously increased since protective management practices were implemented in 1993, such as no tillage, straw returning to soil, and the balanced fertilization technique. The results were different from the conclusions that loss of soil organic carbon would happen due to reclamation and continuous farming in tropical forests, semiarid grasslands of northern China and Nigerian semiarid Savannah.

TI  - Forest biomass recovery twenty-four years after conventional and reduced-impact logging in Eastern Amazon
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
AB  - Given the mounting global concerns about mitigating climate change and curbing greenhouse gas emissions, it becomes increasingly crucial to comprehend the effects of logging techniques on biomass dynamics in tropical forests. This understanding is essential for fostering greater carbon retention and sequestration, aligning with the objectives of initiatives like REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation plus sustainable forest management and the conservation and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) and other conservation goals. In this context, this study investigated the effects of two wood harvesting methods, reduced-impact logging (RIL) and conventional logging (CL), on above-ground biomass (AGB) recovery rates 24 years after harvesting. The experimental design was based on three treatments: RIL, CL, and an unlogged control plot, situated in the municipality of Paragominas, State of Para<acute accent>, in the Eastern Amazon region of Brazil. All trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 25 cm, as well as all trees of commercial species with a DBH >= 10 cm, were monitored in a 24.5 ha plot within each treatment. Additionally, a 5.25 ha subplot within each treatment was designated for the monitoring of all trees with DBH >= 10 cm. The biomass data were generated from 11 measurements carried out from 1993 to 2017 (24-year period). Pre-logging AGB stocks were estimated at 181 Mg ha1 in the RIL plot, 187 Mg ha-1 in the CL plot, and 174 Mg ha-1 in the control plot. One year after logging, AGB decreased by 19 % under RIL and 30 % under CL, while the control forest remained unchanged. By 13 years after harvest, the RIL plot achieved 102 % AGB recovery, while the CL plot recovered 86 % of the original pre-harvest stock. Over the 24-year post-logging period, AGB stocks recovered to 128 % in the RIL plot compared to only 90 % in the CL plot, while the control forest maintained 93 % of its original stock. The average annual ABG increment rates were 3.56 Mg ha-1 year-1 after RIL and 2.33 Mg ha-1 year-1 after CL. Our findings demonstrate that implementing RIL is a more effective strategy for maintaining post-logging AGB stocks and accelerating AGB recovery rates, serving as a significant mitigation measure against climate change.

TI  - Do national strategies under the UN biodiversity and climate conventions address agricultural commodity consumption as deforestation driver?
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Forest conversion in the tropics is increasingly driven by global demand for agricultural forest-risk commodities such as soy, beef, palm oil and timber. In order to be effective, future forest conservation policies should include measures targeting both producers (the supply side) and consumers (the demand side) to address commodity driven deforestation. Whereas the UN Conventions on Biodiversity (CBD) and Climate Change (UNFCCC) do not make reference to this driving factor, here we explore whether and how recent national strategies by member states to the Conventions acknowledge the role of agricultural commodities in tropical deforestation. A text analysis of 139 Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to climate change mitigation and 132 National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) shows that the general trade-off between national development aspirations and forest conservation is commonly acknowledged. However, only few strategies link deforestation to commodity production and consumption, whereas most documents do not mention this topic. This lack of reference to a key driver of tropical deforestation limits the prospects of safeguarding tropical forests for biodiversity and climate change mitigation purposes as part of the two UN Conventions, and might jeopardise their overall effectiveness.
   These findings were complemented by a content analysis of INDCs, NBSAPs and REDD + documents from eight case countries affected by commodity-driven deforestation. We investigated whether this driver is acknowledged in the national strategies, and which policy measures are suggested to address forest loss from agricultural commodities. We found that six case countries mention agricultural commodities as deforestation driver in their REDD + documents, whereas the biodiversity and climate change strategies were silent on the topic. Policy measures targeting commodity production were suggested in four REDD + strategies, ranging from incentive payments, sustainable agricultural practices and land-use planning to demand-side approaches such as certification and the promotion of sustainable lifestyles.
   One conclusion from this exercise is that UN member states seem not to consider climate and biodiversity national plans the adequate forum to discuss detailed forest conservation approaches. We argue that in order to increase effectiveness, strategies under the UN Conventions should take commodity-driven deforestation into account, through measures that address both the producer and the consumer side.

TI  - Even cooler insights: On the power of forests to (water the Earth and) cool the planet
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Scientific innovation is overturning conventional paradigms of forest, water, and energy cycle interactions. This has implications for our understanding of the principal causal pathways by which tree, forest, and vegetation cover (TFVC) influence local and global warming/cooling. Many identify surface albedo and carbon sequestration as the principal causal pathways by which TFVC affects global warming/cooling. Moving toward the outer latitudes, in particular, where snow cover is more important, surface albedo effects are perceived to overpower carbon sequestration. By raising surface albedo, deforestation is thus predicted to lead to surface cooling, while increasing forest cover is assumed to result in warming. Observational data, however, generally support the opposite conclusion, suggesting surface albedo is poorly understood. Most accept that surface temperatures are influenced by the interplay of surface albedo, incoming shortwave (SW) radiation, and the partitioning of the remaining, post-albedo, SW radiation into latent and sensible heat. However, the extent to which the avoidance of sensible heat formation is first and foremost mediated by the presence (absence) of water and TFVC is not well understood. TFVC both mediates the availability of water on the land surface and drives the potential for latent heat production (evapotranspiration, ET). While latent heat is more directly linked to local than global cooling/warming, it is driven by photosynthesis and carbon sequestration and powers additional cloud formation and top-of-cloud reflectivity, both of which drive global cooling. TFVC loss reduces water storage, precipitation recycling, and downwind rainfall potential, thus driving the reduction of both ET (latent heat) and cloud formation. By reducing latent heat, cloud formation, and precipitation, deforestation thus powers warming (sensible heat formation), which further diminishes TFVC growth (carbon sequestration). Large-scale tree and forest restoration could, therefore, contribute significantly to both global and surface temperature cooling through the principal causal pathways of carbon sequestration and cloud formation.
   We assess the cooling power of forest cover at both the local and global scales. Our differentiated approach based on the use of multiple diagnostic metrics suggests that surface albedo effects are typically overemphasized at the expense of top-of-cloud reflectivity. Our analysis suggests that carbon sequestration and top-of-cloud reflectivity are the principal drivers of the global cooling power of forests, while evapotranspiration moves energy from the surface into the atmosphere, thereby keeping sensible heat from forming on the land surface. While deforestation brings surface warming, wetland restoration and reforestation bring significant cooling, both at the local and the global scale.image

TI  - Soil C stocks in latossolos of the planalto, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil
T2  - CIENCIA RURAL
AB  - : Approximately 5% of the total emissions (0.11 Gt CO2 2 and GWP-AR5) originate in Rio Grande do Sul state (RS), a representative agricultural region in Southern Brazil. This study assessed SOCS (soil organic C stocks) in Latossolos of the Planalto of RS, with up-to-date data obtained from recent field campaigns and legacy data, and relate these SOC stocks to environmental variables. A literature search identified 195 documents with SOCS in layers 0-30 cm and 0-100 cm. The mean SOCS (0-30 cm) in the Latossolos was significantly higher (73.6 Mg ha-1 ) than the suggested IPCC default (55 Mg ha-1 ). The highest stocks (237 +/- 39 Mg ha-1 ) were measured in uncultivated Latossolos Brunos in the 0-100 cm layer, especially at higher altitudes and lower mean annual temperature. The most frequently occurring soil Latossolo Vermelho distrof & eacute;rrico-LVdf (25% of the Planalto), also had high SOCS. Surprisingly Latossolos Vermelho Distr & oacute;fico (LVd) also had high SOCS, in spite of the coarser texture. The estimated SOCS in Latosoolos of the Planalto is 419.9 Tg C, 36% larger than reported previous studies. We concluded that, despite significant land use changes, soils of this region maintain large SOCS which had been underestimated in previous studies.

TI  - Tree species diversity and its relationship with carbon stock in the parkland agroforestry of Northern Ethiopia
T2  - COGENT BIOLOGY
AB  - Parkland agroforestry can store carbon and conserves biodiversity. Studying the relationship between carbon stock and biodiversity is crucial in understanding the tradeoff between major benefits of the parkland agroforestry system, and way to achieve the optimum balance between them. Therefore, this study aims to estimate the biomass and SOC in community type, and explore the relationship between carbon stocks and diversity. Tree with DBH (Diameter at breast height) > 2 cm was measured and species were identified in 75 (50x100m) randomly located plots. Species richness (S), Species evenness (J), Shannon-weiner diversity index (H') and Simpson diversity index (D) of the study area were 3.02, 0.81, 0.82 and 0.46 respectively. Similarly, the mean aboveground (AGC), belowground (BGC) and soil organic (SOC) carbon were 7.9, 3.03 and 20.07 Mg C ha-1 respectively. There was a liner and weakly significant correlation between AGC and tree J in plant community 2 (r = -0.558, P < 0.05) and 3 (r = -0.451, P < 0.05), and there was a negative correlation between J (r = -0.552, P < 0.05), D (r = -0.646, P < 0.05) and H' (r = -0.643, P < 0.05) with TC (Total carbon) in plant community 2. However, there was no significant relationship between J, D and H' with TC in plant communities 1 and 3. In these parkland agroforestry systems, the relationship tree species diversity with AGC and TC appeared to be highly variable; it indicates that parkland agroforestry systems have significantly improved the vegetation and SOC. However, forest carbon enhancement cannot assure the biodiversity conservation and promotion in a parkland agroforestry system.

TI  - Contrasting trends in biodiversity of birds and trees during succession following cacao agroforest abandonment
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Understanding how transformed habitats act as reservoirs of biodiversity is a key challenge at a time when ecosystems are under unprecedented pressure. Here we compare tree and bird biodiversity in actively cultivated and abandoned cacao agroforests, and use a space for time approach to ask how this diversity has changed over 100 years of succession.
   Tree and bird communities were surveyed in cacao agroforests, secondary forests at different stages of succession and primary forests in the Northern Range of Trinidad, West Indies, to test the prediction that there are consistent temporal trends in alpha and beta-diversity across taxa.
   Temporal alpha-diversity was taxon dependent. We found that tree alpha-diversity increased with forest age. In contrast, there was no temporal trend in bird alpha-diversity. Tree and bird species richness were negatively correlated.
   Tree and bird composition varied with forest age and environmental distance. A greater proportion of native trees, and of highly forest-dependent and insectivorous birds were found in older forests.
   Our analyses show that actively cultivated and young abandoned cacao agroforests can sustain high bird alpha-diversity, despite lower levels of tree alpha-diversity. Old secondary and primary forests have unique species compositions including more sensitive and specialist species. Compositional shifts with successional stage for both trees and birds produce a patchwork of habitats that contribute to regional gamma-diversity.
   Synthesis and applications. Our research highlights the value of actively cultivated cacao agroforests and secondary forest alongside primary forests as reservoirs of biodiversity. By supporting both biodiversity and livelihoods, traditionally grown shade-cacao agroforests fall within a people and nature framework. Taken together, these results emphasise the contributions of secondary forests, which are often overlooked, to conservation.

TI  - Parks under attack: Brazil's Iguacu National Park illustrates a global threat to biodiversity
T2  - AMBIO
AB  - National parks are under attack in many parts of the world, including Brazil, which the Convention on Biodiversity ranks as the world's most biodiverse country. Brazil has been experiencing an unprecedented environmental crisis, and the political situation in the country favors approval of environmentally damaging measures by both the legislative and executive branches of government. A new and largely unreported setback is a proposal in the National Congress for a road cutting the Iguacu National Park in two. Here, we identify environmental threats from the proposed road and pressures on the park from the surrounding human population. The proposed laws violate Brazil's constitution and would cause immeasurable damage to the park's biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. The road would reduce the cost of transport between two municipalities (counties), but not the cost of transporting soybeans, their main agricultural product. However, the local population would be better served by strengthening its ties to the park and promoting economic alternatives such as tourism, agroforestry, and organic agriculture. The Caminho do Colono road illustrates the danger posed by downgrading the status of protected areas in order to allow environmentally damaging activities. This trend is occurring in many countries and is especially evident in Brazil.

TI  - Impacts of Shade Trees on the Adjacent Cacao Rhizosphere in a Young Diversified Agroforestry System
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Cacao agroforestry systems offer the potential to diversify farmer income sources, enhance biodiversity, sequester carbon, and deliver other important ecosystem services. To date, however, studies have emphasized field- and system-scale outcomes of shade tree integration, and potential impacts on the rhizosphere of adjacent cacao trees have not been fully characterized. Interactions at the root-soil interface are closely linked to plant health and productivity, making it important to understand how diverse shade tree species may affect soil fertility and microbial communities in the cacao rhizosphere. We assessed the impacts of neighboring shade tree presence and identity on cacao yields and physical, chemical, and biological components of the cacao rhizosphere in a recently established diversified agroforestry system in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Stepwise regression revealed surprising and strong impacts of microbial diversity and community composition on cacao yields and pod infection rates. The presence of neighboring shade trees increased nitrogen, phosphorus, and pH in the rhizosphere of nearby cacao trees without yield losses. Over a longer time horizon, these increases in rhizosphere soil fertility will likely increase cacao productivity and shape microbial communities, as regression models showed nitrogen and phosphorus in particular to be important predictors of cacao yields and microbiome diversity and composition. However, neither presence nor identity of shade trees directly affected microbial diversity, community composition, or field-scale distance-decay relationships at this early stage of establishment. These results highlight locally specific benefits of shade trees in this agroecological context and emphasize the rhizosphere as a key link in indirect impacts of shade trees on cacao health and productivity in diversified systems.

TI  - Sustainable intensification of palm oil production through cattle integration: a review
T2  - AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - This review aimed to evaluate the impacts of oil palm-cattle integration systems on food security and environmental sustainability. We reviewed more than 100 papers and selected those that reported the advantages of these systems. Oil palm-cattle integration has been implemented in some Southeast Asian countries, especially in Malaysia and Indonesia, but it is not widely adopted by oil palm plantations. These systems are mainly driven by policies to enhance food security and reduce environmental impacts. Oil palm-cattle integration can contribute to several Sustainable Development Goals, such as (SDG 1 and 2) no poverty and zero hunger, because it allows for more and diverse food production on the same land, and it increases the income per hectare by up to 15% due to higher oil palm yield (up to 4 t FFB/ha) and lower weed control costs (up to 60%) with rotational grazing. It can also support (SDG 6, 12, 13) responsible production and consumption, clean water and sanitation, and climate action, because it can decrease herbicide use, enhance biodiversity (understory and beneficial species), and improve soil quality. Moreover, it can mitigate the risk of indirect land use change associated with deforestation.

TI  - Sustainability of Brazilian forest concessions
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - In 2006, the Brazilian Forest Service (SFB) started an ambitious program to establish forest concessions so as to provide a legal framework for long-term sustainable timber production in Amazonian forests. Forest concessions in the Brazilian Amazon currently cover only 1.6 million ha (Mha) but we estimate the area of all potential concessions as 35 Mha. This paper assessed the conditions under which the present and potential concession system can ensure an annual production of 11 Mm(3). yr(-1) to meet the estimated present timber demand. For this we used the volume dynamics with differential equations model (VDDE) calibrated for the Amazon Basin with a Bayesian framework with data from 3500 ha of forest plots monitored for as long as 30 years after selective logging. Predictions of commercial volume recovery rates vary with location.
   We tested 27 different scenarios by using combinations of initial proportion of commercial volume, logging intensity and cutting cycle length. These scenarios were then applied to the current area of concessions and to the area of all potential concessions (35 Mha). Under current logging regulations and the current concession area (mean logging intensity of 15-20 m(3).ha(-1), a harvest cycle of 35 years and an initial commercial timber volume proportion of 20%), timber production can be maintained only for a single cutting cycle (35 years). Only the scenario with a logging intensity of 10 m(3)ha(-1) every 60 years with a 90% initial proportion of commercial timber species can be considered as sustainable. Under this scenario, the maximum annual production with the present concession areas is 159,000 m(3) (157-159), or less than 2% of the present annual production of 11 Mm(3). When considering all potential concession areas (35 Mha), under current rules, the total annual production is 10 Mm(3)yr(-1) (2-17 Mm(3)yr(-1), 95% credibility interval) but is not maintained after the first logging cycle. Under the most sustainable scenario (see above) and a concession area of 35 Mha, the long-term sustainable annual production of timber reaches only 3.4 Mm(3)yr(-1). Based on these results we argue that the concession system will not be able to supply the timber demand without substantial reforms in natural forest management practices and in the wood industry sector. We argue that alternative sources of timber, including plantations linked with forest restoration initiatives, must be promoted.

TI  - Biodiversity and ecosystem function of tropical forest dung beetles under contrasting logging regimes
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - A key challenge for tropical conservation biologists is to assess how forest management practices affect biodiversity and associated ecosystem functions. Dung beetles (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) provide an ideal focal guild for such studies. We compared dung beetle assemblages and experimentally assessed rates of dung removal and seed burial in undisturbed forest, low-intensity selectively logged forest under sustainable forest management, and high-intensity logged forest, not under sustainable management in Malaysian Borneo. In total, 7923 individuals from 39 species of dung beetle were collected. There were no significant differences in abundance, biomass or diversity across sites. Species richness was significantly lower in the high-intensity logged sites. Beta diversity was low: of 35 species recorded in undisturbed forest sites, 32 were also captured in low-intensity sites and 29 in high-intensity sites. The environmental and vegetation variables measured had little influence on species composition. An average of 63-99% of dung was removed over 24 h. Mean dung and seed removal were significantly lower in the high-intensity logged sites. Dung removal rates were significantly and positively correlated with dung beetle species richness, but not with dung beetle biomass or abundance. However, the biomass of large-bodied, nocturnal dung beetles was positively correlated with dung removal. In contrast to previous studies, dung beetle biomass and abundance were not correlated with species richness, indicative of density compensation. Overall, dung beetle communities and associated ecosystem functions were robust to low-intensity but not high-intensity selective logging. These differences may be related to changes in the abundance and biomass of particular dung beetle species or guilds rather than community-wide measures of abundance and biomass, highlighting the need to move beyond simplistic biodiversity-ecosystem functioning correlations to understand the functional consequences of habitat modification in high-diversity ecosystems.

TI  - Growth and productivity of Eucalyptus benthamii in integrated crop-livestock systems in southern Brazil
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLS) are production models that promote sustainable intensification and integrate agricultural and forestry production systems, generating a combination of economic and environmental benefits. Knowledge is still scarce about the growth and productivity of the tree component in ICLS, and there is a lack of long-term landscape-scale assessments about the provision of ecosystem services in ICLS. Our objective was to evaluate the monthly stem volume increment and productivity of Eucalyptus benthamii, at 7 years old, using metal dendrometer bands, for three different models of ICLS that integrate trees to the crop (crop-forestry-CF), livestock (livestock-forestry-LF), or both (crop-livestock-forestry-CLF) in southern Brazil. The form factor decreased while increasing age, with 0.516 at 4 years and 0.437 at 6 years after planting. In ICLS, we found the productivity of E. benthamii similar to the national averages for monoculture forestry in the United States and Brazil. At 6.5 years after planting, the average annual stem volume increment was 22.7 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) (LF), 24.6 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) (CLF) and 25.5 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) (CF), respectively. The CF production system provided trees with greater accumulated stem volume within 7 years of age. The LF system, on the other hand, provided trees with an equal increment in diameter, but less accumulated stem volume, and, therefore, smaller heights, suggesting that there is interference from cattle and pasture management on the growth and productivity of E. benthamii. ICLS are configured as an excellent possibility for vertical expansion of agricultural frontiers, promoting sustainable intensification, as well as can prevent horizontal expansion into new areas, reducing pressure on native forests, and contributing to combating deforestation.

TI  - Biodiversity inventory of trees in a large-scale permanent plot of tropical evergreen forest at Varagalaiar, Anamalais, Western Ghats, India
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - A permanent plot of 30 ha (600 x 500 m(2)) was established for long-term ecological research on biodiversity and forest functioning in a tropical evergreen forest at Varagalaiar, Anamalais, Western Ghats. This paper gives the results of the first census of trees in the 30 ha plot. All trees greater than or equal to 30 cm gbh were permanently tagged with sequentially numbered aluminium tags and their girth measured. 148 tree species (in 120 genera and 49 families) were enumerated in a total sample of 13,393 individuals. Species diversity, density and dispersion patterns were determined. The mean species richness, density and basal area per hectare were 65 species, 446 stems and 36.26 m(2) respectively. The Sorensen similarity index for thirty 1-ha subplots varied from 0.7 to 0.9, indicating the homogeneity in species composition of the stand. The pronounced species hierarchy has resulted in the dominance of four species that occupy four different forest storeys: Drypetes longifolia (lower storey) Reinwardtiodendron anamallayanum (middle storey), Poeciloneuron indicum (upper storey) and Dipterocarpus indicus (emergent). The forest was dominated by Euphorbiaceae in terms of richness (18 species) and abundance of species (3788 stems), and Dipterocarpaceae based on the contribution to basal area (18.4%). Species richness and density decreased with increasing girth-class. Girth class frequency of the stand exhibited an expanding population of trees. Twenty-nine tree species, analysed for spatial dispersion at 1-ha scale, exhibited both clumped and uniform patterns, except Vateria indica which was randomly distributed in one hectare. Repeat census scheduled for subsequent years, will elucidate the behaviour of the individual species and the population dynamics of the tree flora and will be useful for forest conservation and management. It will also help to monitor human activity within this forest.

TI  - The mid-domain effect of mountainous plants is determined by community life form and family flora on the Loess Plateau of China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - The mid-domain effect (MDE) explains altitudinal patterns of species diversity of mountainous plants at different elevations. However, its application is limited by the species life form and family flora in different layers of plant communities. To verify the MDE hypothesis at the plant community level, we chose a mountain with representative characteristics of the study area in the east of the Loess Plateau, China, such as obvious elevation (from 1324 to 2745 m) and latitude (from 36 degrees 23 ' to 39 degrees 03 ') gradients and considerable vegetation types (mainly coniferous and broad-leaved forests). We measured the life forms, families, and species diversity indices of tree, shrub, and herb communities along different elevations. We determined that the family numbers of the herb and shrub communities presented unimodal patterns across an altitudinal gradient, and the highest values occurred at intermediate elevations. The importance values of dominant families in the shrub and tree communities presented unimodal patterns, but the lowest values occurred at intermediate elevations. The species diversity indices of the herb, shrub, and tree communities conformed to unimodal change patterns following an altitudinal gradient, but the greatest diversity occurred at high, low, and intermediate elevations, respectively. At higher elevations, forbs and grasses grew well, whereas sedges grew well at lower elevations. Responses of different tree life forms to the altitudinal gradient were greater for evergreen coniferous tree species than for deciduous coniferous and deciduous broad-leaved tree species. We concluded that the MDE hypothesis of species diversity for mountainous plants is influenced greatly by the community life form and family at the plant community level in a temperate semi-arid region of the Loess Plateau, China. This conclusion tested and modified the MDE hypothesis and may be valuable for fueling prediction of biodiversity models and for the comparison with similar studies in arid and semi-arid mountainous regions.

TI  - Active restoration leads to rapid recovery of aboveground biomass but limited recovery of fish diversity in planted mangrove forests of the North Brazil Shelf
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Coastal degradation has spurred active restoration of mangrove ecosystems, from local initiatives to global commitments to increase mangrove forest area by 20% over the next decade. Mangrove restoration projects typically have multiple objectives, including carbon storage, coastal resilience, and fisheries recovery. How planting seedlings, the most common form of active restoration, can promote recovery of mangrove ecosystem functions remains an urgent research need. We quantified multiple ecosystem outcomes of Guyana's national mangrove restoration program, approximately a decade after seedling planting, and compared restoration outcomes with conditions in intact and degraded mangrove forests. Multivariate analyses indicate that intact and restored sites' environmental conditions were similar to each other but different from degraded sites. Aboveground biomass in restored sites (103 Mg ha(-1)) was 13 and 99% greater than intact (89.4 Mg ha(-1)) and degraded (0.12 Mg ha(-1)) sites, respectively. Active restoration successfully increased seedling abundance of both planted and unplanted species, with similar abundance between intact and restored sites. In contrast, fish communities in restored sites remained similar to degraded sites. Restored sites were dominated by a single algivorous fish species, with lower species diversity and commercially valuable fisheries than intact sites. Our results demonstrate that active restoration is a viable option to restore mangrove forest tree biomass and tree species composition in this region. However, even under a best-case scenario for mangrove forest restoration, fisheries did not recover during our study's timespan. Long-term monitoring and controlled experiments will be essential to further understand restoration outcomes for multiple ecosystem services in mangrove forests.

TI  - Resettlement and landscape-level conservation: Corridors, human-wildlife conflict, and forest use in Central India
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Since the origin of the protected area network, authorities have resettled people in the interest of wildlife conservation. However, the impacts of resettlement on wildlife corridors connecting increasingly insular protected areas and the interaction of resettlement with existing human-wildlife conflict (HWC) outside of protected areas remain unclear. Using Kanha National Park (KNP) in central India as a case study, we quantified impacts of 450 households (that were resettled from 2009 to 2013, surveyed in 2016) on non-protected forests at their new settlement locations, We measured forest use for cattle grazing, tendu leaf extraction (a commercial non-timber forest product) and consumption of forest foods. We also quantified HWC risks that resettled households face at their new settlement locations. We use published spatial analyses on designation of the corridor and risks of human wildlife conflict in conjunction with our data to assess post-resettlement impacts at the new settlement locations. Overall, most resettled households (330) have moved to existing villages that lie outside of wildlife corridors around KNP. They comprise < 10% of existing populations at most of their new settlement villages. Many resettled households and their non-resettled neighbors face high HWC risks due to the spatial patterns of HWC around KNP. Controlling for assets and proximity to forest, resettled households own more cattle, are less involved in tendu trade, and consume fewer forests foods than non-resettled neighbors. Model results suggest that increasing off-farm economic opportunities would reduce pressures on forest resources for both resettled and non-resettled households. Our findings, while limited to the KNP landscape, provide approaches applicable in other human-dominated places to design resettlement strategies towards landscape-level conservation goals.

TI  - Seed rain in cocoa agroforests is induced by effects of forest loss on frugivorous birds and management intensity
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Tropical forests have been intensively degraded and deforested for different anthropogenic uses, mostly associated to agricultural expansion due to increasing human demands. Therefore, an emerging number of studies has advocated on the benefits of land-sharing strategies such as agroforestry systems which conciliate biodiversity conservation with production. Yet features at both landscape and local scales could affect ecological processes and productivity within agroforests. Here, we used structural equation models to investigate the direct and indirect effects of landscape forest cover, animal seed dispersers and local vegetation variables on the seed rain structure of cocoa (Theobroma cacao) agroforests of the Brazilian Atlantic forest. We sampled seed rain for 12 consecutive months, performed bird and bat surveys and measured local structure variables related to management intensification (i.e., lower abundance and richness of adult trees and lower canopy shading indicating farm intensification) in 15 farms embedded within landscapes showing varying forest cover amount (2.3?74.9 %). Our results indicate that total and animal-dispersed seed richness in cocoa agroforests increased in more forested landscapes induced by the frugivorous bird richness, whereas the abundance of total and animaldispersed seeds was greater in more shaded farms. Contrary to expectations, the abundance of total and animal-dispersed trees negatively influenced the richness of frugivorous birds, thus indirectly affecting the richness of total and animal-dispersed seeds. Finally, we observed a weak similarity among the composition of arrived seeds and adult trees of animal-dispersed species recorded in the same sampling sites, suggesting that several seeds were actively dispersed from other localities. Our results therefore demonstrate that landscape forest amount and local management intensification play key roles in determining the seed diversity reaching cocoa agroforestry farms. We emphasize the importance of retaining native vegetation cover around the cocoa agroforestry, by either preserving the existing forest remnants or promoting restoration programs within deforested landscapes, in addition to locally ensure tree shading to boost seed arrival and enhance ecosystem functionality.

TI  - Mangrove Forest Restoration by Fisheries Communities in Lampung Bay: A study based on perceptions, willingness to pay, and management strategy
T2  - FOREST AND SOCIETY
AB  - Mangroves provide benefits and various services to local communities living along coastal areas, particularly fishery communities. Fishery community perceptions are significant in determining attitudes towards improving mangrove conditions, which can also be addressed through restoration activities. This research was conducted to analyze fisheries communities perceptions, willingness to pay (WTP) for mangroves restoration, and mangrove forest management strategies. Field surveys were conducted from July-August 2019 and February-March 2020. Primary data were collected from respondents in four regions (Kalianda Regency, South Lampung Regency, Bandar Lampung City, and Pesawaran Regency) in Lampung Province, Indonesia, which consist of fishers, shrimp farmers, crab and wood seekers, and finfish farmers. The respondents were 193 people, and four experts were involved in the policy scenario analysis. Results revealed a gap in the value of WTP among fishery community groups, in which the average value for fishers is lower than shrimp farmers. The years of formal education significantly influenced the WTP for mangrove restoration. Based on the scenario analysis, scenario 01 become a priority strategy, where four policies (P1 = Mangrove ecotourism development in Lampung Bay; P2 = Mangrove knowledge education and training on processing mangrove based products; P3 = Restoration and conservation of mangrove forests; and P4 = Community-based management for mangrove forests utilization) show high likelihoods to be simultaneously implemented for mangroves management, with mangrove ecotourism policy as the most decisive policy. For future research, other explanatory variables can be added, such as information on family member characteristics, and to develop a bottom-up policy scenario by identifying and involving the role of the local community.

TI  - Recent forest and land-use policy changes in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo: Are they truly transformational?
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - This paper analyses the policy changes occurring in the forest and palm oil sectors of Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, through the lens of the transformational change concept. The aim is to first examine whether Sabah is transforming and, if so, to identify the determinants enabling or hindering the change. To determine if Sabah is transforming, we used two criteria: - (i) an ambitious change in the policy framework, that promotes forest conservation and sustainable use, and is moving away from business-as-usual activities; and (ii) the level of implementation of the policies that we identified as supporting transformational change. We found that Sabah very likely did intend to transform. We made this conclusion based on comparing changes in policies occurring in Sabah, and we decided if it is ambitious by primarily comparing Sabah's policies with other Malaysian states, the federal government, and internationally. We showed that: (i) Sabah decided to use voluntary international certification standards (private market instruments) like FSC and RSPO, while the other Malaysian states did not; (ii) they decided to protect more forest compared to national and international targets; and (iii) Sabah is an early mover as the state is one of the first in the world to adopt the RSPO Jurisdictional Approach. But intention needs to be followed by implementation, and this is where the state falls short. The policies in Sabah were not fully implemented because of the patronage system where the more powerful actors used their power to continue with business-as-usual activities, there is frequent political turnover in Sabah, and the state faced difficulty in meeting international standards. Our research shows that local leadership and a local transformational change coalition (civil society actively working in Sabah) mainly prompted the transformational change, although the promises of economic gains and better reputation also played a role. We conclude by emphasising the change must be made more compelling for political leaders, as part of a broader institutional structure, not only through the narrow focus on reducing deforestation but through the development of a more sustainable and equitable national economy, and that consumer countries should play a role in reducing pressures on forest by providing incentives to a state that manages its natural resources sustainably.

TI  - Modelling and quantifying tree biometric properties of dry Afromontane forests of south-central Ethiopia
T2  - TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB  - Key message Models for quantifying tree biometric properties, imperative for forest management decision-making, including height, diameter, bark thickness and volume were developed, and wood basic density was documented for dry Afromontane forests of south-central Ethiopia. Tree biometric properties such as height (ht), diameter at breast height (dbh), bark thickness (bt), volume and wood basic density (wbd) are imperative for forest management decision-making. For dry Afromontane forests in south-central Ethiopia, models for quantifying such tree properties are totally lacking. This study, therefore, aimed at developing models for ht based on dbh, for dbh based on stump height diameter (dsh), for bt based on dbh,for volume based on dbh, ht and crown width (crw), as well as documenting wbd data. Comprehensive and representative datasets were collected from Degaga-Gambo and Wondo Genet forests. The ht, dbh and bt modelling were based on 1345 sampled trees during forest inventories, while the volume modelling and wbd documentation were based on 63 destructively sampled trees from 30 species covering 87% of the total basal area in the study sites. Weighted least squares regression was applied for modelling and leave one out cross-validation was used for evaluation. The ht-dbh and dbh-dsh models performed well (pseudo-R-2 = 0.72 and 0.98), while bt-dbh performed poorer (pseudo-R-2 = 0.42). Models for the total tree, merchantable stem and branches volume were developed with different options for independent variables, where pseudo-R(2)varied from 0.74 to 0.98, with smallest values for the branches models The models may be applied to forests outside the present study sites provided that the growing conditions are carefully evaluated. The species-wise wbd was ranging from 0.426 to 0.979 g cm(-3), with the overall mean of 0.588 g cm(-3). The wbd data will be useful for building up a national wbd database and may also be included in the Global Wood Density database. The study represents a significant step towards sustainable forest management including REDD + MRV practices in the dry Afromontane forests of south-central Ethiopia.

TI  - Functional trait profiles and diversity of trees regenerating in disturbed tropical forests and agroforests in Indonesia
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - A main question in restoration of degraded forests and forest landscapes recovering from logging and fire is what to expect from natural regeneration through surviving propagules in the soil or seed sources and associated dispersal agents from the surrounding landscape mosaic, as alternative to tree planting. Tree diversity in sec-ondary forests may be high, but based on newcomer species of low wood density and long-distance, abiotic dispersal modes. We compiled and analyzed three pairs of case studies (totaling 815 plots and 11.8 ha) of sec-ondary forests recovering from logging, fire and conversion to agroforest in Sumatra and Kalimantan (Indonesia) on mineral soils. Data on tree species diversity, wood density frequency distribution (indicative of successional status) and dispersal modes were compared with those of less disturbed comparator forests in the same land-scapes. Relatively undisturbed lowland dipterocarp forest in Kalimantan had close to 200 species of trees (>10 cm diameter) at a 1-ha sample scale (and 450 at a 10-ha scale). After repeated fires a sample area of 2 ha was needed to reach the same species richness. Regulation-based logging had little impact on tree species richness. In rubber agroforest with low-intensity management beyond rubber planting, 50 tree species were found at a 1-ha scale and close to 100 species in 3 ha. The Kalimantan forest after repeated fires had a markedly higher fraction of low-wood-density trees (40%), but otherwise, all forests sampled were similar in overall wood density profiles. Selectively logged forest managed by a local community (village forest) and rubber agroforest in Sumatra con-tained larger fractions of heavy-wood-density trees. The majority of trees (50%-70%) had birds, bats and primates as dispersal agents in all sites. Selectively logged forests had higher fractions of autochorous species (15%) compared to other sites. Anemochorous (wind-dispersed) species, especially Macaranga lowii, were most common (20%) in lowland dipterocarp forest. Comparison between secondary forests and agroforests showed the influence of farmer selection regarding what is allowed to grow beyond the pole stage. Wood density and seed dispersal profiles can be used as degradation indicators of species assemblages across various disturbance levels and types, as they reflect the habitat quality of the surrounding landscape mosaics.

TI  - A systematic review of mangrove restoration studies in Southeast Asia: Challenges and opportunities for the United Nation's Decade on Ecosystem Restoration
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB  - Mangroves provide valuable ecological and socio-economic services. The importance of mangroves is particularly evident in Southeast (SE) Asia where the most extensive and diverse forests are found. To recover degraded mangroves, several SE Asian countries have implemented restoration programs. However, to date, there has been no systematic and quantitative synthesis on mangrove restoration studies in the region. Here, we provide a bibliometric-based analysis of mangrove restoration to provide understanding on trends and future directions needed to meet biodiversity and restoration targets in the region. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol, we analyzed 335 articles (249 articles with ecological attributes; 86 articles with social attributes) published until February 2022 from Scopus and Web of Science databases. Mangrove restoration studies with ecological and social attributes started around the early 1990s mostly from Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Majority of SE Asian countries have stronger collaboration to western countries rather than within the region. Reasons for restoration vary per country, but mostly were intended to rehabilitate damaged mangroves. Direct planting was the most common restoration method used while hydrological rehabilitation was less practiced. Research on ecological attributes were dominated by biodiversity-related studies focused on flora and fauna, and less on other ecosystem services (e.g., coastal protection, fisheries production, etc.). Studies with social attributes only accounted for < 30% of the publications, mostly on topics related to ecological economics. Although mangrove restoration studies are apparent, some thematic restoration foci are needed. We propose priority research topics to help achieve the biodiversity and restoration targets by 2030.

TI  - Local and landscape characteristics shape amphibian communities across production landscapes in the Western Ghats
T2  - ECOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS AND EVIDENCE
AB  - Global tropical forests have been modified and fragmented by commodity agroforests, leading to significant alterations in ecological communities. Nevertheless, these production landscapes offer secondary habitats that support and sustain local biodiversity. In this study, we assess community level and species-specific responses of amphibians to land management in areca, coffee and rubber, three of the largest commodity agroforests in the Western Ghats. A total of 106 agroforests across a 30,000-km(2) landscape were surveyed for amphibians using a combination of visual and auditory encounter surveys. We used a Bayesian multi-species occupancy modelling framework to examine patterns of species richness, beta diversity, dominance structure and individual species occupancies. The influence of biogeographic variables such as elevation and latitude as well as microhabitat availability of streams, ponds and unpaved plantation roads was tested on amphibian species occupancy. Coffee agroforests had the highest species richness and lowest dominance when compared to areca and rubber. Beta diversity was highest in areca for within agroforest measures. Compared across agroforests, coffee had highest beta diversity with areca and rubber. Both elevation and latitude showed an overall positive association with amphibian occupancy, although species-specific responses varied considerably. Microhabitat availability was one of the strongest predictors of amphibian occupancy, with mean community response being positive with presence of water bodies and roads. Pond presence increased species richness per site by 34.7% (species-specific responses in occupancy ranged from -2.7% to 327%). Stream presence alone did not change species richness but species-specific response ranged from -59% to 273%. Presence of plantation roads also increased species richness by 21.5% (species-specific response ranged from -82% to 656%). Being unpaved with little vehicular traffic, plantation roads seem to provide additional habitats for amphibians. Presence of all three microhabitats at a site increased species richness by 75%. Our study highlights the importance of land management strategies that maintain diverse native canopy and freshwater bodies and other microhabitats in sustaining amphibian fauna. Market-driven land-use change from coffee to other agroforest types will have detrimental effects on amphibian communities and their long-term sustainability in the Western Ghats.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration in Cropland Soils
T2  - CARBON SEQUESTRATION IN AGRICULTURAL ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Humans began to cultivate land thousands of years ago, for growing crops after clearing the previous vegetation cover and plowing the soil. The soil disturbance altered, in particular, soil C dynamics which has recently been exacerbated by the increase in crop intensification (i.e., fertilization, irrigation, liming, mechanization). This has resulted in major losses of terrestrial carbon (C); i.e., global emissions by the expansion of agriculture for croplands were estimated at 98.4 Pg C for the period 1850-2015. Cropland management can alter soil inorganic carbon (SIC) stocks which, in arid and semiarid climates, can be similar to or more than the amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock. However, whether a specific practice leads to a net sequestration of SIC in cropland soils needs additional research. Otherwise, the conversion of land to cropland in temperate regions may release up to 36% of the SOC stock to 27 cm depth, and up to 30% of the SOC stock to 48 cm depth in tropical regions. In 2000, about 12% of Earth's ice-free land surface or 15 million km(2) was used for croplands. Climate, geology, and land and crop management practices control the magnitude of the cropland SOC stock. A major fraction (25-70%) of the carbon dioxide (CO2) fixed during crop photosynthesis by gross primary production (GPP) is respired autotrophically (R-a) back to the atmosphere. Estimates of global cropland GPP vary between 8.2 and 20.0 Pg C yr(-1) (1 Pg = 10(15) g). The remaining net primary production (NPP = GPP - Ra) is the main C input into cropland soils. Cropland NPP includes the production of biomass in foliage, shoots and roots, weed and seed production, root exudation, the carbon (C) transfer to microorganisms that are symbiotically associated with roots, and the volatile organic carbon (VOC) emissions that are lost from leaves to the atmosphere. However, not all components of cropland NPP have yet been measured in a single study. NPP enters soil by rhizodeposition and decomposition of plant litter, but the major fraction is heterotrophically converted back to CO2 by soil respiration and some is lost as methane (CH4). Aside decomposition, C losses from croplands soils occur also by fire, erosion, leaching, and harvest. Thus, a small amount of fixed C remains in cropland soils and accumulates as SOC due to a combination of short- and long-term stabilization processes. Stabilization processes include physical protection of organic matter (OM) against decomposers and their enzymes, stabilization by organo-mineral complexes and organo-metal interactions, and some as biochemically recalcitrant black carbon (BC). Soil aggregation, in particular, may be the most important stabilization process in the surface layers of cropland soils. Site-specific factors including climate, physicochemical characteristics, soil and vegetation management determine the balance between C input and losses. Cropland soils can be recarbonized through the adoption of recommended management practices (RMPs) such as conservation tillage, residue mulching and use of cover crops, practices which all contribute to SOC accumulation and sequestration by an additional transfer of C from the atmosphere to the soil. Translating science of cropland soil management into a global restorative program is a high priority for feeding the world, mitigating climate change and improving the environment.

TI  - Comparing airborne and terrestrial LiDAR with ground-based inventory metrics of vegetation structural complexity in oil palm agroforests
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Vegetation structural complexity is an important component of forest ecosystems, influencing biodiversity and functioning. Due to the heterogeneous distribution of vegetation elements, structural complexity underpins ecological dynamics, species composition, microclimate, and habitat diversity. Field measurements and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, such as airborne (ALS) and terrestrial (TLS), can assess structural characteristics of forest and agroforestry systems at various spatial scales. This assessment is urgently needed for monitoring ecosystem restoration in degraded lands (e.g., in oil palm landscapes), where it is not well-known how structural measures derived from these different approaches relate to each other. Here, we compared the degree of correlation between individual and multivariate datasets of vegetation structural complexity metrics derived from ALS, TLS, and ground-based inventory approaches. The study was conducted in a 140 ha oil palm monoculture, enriched with 52 plots in the form of tree islands representing agroforestry systems of varying sizes and planted diversity levels in Sumatra, Indonesia. Our datasets comprised 25 ALS, five TLS, and nine groundbased inventory metrics. We studied correlations among metrics related to traditional stand summary, heterogeneity, and vertical and horizontal stand structure. We used principal component analysis for data dimensionality reduction, correlation analysis to quantify the strength of relationships between metrics, and Procrustes analysis to investigate the agreement between datasets. Significant correlations were found between ALS and TLS metrics for canopy density (r = 0.79) and maximum tree height (r = 0.58) and between ALS and ground-based inventory measures of stand heterogeneity and height diversity (r between 0.60 and -0.63). Further, we observed significant agreements between the ordinations of multivariate datasets (r = 0.56 for ALS - TLS; and r = 0.46 for ALS - ground-based inventory). Our findings underline the ability of ALS to capture structural complexity patterns, especially for canopy gap dynamics and vegetation height metrics, as captured by TLS, and for measures of heterogeneity and vertical structure as captured by ground-based inventories. Our study highlights the strength of each approach and underscores the potential of integrating ALS and TLS with ground-based inventories for a comprehensive characterization of vegetation structure in complex agroforestry systems, which can provide guidance for their management and support ecosystem restoration monitoring efforts.

TI  - Sustainability of Arabica coffee business in West Java, Indonesia: A multidimensional scaling approach
T2  - OPEN AGRICULTURE
AB  - Arabica coffee plantation area is limited, and production is still low while demand increases. The development of Arabica coffee in Indonesia faces many obstacles that threaten its sustainability. The objective of this study is to determine the sustainability status of the Arabica coffee business in West Java and formulate a sustainability strategy. Primary data were obtained through interviews with respondents and key persons from relevant stakeholders from upstream to downstream using a structured questionnaire. The study was conducted in August-October 2021 in Garut District, West Java. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) was used to assess the sustainability status of the Arabica coffee business in five dimensions, i.e., ecological, economic, social, marketing, and institutional. The results show that the Arabica coffee business in West Java is fairly sustainable, with an average score of 55.65%. The MDS analysis for each dimension reveals that the social dimension has the highest score (62.45%), followed by the ecological dimension (59.01%), the economic dimension (53.00%), the institutional dimension (51.92%), and the marketing dimension (51.87%). This study emphasizes five actions as parts of the sustainability strategy, i.e., adaptation and mitigation of climate change, creative efforts to increase farmers' income, human resource capacity building, strengthening business partnerships, and strengthening farmer organizations.

TI  - Perceptions of environmental change and use of traditional knowledge to plan riparian forest restoration with relocated communities in Alcantara, Eastern Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
AB  - Background: Riparian forests provide ecosystem services that are essential for human well-being. The Pepital River is the main water supply for Alcantara (Brazil) and its forests are disappearing. This is affecting water volume and distribution in the region. Promoting forest restoration is imperative. In deprived regions, restoration success depends on the integration of ecology, livelihoods and traditional knowledge (TEK). In this study, an interdisciplinary research framework is proposed to design riparian forest restoration strategies based on ecological data, TEK and social needs.
   Methods: This study takes place in a region presenting a complex history of human relocation and land tenure. Local populations from seven villages were surveyed to document livelihood (including 'free-listing' of agricultural crops and homegarden tree species). Additionally, their perceptions toward environmental changes were explored through semi-structured interviews (n = 79). Ethnobotanical information on forest species and their uses were assessed by local-specialists (n = 19). Remnants of conserved forests were surveyed to access ecological information on tree species (three plots of 1,000 m(2)).
   Results included descriptive statistics, frequency and Smith's index of salience of the free-list results. Results: The local population depends primarily on slash-and-burn subsistence agriculture to meet their needs. Interviewees showed a strong empirical knowledge about the environmental problems of the river, and of their causes, consequences and potential solutions. Twenty-four tree species (dbh > 10 cm) were found at the reference sites. Tree density averaged 510 individuals per hectare (stdv = 91.6); and 12 species were considered the most abundant (density > 10ind/ha). There was a strong consensus among plant-specialists about the most important trees. The species lists from reference sites and plant-specialists presented an important convergence.
   Conclusions: Slash-and-burn agriculture is the main source of livelihood but also the main driver of forest degradation. Effective restoration approaches must transform problems into solutions by empowering local people. Successional agroforestry combining annual crops and trees may be a suitable transitional phase for restoration. The model must be designed collectively and include species of ecological, cultural, and socioeconomic value. In deprived communities of the Amazon, forest restoration must be a process that combines environmental and social gains.

TI  - Examining demand for urban river rehabilitation in Indonesia: Insights from a spatially explicit discrete choice experiment
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - The demand for urban river rehabilitation can be measured through stated preference surveys such as choice experiments, providing information on the welfare estimates of a particular approach. We deploy such a technique in the context of plans to rehabilitate a major river in Jakarta, Indonesia. The current plan focuses on widening and canalizing the downstream segment of the river within Jakarta's administrative boundary. We hypothesize that residents would demand (and thus be willing to pay for) additional components of an ecological rehabilitation program in the form of riverside park space and upstream forest conservation outside of Jakarta's jurisdiction. We develop a spatially-explicit discrete choice experiment in which households register their preferences for channel widening, park space, forest conservation, and a monthly fee to fund the rehabilitation. Using mixed logit models we find significant and substantial demand for both park space and forest conservation, with a lower bound on the total willingness to pay (WTP) of greater than US $4 million per year for park space and nearly US $6 million per year to support reforestation in the upper catchment. These estimates are based on households within the catchment, but we find that demand did not seem to decay with distance so the upper bound on total WTP could be substantially higher. We also find that household income level has a strong effect on marginal WTP for forest conservation, minimal effect on marginal WTP for park space, and that location along the river influenced WTP for park space and channel widening. This provides further evidence that there is substantial demand for river rehabilitation in developing world cities, and that choice experiments can provide information relevant to land use planning.

TI  - Forest conservation maximises acai palm pollination services and yield in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Agricultural expansion is one of the main drivers of global pollinator loss. Paradoxically, this occurs while agriculture is becoming increasingly dependent on biotic pollination, raising concerns about food production. Integrated Crop Pollination (ICP), the use of both wild and managed pollinators in crop fields, can help conserve pollinator diversity while ensuring effective pollination services for growers. However, given the context-dependent nature of this approach, there is an urgent need to evaluate its application across different landscapes and crops.2. We apply the ICP approach to acai palm (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) production in the eastern Brazilian Amazon to explore effects of a native stingless bee, Scaptotrigona aff. postica (Apidae: Meliponini), and landscape-level forest conservation on yield and socioeconomic outcomes for acai fruit growers. We assessed flower visitor assemblages and fruit production on 18 plantations across a landscape forest cover gradient, with bee colonies introduced on nine plantations. Field data were combined with information from semistructured interviews of growers to estimate yield and profit per hectare under different pollinator management scenarios.3. Bee colonies and forest cover enhanced flower visitor abundance on palm inflorescences, but abundance increases attributed to managed bees were associated with shifts in flower visitor evenness and diversity (species richness), due to reduced visitation of wild bees near managed colonies.4. Fruit production on inflorescences was positively related to bee abundance and bee diversity. Consequently, overall pollination performance was lower in plantations with bee colonies. This was repeated at the hectare scale, where yield and profit were associated with surrounding forest cover and not bee colonies.5. Synthesis and applications. Managed bees can increase pollinator densities and fruit production, but the increased environmental and socioeconomic risks associated with this activity means acai growers should prioritise forest conservation to safeguard pollination services and improve overall sustainability of acai production in the eastern Brazilian Amazon.

TI  - Sapling biomass allometry and carbon content in five afforestation species on marginal farmland in semi-arid Benin
T2  - NEW FORESTS
AB  - Allometric equations are routinely used in the estimation of biomass stocks for carbon accounting within forest ecosystems. However, generic equations may not reflect the growth trajectories of afforestation species that are introduced to degraded farmland characterized by water and nutrient limitations. Using sequential measurements of the height, basal diameter, and above- and belowground biomass of juvenile trees, we developed allometric equations for five woody species (Moringa oleifera Lam., Leucaena leucocephala Lam., Jatropha curcas L., Anacardium occidentale L. and Parkia biglobosa Jacq.) subjected to a gradient of water and nutrient availability in an afforestation trial on degraded cropland in the semi-arid zone of Benin, West Africa. For three of the species studied, the allometric relationships between basal diameter and biomass components (i.e. leaves, stems and roots) were described best by a simple power-law model (R-2 > 0.93). The incorporation of species-specific height-diameter relationships and total height as additional predictors in the power-law function also produced reasonable estimates of biomass. Fifteen months after planting, roots accounted for 10-58% of the total biomass while the root-to-shoot ratio ranged between 0.16 and 0.73. The total biomass of the saplings ranged between 1.4 and 10.3 Mg ha(-1), yielding 0.6-4.3 Mg C ha(-1), far exceeding the biomass in the traditional fallow system. The rate of stem carbon sequestration measured ca. 0.62 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). Overall, the allometric equations developed in this study are generally useful for assessing the standing shoot and root biomass of the five afforestation species during the juvenile growth stage and can help in reporting and verifying carbon stocks in young forests.

TI  - Collective Management of Natural Resources Based on Traditional Values in West Sumatera Indonesia
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Collective management of natural resources based on local values and practices is essential for sustainable management of natural resources. This study reassessed the traditional collective management of natural resources related to agriculture in West Sumatera. Descriptive analysis was used to evaluate the Adat (custom) of Minangkabau in natural resources management. The results showed that forest and stream are essential to the community as they provide ecosystem services such as clean air and the guidance of community culture. In managing the natural resources, Adat and religious values are fundamental principles. Based on these values, the traditional practices to protect and utilize nature are Rimbo Larangan (prohibited forest) and Lubuak Larangan (prohibited river). Additionally, Parak (agroforestry), Tanah Ulayat (communal land for agriculture), and Alek Banda (harvest ceremony) are the collective management of natural resources related to agriculture. These practices are based on fundamental principles, which are; (1) collective knowledge of Adat; (2) role of indigenous leader; and (3) Mufakat (consensus) in the decision-making process. Based on these traditional practices, the community can utilize the natural resources fairly and sustain the nature. Thus, this study suggests that the Adat Minangkabau in natural resource management needs to be conserved by utilizing traditional indigenous concepts.

TI  - Biomass and carbon storage of Eucalyptus and Acacia plantations in the Pearl River Delta, South China
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Forest plantations represent an important carbon sink. In the Pearl River Delta (PRD) in Southern China, fast-growing Eucalyptus and Acacia are favoured plantation species, but little is known regarding their efficiency with respect to biomass production, partitioning and dynamics with stand age, or the contribution made by the understory, litter and coarse woody debris (CWD) to the volume of biomass and fixed carbon. Here, a set of 21 plantations of various ages were monitored for the pattern of biomass accumulation and partitioning. A continuous biomass expansion factor (BEF) method was applied to a set of forest inventory data (FID) over the periods 1989-2003 to estimate biomass accumulation, carbon storage and its pattern of change over time. The accumulation of biomass increased with stand age, reaching, respectively, 207.45 and 189.35 t ha(-1) in mature Eucalyptus and Acacia plantations. The contribution of secondary biomass from the understory, litter layer and CWD accounted for, respectively, up to 10.2% and 20.3% of the total biomass in the two types of plantation, highlighting the significance of secondary biomass. At a similar growth stage, the ranking of the contribution to secondary biomass in the Eucalyptus plantations was litter > herbaceous plants > shrubs > CWD, while in the Acacia plantations, it was litter > CWD > shrubs > herbaceous plants. The Eucalyptus and Acacia plantations in the PRD accumulated some 2.66-7.84 Mt of biomass and sequestered 1.33-3.92 Mt of carbon. For both species, the bulk of the plantations (Eucalyptus 82.1%, Acacia 89.3%) were at the young to middle-aged stage. The Acacia plantations generated a higher biomass density than the Eucalyptus plantations. Forest management intensification and reforestation programmes, especially targeting Acacia or mixed Eucalyptus/Acacia forests, offer good potential for future carbon sequestration.

TI  - Constructing soils for climate-smart mining
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Surface mining is inherently linked to climate change, but more precise monitoring of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is necessary. Here we combined the geolocation of mine sites and carbon stock datasets to show that if all legal active mining sites in Brazil are exploited over the next decades, 2.55 Gt of CO2 equivalent (CO(2)eq) will be emitted due to the loss of vegetation (0.87 Gt CO(2)eq) and soil (1.68 Gt CO(2)eq). To offset these emissions, we propose constructing soils (Technosols) from mine and other wastes for mine reclamation. We show that this strategy could potentially offset up to 60% (1.00 Gt CO(2)eq) of soil-related CO2 emissions. When constructed with suitable parent materials, Technosols can also restore important soil-related ecosystem services while improving waste management. The construction of healthy Technosols stands out as a promising nature-based solution towards carbon-neutral mining and should, therefore, be considered in future environmental policies of major mining countries.
   Soils constructed from mine waste can help mitigate future mining-related carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 1 Gt CO(2)eq in Brazil through supporting ecosystem carbon stock recovery, suggest estimates derived from geospatial analysis of legal mining activity and soil carbon in Brazil.

TI  - Dendrometry, production, and nutritional value of Mimosa caesalpiniifolia (Leguminosae) under monocrop and silvopastoral system
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Legumes trees have the potential to provide diverse ecosystem services in different cropping systems. The objective of this study was to evaluate the dendrometric, productive characteristics and nutritional value of Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth. in monocrop and a silvopastoral system, in Brazil. The treatments were distributed under a randomized block design, with three replications, and consisted of M. caesalpiniifolia monocrop system and silvopasture (signal grass + M. caesalpiniifolia). At 38 months after planting, evaluations were carried out every 56 days for two years. The data were analyzed using repeated measures over time using SAS on demand (2021) and the treatment means were compared using PDIFF with Tukey's test (P < 0.05). There was no effect of cropping systems on plant height (similar to 5.2 m). The greatest values for diameter at breast height (16.32 cm), basal diameter (20.54 cm), and dry matter production per plant (36 g DM plant(-1)) were observed in the silvopasture system. Higher content of crude protein (221 g kg(-1)), acid detergent fiber (449 g kg(-1)), and digestibility (383 g kg(-1)) were observed in the rainy season, while the highest dry matter content (426 g kg(-1)) occurred in the dry season. Mimosa caesalpiniifolia showed appropriate dendrometric characteristics in the silvopasture system. The silvopasture provides greater forage production per plant of M. caesalpiniifolia and better nutritional value of the forage than the legume monocrop.

TI  - What you see is not what you get: the role of ultrasonic detectors in increasing inventory completeness in Neotropical bat assemblages
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Microchiropteran bats have the potential to be important biodiversity indicator species as they are distributed globally and are important in ecosystem functioning. Survey and monitoring protocols for bats are often ineffective as sampling techniques vary in their efficacy depending on the species involved and habitats surveyed. Acoustic sampling using bat detectors may prove an alternative or complementary technique to capture methods but is largely untested in the tropics.
   2. To compare the efficacy of bat detectors and capture methods in surveys, we used ground mist nets, sub-canopy mist nets and harp traps to sample bats while simultaneously recording the echolocation calls of insectivorous bats in a diversity of habitats in the Yucatan, Mexico. We described echolocation calls, analysed call characteristics to identify species, and compared species inventories derived from traditional capture methods with those derived from acoustic sampling.
   3. A total of 2819 bats representing 26 species and six families were captured; 83% were captured in ground nets, 13% in sub-canopy nets and 4% in harp traps. Fourteen species and five phonic types were identified based on five echolocation call characteristics. Discriminant function analysis showed a high level of correct classification of the calls (84.1%), indicating that identification of species by their echolocation calls is feasible.
   4. In all habitats, acoustic sampling and capture methods sampled significantly more species each night than capture methods alone. Capture methods failed to sample 30% of the bat fauna, and aerial insectivores were sampled only by bat detectors.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Given the importance of bats in ecosystem functioning, and their potential as indicator species, developing effective methodologies to survey and monitor bats is important for sustainable forest management and biodiversity conservation. Acoustic sampling should be used with capture methods to increase inventory completeness in bat assemblage studies, and could form part of a single standardized monitoring protocol that can be used globally in tropical forests, as this method detects aerial insectivores not sampled by capture methods.

TI  - Deforestation in Central Africa:: Estimates at regional, national and landscape levels by advanced processing of systematically-distributed Landsat extracts
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Accurate land cover change estimates are among the headline indicators set by the Convention on Biological Diversity to evaluate the progress toward its 20 10 target concerning habitat conservation. Tropical deforestation is of prime interest since it threatens the terrestrial biomes hosting the highest levels of biodiversity. Local forest change dynamics, detected over very large extents, are necessary to derive regional and national figures for multilateral environmental agreements and sustainable forest management. Current deforestation estimates in Central Africa are derived either from coarse to medium resolution imagery or from wall-to-wall coverage of limited areas. Whereas the first approach cannot detect small forest changes widely spread across a landscape, operational costs limit the mapping extent in the second approach. This research developed and implemented a new cost-effective approach to derive area estimates of land cover change by combining a systematic regional sampling scheme based on high spatial resolution imagery with object-based unsupervised classification techniques. A multi-date segmentation is obtained by grouping pixels with similar land cover change trajectories which are then classified by unsupervised procedures. The interactive part of the processing chain is therefore limited to land cover class labelling of object clusters. The combination of automated image processing and interactive labelling renders this method cost-efficient. The approach was operationally applied to the entire Congo River basin to accurately estimate deforestation at regional, national and landscape levels. The survey was composed of 10 x 10 km sampling sites systematically-distributed every 0.5 degrees over the whole forest domain of Central Africa, corresponding to a sampling rate of 3.3%. For each of the 571 sites, subsets were extracted from both Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery acquired in 1990 and 2000 respectively. Approximately 60% of the 390 cloud-free samples do not show any forest cover change. For the other 165 sites, the results are depicted by a change matrix for every sample site describing four land cover change processes: deforestation, reforestation, forest degradation and forest recovery. This unique exercise estimates the deforestation rate at 0.21% per year, while the forest degradation rate is close to 0.15% per year. However, these figures are less reliable for the coastal region where there is a lack of cloud-free imagery. The results also show that the Landscapes designated after 2000 as high priority conservation zones by the Congo Basin Forest Partnership had undergone significantly less deforestation and forest degradation between 1990 and 2000 than the rest of the Central African forest.

TI  - Why were upscaled incentive programs for forest conservation adopted? Comparing policy choices in Brazil, Ecuador, and Peru
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
AB  - Forest conservation policies could potentially become a centerpiece for climate change mitigation. Incentive-based conservation policies, such as payments for environmental services (PES), are seen as promising approaches to reduce deforestation. Yet, arguably the adoption of upscaled PES programs has remained slow, and when implemented their design often diverges from the principles laid out in the theory-based PES literature. In this article, we concentrate on some political economy forces that could help explaining the gap between PES theory and practice, with respect to policy adoption, including opportunities and challenges in this process. Public policy theories grasp the adoption determinants of three large, government-led incentive programs for forest conservation in the Amazon, in Peru, Ecuador, and Brazil. We use Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework to analyze decision-making regarding program initiation, including key stakeholder interviews, to understand policy choices. We find that environmental concerns are not always the prime motives for PES programs, as political and institutional contexts limit environmental policy-makers' actions. Yet, policy choice processes become less constrained when environmental issues are closer to a government's priorities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Litter Traits of Native and Non-Native Tropical Trees Influence Soil Carbon Dynamics in Timber Plantations in Panama
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Tropical reforestation initiatives are widely recognized as a key strategy for mitigating rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Although rapid tree growth in young secondary forests and plantations sequesters large amounts of carbon (C) in biomass, the choice of tree species for reforestation projects is crucial, as species identity and diversity affect microbial activity and soil C cycling via plant litter inputs. The decay rate of litter is largely determined by its chemical and physical properties, and trait complementarity of diverse litter mixtures can produce non-additive effects, which facilitate or delay decomposition. Furthermore, microbial communities may preferentially decompose litter from native tree species (homefield advantage). Hence, information on how different tree species influence soil carbon dynamics could inform reforestation efforts to maximize soil C storage. We established a decomposition experiment in Panama, Central America, using mesocosms and litterbags in monoculture plantations of native species (Dalbergia retusa Hemsl. and Terminalia amazonia J.F.Gmel., Exell) or teak (Tectona grandis L.f.) to assess the influence of different litter types and litter mixtures on soil C dynamics. We used reciprocal litter transplant experiments to assess the homefield advantage and litter mixtures to determine facilitative or antagonistic effects on decomposition rates and soil respiration in all plantation types. Although litter properties explained some of the variation in decomposition, the microclimate and soil properties in the plantations also played an important role. Microbial biomass C and litter decomposition were lower in Tectona than in the native plantations. We observed non-additive effects of mixtures with Tectona and Dalbergia litter on both decomposition and soil respiration, but the effect depended on plantation type. Further, there was a homefield disadvantage for soil respiration in Tectona and Terminalia plantations. Our results suggest that tree species diversity plays an important role in the resilience of tropical soils and that plantations with native tree species could help maintain key processes involved in soil carbon sequestration.

TI  - The ecological role and potential impact of an alien tree highly attractive to native nectar-feeding birds in urban areas
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Alien plants may provide considerable benefits to biodiversity in urban areas while showing low to moderate risk of negative impacts. Here, we evaluated the ecological role of the alien tree Bombax ceiba when interacting with nectar-feeding birds, including its potential for negative impacts as an invasive plant in an urban area in Brazil. At the community level, network analysis of 70 bird species interacting with flowers from 73 plant species showed B. ceiba to be one of the few "hub" plant species, indicating its importance as a nectar resource for urban birds. Specifically, B. ceiba flowers attracted 38 bird species with different habits (feeding guilds and habitat requirements), most of which fed on nectar, while some also consumed floral parts. On the other hand, the semiquantitative risk assessment for B. ceiba regarding potential negative impacts on native species and ecosystems indicated only a moderate risk, suggesting an overall benefit of keeping this tree species in the urban landscape. In this context, we highlight that the function, not only the origin of a species, may be used to plan "biophilic" cities through urban greening. Moreover, possible suppression of alien plants should consider the ecological role these species play in urban areas. Given that proper assessment of risk factors is carried out, urban afforestation with some alien plant species can promote biodiversity and ecosystem services by providing key resources during food scarcity for the fauna.

TI  - Edge effect impacts on forest structure and carbon stocks in REDD plus projects: An assessment in the Amazon using UAV-LiDAR
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Land use/land cover change (LULCC) is an ongoing process in the Brazilian Amazon, and it is a major source of emissions through the processes of deforestation and forest degradation. Identifying and monitoring deforestation and different sources of degradation is crucial for the success of forest conservation and REDD+ projects (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation). This study aims to investigate edge effects caused by land use change in REDD+ projects and understand their effect on forest structure and carbon storage potential. Here, the edge effect is not primarily caused by direct human intervention but rather by microclimatic changes induced by the agricultural conversion of adjacent areas. The study was conducted on ongoing REDD+ projects established in the Brazilian Amazon, and we relied on statistical modeling to relate forest structural characteristics (i.e., canopy height, canopy roughness, canopy openness, carbon stock, leaf area index, and understory leaf area index) along the distance gradient from the forest edge to its interior. Our findings demonstrate that edge effects extend up to a distance between 30 and 65 m, showcasing the remarkable resilience of the forests examined in this study. By comparing the area impacted by the edge effect to the forest interior, we observed a 19.6 % reduction in canopy height, 23.3 % reduction in carbon stock, 17 % reduction in leaf area index, 35.6 % increase in canopy roughness, and more than 100 % increase in canopy openness. Our results show how this source of edge effect can affect the total carbon stock of projects with different sizes. In large areas (i.e., 5000 ha), edge effect does not have a significant impact on the total carbon stock due to the small proportion of edge area, reducing 0.8 % of the total carbon stock. Nevertheless, small areas are more subjected to emission caused by edge effect, where a project with 100 ha can have a loss of 5 % in carbon stock. These results underscore the importance of promoting the widespread adoption of remote sensing techniques in REDD+ projects. This study has revealed the significant potential of LiDAR technology for monitoring local degradation in REDD+ projects. The methodology allowed for a comprehensive and detailed assessment of forest structure, offering replicable and periodic monitoring capabilities to enhance its effectiveness.

TI  - Decreasing uncertainties and reversing paradigms on the economic performance of agroforestry systems in Brazil
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - The return on investment in agroforestry depends mainly on meteorological and market variables, both uncontrollable. For this, it is necessary to prepare investment projects to verify the feasibility before executing them, minimizing the risks and uncertainties to the farmer. In this sense, the study aimed to identify the economic and financial viability of a biodiverse agroforestry system to boost income generation and recovery of degraded areas. For this, it was decided to model a biodiverse agroforestry arrangement with the purpose of meeting the new Brazilian Forest Code, Law no. 12,651 of 2012 and promoting economic-financial return to the family farmer in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul. The study method considered the following capital investment valuation techniques: Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Equivalent Uniform Annual Worth (EUAW), Discounted Payback Period (DPP), Profitability Index (PI), Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR), Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) and Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). In addition, sensitivity and risk analyzes were developed using Software R (R Development Core Team). There were 10,000 interactions between variables of productivity, price and variable costs. The results demonstrate that the agroforestry system is significantly viable regardless of whether the farmer owns rural property, since net sales revenues can remain higher than the costs over 20 years.

TI  - Making a bridge between livelihoods and forest conservation: Lessons from non timber forest products' utilization in South Sumatera, Indonesia
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Promoting forest conservation as well as the well-being of forest proximate people requires an appropriate balance of regulation, enforcement, and incentives. When regulation and enforcement are minimal, economic incentives for low-intensity and non-deleterious forest use can provide conservation and livelihood benefits. One management option for promoting low intensity and non-deleterious forest use includes the harvest and production of non-timber forest products (NTFPs). This research identifies and examines strategies to promote sustainable livelihoods in a conservation landscape. We assess Pangkalan Bulian Village, Musi Banyuasin District, South Sumatra Province using the Community Livelihood Appraisal and Product Scanning (CLAPS) method to describe potential commodities and conduct value chain and market analyses on downstream sectors. Data collection included in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and household surveys disseminated through snowball sampling. We find that rattan is a priority NTFP due to the presence of abundant raw materials, trained human resources, and potential markets. Actors involved along the value chain are collectors, local brokers, large collectors, small processors, large processors, retailers and end consumers. Profit margins earned along each link of the value chain are around 25%. Thus, we encourage rattan harvest and production as a low intensity and non-deleterious forest use that can simultaneously benefit local livelihoods and forest conservation in a landscape where protected area rules and regulations are difficult to enforce.

TI  - Direct and cascading effects of landscape structure on tropical forest and non-forest frugivorous birds
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Global biodiversity is increasingly threatened by land-use change, but the direct and indirect drivers of species diversity in human-modified tropical landscapes are poorly known. Forest-dependent species are expected to be particularly sensitive to changes in landscape composition (e.g., forest loss) and configuration (e.g., increase of forest edges), both directly and indirectly through cascading landscape effects on local patterns of forest structure and resource availability. In contrast, non-forest-dependent species are probably more strongly related to landscape changes than to local forest patterns, as these species are able to use resources not only from the forest, but also from other landscape elements over larger spatial scales. We tested these hypotheses using structural equation modeling. In particular, we sampled 20 landscapes (115 ha each) from the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest to assess the effect of landscape-scale forest cover and amount of forest edges on the diversity of frugivorous birds, both directly and indirectly through the effect that these landscape variables may have on vegetation complexity and fruit biomass. We separately assessed the response of forest-dependent and non-forest-dependent frugivores to infer potential mechanisms underlying bird assemblages in fragmented landscapes. The diversity of forest-dependent birds mainly decreased with the simplification of vegetation complexity in more deforested landscapes, but increased with increasing fruit biomass in more forested landscapes (indirect effects). Both patterns were significant, thus supporting a strong bottom-up control, i.e., local habitat simplification and resource scarcity in highly deforested landscapes limits the maintenance of forest-dependent birds. Conversely, but as expected, non-forest-dependent birds were more strongly and directly related to landscape-scale patterns. In particular, landscapes with higher forest edge amount showed higher bird species diversity, probably because the increasing length of ecotones and interspersion/juxtaposition of different habitat types in landscapes with more forest edges can increase resource availability and foraging efficiency of non-forest-dependent birds. As the seed dispersal services offered by forest-dependent species cannot be ecologically compensated for by the proliferation of non-forest-dependent species, preventing forest loss is imperative to maintain forest-dependent birds and forest regeneration in this vanishing biodiversity hotspot.

TI  - Science and environmental policy establishment: the case of the Forest Act in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - Natural ecosystems are under severe threat worldwide and environmental policies are essential to minimize present and future impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem services and climate change. The New Forest Act in Brazil is the main policy to protect native vegetation in private lands, which comprise 54% of the remaining Brazilian native vegetation. However, conflicts between environmental and agricultural concerns in its implementation demand for balanced solutions based on scientific evidence. To face the challenge of applying science in environmental policy establishment, we developed a scientific project funded by the Sao Paulo State Research Foundation (FAPESP) to support the implementation of the New Forest Act in Sao Paulo State, as part of the Biota/FAPESP Program. The project was conducted differently from a regular research project: the broad objective was to provide scientific support to the State's implementation of the New Forest Act, based on a participatory interaction among stakeholders to build specific objectives, methods, and discussion of results, within an interdisciplinary and intersectoral research team. Here, we present the lessons learned during and after the four years of the research project development to evaluate how scientific knowledge can be produced and adopted in the implementation of a specific environmental policy. We present the main outcomes and the challenges faced in trying to include scientific data in the decision-making process. We also present current and future challenges in the New Forest Act implementation that could be solved with scientific evidence. The lessons learned showed that even designing the project in order to meet the needs to support the implementation of the environmental policy, avoiding difficulties normally pointed out by similar projects, there was a great difficulty for scientific contributions to be adopted in the decision-making process. Most of the scientific information and advice, even after discussion and common understanding among a diverse stakeholder group, were ignored or over-ruled in the final decision-making phases.

TI  - Trophic position determines the persistence of neotropical understory birds after forest disturbance
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Habitat loss and degradation are key drivers of the current biodiversity crisis. Most research focuses on the question of which traits allow species to persist in degraded habitats. We asked whether a species' trophic position or niche width influences the resilience of species in degraded habitats and to what extent habitat degradation affects trophic interactions between species. We used nitrogen isotope ratios (15N:14N, expressed as delta 15N value) to quantify and compare trophic positions and niche widths of understory birds inhabiting old-growth and young secondary forests in the Pacific lowlands of Costa Rica. We found that a species' trophic position rather than its trophic niche width determined its persistence in secondary forests. Species feeding at lower trophic levels in old-growth forests were less likely to persist in secondary forests than those occupying a higher trophic position in old-growth forests. This pattern is likely induced by the occurrence of relatively large-bodied habitat specialists with a flexible and high-trophic level diet in secondary forests. These habitat specialists likely caused generalist bird species to lower their trophic position relative to conspecifics in old-growth forests. Regarding trophic niche widths, species in secondary forests tend to have larger niche widths than old-growth forest species. However, as old-growth forest specialists and generalists did not differ in their niche widths, no systematic effect of trophic niche width on species persistence after forest disturbance was found. This is the first study that shows a systematic effect of trophic position on the persistence of a wide range of bird species in a disturbed forest ecosystem. It therefore provides important insights into species' responses to habitat degradation and the conservation value of secondary forests. To improve habitat quality for old-growth forest birds and facilitate avian seed dispersal, the creation of large contiguous forest patches should be prioritised when implementing reforestation measures.
   We studied whether an understory bird species' trophic position or niche width determines its persistence after forest disturbance in the Pacific lowlands of Costa Rica. Using stable isotope methodology, we found a significant effect of trophic position: Species feeding at low trophic levels in old-growth forests were less likely to persist in secondary forests. The dataset provides insights into species' responses to habitat degradation and the conservation value of the secondary forests in the study area, which are useful for planning of future conservation measures in the region.image

TI  - Effects of reduced impact logging on bat biodiversity in terra firme forest of lowland Amazonia
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Timber harvest is one of the main causes of degradation of Amazonian tropical forests, where bats represent important components of biodiversity. In addition, bats may represent keystone taxa in the Neotropics, as they are primary agents of pollination and seed dispersal for many pioneer plants. We assessed the impact of low harvest (18 m(3)/ha), reduced impact logging (RIL) on population and community characteristics of phyllostomid bats in Amazonian terra firme forest of Brazil at 20-42 months post-harvest. Based on 1-03,680 net-meter-hours of netting in Tapajo's National Forest, 2341 phyllostomids were captured, representing 42 species, 25 genera, and 4 broad feeding guilds. Population-level responses of common phyllostomids to RIL were minor, with 10 of 15 species evincing no change in mean abundance. Of those taxa. responding to RIL (mean difference in number of individuals per site), three increased (Artibeus concolor [0.46 individuals], Artibeus lituratus [3.88], and Glossophaga soricina [0.71]) and two decreased (Carollia brevicauda [0.96] and Carollia perspicillata [14.04]) in abundance. Compositional (species distributions) and structural (rank distributions) aspects of bat assemblages differed between cut and control forests. More specifically, bat assemblages in cut forest had increased diversity and decreased dominance compared to control forest. Nonetheless, the proportional abundance of the five most common species, as a group, was similar in cut (86%) and control forest (88%), and frugivores dominated assemblages in both management types. Mean abundance of frugivores decreased (10.59 individuals per site) in response to RIL; however, this response was driven by decreases in C. perspicillata, the most abundant species in terra firme forest. Although RIL had only minor effects on biodiversity in the short-term, extrapolation to a long-term prospectus should be exercised with caution when applied to conservation or policy issues.

TI  - Review: Biodiversity conservation strategy in a native perspective; case study of shifting cultivation at the Dayaks of Kalimantan
T2  - NUSANTARA BIOSCIENCE
AB  - Setyawan AD. 2010. Biodiversity conservation strategy in a native perspective; case study of shifting cultivation at the Dayaks of Kalimantan. Nusantara Bioscience 2:97-108. Native tribes generally are original conservationists; they build genuine conservation strategy of natural resources and environment for sustainable living. Dayak is a native tribe of Kalimantan that has been living for thousands of years; they use shifting cultivation to manage the communal forest lands due to Kalimantan's poor soil of minerals and nutrients, where the presence of phosphorus becomes a limiting factor for crops cultivation. In tropical forests, phosphorus mostly stored in the trees, so to remove it, the forest burning is carried out. Nutrients released into the soil can be used for upland rice (gogo) cultivation, until depleted; after that, cultivators need to open a forest, while the old land was abandoned (fallow) until it becomes forest again (for 20-25 years). The consecutive land clearing causes the formation of mosaics land with different succession ages and diverse biodiversity. This process is often combined with agroforestry systems (multicultural forest gardens), where the will-be-abandoned fields are planted with a variety of useful trees that can be integrated in forest ecosystems, especially rubber and fruits. These systems of shifting cultivation are often blamed as the main factor of forest degradation and fires, but in the last 300 years, this system has little impact on forest degradation. But, this is relatively low in productivity and subsistent, so it is not suitable for the modern agriculture which demands high productivity and measurable, mass and continuous yield, as well as related to the market. The increased population and industrial development of forestry, plantation, mining, etc. make the communal forest become narrower, so the fallow periods are shortened (5-15 years) and the lands are degraded into grasslands. In the future, shifting cultivation remains one of the Dayaks option to meet the needs of rice, but agroforestry should be developed because of its higher economic value.

TI  - Crop functional structure predicts the provision of Nature<acute accent>s material Contribution to People in diversified agroforestry
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
AB  - Applying concepts from natural ecosystem ecology, particularly through diversified cropping systems that integrate woody crops with other crops, can enhance agrobiodiversity and significantly contribute to multifunctional agriculture. The ecological and, more recently, the agronomic literature have indicated that functional trait aspects of diversity offer a more comprehensive explanation for ecosystem functions compared to species richness alone. In this study, we apply the trait-based approach during experimental agroforest succession in subtropical Southern Brazil to investigate the main factors of crop functional structure, differentiating the effects of functional diversity (FD) from functional identity (CWM- community weighted mean), on Nature 's Contributions to People (NCP). The experiment was designed varying crop FD, based on leaf nitrogen concentration, while maintaining crop species richness constant across all treatments. To assess FD and CWM, we measured six crop traits; maximum plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen content, leaf dry-matter content, and stem-specific density. Additionally, we evaluated four material NCP (green manure, forage, germplasm, and food) based on data collected during the initial four years of the experiment (2017 -2020). To analyze the data, we employed principal component analysis to reduce the number of variables and subsequently fitted linear mixed-effect models. Our findings provide support for the hypothesis that crop functional structure, particularly in relation to leaf traits (leaf area and leaf nitrogen content) and vegetative height, significantly influences material outputs and predicts above-ground biomass production that can be utilized as green manure and animal feed in agroforestry and silvopastoral systems. Both FD and CWM were important drivers of NCPs, showing that both niche complementarity and selection effects contribute to explain agroecosystem functioning. By utilizing functional traits, we reached valuable insights for generating agronomical recommendations and enhancing cropping system diversification through effective trait-based management.

TI  - Quantification and monitoring of deforestation in India over eight decades (1930-2013)
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - There is still large uncertainty over the status of global forest cover owing to the paucity of comprehensive and holistic studies related to long term forest cover change. The aim of the present work is to prepare a nation-wide multi-date forest cover database which describes and quantifies historical and recent changes in natural forests of India. This analysis facilitated the determination of the state of Indian forest cover changes over last eight decades. Here, we have mapped the total area under forest cover, evaluated the spatial tracking of changes in natural forests, estimated the rate of deforestation and afforestation, analysed the biogeographic zone wise and state wise forest cover change, existing land use in deforested area, influence of environmental factors such as terrain on deforestation and implication of different definitions of forest used by agencies reporting deforestation in India. The results indicated that forests covered an area of 869,012 km(2) in 1930 which has decreased to 625,565 km(2) in 2013, a net loss of 243,447 km(2) (28 %) in eight decades. The highest annual average forest loss was found to be 4795 km(2) during 1930-1975, 1476 km(2) during 1975-1985, 767 km(2) during 1985-1995, 356 km(2) during 1995-2005 and 209 km(2) during 2005-2013. Between 1930 and 1975, forest experienced large scale deforestation at gross annual rate of 0.77 % which has declined to 0.29 % and 0.14 % for the 1975-1985 and 1985-1995 periods respectively. Quantification of annual rate of gross deforestation for the recent period indicates 0.07 % during 1995-2005 and 0.05 % during 2005-2013. The lower rates of deforestation during recent period support effectiveness of conservation measures taken at national level. It was found that deforestation rate has decreased in many biogeographic zones by 2005, except for Andaman & Nicobar Islands and North East. The major deforestation has mostly occurred due to conversion of forests to agriculture. The construction of reservoirs contributed to 4.1 % of forest loss. The tropical forests have experienced large scale deforestation followed by subtropical forests. The findings of the study will be useful to prioritize conservation and protection of forest cover at the regional level. It shall also provide a base for future research on the impacts of deforestation on carbon flux and biodiversity.

TI  - Assessment of Suitability of Tree Species for Bioenergy Production on Burned and Degraded Peatlands in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - LAND
AB  - Large areas of deforested and degraded land, particularly degraded peatlands, need a viable long-term solution for restoration, ideally one that ensures energy security without compromising food security or biodiversity conversation. To address a knowledge gap on the most adaptive bioenergy crop(s) for degraded lands, this research project assessed the survival and growth performance of potential bioenergy crops to restore burned and degraded peatlands. Our methodology compared the bioenergy species with the potential to survive in extreme environments, i.e., gamal [Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Walp.], kaliandra (Calliandra calothyrsus Meissner), kemiri sunan [Reutealis trisperma (Blanco) Airy Shaw], and nyamplung (Calophyllum inophyllum L.). Observed parameters are plant survival rates, tree height, and circular stem growth. The experiment was conducted between March 2016 to February 2017 in a two-hectare demonstration plot on burned and degraded peatland in Buntoi village, Pulang Pisau, Central Kalimantan province. Using a split plot design, two treatments were given to each species, i.e., monoculture plantation and agroforestry (intercropped with Ananas comosus (L.) Merr.); with each treatment, the species were replicated on two separate plots. Results indicate that nyamplung is the most adoptable species followed by kemiri sunan, however both species performed very well under agroforestry treatment when compared with monoculture. Further study is needed to assess the productivity and associate biofuel yield.

TI  - Combining focus group discussions and choice experiments for economic valuation of peatland restoration: A case study in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
AB  - This study explores the benefits of combining results of qualitative focus group discussions (FGDs) with a quantitative choice experiment (CE) in a low-income country context. The assessment addresses the compensation needed by local communities in Central Kalimantan to cooperate in peatland restoration programs. The main policy message of the study is that such programs would have to provide arrangements that secure a stable income and food supply, as well as create awareness of the long-term benefits of peatland restoration. The results of this study demonstrate the value of combining qualitative and quantitative methods to improve the reliability and validity of studies assessing the value of ecological services. FGDs prove to be paramount to understanding the underlying attitudes and motives towards the proposed scenarios and its institutional context. FGDs provide the possibility to identify the specific terms and conditions on which respondents would accept land-use change scenarios and help to understand preferences regarding the distribution of costs and benefits over time. Yet the individual CE responses offer important quantitative information about the magnitude of welfare changes associated with restoration. Moreover, the privacy of the elicitation process avoids peer-pressure. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Classification of Tree Species in a Diverse African Agroforestry Landscape Using Imaging Spectroscopy and Laser Scanning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Airborne imaging spectroscopy (IS) and laser scanning (ALS) have been explored widely for tree species classification during the past decades. However, African agroforestry areas, where a few exotic tree species are dominant and many native species occur less frequently, have not yet been studied. Obtaining maps of tree species would provide useful information for the characterization of agroforestry systems and detecting invasive species. Our objective was to study tree species classification in a diverse tropical landscape using IS and ALS data at the tree crown level, with primary interest in the exotic tree species. We performed multiple analyses based on different IS and ALS feature sets, identified important features using feature selection, and evaluated the impact of combining the two data sources. Given that a high number of tree species with limited sample size (499 samples for 31 species) was expected to limit the classification accuracy, we tested different approaches to group the species based on the frequency of their occurrence and Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance. Surface reflectance at wavelengths between 400-450 nm and 750-800 nm, and height to crown width ratio, were identified as important features. Nonetheless, a selection of minimum noise fraction (MNF) transformed reflectance bands showed superior performance. Support vector machine classifier performed slightly better than the random forest classifier, but the improvement was not statistically significant for the best performing feature set. The highest F1-scores were achieved when each of the species was classified separately against a mixed group of all other species, which makes this approach suitable for invasive species detection. Our results are valuable for organizations working on biodiversity conservation and improving agroforestry practices, as we showed how the non-native Eucalyptus spp., Acacia mearnsii and Grevillea robusta (mean F1-scores 76%, 79% and 89%, respectively) trees can be mapped with good accuracy. We also found a group of six fruit bearing trees using JM distance, which was classified with mean F1-score of 65%. This was a useful finding, as these species could not be classified with acceptable accuracy individually, while they all share common economic and ecological importance.

TI  - Economic Value of Environmental Services Regulating Flow and Maintaining Water Quality in the Piracicaba River Basin, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - From distributed or semidistributed hydrological models, it is possible to identify where land use decisions can bring greater economic benefits in relation to water use. This study aimed to integrate simulations of a hydrological model varying the land use in four reforestation scenarios that influence the economic benefits of provision environmental services, including the user's alternatives as a key parameter and finally estimating the economic value of such benefits. The "avoided costs" method was used for economic valuation of flow regularization service and adequacy of water quality in the Piracicaba River basin, aiming to generate various economic instruments to support decision makers. The cost for water storage was estimated from the rising rain volume infiltrating the soil from the change in the dynamics of land use, whereas the cost of maintaining water quality was obtained from the variation between the effects of scenarios in nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment loads. The valuation methodology allowed us to estimate the avoided costs, which will mainly contribute to application of economic instruments to manage water resources, directing land use decisions in hydrographic basins, guiding environmental impact assessment studies, and the definition of mitigation measures.

TI  - Rush for cash crops and forest protection: Neither land sparing nor land sharing
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - In many countries with large tracts of tropical forests, there is a dual focus on enhancing forest protection and increasing commercial agriculture for economic development. Laos is a case in point for this development as the Government of Laos (GoL) has a strong commitment to economic growth, which rural farmers in part help realize through a rush for cash crop production destined to be sold in neighboring countries. Maize cultivation, for example, is rapidly expanding and grown under a contract-farming system for Vietnamese markets. At the same time, GoL attempts to increase nationwide forest cover and prepares for REDD+ (reducing deforestation and forest degradation). This paper explores how the recent boom in cash crops is impacting land use and livelihoods of local communities, as well as affecting forest conservation in Hua Meuang District of Huaphan Province in northeastern Laos. We also examine how local authorities react to these changes and navigate the contradicting policies. Furthermore, the paper analyzes to what extent the land sparing intention of land- and forest-land allocation policies are fulfilled. We found that the production of maize has rapidly expanded in Hua Meuang District since the mid-2000s as a result of high demands for maize in Vietnam and because local authorities see the crop as a way to reduce rural poverty and reduce traditional subsistence shifting cultivation practices. Communities have increased the areas that they dedicate to maize cultivation and have achieved an increase in both income and household assets. Maize has replaced upland rice cultivation as well as primary and secondary forests. Although the government policies aim to spare land for forest conservation by intensifying agriculture, the result is rapid agricultural expansion and no spared forest. Moreover, the traditional land-sharing landscapes with forest, fallows, and fields are being transformed, creating landscapes that are increasingly dominated by agriculture. This may still be in line with economic development policies, but it is at odds with forest conservation policies, REDD+ policies, and the GoL target of increasing forest cover in the country.

TI  - Growth, carbon sequestration, and management of native tree plantations in humid regions of Costa Rica
T2  - NEW FORESTS
AB  - The Costa Rican government has provided incentives for reforestation programs since 1986 and initiated a Payment for Environmental Services program in 1996. These incentives yielded native species reforestation programs throughout the country. This research aims to provide information about growth, carbon sequestration, and management of seven native tree species (Vochysia guatemalensis, Vochysia ferruginea, Hyeronima alchorneoides, Calophyllum brasiliense, Terminalia amazonia, Virola koschnyi, and Dipteryx panamensis) growing in small and medium- sized plantations in the Caribbean and Northern lowlands of Costa Rica. A total of 179 plots were evaluated in 32 farms. Overall, I found that V. guatemalensis, V. ferruginea, H. alchorneoides, and T. amazonia were the species with the fastest diameter, total height, and volume growth; and T. amazonia and D. panamensis sequestered more carbon. Moreover, I found that the plantations that had been thinned before this assessment had the best growth. The results of the present research enhance the criteria elaborated in previous research findings to improve species choices for reforestation and silvicultural management in Costa Rica and in other regions with similar ecological features. Furthermore, they support the concept that tropical plantations can serve diverse economic, social, and ecological functions that may ultimately help reduce atmospheric CO2 accumulation.

TI  - An assessment of carbon stock for various land use system in Aravally mountains, Western India
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation in developing countries is of the central importance in efforts to combat climate change. A study was conducted to measure carbon stocks in various land-use systems including forms and reliably estimates the impact of land use on carbon (C) stocks in the forest of Rajasthan, western India (23 degrees 3'-30 degrees 12'N longitude and 69 degrees 30'-78 degrees 17'E). 22.8% of India is forested and 0.04% is the deforestation rate of India. In Indian forest sector of western India of Aravally mountain range covered large area of deciduous forest and it's very helpful in carbon sequestration at global level. The carbon stocks of forest, plantation (reforestation) and agricultural land in aboveground, soil organic and fine root within forest were estimated through field data collection. Results revealed that the amount of total carbon stock of forests (533.64 +/- 37.54 Mg.ha(-1), simplified expression of Mg (carbon) .ha(-1)) was significantly greater (P<0.05) than the plantation (324.37 +/- 15.0 Mg.ha(-1)) and the agricultural land (120.50 +/- 2.17 Mg.ha(-1)). Soil organic carbon in the forests (172.84 +/- 3.78 Mg.ha(-1)) was also significantly greater (P<0.05) than the plantation (153.20 +/- 7.48 Mg.ha(-1)) and the agricultural land (108.71 +/- 1.68 Mg.ha(-1)). The differences in carbon stocks across land-use types are the primary consequence of variations in the vegetation biomass and the soil organic matter. Fine root carbon was a small fraction of carbon stocks in all land-use types. Most of the soil organic carbon and fine root carbon content was found in the upper 30-cm layer and decreased with soil depth. The aboveground carbon (ABGC): soil organic carbon (SOC): fine root carbon ratios (FRC), was 8:4:1, 4:5:1, and 3:37:1 for the forest, plantation and agricultural land, respectively. These results indicate that a relatively large proportion of the C loss is due to forest conversion to agricultural land.

TI  - Integrated analysis of agroecosystems with citrus orchards in organic, agroforestry, and conventional systems
T2  - AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Understanding interactions that emerge in complex ecological networks is fundamental to developing a more sustainable agriculture. We studied three agricultural farms in subtropical Brazil, consisting of conventional citrus (Cconv), organic citrus (Corg) and citrus in agroforestry system (Cagr), and two forest areas, one 40-years old (F40) and the other 200-years old (F200). We determined Pfeiffer's circular chromatography (PCC) analyses and soil chemical, physical, and biological properties in different soil layers. The PCC expressed soil properties in an integrated manner and improved our understanding of the relation of chromatography patterns with soil physical properties (soil density, porosity, aggregate stability, total organic carbon, and FDA hydrolysis). Forest areas and citrus orchards under different managements were also distinguished by chromatography. Thus, chromatography is an important tool for assessing soil quality/health in citrus and forest systems. The best options to maintain soil quality in citrus orchards are the agroforestry and organic systems. These two cropping systems have greater spontaneous coverage (Margalef index, occurrence, and richness) and soil pH, soil organic carbon, porosity, and Pfeiffer chromatography parameters. Permanent soil cover, mowing, composting, biofertilizers, and minimum machinery traffic contribute to improving soil quality.

TI  - Will Passive Protection Save Congo Forests?
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Central Africa's tropical forests are among the world's largest carbon reserves. Historically, they have experienced low rates of deforestation. Pressures to clear land are increasing due to development of infrastructure and livelihoods, foreign investment in agriculture, and shifting land use management, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The DRC contains the greatest area of intact African forests. These store approximately 22 billion tons of carbon in aboveground live biomass, yet only 10% are protected. Can the status quo of passive protection-forest management that is low or nonexistent-ensure the preservation of this forest and its carbon? We have developed the SimCongo model to simulate changes in land cover and land use based on theorized policy scenarios from 2010 to 2050. Three scenarios were examined: the first (Historical Trends) assumes passive forest protection; the next (Conservation) posits active protection of forests and activation of the national REDD+ action plan, and the last (Agricultural Development) assumes increased agricultural activities in forested land with concomitant increased deforestation. SimCongo is a cellular automata model based on Bayesian statistical methods tailored for the DRC, built with the Dinamica-EGO platform. The model is parameterized and validated with deforestation observations from the past and runs the scenarios from 2010 through 2050 with a yearly time step. We estimate the Historical Trends trajectory will result in average emissions of 139 million t CO2 year(-1) by the 2040s, a 15% increase over current emissions. The Conservation scenario would result in 58% less clearing than Historical Trends and would conserve carbon-dense forest and woodland savanna areas. The Agricultural Development scenario leads to emissions of 212 million t CO2 year(-1) by the 2040s. These scenarios are heuristic examples of policy's influence on forest conservation and carbon storage. Our results suggest that 1) passive protection of the DRC's forest and woodland savanna is insufficient to reduce deforestation; and 2): enactment of a REDD+ plan or similar conservation measure is needed to actively protect Congo forests, their unique ecology, and their important role in the global carbon cycle.

TI  - Review of allometric equations for major land covers in SE Asia: Uncertainty and implications for above- and below-ground carbon estimates
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Our review of biomass studies conducted for 11 Southeast Asian countries, Papua New Guinea, and southern China uncovered 402 above-ground and 138 below-ground biomass allometric equations for the following major land covers: forest, peat swamp forest, mangrove forest, logged over forest, orchard and tree plantation, rubber plantation, oil palm plantation, bamboo, swidden fallow, and grassland/pasture/shrub land. No equations existed for non-swidden agroforest and permanent croplands, two other important land covers involved in current and projected land-cover transitions. We also found 245 stem-volume equations and 50 height-diameter equations. Applying existing allometric equations out of convenience is potentially a key source of uncertainty in above- and below-ground carbon stock estimates in many SE Asian landscapes. Differences in environmental conditions and vegetation characteristics should preclude the use of many pre-existing equations at locations outside of the geographical location where they were developed, without first verifying their applicability. While use of site-specific equations is preferred to reduce uncertainty in estimates, there are few in existence for many land covers and many geographical areas of the region. For example, few or no equations exist for Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, and Timor Leste. Ten or fewer above-ground biomass equations exist for rubber plantation, oil palm plantation, non-swidden agroforest, grassland/pasture/shrublands, and permanent croplands for the entire region. Even site-specific equations can introduce uncertainties to biomass estimates if they were determined from an insufficient sample size. Difficulties associated with sampling below-ground root biomass accurately often leads to allometric equations that potentially under-estimate below-ground biomass. In addition, substantial errors may be present if these below-ground equations are conveniently used by researchers in lieu of site-specific measurements. Although the importance of including wood density in allometry is increasingly recognized, only 26 of the reviewed studies did so. Ideally, when wood density values are used to estimate biomass, new on-site measurements should be taken, rather than relying on pre-existing values. This review demonstrates that more research in SE Asia is needed on biomass in general, specifically for several land covers including peat swamp forest, rubber and oil palm plantations, bamboo, swidden fallow, non-swidden agroforest, and permanent cropland. Importantly, for the purpose of informing the development and implementation of policies and programs such as REDD+, our meta-analysis highlights the pressing need to address the insufficient number of allometric equations and the possible inappropriate use of some when estimating vegetation biomass related to current and potential land cover changes in the region.

TI  - Cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) climate zones and its associated agrobiodiversity in Arauca, Colombia
T2  - BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL
AB  - Cacao (Theobroma cacao L) is one of the most relevant crops in terms of economy and social rural development in Colombia. Cacao is also an important crop due to its potential to replace illicit crops and it is related to less deforestation and preserves the biodiversity. There are several cacao districts in Colombia, one of these being Arauca. The Department of Arauca is the second largest cocoa producing region in Colombia; however, it is heavily affected by armed conflict. To raise the knowledge and technology available in the region, integrating data on the occurrence of cacao farms with climatic variables becomes powerful socioeconomic mapping tool for maintaining agrobiodiversity and food security the region. Consequently, this type of agrodiversity data and agroclimatic approaches help to better manage agrobiodiversity, as in the cacao region of Arauca. These tools are even more relevant in biodiverse regions, such as flooded savannahs and tropical forest ecosystems, which are currently undergoing drastic changes due to agricultural expansion and climate change. One of the knowledge gaps in Colombia ' s cacao regions is that there are currently no agroclimatic maps made with a social and scientific approach. This study aimed to provide a database of the spatial distribution of cacao farms in Arauca, as well as agroclimatic maps that identify and locate cacao climate regions in Arauca. We also present a presence-only matrix consisting of twenty-six tree species, or agrobiodiversity, distributed across the study region and specifically associated with the cacao forestry systems in Arauca.New information We present the first database of both climate and agrobiodiversity data related to cacao farms in Arauca, developed with a research and socioeconomic vision that generated a novel approach for the agroclimatic zoning of cocoa in the Arauca Region and Colombia. Using 1,538 cacao farms at the regional scale, we identified two national and six regional -scale climate and soil regions. The selection at the local scale allowed us to classify 180 cacao farms comprising nine agroclimatic clusters in Arauca. We found twenty-six tree species distributed across the cacao climate zones. This dataset and its related maps also represent the agrobiodiversity of cultivated cacao locally. This is the most complete climate and agrobiodiversity dataset of cacao farms distribution in one of the top cocoa-producing regions in the country. These outputs are crucial because they constitute a baseline for developing research in the biodiversity of agroforestry systems, pests and diseases, pollutant presence, genetics, post-harvest processing and cocoa quality and safety.

TI  - Urban Gardens and Soil Compaction: a Land Use Alternative for Runoff Decrease
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB  - After several landscape transformations caused by human activities, finding a suitable environment becomes increasingly challenging in urbanized regions. The predominance of non-permeable areas results in a low level of water infiltration. Notwithstanding, even green areas can have high runoff rates, since soil compaction has a decisive influence on the water movement. In places that have a natural predisposition to overflow, these problems are more significant. This study aimed to investigate causes of flooding, highlight the benefits of urban gardening and to propose urban gardening as an alternative to soil improvement in the Corujas Watershed, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The evaluation was based on: (a) the physical characteristics of the watershed, provided by morphometric analysis and land-use analysis; and (b) the soil compaction rates of an urban garden compared to a riparian forest and a grass area. The morphometric results indicated that the watershed has a significant flood tendency, and the land use map demonstrated that 29.55 % of the soil has some permeability. Nevertheless, this permeability currently varies according to soil management and cover. The grass area presented the highest compaction rates, the riparian forest a medium rate, and Corujas Garden the lowest rate. The garden also has green infrastructures and good management practices, which have led to the appearance and perpetuation of diffuse springs. These results showed that the urban garden activities could improve the physical characteristics of the soil and optimize water infiltration. Subsequent studies will investigate whether this characteristic also applies to other gardens located in different urban watersheds.

TI  - Macrozoobenthic community assemblage as key indicator for mangrove restoration success in North Sumatra and Aceh, Indonesia
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - The recognition of the high value of mangrove forests and the wide array of ecosystem services they provide has motivated investment in worldwide restoration efforts. However, current metrics of functional restoration (other than seedling survival rates and plant community composition) are often not readily available for local community managers, highlighting an urgency to identify easy-to-measure indicators to assess the functionality of restored mangroves. The macrozoobenthic community could be such practical indicator, as macrozoobenthic communities are sensitive to changes in their environment, and can be easily surveyed within local managing programs. Focusing on three main mangrove management conditions (natural, planted, and naturally regenerated) in North Sumatra and the province of Aceh, Indonesia, we compared vegetation and macrozoobenthic community diversity indices and identified environmental variables that best describe the forest management conditions and their associated macrozoobenthic community assemblage. Results showed that community assemblage, rather than macrozoobenthic diversity index, was associated with management conditions. The highest dissimilarity in macrozoobenthic community assemblages occurred between planted versus natural mangroves, with nonsignificant dissimilarity between natural and naturally regenerated mangroves. The Lined Nerite gastropod (Nerita balteata) was identified as an indicator of natural mangroves, and the invasive Giant African snail (Achatina fulica) was abundant in mangrove plantations, but also in natural mangroves bordering harbors, oil palm plantations, and aquaculture ponds, suggesting associated anthropogenic pressures. This study showed that the macrozoobenthic community can be used as restoration indicator and could serve as a baseline to empower monitoring activities and community-based adaptive management practices to improve the outcomes of restoration efforts.

TI  - Global Evolution of Research on Silvopastoral Systems through Bibliometric Analysis: Insights from Ecuador
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Scientific studies on silvopastoral systems have led to permanent changes oriented toward better silvopasture practices, as well as to policy strategies to respond effectively to the global objectives of restoration and sustainable development. In this work, we performed a bibliometric analysis with the purpose of identifying changes associated with different silvopastoral systems. We applied Bibliometrix in R to analyze 5708 documents published between 1983 and 2022 by including the terms "silvopastoral" and "silvopasture", among others. The results showed a longitudinal and exponential increase in silvopasture studies over the last 20 years. We adjusted the growth to an S-Curve function with an R-2 of 96.06%. The interest of researchers regarding knowledge about silvopasture has evolved; initially, it focused on the characterization of silvopasture, whereas recently, it has focused on the search for strategies to improve the sustainable use of silvopasture, including ecosystem restoration and the implementation of better practices. The following countries stand out as those with the largest scientific production of studies on silvopasture: The United States, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina in the Americas; China and India in Asia; and Spain; and Germany, and the United Kingdom in Europe. In the case of Ecuador, cited leaders in silvopasture facilitated the construction of a group of experts who contribute to the development of public policies. The most cited publications appeared in journals published by the Springer group, Elsevier, and MDPI Journals, mostly in open-access systems. In the future, the disruptive contribution of open-access systems in the global dissemination of knowledge, breaking through the economic constraints of countries, universities, and researchers, should be evaluated.

TI  - Kaleka Agroforest in Central Kalimantan (Indonesia): Soil Quality, Hydrological Protection of Adjacent Peatlands, and Sustainability
T2  - LAND
AB  - Increased agricultural use of tropical peatlands has negative environmental effects. Drainage leads to landscape-wide degradation and fire risks. Livelihood strategies in peatland ecosystems have traditionally focused on transitions from riverbanks to peatland forests. Riparian 'Kaleka' agroforests with more than 100 years of history persist in the peatlands of Central Kalimantan (Indonesia), where large-scale open-field agricultural projects have dramatically failed. Our field study in a Dayak Ngaju village on the Kahayan river in the Pulang Pisau district involved characterizing land uses, surveying vegetation, measuring soil characteristics, and monitoring groundwater during a period of 16 months. We focused on how local practices and farmer knowledge compare with standard soil fertility (physical, chemical, biological) measurements to make meaningful assessments of risks and opportunities for sustainable land use within site-specific constraints. The Kaleka agroforests around a former settlement and sacred historical meaning are species-rich agroforests dominated by local fruit trees and rubber close to the riverbank. They function well with high wet-season groundwater tables (up to -15 cm) compatible with peatland restoration targets. Existing soil quality indices rate the soils, with low soil pH and high Al-exch, as having low suitability for most annual crops, but active tree regeneration in Kaleka shows sustainability.

TI  - Indicators of conservation priorities for medicinal plants from seasonal dry forests of northeastern Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Medicinal plants are used by local populations to treat numerous diseases, and many species are used as raw materials for the manufacture of medicines sold by the pharmaceutical industry. However, the intensive collection of these resources poses great challenges related to their conservation. Through a systematic review, we gathered information on the versatility of medicinal trees from seasonal dry forests (Caatinga) in order to create a conservation priority index (CPI) for these species. We found that demand by the pharmaceutical industry is a factor that must be taken into account when establishing conservation priorities for medicinal plants. We found that endemism was not a determining factor in the identification of priority species for conservation. The effects of extractivism on the demographics of Handroanthus impetiginosus (Mart. Ex DC.) Mattos, Anacardium occidentale L., and Copaifera langsdolffii Desf. populations require urgent assessment, because these species are in high demand by local communities and the pharmaceutical industry. Ecological studies may reveal strategies that should be incorporated into their management plans, which can include an increase in time between collection intervals, the production of plant nurseries, the implementation of reforestation programs, and cryopreservation, in addition to the involvement of the local community in monitoring programs. Other indicators such as the importance of species for the maintenance of ecosystem services, productivity chains, and the elaboration of public policies can be included as conservation strategies for these species.

TI  - Effects of farm and landscape management on bird and butterfly conservation in western Honduras
T2  - ECOSPHERE
AB  - Previous research has indicated that a substantial portion of native flora and fauna may persist in agricultural mosaics in the Neotropics. However, understanding the relative importance of different habitat factors and management practices at different scales for sustaining this biodiversity has proven somewhat elusive. In addition, most such research has taken place in only a few fairly well-studied landscapes, thus limiting our ability to infer broader patterns that might be transferred to unstudied locales. This study expands the geographic breadth of prior research by evaluating bird and butterfly assemblages in an agricultural landscape in the Rio Copan watershed of western Honduras. The study also provides a systematic assessment of the relative influence of categorical and continuous habitat variables across a range of scales likely to be significant for birds and butterflies. Overall, we recorded 145 tree species, 139 bird species, and 119 butterfly species. Birds and butterflies displayed contrasting responses to land cover: birds were most strongly associated with dense vegetation in broadleaf forests, forest fallows, shade-grown coffee farms, and live fences, while butterflies were most abundant in live fences, pastures, and riparian forests. Bird assemblages were heavily skewed toward common and non-forest-dependent species, likely due to the young age and high disturbance level of forest plots. In contrast, butterfly assemblages contained a substantial proportion of forest-dependent species, which were observed in forests as well as pastures and live fences. Contrary to expectations, categorical land cover descriptors were more effective at explaining faunal assemblage patterns than continuous habitat descriptors related to vegetation and landscape context. In addition, plot scale (25-100 m) habitat features had a greater influence on faunal assemblages than did neighborhood scale (200-3000 m) landscape composition or structure, although differences in management intensity at the scale of the entire watershed (5-20 km) also exerted a strong influence on conservation outcomes.

TI  - The Refusal of Livestock Owners Towards Exclusion Policy In Protected Area
T2  - JURNAL MANAJEMEN HUTAN TROPIKA
AB  - Development of protected forest is often considered to be a way to preserve biodiversity and ecosystem service. To keep protected area, Indonesia government excludinged local people from protected forest by making a policy which prohibits grazing on protected forest. However, the success of protected forest management often depends on perception of local people because the policy has affected livestock owners who have interest in forest use. Exclusion of local people from protected forest leads loss of people income and unemployment. This study applied a socioeconomic approach to examine and analyze the livestock owner perception on forest grazing prohibition in Timor Island of Indonesia by conducting a household survey of 36 livestock owners. The study results showed that 30.6%, 50.0%, 19.4%, 0%, and 0% of livestock owners are totally disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, and totally agree, with grazing prohibition, respectively. In addition, people perception was significantly affected by number of livestock owned by people. It means that livestock owners mostly reject the policy on grazing prohibition. Indeed policy which prohibits grazing on the protected forest is not effective to be implemented. Government and policy maker should review the policy and consider the refusal of livestock owner toward exclusion policy. Interest of local people should be considered in developing a policy on protected forest.

TI  - Using leaf δ<SUP>13</SUP>C and photosynthetic parameters to understand acclimation to irradiance and leaf age effects during tropical forest regeneration
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Regenerating forests are important for the maintenance of tropical biodiversity. Forest management in fragments of Atlantic forest in Brazil includes removal of exotic eucalyptus trees that were once part of plantations, in order to reestablish native flora. However, it is unclear how native tree saplings regenerating under former plantations respond to abrupt changes in environmental conditions associated, with exotic tree removal. We used leaf carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) and photosynthetic parameters to evaluate physiological responses of native tree saplings to canopy opening. We analyzed young and mature leaves of the three most representative species of regenerating trees (Byrsonima sericea, Siparuna guianensis, Xylopia sericea) in one secondary forest fragment and three managed areas that form an irradiance gradient (9, 85, 230 and 550 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) in Brazilian Atlantic forest. Eucalyptus removal increased photosynthetic CO2 assimilation and stomatal conductance in mature leaves of all species, but there was no change in intercellular CO2 concentration. In young leaves, two species showed increasing A and one species showed increasing gs in response to canopy opening. Leaf delta C-13 did not vary significantly among species, but site and age affected delta C-13, as leaves from shaded sites showed lower delta C-13 values (around -33 parts per thousand) than leaves from lighter sites (around -30 parts per thousand), and young leaves showed higher delta C-13 values (around -30 parts per thousand) than mature leaves (around -32 parts per thousand). Mature leaves showed greater photosynthesis and stomatal conductance than young leaves. The sensitivity of young leaf delta C-13 to irradiance increases suggests that delta C-13 in these organs is controlled not only through carbon imported to new leaves during growth, but also through direct responses of stomatal control and carboxylation as these young leaves develop their photosynthetic competency. Young and mature leaves showed decreased total chlorophyll/carotenoids with increasing irradiance, indicating acclimation capacity from early developmental phases. Young leaves in high irradiance sites showed susceptibility to irradiance stress (F-v/F-m, around 0.7), but values for mature leaves did not show high irradiance stress (F-v/F-m around 0.8). In conclusion, forest management affected leaf delta C-13 of the main regenerating understary species, with site effects being more important than species-specific features for photosynthetic performance. The data also indicate that these species are resilient to forest management that includes exotic eucalyptus canopy tree removal. In this context, carbon stable isotopes can be considered as recorders of ecological change and can be used to study the effects of management on forest regeneration and photosynthetic competency.

TI  - Traditional Agroforestry Systems and Conservation of Native Plant Diversity of Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Traditional agroforestry systems (TAFS), which integrate crops with wildlife, are important reservoirs of human culture and technical experiences with a high capacity for biodiversity conservation. Our study aimed to evaluate the capacity of TAFS to conserve the floristic diversity of tropical dry forests (TDF) in the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan Valley, Mexico. We compared TAFS and TDF by measuring their forest cover, floristic composition, and structure, in addition to documenting the motivations of people to maintain native vegetation in their agricultural fields. We conducted a restricted randomized sampling of perennial plant species, including nine sites of TAFS and nine of TDF to determine the alpha, beta, and gamma diversity. Furthermore, we conducted semi-structured interviews with peasants who managed the agricultural plots we studied. We also performed workshops with people of the communities where surveys were performed. Our findings show that TAFS can maintain, on average, 68% of the species (95% of them native to the region) and 53% of the abundance of individuals occurring in the adjacent TDF. TAFS harbour 30% (39 species) of plants endemic to Mexico. Total species richness of TDF and TAFS were similar, as well as the effective number of species or communities estimated for the alpha, beta, and gamma diversity, but differed in the abundance of individuals. The high species turnover recorded in TDF (72%) and TAFS (74%) has profound implications for conservation, suggesting that it would be necessary to maintain several sites in order to conserve the regional diversity of native vegetation. Material, non-material, and regulatory contributions were reported to be the reason that peasants take into account maintaining natural vegetation. TAFS associated with TDF in the region (also called "Apancles") contain an important richness, diversity, and endemism of components of natural ecosystems, as well as provide multiple socio-ecological contributions. These systems could represent a viable alternative to reconcile biological conservation with social well-being.

TI  - Assessing mangrove restoration practices using species-interaction networks
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Mangroves are uniquely important ecosystems, for preserving biodiversity, sustaining livelihoods, and mitigating against climate change. However, they are degraded globally and are therefore a priority for ecosystem restoration. To date, the assessment of mangrove restoration outcomes is generally poor, and the limited studies that do exist are focused largely on forest area. Thus, more holistic ways of assessing the outcomes of mangrove restoration projects on biodiversity and associated ecological processes are urgently needed. Ecological networks are a useful tool for simultaneously examining both. Here, we assessed the utility of using species-interaction networks for evaluating mangrove restoration outcomes for the first time. We compared the structure and complexity of mangrove ecological networks in replicated "monoculture reforestation," "mixed species regeneration" and "reference forest" plots in two study areas in Sulawesi, Indonesia, an estuarine, and a coastal fringe mangrove system. We also combined and evaluated sampling methods, utilizing traditional plant-animal sampling while also integrating video recording data in a novel way. We found significant differences in the structure and complexity of mangrove networks between restored and natural plots, with contrasting effects between the two sites. Our results show differences in the complex ways in which taxa interact in mangrove restoration projects, which would be overlooked if common biodiversity metrics, such as species richness, were used alone, with consequences for the restoration of ecosystem functioning. We also highlight the utility of video recording data collection for constructing species-interaction networks, overcoming the detrimental impacts of observer presence for some key species.

TI  - Social Role-Play Games Vs Individual Perceptions of Conservation and PES Agreements for Maintaining Rubber Agroforests in Jambi (Sumatra), Indonesia
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - Financial incentives can both support and undermine social norms compatible with environmental service enhancement. External co-investment-e.g., through incentives from programs to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) and eco-certification-needs to synergize with local efforts by understanding local dynamics and conditions for free and prior informed consent. We assessed the perceptions and behavior of rubber agroforest farmers under existing conservation agreements as a step toward institutionalized reward schemes for agro-biodiversity using questionnaires and role-playing games (RPG). To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply such a combination of methods to explore the perceptions of payments for environmental services (PES). Results revealed a strong conservation belief system and social norms in the research site, with indications that individual interest in converting old rubber agroforest to oil palm, with consequent private gain and loss of local social agro-biodiversity benefits, is suppressed in the social context of a role-playing game. In the game, all financial bids by external agents to secure an oil palm foothold in the village, were rejected despite indications of declining income in the village. Agents promoting an eco-certification scheme in the RPG had success and the responses obtained in the game can assist in the actual rollout of such a scheme without creating unrealistic expectations of its financial benefits. Co-investment schemes that require higher levels of trust and clarity of performance measures will have to address the potential discrepancy between individual preferences and community-level planning and decisions, while recognizing that social norms color the responses of individuals when presented with alternatives.

TI  - Determining High Conservation Values in Production Landscapes: Biodiversity and Assessment Approaches
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Conversion of natural, heterogenous tropical forests to intensively managed, monoculture-production landscapes is a major threat to biodiversity. This phenomenon is driven by global demand for commodities such as wood, palm oil, sugar, and soybean. The economies of many countries in tropical areas depend on these commodities, and there is a need to ensure economic welfare while protecting biodiversity. Certification schemes such as those developed by the Forest Stewardship Council and Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil are intended to provide incentive to companies to employ environmentally and socially sustainable production practices. One element of these certification schemes is the concept of High Conservation Values (HCVs) which fall into six categories that encompass ecological indicators and human dimensions. The HCV process has expanded beyond production landscapes to include long-term conservation planning. Despite expansion, implementation of the HCV process as it pertains to biodiversity is challenged, in part, by a lack of specificity regarding target metrics. Another challenge is that, in practice, there is a short time period for assessment, resulting in limited collection of primary data and a reliance on secondary data sources for interpolation. HCV guidance advances a precautionary approach to assessment, but in some regions, there is not enough known about the biology, behavior, or interspecific associations of species to effectively assess what is not observed. In this paper, we assess environmental HCVs in a well-studied timber production system in Sarawak, East Malaysia. Using an original long-term multi-method dataset of avifaunal surveys as well as published datasets of other taxa, we 1) assess biodiversity metrics at the site including presence of Rare, Threatened, and Endemic species, 2) assess change over time at assessment locations, and 3) evaluate costs and benefits of the various methods and provide best practice recommendations for HCV assessment and long-term monitoring. Finally, we recommend transparent data-archiving and sharing for improved accuracy and efficiency in the HCV process. Managed landscapes are important areas for ecological research that are beneficial not only to the restoration and conservation of species and ecosystems but also to well-informed certification and long-term sustainability.

TI  - Biodiversity, dynamics, and impact of chakras on the Ecuadorian Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY
AB  - Aims Deforestation and biodiversity loss are two alarming, closely related problems, and the main factors triggering changes in land use. Indigenous agricultural practices in the western Amazon Basin are known as chakras, and their structure and dynamics are seemingly optimal for forest management. However, the variability in tree species and the degree of forest recovery after abandonment is poorly documented in this agroforestry system (AFS). The goals of this study were: (i) to investigate whether the different AFSs (chakras) preserve similar levels of forest diversity, (ii) to determine the effect of transformation of mature forests (MF) to chakras, in particular, forest alpha and beta diversity levels, and (iii) to investigate whether native tree species recovery leads to the original forest structure following chakra abandonment.
   Methods We assessed the floristic composition in three AFSs (cassava, corn, and cocoa), the secondary forest (SF), and the forest remnants in the buffer zone of the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon (NEA). All tree species with a diameter at breast height (dbh) 10 cm were inventoried in 61 plots (0.28 ha average) representing 17.44 ha. Alpha diversity was calculated in all systems to determine the levels of variability using species richness and the Shannon diversity index. Also, beta diversity was examined to evaluate the degree of dissimilarity among all AFSs with the MF in order to analyze changes in floristic composition. The divergence between the SF and the MF was analyzed to ascertain forest recovery after chakra abandonment.
   Important Findings A total of 4,060 trees (dbh 10 cm) representing 109 species, 96 genera, and 43 plant families were inventoried in 17.44 ha sampled in five systems in the buffer zone of the NEA. The most dominant plant families were Arecaceae, Myristicaceae, Fabaceae, Meliaceae, and Malvaceae, and the most representative genera included Iriartea, Virola, Guarea, Ocotea, Cordia, Chrysophyllum, and Inga. The MF in this zone is composed of 81 tree species circumscribed in 74 genera and 30 plant families. Transforming this MF to different chakras leads to a decrease of alpha diversity between 52% and 75%, particularly in AFS practiced for local food security (corn and cassava). However, all the AFSs preserve ca. 56% of the native flora existing in the MF, in which at least 8% of the species are threatened; however, the status of the remaining 92% of species is still unknown, indicating that the assessment of the rarity of the native trees is virtually unexplored. Additionally, all sites investigated consistently formed three clusters that corresponded to AFS, MF, and SF. Thus, the trend of forests to recover the original structure is facilitated by native trees left intact in the chakras. These results strongly support the potential to execute sustainable forest management and preservation of endangered tree species practicing this AFS.

TI  - Disturbance or propagule pressure? Unravelling the drivers and mapping the intensity of invasion of free-ranging dogs across the Atlantic forest hotspot
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
AB  - Aim Identifying the drivers of biological invasions is crucial to predict the risk of invasion across broad spatial scales and to devise strategies to prevent invasion impacts. Here, we explore the relative importance and synergies between two key drivers-propagule pressure and landscape disturbance-in determining the invasion of native forest remnants by dogs, one of the most abundant, widely distributed, and harmful invasive species worldwide. Location Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Methods Combining a camera trap dataset (96 sites in forest remnants) and censuses of populations of dogs raised by humans across 12 landscapes (2,830 ha each), we used N-mixture models that account for imperfect detection to confront alternative hypotheses of invasion drivers. We then used this empirical evidence to predict the intensity of dog invasion across the Atlantic Forest hotspot. Results Propagule pressure (density of raised dogs, positive effect) and landscape disturbance (forest cover, negative effect) were equally important drivers of dog invasion, presenting additive rather than synergistic effects. Dogs invade forest remnants far from their homes, making the density of raised dogs the key component of propagule pressure (relative to dog spatial distribution). Forest cover was more important than either the length or density of forest edges, suggesting that both reduced area of forested barriers to long-distance movements and increased proximity of forests to edges facilitate dog access to forests. Across the Atlantic Forest, the combination of high human population density and extensive deforestation makes dog invasion an additional and widespread threat. Main conclusion Combined with available maps of priority areas for biodiversity conservation, our spatial prediction of dog invasion can help target areas for integrated management actions. These actions should go beyond measures to control dog populations and encompass the maintenance and restoration of native forests and strategic planning of afforestation through planted forests.

TI  - Quantification of carbon stocks in Mount Marsabit Forest Reserve, a sub-humid montane forest in northern Kenya under anthropogenic disturbance
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - The quantification of carbon stocks is vital for decision making in forest management, carbon stock change assessment and scientific applications. We applied the land degradation surveillance framework (LDSF) method with a sentinel site of (10 km x 10 km) to assess carbon stock levels and tree diversity in the Marsabit Forest Reserve (MFR). The above ground (ABG) carbon stock was estimated at 12.42 t/ha, while soil organic carbon (SOC) was 12.51 t/ha, with SOC densities increasing with increasing depth. The mean ABG carbon and SOC densities were higher in the least disturbed strata than the disturbed strata. The estimated ABG carbon and SOC stocks were significantly lower than the range observed in a typical dry tropical forest. Twenty-one tree species were recorded belonging to twelve families with the disturbed areas recording nine tree species while the least disturbed recording twelve species. Rubiaceae and Rutaceae were the richest families with four species each while Boraginaceae, Capparaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Tiliaceae, Violaceae, and Ochnaceae the least frequent with one species each. The most common tree species were, Croton megalocarpus, Drypetes gerrardii, Ochna insculpta, Strychnos henningsii and Vangueria madagascariensis. The forest recorded a basal diameter of 14.09 +/- 12.15 cm, basal area of 0.016 m 2/ha with a mean height of 8.69 m. The basal size class distribution declined monotonically indicative of a stable population. Livestock grazing, selective logging, and firewood collection were the primary forms of anthropogenic activities recorded in the MFR despite the moratorium imposed on consumptive utilisation of forest products by the Marsabit County security committee. The Pearson correlation coefficient returned an inverse relationship between forest disturbance with SOC and ABG carbon in the disturbed strata suggesting that anthropogenic activities reduced carbon stocks in the MFR. Concerted efforts to mitigate anthropogenic impacts on the MFR could significantly increase its terrestrial carbon sequestration potential and the provision of critical ecosystem goods and services.

TI  - How persistent are the impacts of logging roads on Central African forest vegetation?
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Logging roads can trigger tropical forest degradation by reducing the integrity of the ecosystem and providing access for encroachment. Therefore, road management is crucial in reconciling selective logging and biodiversity conservation. Most logging roads are abandoned after timber harvesting; however, little is known about their long-term impacts on forest vegetation and accessibility, especially in Central Africa. In 11 logging concessions in the Congo Basin, we field-sampled a chronosequence of roads that, judging from satellite images, had been abandoned between 1985 and 2015. We assessed recovery of timber resources, tree diversity and above-ground biomass in three zones: the road track, the road edge (where forest had been cleared during road construction) and the adjacent logged forest. The density of commercial timber species <15cm d.b.h. was almost three times higher in the road track (321 individuals ha(-1)) and edge (267) than in the logged adjacent forest (97). Over time, tree species diversity converged to a comparable level between roads and adjacent forests, along with an increase in canopy closure. The average width of forest clearing for road construction was 20m, covering a total 076% of the forest area inside concessions. After 15years following abandonment, road tracks had recovered 24 Mgha(-1) of above-ground woody biomass, which was 6% of that in the adjacent forest, while road edges had accumulated 167 Mgha(-1) (42%). Ten years after abandonment, roads were no longer penetrable by poachers on motorcycles. An exotic herb species was fully replaced by dominant Marantaceae that have even higher abundance in the adjacent forest.Synthesis and applications. Our evidence of vegetation recovery suggests that logging roads are mostly transient elements in the forest landscapes. However, given the slow recovery of biomass on abandoned road tracks, we advocate both reducing the width of forest clearing for road construction and reopening old logging roads for future harvests, rather than building new roads in intact forests. Road edges seem suitable for post-logging silviculture which needs to be assisted by removing dominant herbs during the early years after abandonment while the road track is still accessible.

TI  - Progress of paludiculture projects in supporting peatland ecosystem restoration in Indonesia
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Sustainable peatland management practices such as paludiculture are crucial for restoring degraded peatland ecosystems. Paludiculture involves wet cultivation practices in peatland and can maintain peat bodies and sustaining ecosystem services. However, information about paludiculture effects on tropical peatlands is limited in the literature. Therefore, this study aimed to analyse the effectiveness and progress of paludiculture projects in supporting peatland ecosystem restoration in Indonesia that uses approaches of soil rewetting, revegetation of peat soil/forest, and the revitalisation of rural livelihoods around peatlands. We obtained qualitative and quantitative data from field measurements, observations, document reviews, spatial data from open-source web applications, and interviews with key stakeholders in two projects (agri-silviculture and agro-sylvofishery) that adapt paludiculture principles to Indonesia's South Sumatra Province. We found that the limited use of paludiculture principles in both projects has a different contribution to peatland restoration. The agri-silviculture project has been utilising jelutung (Dyera polyphylla), ramin (Gonystylus bancanus), and balangeran (Shorea balangeran) for (forest) revegetation. These species are 3 of the 534 paludiculture species that are adaptive to peat soils and tolerant to acidic conditions and inundation. The revegetation resulted in effective results that supported peatland restoration despite the delayed application of rewetting activities in the initial phase of the project. Additionally, in the agro-sylvofishery project, trade-offs between soil rewetting to maintain high peat water tables and the need to provide short-term economic benefits for local communities through horticulture and fishery practices were noted. During the 2019 El Nino, the involvement of a closed-loop canal to support fishery practices appeared to contribute to affecting the water table, which was also influenced by the open canals dug in nearby palm oil plantations.

TI  - Analysis of challenges, costs, and governance alternative for peatland restoration in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
AB  - Restoration of degraded tropical peatland is considered to be one of the most cost-efficient measures in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and conserving biodiversity. Although benefits of restoration are often expected to substantially exceed the costs, most restoration projects are being carried out without clear cost analyses. This study provides empirical assessments of challenges and costs of the four peatland restoration projects managed by different proponents in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia based on key informant interviews, a follow-up survey and document analyses. We also reviewed existing policy contexts that can address some of the challenges to propose a governance alternative to sustain peatland restoration efforts. We found that many ecological challenges of peatland restoration projects were created by drainage canals leaving the peat to be dry and fire prone. Peatland degradation has been exacerbated by human activities and human-caused fires, and restoration efforts have faced many challenges due to lack of secure funding and complexity of governing the project implementation. The key informants we interviewed easily recognized direct costs for implementing restoration activities, but often left out indirect costs of addressing social challenges, such as expenses to engage local communities, in their assessments of the costs. Although our accounting is far from exhaustive, we found that indirect costs can add up to half of the total cost of peatland restoration projects. Current funding mechanisms for these projects mostly rely on international donors and private sectors, which make the long-term sustainability of the projects questionable. We argue that hybrid governance for a green business model, such as restoration and ecosystem services enterprises, with active participation from the public sector should be mainstreamed. The accounting framework developed in this study can be applied in other projects and should be further revised to systematically assess cost-effectiveness of restoration interventions.

TI  - Growth, productivity, aboveground biomass, and carbon sequestration of pure and mixed native tree plantations in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - In Costa Rica, reforestation programs with indigenous tree species are a recent activity. Information is still scarce on long-term species performance and silvicultural management to ensure the success of tree plantings, especially for mixed stands. This study aims to estimate growth, aboveground biomass, and carbon sequestration of nine native tree species growing in mixed and pure plantings. The study was carried out at La Selva Biological Station in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica. More than a half of the tree species studied (e.g. Calophyllum brasiliense, Jacaranda copaia, Terminalia amazonia, Hyeronima alchorneoides, Vochysiaferruginea, Balizia elegans) are distributed from Mexico-Guatemala to South America and a few have more limited distribution in Central America (e.g. Vochysia guatemalensis, Virola koschnyi, Dipteryx panamensis). The nine tree species are divided into three sets. The 3 members of each set were grown separately in pure plantations, and together in I mixed plantation, giving 12 monocultures and 4 mixtures. Plantation 1 (13 years old) is composed of V guatemalensis, C. brasiliense, and J. copaia. Plantation 2 (13 years old) is comprised of D. panamensis, T amazonia and V koschnyi. Plantation 3 (12 years old) is composed of H. alchorneoides, B. elegans, and V. ferruginea. Overall, all the species had good growth and productivity either in pure or mixed stands in comparison to other native and exotic species growing in similar ecological conditions. The exception was C. brasiliense in mixed stands, where it was suppressed by the fast-growing species V guatemalensis and J. copaia. At the stand level, the mixed stands performed well for volume, basal area, aboveground biomass, and carbon sequestration, in comparison to other pure or mixed plantations of tropical timber species. Pure plantations of V guatemalensis, V ferruginea, V koschnyi, J. copaia, and T amazonia also presented good productivity. At the tree level, V guatemalensis, J. copaia, T amazonia, H. alchorneoides, and D. panamensis performed better in mixtures than in pure stands for diameter, height, aboveground biomass, and carbon sequestration estimations. Values for the former three species were significantly higher in mixed than in pure stands. C. brasiliense was the only species with significantly better growth in pure stands than in mixed stands, for the three-species combination examined. The results show that mixed plantings had similar or higher productivities for several of the variables examined, but conclusions, on relative productivities depend on the species and growth features, interactions among species, and the variables quantified. In addition, there is a need to continue monitoring over longer time-frames, and for further studies of the species interactions and site factors involved, in order to develop reforestation guidelines for a range of objectives and environmental settings.

TI  - Our Hungry Neighbor: Self-Reported Data from Farmers' Perspective on Tapanuli Orangutans in the Batang Toru Forest, Indonesia
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - Background and Research AimsHuman-orangutan conflicts are a growing problem in the tropical rainforests of Sumatra. Habitat degradation and fragmentation can drive orangutans to move on to agroforestry plantations and into conflict with farmers. This research examines farmers' awareness of the roles that Tapanuli orangutans play, their attitudes towards orangutans when they come on their land and the broader political-economic factors which influence interactions between smallholders and orangutans.MethodsWe used a mixed methods approach of quantitative surveys with 275 farmers and qualitative in-depth interviews with 22 key informants from 11 villages on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia.ResultsWe found that while many farmers had negative encounters with orangutans eating their crops, their responses differed. Some tolerated the orangutans; others chased them away. The difference stemmed from cultural beliefs about orangutans and their relationship to humans. Some communities hold them as neighbours, others fear them, but in both cases would not harm them. Most farmers do not perceive them as significant threats but as hunger-driven neighbours. Rather than blaming the orang-utans per se, they argue that habitat loss caused by expanding extractive activities is the driving factor of this conflict. They want to see limits on the expansion of extractive industry, alternative income sources and compensation for their orangutan losses.ConclusionThe study concludes by highlighting five aspects that need consideration for reducing human-orangutan conflicts and with a broader discussion on the need to include the socio-cultural context of the human populations in conservation initiatives.Implications for ConservationThe study underscores the imperative of integrating local farmers' perspectives in conserving critically endangered Tapanuli orangutans. It advocates coexistence through crop loss mitigation, deforestation prevention, and compensation strategies, emphasizing the need for holistic, sustainable conservation measures encompassing ecological, social, and economic facets within the region.

TI  - Soil bacterial diversities and response to deforestation, land use and burning in North Amazon, Brazil
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - The biodiversity in Amazon forest soils is continuously challenged by anthropogenic activities or disturbances, impacting the quantity and quality of its natural resources and a wide range of ecosystem services. Understanding microbial processes and response to various soil management practices provide valuable information to maintain sustainable ecological environments. We hypothesized that microbial assemblages (several not yet identified) and activities are continuously changing in forest ecosystems, mostly due to management selections. Therefore, our work's objective was to assess bacteria communities' changes via next-generation sequencing techniques and bridge knowledge gaps in our understanding of their responses to deforestations, intensive agriculture, and repeated forest burning activities in altered and native forest locations in the Northern Amazon Rainforest, Brazil. We evaluated soils during different climatic periods (dry and rainy) collected at selected sites for pasture, conventional agriculture, and forestry. Intensive conversion to pasture and conventional plantations seriously impacted the bacterial diversities and species richness. The forest area presented the greatest bacterial diversities and species richness, followed by the pasture areas, especially in the 0-5 cm soil layer. Conventional plantations showed the lowest diversities and species richness. There was no change in species richness between the dry and rainy periods; however, the wet period showed lesser species diversities. Based on the analyses, the bacterial communities comprised of the phyla: Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Cyanobacteria. Bacteria trends identified are being considered in future management decisions to preserve biodiversities and the region's forest ecosystems' functioning.

TI  - Traditional perennial crop-based agroforestry in West Java: the tradeoff between on-farm biodiversity and income
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Agroforestry systems have been re-evaluated with a renewed scientific interest as appropriate models for achieving sustainable production while maintaining planned and associated biodiversity and agroecosystem functioning. Traditional bamboo-tree gardens in West Java are known to play substantial ecological and socioeconomic roles. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the relationship between income generation and biodiversity by studying 83 bamboo-tree gardens that varied in species composition and degree of commercialization. We conducted a survey of the vegetation and interviewed the owners or managers of each plot. We identified 42 planned and utilized species and 19 associated non-use species. Eight vegetation groups were identified by two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN), each of which varied in individual densities of different utilization species types, Simpson's diversity index, management intensities, and potential annual gross income. The group with the highest potential income generation was dominated by clove trees (Syzygium aromaticum); however, this group also had a lower level of diversity and higher levels of management intensity than the other groups, but all of the pairwise groups were not significantly different. About 60% of the villagers used at least some fuelwood as a domestic energy source, and almost all of them collected fuelwood from bamboo-tree gardens regardless of ownership. There were no significant differences in density of potential fuelwood species among the vegetation groups. There were significant positive correlations between income and most management activities. The regression model between gross income and Simpson's diversity index with the best fit was a unimodal curve, which strongly suggests that maximum diversity can be conserved at an intermediate level of income. Nevertheless, this intermediate level of gross income is probably not adequate as the primary source of income for garden owners, although some gardens had the potential to achieve higher income levels with no decline in diversity. We suggest that maximizing individual density and multistratifying canopy layers could improve profitability within perennial crop-based agroforestry systems in West Java.

TI  - Termite diversity is resilient to land-use change along a forest-cocoa intensification gradient in Ghana, West Africa
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Cocoa is an important crop for Ghana's economy, contributing 25% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The crop, however, is mainly cultivated on forest-derived soils and is a major cause of land-use change. Termites are an important biological component of tropical ecosystems providing numerous ecosystem services. Previous studies have indicated that termites are sensitive to forest disturbance and decrease in richness and abundance across land-use intensification gradients, with consequences for the essential services that they provide. Native shade trees are often used to improve cocoa cultivation and may reduce the detrimental effects of land-use change on some aspects of biodiversity. The aim of this study was therefore to explore how termites respond to land-use change along a shade-tree gradient in Kakum National Park and surrounding cocoa farms in Ghana (from forest at 80% tree cover to cocoa with no shade cover, to the extreme of cultivated arable crop land). It was predicted that termite richness and abundance would decrease with decreasing shade cover, and with increasing distance from the forest edge. Thirty-four species from 29 genera were sampled, with Ancistrotermes crucifer being found in all the locations (47% of all encounters). Species richness and abundance differed marginally across the land-use gradient, as well as the distance from the forest edge; however, species richness did not show any significance with distance. All the same, termite communities were robust to the disturbance. Our findings suggest that though site influenced species richness and abundance, cocoa trees can play a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity and environmental quality in an agricultural landscape by providing a habitat for forest species that are not found in pastures or farm fields. However, we caution that the relatively low forest baseline of existing forest diversity may inflate the value of cocoa land, with those forests no longer representing undisturbed natural habitats: this highlights that shifting baselines may need to be accounted for when interpreting findings in the Anthropocene.

TI  - Shade coffee agroforests as native plant sources for restoration
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Tropical agroforestry systems such as shade coffee are recognised as important refuges for biodiversity in human-modified landscapes. In these systems, many conservation initiatives aiming to sustain biodiversity against the trend of intensifying agroforestry management focus on promoting biodiverse tree overstories but engage less with conservation opportunities and challenges associated with agroforest understories. In coffee agroforests with native shade trees, weeding of natural regeneration constitutes lost conservation opportunities. We explore the potential for reducing such losses by rescuing native tree seeds and naturally regenerating seedlings from coffee agroforests and developing local native plant nurseries, which are a critical bottleneck for restoration. For this, we draw on floristic surveys using 42 0.3 ha plots in eight polyculture shade coffee agroforests and collaborative pilot rescue, nursery development and restoration initiatives in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, India. Ninety restoration-relevant native tree species (inferred from species distributions, traits and practitioner knowledge) constituted 37% of all trees recorded in coffee agroforests. The species list included 30 conservation-priority species (endemic to the Western Ghats and/or classified as threatened or near-threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature), most of which were not stocked in existing public nurseries. Experiences from pilot rescue efforts, which collected over 18,000 seeds and seedlings spanning 56 restoration-relevant species in 12 months, underscore the importance of efficient rescue planning focussed on mapping target trees and monitoring phenology, fostering partnerships with agroforest landowners to enhance rescue opportunities and developing nursery infrastructure to house rescued plants and support local restoration efforts. Synthesis and applications. Shade coffee agroforests can contribute to conservation beyond their boundaries as sources of native plants that can help expand and diversify local nurseries and scale up restoration, while alleviating the need to exploit remnant natural forests as plant sources for nurseries and restoration. Harnessing this opportunity requires the development of strategies and partnerships for integrating native plant sourcing, nursery and restoration efforts, backed by policies and initiatives that promote landscape-level benefits of agroforestry for biodiversity and conservation.

TI  - Coffee agroforestry as an alternative to the implementation of green economy practices in Indonesia: A systematic review
T2  - AIMS AGRICULTURE AND FOOD
AB  - Agroforestry systems, particularly the coffee agroforestry system (CAS), represent a promising approach to achieving sustainable development and promoting a green economy in Indonesia. Our research aims to explore the potential of CAS to provide ecosystem services and socio-economic benefits and address environmental risks in Indonesia. To critically analyze the current state of CAS in Indonesia, its potential for sustainable development, and the challenges that should be addressed to increase its uptake, we conducted a systematic review of published academic literature. Our findings suggest that CAS has the potential to turn a profit in the future thanks to rising global and domestic market demand as well as environmental benefits like reducing carbon emissions and improving resource efficiency. However, several challenges should be addressed to improve coffee quality and sustain green economy activities, including product certification, collaboration with NGOs and business entities, and coordination of government policies at the site level. Overall, this study highlights the importance of CAS as a green economy approach in Indonesia and suggests policy recommendations to support its promotion and adoption. By addressing the challenges and promoting the potential of CAS, sustainable development and green economic growth can be achieved in Indonesia.

TI  - Contrasting Patterns of Species Richness and Composition of Solitary Wasps and Bees (Insecta: Hymenoptera) According to Land-use
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Several species of arthropods inhabiting forest fragments interact with managed areas. The importance of such areas to biodiversity conservation, however, is not well established. Communities of solitary wasps and bees (Insecta: Hymenoptera) play a key role in agroecosystem functioning and they have been used in studies of biodiversity assessment in different land-use types. We aimed to assess patterns of species richness and composition of solitary wasps and bees over a 1-yr period in a gradient of decreasing land-use intensity formed by pastures, alley croppings, young fallows, and old fallows using trap nests. Old fallows had the highest species richness of wasps and bees, harboring all bee species and 86 percent of wasp species occurring in the region, while the remaining land-uses had similar species richness. Vegetation structure (tree richness) and relative humidity explained most of the variance for the species richness of wasps. For bees, however, there was no influence of environmental factors on the community among land-use types, indicating better adaptability of this group to environmental variations related to land-use. The composition of solitary wasp communities (but not those of bees) differed among land-use types, and the occurrence of rare species in most cases was restricted to old fallow sites. In conclusion, the community of solitary wasps and bees is contingent on land-use, with solitary wasps more sensitive to anthropized areas. For both groups, less anthropized areas harbor a greater richness and number of rare species while more intensively managed land-use types harbor higher abundances.

TI  - The Interplay Between Carbon Storage, Productivity, and Native Tree Density of Agroforestry Systems
T2  - LAND
AB  - Agroforestry has been widely suggested as a tool for storing carbon while also providing other ecosystem services like food and income production. A greater understanding of how carbon storage in agroforestry systems varies, and particularly how it is intertwined with the productivity of these systems, could enable farmers and policymakers to make changes that simultaneously increase carbon storage and alleviate poverty. In this study, we used allometric equations to evaluate the carbon storage in the biomass of two complex agroforestry systems in Bali, Indonesia-rustic where a native tree canopy is still present, and polyculture where all native trees have been removed, and the canopy consists only of cropping trees. We then compared these figures to that of a nearby primary forest and linked carbon storage to productivity for both agroforestry systems. We found that the primary forest (277.96 +/- 149.05 Mg C ha-1) stored significantly more carbon than either the rustic (144.72 +/- 188.14 Mg C ha-1) or polyculture (105.12 +/- 48.65 Mg C ha-1) agroforestry systems, which were not significantly different from each other. We found productivity and carbon storage to be significantly positively correlated with each other within the polyculture system but not within the rustic system. We also found that for the rustic system, an increase in the density of native trees is accompanied by an increase in carbon storage, but no significant change in productivity. Consequently, we conclude that within the rustic system, carbon storage can be increased or maintained at a high value by the preservation and encouragement of large native trees, and that this need not necessarily result in a decrease in productivity.

TI  - Flowering and fruiting show phenological complementarity in both trees and non-trees in mosaic-burnt floodable savanna
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - The homogenization of fire regimes in a landscape may imply a temporal reduction in the availability of re-sources, such as flowers and fruits, which affect the fauna, as well as ecosystem services. We hypothesized that maintaining mosaic burning regimes, and thereby pyrodiversity, can diversify phenological patterns, ensuring year-round availability of flowers and fruits. Here we monitored open grassy tropical savanna phenology under different historical fire frequencies and fire seasons in a highly heterogeneous landscape in an Indigenous Ter-ritory in Brazil. We evaluated phenological patterns of tree and non-tree plants through monthly surveys over three years. These two life forms responded differently to climate and photoperiod variables and to fire. Different fire regimes led to a continuous availability of flowers and fruits, due to the complementarity between tree and non-tree phenologies. Late-season fires are supposed to be more devastating, but we did not detect a significant reduction in flower and fruit production, especially under moderate fire frequency. However, late burning in patches under high frequency resulted in a low availability of ripe fruits in trees. The fruiting of non-tree plants in patches under low fire frequency and early burning ensure ripe fruit, when there are practically no trees fruiting in the entire landscape. We conclude that maintaining a seasonal fire mosaic should be prioritized over historical fire regimes, which lead to homogenization. Fire management is best conducted between the end of the rainy season and the beginning of the dry season, when the risk of burning fertile plants is lower.

TI  - Effects of land-use change and elevation on endemic shrub frogs in a biodiversity hotspot
T2  - ANIMAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Agroforestry, often promoted as a sustainable agriculture practice, is rapidly expanding, often at the cost of primary tropical forests. While agroforestry negatively impacts amphibian diversity, its effects on population demography, microhabitat, use and body condition are relatively understudied. This information is crucial for determining and promoting amphibian-friendly land-use practices. We compared habitats, population densities, microhabitat use and body condition of two endemic species of shrub frogs (Pseudophilautus amboli and Raorchestes bombayensis) across (1) elevations (low- and high-elevation forests) and (2) land-use categories (cashew, rubber and low-elevation forests) in the northern part of the Western Ghats Biodiversity Hotspot. Using distance sampling, we demonstrated that the abundances of the two shrub frog species differed across elevation categories, with P. amboli more common in low-elevation forests and R. bombayensis more prevalent in high-elevation forests. Both species of frogs exhibited extremely skewed, male-biased sex ratios, with three females for 100 males. P. amboli had lower densities and poor recruitment and exhibited altered microhabitat use in cashew plantations compared to low-elevation forests. Although adult male P. amboli densities in rubber were similar to those in low-elevation forests, they exhibited altered microhabitat use and smaller body sizes than in forests, indicating poor body condition. We demonstrate the differential impacts of agroforestry types on shrub frogs. We also demonstrate that distance sampling can be a useful tool for population monitoring of shrub frogs, which comprise almost 25% of the anuran diversity in the Western Ghats. There is a need to identify the drivers of extremely skewed sex ratios, which make these species vulnerable to population crashes. Given the recent downlisting of the two focal species to Least Concern, we advocate for their uplisting to at least Near Threatened status considering their patchy distribution, negative impacts of rapidly expanding agroforestry plantations and extremely skewed sex ratios.
   Agroforestry negatively impacts amphibian diversity, yet its impacts on population demography, microhabitat use and body condition remain poorly studied. We compared habitats, population densities and body condition of two endemic shrub frogs (Pseudophilautus amboli and Raorchestes bombayensis) across elevation categories and three land-use types (forests, cashew and rubber plantations) in the Western Ghats. We show altered microhabitat use, male-biased sex ratios and poor recruitment in agroforestry plantations, advocating for the uplisting of these species to at least Near Threatened due to their vulnerability to rapidly expanding agroforests.

TI  - Potential environmental implications of sandbar afforestation: Insights from ecosystem restoration initiatives in a sandbar of Brahmaputra River Assam, India
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Plantation in riverine sandbars offers an excellent opportunity for restoration of ecosystem with a vast potential for enhancing carbon stock. Afforestation on barren islands is challenging task; however, Padmashree Jadav Payeng has single-handedly transformed a sandbar of the river Brahmaputra into a forested landscape in India's northeastern state of Assam. Such inspiring initiative needs more attention in terms of scientific assessment to quantify ecosystem value and services that can be enriched through such activities. This study uses remote sensing data viz., Landsat4-5TM and Sentinel 2 A data to provide a detailed information on spatio-temporal variability of land use land cover of study region from 1990 to 2021. It aims to conduct a scientific and systematic assessment of biophysical changes that have occurred in the sandbars, understand the status of afforestation, and evaluate the current levels of aboveground biomass (AGB), belowground biomass (BGB), and carbon stock in the selected sandbars. The spatial distribution of AGB, BGB and carbon stock is derived using linear regression model between SAR backscatter and field-based AGB. The results demonstrate that forest cover increased by 31.92 % and sandbar area is reduced by 26.87 % from 1990 to 2021. Spatially derived AGB ranges from 9 to 1295.89 Mg per ha, BGB from 2.35 to 290.50 Mg per ha and carbon stock from 6.18 to 763.34 Mg per ha. Ficus religiosa exhibits a high biomass, ranging from 564.7 Mg per ha to 994.7 Mg per ha, and a high carbon stock, ranging from 8 to 557.30 Mg per ha, attributed to its larger diameter at breast height (DBH). Moreover, phytosociological assessment was conducted for the studied forest, which reveal a total tree species richness of 79. The forest exhibits a total tree density of 395 individuals per hectare. Different biodiversity indices provide a comprehensive understanding of species composition; where results show a Shannon diversity index of 2.81, a Simpson's index of 0.08, a Menhinick's richness index of 2.7, and a Margalef's richness index of 5.26. The article provides detailed information on change in forest cover and present status of AGB, BGB and Carbon stock, providing evidence-based narratives on ecosystem restoration. The initiative by a single person has created a forested landscape and habitat for a large number of wild animals, contributing to better carbon stock and a healthier ecosystem. With regard to the current debate of carbon market, the study suggests the need of instrumentalization of carbon credits for such restoration activities to encourage increase in carbon stock. It also concludes that in-depth research should be taken up on long-term effectiveness of such plantation activities and the potential for scaling up these initiatives for ecosystem restoration in view of climate change mitigation and sustainable forest development.

TI  - Land-use change impact on time-averaged carbon balances: Rubber expansion and reforestation in a biosphere reserve, South-West China
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The expansion of rubber plantations (Hevea brasiliensis mall. Arg) is a major driving force for deforestation and forest degradation in mountainous South-East Asia. In China, the unclear distinction between natural forest and commercial plantations has permitted the expansion of rubber into protected forest areas of nature reserves. However, the impact of such land-use changes on landscape carbon balances within nature reserves has rarely been investigated. We selected the Naban River Watershed National Nature Reserve (NRWNNR) in Xishuangbanna, China as a case study area and evaluated carbon stocks using the Rapid Carbon Stock Appraisal (RaCSA) method based on tree, plot, land use and landscape assessments, integrating field sampling with remote sensing and GIS technology. Six dominant land use systems were surveyed: lowland forest (<800 m above sea level), highland forest (>800 m a.s.l.), lowland rubber, highland rubber, bush and grassland and agricultural crops. Land use type-specific time-averaged carbon stocks (C-ta) were calculated based on total above ground biomass (AGB). Soil organic carbon (surface 30 cm) and below ground biomass were measured, but not included in C-ta calculations due to large uncertainties unrelated to land use change. The C-ta of lowland and highland rubber plantations were 58 Mg C ha(-1) and 28 Mg C ha(-1) respectively, showing larger carbon sequestration potential than nonforest land use types (agricultural crops, bush and grassland) but much lower than C-ta of natural forest (156-185 Mg C ha(-1)). Sensitivity analysis of C-ta variability showed that forest C stocks have the largest influence on landscape carbon balance. Time series analysis of land-use and land-cover maps (1989, 2007, 2012) demonstrated that during 23 years, the whole landscape of the nature reserve (26,574 ha) gained 0.644 Tg C. Despite rubber expansion, biosphere zoning strategy (i.e. experimental, buffer, core zones), and reforestation activities conducted in NRWNNR were able to enhance the carbon stocks.

TI  - Grass-livestock interaction: a critical review of current research progress
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Introduction: Grass-livestock interaction is of great value in maintaining ecological balance, regional economic development, and the sustainability of grassland husbandry, which has gained attention in recent years in both academia and practice, however, study on grass-livestock interaction possesses cognitive bias and gaps. Methods: This study clarified the latest research progress and development trend in the grass-livestock interaction field by illuminating publication trend, cooperative network, keyword co-occurrence relationship, keyword clustering during 2000 to 2022 based on the Web of Science core database. Results: The results indicated that the annual number of publications in the grass-livestock interaction field showed a globally increasing with interdisciplinary and international collaboration, and the United States of America ranked firstly, followed by Brazil, England, Australia, China. Agricultural Research Service, the U.S. Department of Agricultures was the organization with the highest number of publications, and Rangeland Ecology & Management, Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment, Grass and Forage Science were the top three journals. Furthermore, in terms of the temporal evolution, the research targeting the grass-livestock interaction mainly went through three stages: initial exploration period (2000-2011), to the period of rapid development (2012-2016) to transitional development period (2017-2022), and the notable existing keywords was Management, Livestock, Cattle, Vegetation, Growth, Soil. In terms of the structural composition, four broad divisions including mechanism of human activities, grassland resource monitoring and management, grassland livestock competition/adaptability, grassland land/soil research were identified. The results provide positive and objective insights into that grassland sustainability and grazing control through strengthening cross-disciplinary and cross-regional cooperation, and applying of standard methods based on evaluation system in the grass-livestock interaction field. Discussion: The overall contribution of the work is provision of novel insight into the intellectual structure and temporal progression of grass-livestock interaction research at a macroscopic scale and the directions in which the field is headed currently.

TI  - Crop-livestock-forestry systems as a strategy for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing the sustainability of forage-based livestock systems in the Amazon biome
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Intensification of livestock systems becomes essential to meet the food demand of the growing world population, but it is important to consider the environmental impact of these systems. To assess the potential of forage-based livestock systems to offset greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the net carbon (C) balance of four systems in the Brazilian Amazon Biome was estimated: livestock (L) with a monoculture of Marandu palisade grass [Brachiaria brizantha (Hochst. ex A. Rich.) R. D. Webster]; livestock-forestry (LF) with palisade grass intercropped with three rows of eucalyptus at 128 trees/ha; crop-livestock (CL) with soybeans and then corn + palisade grass, rotated with livestock every two years; and crop-livestock-forestry (CLF) with CL + one row of eucalyptus at 72 trees/ha. Over the four years studied, the systems with crops (CL and CLF) produced more human-edible protein than those without them (L and LF) (3010 vs. 755 kg/ha). Methane contributed the most to total GHG emissions: a mean of 85 % for L and LF and 67 % for CL and CLF. Consequently, L and LF had greater total GHG emissions (mean of 30 Mg CO2eq/ha/year). Over the four years, the system with the most negative net C balance (i.e., C storage) was LF when expressed per ha (-53.3 Mg CO2eq/ha), CLF when expressed per kg of carcass (-26 kg CO2eq/kg carcass), and LF when expressed per kg of human-edible protein (-72 kg CO2eq/kg human-edible protein). Even the L system can store C if well managed, leading to benefits such as increased meat as well as improved soil quality. Moreover, including crops and forestry in these livestock systems enhances these benefits, emphasizing the potential of integrated systems to offset GHG emissions.

TI  - Rubber-Based Agroforestry Systems Associated with Food Crops: A Solution for Sustainable Rubber and Food Production?
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Agroforestry is often seen as a sustainable land-use system for agricultural production providing ecosystem services. Intercropping with food crops leads to equal or higher productivity than monoculture and results in food production for industry and subsistence. Low rubber price and low labor productivity in smallholdings have led to a dramatic conversion of rubber plantations to more profitable crops. The literature analysis performed in this paper aimed at better understanding the ins and outs that could make rubber-based agroforestry more attractive for farmers. A comprehensive search of references was conducted in March 2023 using several international databases and search engines. A Zotero library was set up consisting of 415 scientific references. Each reference was carefully read and tagged in several categories: cropping system, country, main tree species, intercrop type, intercrop product, level of product use, discipline of the study, research topic, and intercrop species. Of the 232 journal articles, 141 studies were carried out on rubber agroforestry. Since 2011, the number of studies per year has increased. Studies on rubber-based agroforestry systems are performed in most rubber-producing countries, in particular in Indonesia, Thailand, China, and Brazil. These studies focus more or less equally on perennials (forest species and fruit trees), annual intercrops, and mixed plantations. Of the 47 annual crops associated with rubber in the literature, 20 studies dealt with rice, maize, banana, and cassava. Agronomy is the main discipline in the literature followed by socio-economy and then ecology. Only four papers are devoted to plant physiology and breeding. The Discussion Section has attempted to analyze the evolution of rubber agroforestry research, progress in the selection of food crop varieties adapted to agroforestry systems, and to draw some recommendations for rubber-based agroforestry systems associated with food crops.

TI  - Biochar-soil-plant interfaces: a systematic review of the crop performance in tropical climate
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Biochar is increasingly being assessed as a promising solution to address the challenges faced by tropical soils, as it can help mitigate land degradation, replenish nutrients, and enhance soil structure, increasing fertility and promoting the development of crops. This paper provides a systematic literature review towards an evaluation of the current knowledge on the influence of biochar addition in tropical soils on the development of plants. A total of 97 publications on the development of various species, particularly maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza), were chosen. The evaluation involved various parameters, which identified positive and negative effects and no significant differences from the control. Some of them also evaluated the contribution of biochar to the development of trees in degraded soils. Tropical soils from 24 different countries, with specific focus on Brazil and Malaysia, were studied. Most biochars were derived from agricultural biomass or wood and produced at temperatures close to 500 degrees C and with alkaline pH (8.3 average value). Subsequently, 25 articles that combined the most studied plant (Z. mays) with the most adopted test type (field) were selected-in this case, the main endpoints evaluated were grain yield and biomass, which generally showed a positive effect or no significant variation in relation to the control. Although the number of studies on biochars has increased in recent years, scientific knowledge shows several gaps, given the variety of physical and chemical characteristics of biochars and the complexity of natural ecosystems. Future research can potentially yield promising results by exploring a wider range of plant species, soil types, and climatic conditions in long-term trials. Appropriate indicators must be considered for assessments of the reduction in negative effects from the addition of biochar on soil health and quality of ecosystem services.

TI  - Scattered trees in an oil palm landscape: Density, size and distribution
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - In tropical landscapes dominated by oil palm monocultures, scattered trees can contribute to biodiversity, regulate diverse ecosystem functions and deliver goods and services. However, basic quantitative information about such trees is often lacking. The objectives of our study were to identify the landscape-wide density and distribution patterns of scattered trees in an oil-palm-dominated area of Sumatra (Indonesia), and to estimate their size. The study area with the total of 1120 ha was situated in Jambi province in the lowlands of Sumatra. In 2016, the year of our assessment, 83% of the area was covered by oil palm monocultures including industrial and smallholder plantations; other land-use types included rubber plantations and secondary forests. An earlier land-use classification suggests that oil palm cultivation began before 1990 on 41% of the area. The study area was mapped in 2016 using a fixed-wing drone equipped with red-green-blue and near-infrared cameras. We counted all visible trees in the aerial image. In the entire study region, we detected 10.1 scattered trees/ha. In areas where oil palm plantations were established before 1990, the tree density was 67% lower than in the area where oil palm was introduced later. The median tree crown diameter was 4.5 m, which corresponds to an estimated diameter at breast height of 12 cm; thus, most trees were small-statured. The trees were spatially clustered and often aligned along roads and rivers. In conclusion, we found a considerable number of scattered, mostly small-statured trees. This suggests that most trees were young and disappeared before reaching larger dimensions. To ensure the survival of trees and further pro-vision of related ecosystem services, scattered trees in the oil palm landscape need to be conserved and/or restored.

TI  - Women's participation and the gender perspective in sustainable forestry in Cambodia: local perceptions and the context of forestry research
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - We analyzed local stakeholders' perceptions on women's engagement in sustainable forestry and the challenges women face. We additionally examined the publication of scientific papers on women's participation and gender perspectives in forestry research. We employed Kendall's W to examine the concordance of local peoples' assessment of the knowledge of rural women related to forestry, the major barriers preventing women participating effectively in sustainable forestry and the tasks required to engage women better. The study revealed only very weak agreement regarding the knowledge of rural women about forestry (Kendall's W = 0.47, p < .000). Local people considered women knew most about sustainable forestry and use of forest for various purposes and less about the trees and forests. The study found moderate agreement (Kendall's W = .118, p < .000) concerning the major barriers preventing women participating effectively in sustainable forestry, with the most significant barrier being low female participation in decision-making bodies. There was very weak agreement on the highest priority task required to engage women better in forestry management (Kendall's W = .035, p < .000). Quantitative content analysis was used to analyze the scientific papers. From 1992 to September 2018, 537 scientific papers were published in 171 journals, with study sites in 83 countries, related to women and gender in 1) forest, 2) REDD + and 3) community-based forestry. The countries most covered by the research were: Indonesia (27 articles), India (39), United States (45) and Nepal (51). There was a significant increase in the number of papers on women's participation and gender mainstreaming in 1) forest (n = 482) and 2) community-based forestry (n = 20) from 2007, and in 3) REDD + discourses (n = 34) from 2011. This study suggests further scientific research is needed on women's participation and gender perspective in sustainable forestry and environmental concerns if the collective action needed for sustainable forest management is to be effectively addressed.

TI  - Agroforestry governance for operationalising the landscape approach: connecting conservation and farming actors
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
AB  - The expansion and intensification of agriculture as well as the associated land clearing are threatening both biodiversity and human wellbeing in tropical areas. Implementing agroforestry systems through a landscape approach has a strong potential for integrating nature conservation objectives into agricultural systems. A key challenge for implementing the landscape approach is that political processes and conservation initiatives operate in 'silos', being largely disconnected from farmers and local key agents responsible for tree governance. In this study we brought together different stakeholders in facilitated, structured focus discussions to analyse the role of actor groups in tree governance. We used social network analysis to quantitatively and qualitatively analyse agroforestry governance networks and actor interactions related to information exchange, finance flows, and regulation. The analyses were conducted at national, sub-national and local levels in four countries: Honduras, Peru, Indonesia, and Uganda. Using trees on farms as a boundary object enabled all participants to bridge common interests and illuminate some of the constraints and opportunities of local governance systems while overcoming institutional and ideological barriers. The quantitative results of the social network analysis identify a strong density of actor linkages. Despite this density, results indicate incoherent and fragmented actor networks undermining the support for agroforestry on all levels. Nevertheless, existing processes related to finance, information, and regulation can be better aligned to ensure an effective implementation and mainstreaming of agroforestry for biodiversity conservation. Building social capital among key actors on both national and local levels can reveal a strong potential for adaptive learning processes mainstreaming agroforestry as essential component of "good farming" and integrating incentive systems for a coherent and effective agroforestry governance. We conclude that redirecting both public and private funding towards continuous seed-funding for the facilitation of these integrated learning processes can transform landscape management and at the same time reduce transaction costs.

TI  - Soil management practices in coffee farming systems in the Asia-Pacific region and their relevance to Papua New Guinea: A systematic review
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Soil degradation resulting from poor soil management practices is a major problem worldwide. In Papua New Guinea (PNG), the poor access to resources and lack of soil knowledge may lead to the unintended adoption of poor soil management practices in coffee production systems. This study seeks to identify the best soil management practices in the Asia-Pacific region and evaluate their suitability to PNG coffee farming systems based on how these practices align with the specific environmental, social and economic conditions of PNG coffee farmers. The assessment will consider criteria focused on type of and access to resources, impacts on labour and translation of soil knowledge that offer tangible benefits to farmers. To achieve this, a systematic literature review focused on the main coffee-producing countries in the Asia-Pacific region, namely, Vietnam, Indonesia, India, Thailand, China, Malaysia and the Philippines. Following eligibility criteria, a total of 74 peer-reviewed articles were sourced from both Scopus and Web of Science databases, covering the period 2000-2024. Key soil management practices identified included agroforestry (through intercropping or shading), nutrient management and soil erosion control. Overall, the studies emphasized the critical impact of these practices on soil health, with many assessing the soil quality to evaluate sustainability. Based on the criteria outlined, practices that target intercropping with nutrient-enhancing legumes and strategic pruning can further enhance yields and improve soil health. Such practices already integrate well into many coffee systems, as intercropping with legume trees or crops is commonly used to improve soil fertility and provide shade, while strategic pruning is a standard practice to optimize plant productivity, manage pests and diseases and regulate the coffee microclimate. Additional research and farmer education on effective composting methods, shade management and crop selection can empower smallholders to adopt sustainable practices that improve productivity and resilience in coffee agroforestry systems.

TI  - Deforestation and forest regeneration following small-scale gold mining in the Amazon: the case of Suriname
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Despite scientific concern about Amazon deforestation and the impacts of the Amazon gold rush, few researchers have assessed the long-term impacts of small-scale gold mining on forest cover. This study estimates deforestation from gold mining and analyses the regeneration of abandoned mining areas in the Suriname Amazon. Fieldwork in December 1998 included observations and ecological measurements, as well as qualitative interviews with local miners about mining history and technology. Vegetation cover of abandoned mining sites of different ages was compared with that in old-growth forest. By present estimates, gold miners clear 48-96 km(2) of old-growth forest in Suriname annually. Based on different assumptions about changes in technology and the amount of mining that takes place on previously mined sites, cumulative deforestation is expected to reach 750-2280 km(2) by 2010. Furthermore, the analysis of abandoned mining sites suggests that forest recovery following mining is slow and qualitatively inferior compared to regeneration following other land uses. Unlike areas in nearby old-growth forest, large parts of mined areas remain bare ground, grass, and standing water. The area deforested by mining may seem relatively small, but given the slow forest recovery and the concentration of mining in selected areas, small-scale gold mining is. expected to reduce local forest cover and ecosystem services in regions where mining takes place.

TI  - Land-use Change Dynamics, Soil Type and Species Forming Mono-dominant Patches: the Case of Pteridium aquilinum in a Neotropical Rain Forest Region
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Deforestation and agricultural land degradation in tropical regions can create conditions for growth of perennial plant species forming mono-dominated patches (MDP). Such species might limit forest regeneration, and their proliferation forces the abandonment of fields and subsequent deforestation to establish new fields. Therefore, identifying factors fostering MDP species is critical for biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes. Here, we propose a conceptual framework to identify such factors and apply it to the case of Pteridium aquilinum (bracken fern), a light-demanding species, tolerant of low soil fertility and fire. We hypothesize that bracken proliferation is promoted by land-use changes that increase light availability, especially in sites with low soil fertility and land uses involving fire. We assessed this idea using agricultural fields in southeastern Mexico with different land-use change histories and quantifying prevalence and cover of bracken. Five different land-use change histories resulted from transitions among forest, crop, pasture, and fallow field stages. Of the 133 fields sampled, 71 percent had P.aquilinum; regression tree analysis indicated that 65 percent of inter-field variation in prevalence and 90 percent in cover was explained by land-use change history and soil type. Maximum prevalence, cover, and rates of increase in bracken were found on fields with low fertility sandy/clay soils, which had been used for crops and pasture, were frequently burned, and had high levels of light. Fields on fertile alluvial soil never used for pasture were bracken-free. Agriculture promoting high light environments on less fertile soils is a major cause of bracken proliferation and likely that of other MDP species.
   Abstracto En regiones tropicales, la deforestacion y la degradacion de campos agricolas puede crear las condiciones para el crecimiento de plantas perennes formadoras de parches mono-dominados. Tales especies pueden limitar la regeneracion del bosque y su proliferacion conlleva el abandono de los campos agricolas y genera subsecuente deforestacion debido al establecimiento de nuevos campos agricolas. Por lo tanto, identificar los factores que promueven especies formadoras de parches mono-dominados es critico para la conservacion de la biodiversidad en paisajes dominados por el humano. En este articulo se propone un marco conceptual para identificar tales factores y lo aplicamos al caso del helecho Pteridium aquilinum (petatilla), una especie demandante de luz, tolerante a la baja fertilidad del suelo y al fuego. Hipotetizamos que la proliferacion de P.aquilinum es promovida por cambios en el uso del suelo que incrementan la disponibilidad de luz, especialmente en sitios con baja fertilidad del suelo y que incluyen el uso de fuego. Evaluamos esta idea mediante el uso de campos agricolas con diferentes historias de cambio de uso del suelo y cuantificamos la prevalencia y la cobertura de P.aquilinum en el sureste de Mexico. Cinco diferente historias de cambio de uso de suelo resultaron de la transicion entre bosque, agricultura, pastizales y sitios abandonados. De los 133 campos muestreados, 71% presentaron P.aquilinum. Un analisis de arbol de regresion indico que para la prevalencia y la cobertura, el 65% y 90% de la variacion entre campos, respectivamente fue explicada por la historia de cambios de uso de suelo y el tipo de suelo. La maxima prevalencia, la cobertura y las tasas de incremento de P.aquilinum se encontraron en campos con baja fertilidad tales como suelos arenosos y arcillosos, que se utilizaron para agricultura y pastizales y que fueron frecuentemente quemados y con alta disponibilidad de luz. Campos en suelos aluviales que representan suelo fertiles y que nunca se utilizaron como pastizales estuvieron libres de P.aquilinum. Las historias de uso de suelo que promueven ambientes de alta disponibilidad de luz en suelo fertiles son una causa mayor de la proliferacion de P.aquilinum y probablemente de otras plantas perennes que forman parches dominados por una sola especie.

TI  - Infiltration-Friendly Agroforestry Land Uses on Volcanic Slopes in the Rejoso Watershed, East Java, Indonesia
T2  - LAND
AB  - Forest conversion to agriculture can induce the loss of hydrologic functions linked to infiltration. Infiltration-friendly agroforestry land uses minimize this loss. Our assessment of forest-derived land uses in the Rejoso Watershed on the slopes of the Bromo volcano in East Java (Indonesia) focused on two zones, upstream (above 800 m a.s.l.; Andisols) and midstream (400-800 m a.s.l.; Inceptisols) of the Rejoso River, feeding aquifers that support lowland rice areas and drinking water supply to nearby cities. We quantified throughfall, infiltration, and erosion in three replications per land use category, with 6-13% of rainfall with intensities of 51-100 mm day(-1). Throughfall varied from 65 to 100%, with a zone-dependent intercept but common 3% increase in canopy retention per 10% increase in canopy cover. In the upstream watershed, a tree canopy cover > 55% was associated with the infiltration rates needed, as soil erosion per unit overland flow was high. Midstream, only a tree canopy cover of > 80% qualified as "infiltration-friendly" land use, due to higher rainfall in this zone, but erosion rates were relatively low for a tree canopy cover in the range of 20-80%. The tree canopy characteristics required for infiltration-friendly land use clearly vary over short distances with soil type and rainfall intensity.

TI  - To graze or not to graze: A core question for conservation and sustainable use of grassy ecosystems in Brazil
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Differently from commonly used forest conservation strategies, the absence of disturbance in non-forest ecosystems can result in loss of biodiversity. Grassy ecosystems characterize extensive areas in all biomes in Brazil, offering great contribution to biological diversity and providing ecosystem services on which society depends. Palaeoecological evidence indicates these ecosystems evolved under the influence of grazing and fire, and these disturbances have been essential for controlling the dominance of woody vegetation. While the need for fire to maintain grassy biomes has been recently discussed, grazing as a management tool for conservation is still little accepted by the local scientific community and by decision makers. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of the current literature on grazing management and its effects on grassy ecosystems in Brazil. Based on a review of the role of grazers prior and after European colonization, and a synthesis on grazing effects across different systems, we call for the evaluation of grazing as a management tool for biodiversity conservation in Brazil's grassy systems. Grazing should be an interesting management strategy especially in Legal Reserves with grassy vegetation types, as it can ally conservation with livestock production. To achieve these potentially complementary objectives, a research agenda needs to be developed to devise adaptive management strategies for Legal Reserves. In this, relevant stakeholders should be included and both the ecological conditions of the ecosystem in question and the socioeconomic determinants considered.

TI  - Land Recovery and Soil Management with Agroforestry Systems
T2  - SPANISH JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - Soils have many ecological functions and provide various ecosystem services including support for global food and fuel production. However, FAO reports indicate that approximately one-third of the planet's arable lands show levels of degradation from processes including soil erosion, low levels of nutrients, acidification, salinization, compaction, sealing, and contamination. These conditions are also found in Brazil where soil degradation is largely caused by inadequate land management. Worldwide, strategic policies have been presented to mitigate this problem, with emphasis on sustainable agriculture. Among them, agroforestry has been identified as a viable system for mitigating and recovering degraded areas. Agroforestry techniques have been developed and tested but are still not understood by farmers, due to their complexity. This study aimed to analyze experiences and studies with agroforestry reported from Australia, some countries in Africa, and Brazil to search for similarities in these complex systems and identify possible correlations to support the hypothesis that land recovery can be enhanced through soil management using agroforestry. A Sankey diagram was developed to illustrate relationships among problems, the adoption of agroforestry and improvements, and the most important contributions. Data analysis shows that the main problems related to soil degradation are soil erosion and decreased soil fertility, while the adoption of agroforestry systems proved to improve different aspects of soil quality and to be a safe path to sustainable agricultural production. To obtain more information on the adoption of these systems in different locations, soils, and climates, it is important to implement policies for reducing land degradation. Furthermore, the assessment of the economic, environmental and social benefits of improving soil fertility and decreasing erosion in agroforestry systems is necessary to validate the use of agroforestry as a sustainable agricultural practice.

TI  - Effectiveness of community-based mangrove management for biodiversity conservation: A case study from Central Java, Indonesia
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
AB  - Efforts to rehabilitate degraded mangrove ecosystems in Indonesia started in the 1960s and have recently received increased attention. Rehabilitation efforts have been mainly conducted through community-based mangrove management (CBMM) programs, aimed at restoring important services such as food provisioning and coastal protection, and for biodiversity conservation. Our study assessed the effectiveness of CBMM strategies to conserve biodiversity in four adjacent Indonesian coastal villages (Sriwulan, Bedono, Timbulsloko, Surodadi) in Central Java. For this, we used complementary methodologies combining participatory resource mapping, semi-structured interviews, questionnaire-based interviews, field assessments and literature review. This yielded detailed information on mangrove rehabilitation activities, management approaches and the impacts of mangrove rehabilitation on biodiversity in the four villages. Our analysis focussed on mangrove forest structure and diversity and macro invertebrate diversity.
   The overall comparison of management performance shows a higher achievement of CBMM applied in Bedono in terms of a larger mangrove diversity and net reforestation coverage, also supporting a higher macrobenthic faunal diversity compared to the other villages. The main contributing factors were a) the longer-term funding and maintenance, b) the greater acceptance for protective legislation, c) the higher levels of public support, d) the fact that more species of mangroves were used, e) the much larger spatial scale of mangrove restoration, and f) the presence of additional measures to reduce wave action in highly eroded areas. The results revealed key determinants of success when restoring mangroves for the purpose of biodiversity conservation and the influence of different CBMM approaches.

TI  - Mega El Ni(n)over-tildeo's change the playing field for culturally important tree species and hence the foundation for human-nature interactions in tropical forests
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
AB  - Humans have interacted with trees for millennia and the strength of such interactions determines the long-term social values of trees and forests. Such ecocultural linkages could be important to promote during reforestation efforts, potentially helping to turn the tide on the current rapid extinction of cultural and biological diversity. In addition, predicting the fate of ecoculturally important species to changing climates may help guide tree species selection best-suited to future climates. We assessed the vulnerability of four ecoculturally important tree species native to Southeast Asia to an extreme drought: Koompassia excelsa, Nephelium lappaceum, Shorea fallax and Shorea leprosula. These species provide distinct and unique products, and Koompassia excelsa is well-represented in local mythological stories and considered a Cultural Keystone Species (CKS). We used two complementary approaches: 1) an experimental common garden and 2) naturally occurring wild trees growing in a secondary forest and compared the performance of trees before, after, and during the 2016 El Ni (n) over tildeo event with record breaking low precipitation and high temperatures. We found that mortality of the CKS K. excelsa in the common garden, along with mortality and growth of wild trees were unaffected by the El Ni (n) over tildeo drought. In contrast, young trees of N. lappaceum and S. fallax planted in the common garden had mortality 4 and 3 times higher, respectively, during the El Ni (n) over tildeo drought compared to normal years. Growth rate of S. fallax in the wild was also significantly lower during the El Ni (n) over tildeo drought and this effect was particularly pronounced in highly disturbed forests. Our results demonstrate that the impact of extreme climatic events, that are predicted to become more common with climate change, on culturally important tree species is species specific. Management of such species may thus need species specific measures to maintain viable populations and hence provide the basic physical settings for human-nature interactions and associated cultural identities to persist. In this context, our findings that cultural keystone species such as K. excelsa could be drought tolerant is noteworthy, as investing on such species could prove to be beneficial for both local cultures and conservation of native ecosystems and biodiversity.

TI  - Mercury critical concentrations to Enchytraeus crypticus (Annelida: Oligochaeta) under normal and extreme conditions of moisture in tropical soils Reproduction and survival
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Soil provides many ecosystem services that are essential to maintain its quality and healthy development of the flora, fauna and human well-being. Environmental mercury levels may harm the survival and diversity of the soil fauna. In this respect, efforts have been made to establish limit values of mercury (Hg) in soils to terrestrial fauna. Soil organisms such as earthworms and enchytraeids have intimate contact with trace metals in soil by their oral and dermal routes, reflecting the potentially adverse effects of this contaminant. The main goal of this study was to obtain Hg critical concentrations under normal and extreme conditions of moisture in tropical soils to Enchytraeus crypticus to order to assess if climate change may potentiate their acute and chronic toxicity effects. Tropical soils were sampled from of two Forest Conservation Units of the Rio de Janeiro State - Brazil, which has been contaminated by Hg atmospheric depositions. Worms were exposed to three moisture conditions, at 20%, 50% and 80% of water holding capacity, respectively, and in combination with different Hg (HgC12) concentrations spiked in three types of tropical soil (two natural soils and one artificial soil). The tested concentrations ranged from 0 to 512 mg Hg kg(-1) dry weight. Results indicate that the Hg toxicity is higher under increased conditions of moisture, significantly affecting survival and reproduction rate.

TI  - Nutrient Balance and Use Efficiency in Agricultural Lands in the Vermelho River Watershed, Upper Pantanal, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - Agricultural systems play a key role in achieving many of the Sustainable Development Goals, established by the United Nations, given the current challenge of producing enough food to feed a global population that is expected to reach 10 billion people by 2050. More efficient and sustainable use of nutrients in agriculture is an important step to increasing production while minimizing threats to natural ecosystems and resource depletion. In this study, we developed a system nutrient balance for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to evaluate nutrient use practices in cropping and grazing systems in the Vermelho River watershed (VRW), Upper Pantanal, Brazil, and investigated options to improve N and P use efficiency (NUE and PUE). Our results show P balance in cropping systems are positive while those in grazing systems tend to be negative. The positive values in cropping systems are due to both high P inputs from mineral fertilizers and high soil P-sorbing capacities. The negative values in grazing systems are a result of the removal of animal products without replacing the nutrients. Most of the N inputs in the crops grown in this region come from biological nitrogen fixation. The NUE in cropping systems is about 0.95, which is higher than the upper critical value of the desirable range (0.6-0.9). Given the high NUE value and the risk of soil mining, improving cropping systems NUE by adjusting the inputs to replenish N outputs and avoid soil erosion in the VRW are of considerable interest.

TI  - Practise what you preach: a faith-based approach to conservation in Indonesia
T2  - ORYX
AB  - Faith-based teachings on the environment have been identified as a potentially effective form of conservation outreach but one that remains largely untested. Indonesia contains 10% of the world's tropical rainforests and is the most populous Muslim country. A faith-based approach to conservation could therefore yield significant conservation benefits here. Within Islam several key principles in the Qur'an underpin and outline the role of humans in nature conservation. Here, we report on a Darwin Initiative project component that sought to assess the applicability of Islamic teachings to conservation action in West Sumatra. We developed water-conservation-themed sermons that were delivered by project-trained religious leaders in 10 mosques and nine Islamic boarding schools during the holy month of Ramadan. We conducted entry-exit questionnaire surveys to assess levels of concern, awareness and intent to act amongst male (n=389) and female (n=479) worshippers. The results revealed that greater attention should be paid to raising awareness of the linkages between Islam and conservation rather than on conservation principles alone, which were already adequately understood. This study provides the first insights into the important role that women could play within a faith-based project. Female respondents demonstrated greater knowledge and understanding of Islamic teachings about the environment and the services provided by watershed forests. They were also more likely to contribute to conservation activities, suggesting that future projects should seek to involve this often marginalized stakeholder group fully, as well as provide practical ways for men and women to transform words into action.

TI  - Surface runoff and accelerated erosion in a peri-urban wellhead area in southeastern Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
AB  - Degradation of hydrological conditions can adversely impact water resource quality and quantity. This degradation can generate social and economic losses, including losses for users outside the basin area. Therefore, studies focusing on surface runoff and accelerated erosion processes are needed to enable interventions that address degradation-induced challenges. In the present study, the surface runoff and accelerated erosion potential of the Feijao River basin were presented in charts at a 1: 50,000 scale. The Feijao River basin has an area of 243.16 km(2) and is used as the main water source for the city of Sao Carlos, Brazil. Geoenvironmental attributes, such as substrate, climate, relief, soil, water bodies and land cover and use, were integrated and assessed in a GIS environment, using a multicriteria analysis and weighted sum tool. The results show that a large part of the area (86.12% of the basin) exhibits a low surface runoff potential and a moderate accelerated erosion potential. Accelerated erosive processes are triggered by changes in soil cover and have a direct relationship with the removal of existing vegetation and implementation of anthropogenic activities. In this case, as well as for most of the areas in southeastern Brazil, extensive grazing followed by sugar cane cultivation was the main driving force of erosion, acting as trigger for accelerated erosive processes at the water source area.

TI  - Araguaia biodiversity corridor cost benefit analysis: Large scale restoration and sustainable agribusiness in Amazon and Cerrado
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Ecosystem restoration is an important tool for reducing ecosystem loss and contribute to diminish the negative impacts from deriving from climate change, but can be very costly. This paper focuses on the cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis of recovering almost one million hectares of legally protected areas in the Araguaia Biodiversity Corridor (Brazil) following the Brazilian Forest code regulation. We analyze two paths for recovery, ecological and economic (including timber and agroforestry systems). We consider the direct and indirect local costs, as well as monetized environmental benefits using the social cost of carbon and avoided soil erosion. According to our estimates, in 50 years, the recovery of the Araguaia Corridor will lead to net societal benefits with either the ecological (US$ 19.8 billion) or economic (US$ 18.9 billion) pathways in all macro-regions (north, central, and south) and rural property sizes (small, medium and large). The recovery captures 262 million tCO2eq and avoids 527 million tons of soil erosion with the economic path; these estimates are 23% and 1.7% higher, respectively, when using the ecological path. Importantly, we show that the restoration activity is not carbon credit dependent on being profitable when based on the economic path proposed. Additionally, this study highlights the high profitability of agroforestry systems, especially in small farms. There are also relevant local impacts, from 12 to 38 thousand new direct jobs. Even considering a limited menu of ecosystem services (carbon and soil), we show that social benefits from the Araguaia biodiversity corridor restoration exceed its social costs, justifying the subsidization of ecosystem restoration. In this sense, land use policies can incorporate mechanisms for financial support, grants, or incentives to encourage and facilitate ecosystem restoration efforts in the region.

TI  - Assessing the dynamics of small-scale coastal fisheries using public participatory GIS with structural equation model for fisheries management in Jakarta's coastal area, Indonesia
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Rapid coastal development often challenges coastal fisheries, resulting in limited opportunities, particularly for small-scale fisheries. However, the knowledge on how coastal urbanization drives dynamics in small-scale fishery over time is relative limited. Based on the offline survey and interview questionnaire, public participatory geographic information systems (PPGIS) was coupled with partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) to explore the impact of development on fishery condition over 30 years in the coastal areas of Jakarta, Indonesia, where the expansion of Tanjung Priok Port, luxury property development along Jakarta's western coast, and the Ancol Beach reclamation for tourism and recreation altered the coastal fishery condition locally. After testing questionnaire reliability, Fornell-Larckel criterion with average variance extracted (AVE) values was used to assess the validity of study design. The results showed that AVE values were higher than 0.5 for ecosystem condition (AVE = 0.804), fishing effort (AVE = 0.907), total catch (AVE = 0.920), and total income (AVE = 0.885). PPGIS was conducted with 80 participants' survey to map Jakarta's coastal area from 1990 to 2020, indicating a decline in mangroves, ponds, and fishing grounds over the past 30 years and an increase in the size of industrial areas. PLS-SEM analysis showed that positive correlations between ecosystem condition and fishing effort (beta = 0.435, p < 0.001), ecosystem condition and total catch (beta = 0.576, p < 0.001), fishing effort and total income (beta = 0.220, p < 0.01), total catch and total income (beta = 0.490, p < 0.001), and ecosystem condition and total income (beta = 0.262, p < 0.012). Improved ecosystem conditions will lead to increased catches, fishing efficiency, and income. This study also suggests management strategies involving public participation, co-management, community-driven habitat restoration projects, and participatory environmental impact assessments, which can assist policymakers and stakeholders in managing small-scale coastal fisheries.

TI  - Mammal species composition and habitat associations in a commercial forest and mixed-plantation landscape
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Commercial forest plantations of fast-growing species have been established globally to meet increasing demands for timber, pulpwood, and other wood products. Industrial plantations may contribute to tropical forest conservation by reducing exploitation of primary and secondary natural forests. Whether such plantations can support critical elements of biodiversity, including provision of habitat and movement corridors for species of conservation concern, is an important question in Southeast Asia. Our objectives were to investigate relationships between habitat gradients and community attributes of medium-sized to large mammals in a mixed plantation mosaic in Bengkoka Peninsula, Sabah, East Malaysia. Data on mammals were collected using 59 remote camera stations deployed for a minimum of 21 days (24-hour sampling occasions) in three major land-use types: natural forest, Acacia plantations, and non-Acacia plantations (oil palm, rubber, young Eucalyptus pellita). We used sample-based rarefaction to evaluate variation in species richness with land use. We used generalized linear models and ordination analyses to evaluate whether variation in mammal detections and species composition was associated with habitat gradients. We recorded >22 mammal species over 1572 sampling occasions. Natural forest area was positively associated with mammal species richness and detections of threatened mammals. Overall detections of mammals increased with decreasing elevation, but decreased within, and close to, Acacia plantations. Detections of threatened mammals increased with greater proportions of natural forest and Acacia and increasing proximity to roads. Sample-based rarefaction indicated that species richness of mammals in Acacia and natural forest was considerably higher than observed. Both natural forest and Acacia plantations shared similar values for species richness and diversity, but non-Acacia plantations scored lower in both metrics. Mammal species composition differed among different types of land use. Smaller generalists used non-Acacia plantation forests. A variety of other mammals including some threatened species used natural forest, Acacia, or a combination of the two. Acacia plantations possess attributes supporting a diversity of mammal species, including those we defined as threatened based on IUCN criteria. However, this is likely a function of the habitat mosaic with natural forest in the study area and the mangrove forests on the fringes of the peninsula serving as refuges of mammal diversity. Retention and restoration of natural and mangrove forests may therefore enhance the conservation potential of industrial Acacia plantations. Additionally, controlled road access in conjunction with anti-poaching operations and strengthening public awareness are essential to reduce the threat of overexploitation.

TI  - Historical and recent land use affects ecosystem functions in subtropical grasslands in Brazil
T2  - ECOSPHERE
AB  - Land-use changes such as conversion of semi-natural grasslands to agriculture, silviculture, or high-intensity pastures affect biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services. However, which ecosystem functions are affected when highly diverse grasslands are converted remains largely unknown. As a model system, we studied 80 grasslands in Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil, comprising exceptionally diverse permanent grasslands that are traditionally managed with burning of accumulated biomass and moderate grazing, and four additional grassland types with different present or historical management: permanent grasslands with reduced or increased current management intensity and secondary grasslands after past agricultural or silvicultural use. We measured ten ecosystem functions covering all major below-and aboveground ecosystem components and the processes that link them, using the novel rapid ecosystem function assessment approach. Ecosystem functions included primary and secondary production, and species interactions, that is, herbivory, pollination, predation, seed dispersal, and decomposition. Ecosystem functions differed significantly among grassland types, most distinctly between permanent and secondary grasslands. Historical land-use changes to agriculture and silviculture led to altered ecosystem functions even after reconversion to grassland, including lower primary and secondary production, lower decomposition, lower seed dispersal capabilities, and higher invertebrate herbivory. Current management practices explained additional variation in some ecosystem functions, including strong positive effects of intensified management on secondary production. Other ecosystem functions such as pollination and predation were not affected. The findings suggest that conversion of grasslands to more intensive land-use types has long-lasting consequences for some ecosystem functions, with effects persisting even many years after reconversion, resulting in changes in the ecosystem services provided by these grasslands.

TI  - Tropical peatlands under siege: the need for evidence-based policies and strategies
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - It is widely known that tropical peatlands, including peat swamp forests (PSFs), provide numerous ecosystem services in both spatial and temporal dimensions. These include their role as large stores for organic carbon, which when not managed well could be released as carbon dioxide and methane, accelerating climate warming. Massive destruction and conversion of peatlands occur at an alarming rate in some regions. We hope that the lessons learned from those regions currently under siege from conversion can inform other regions that are at the precipice of mass conversion to agriculture. Much has been learned about high latitude, northern hemisphere peatlands but less is known about tropical peatlands. We collate, analyze, and synthesize the evidence revealed from the set of articles in this special issue. This special issue is a step forward, presenting new information generated from a considerable amount of field data collected from peatlands across the tropics in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The hard data collected using comparable scientific methodologies are analyzed and compared with existing published data to form a larger dataset as scientific evidence. The synthesis is then interpreted to generate new knowledge to inform the policy community on how to strategize the sustainable management of tropical peatlands. Carbon (C) stocks in tropical peatland ecosystems can be as large as 3000Mg C ha(-1), but the rate of loss is also phenomenal, causing substantial emissions of greenhouse gases of more than 20Mg C ha(-1)year(-1). These losses have mainly taken place in Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, where peatland development for oil palm and pulpwood has accelerated over the past few decades. Although peatlands in the Amazon and Congo Basin are less developed, it is possible that the same unsustainable pathway would be followed in these regions, if lessons from the dire situation in Southeast Asia are not learned. Strong policies to halt further loss of tropical peatlands may be drawn up and combined with incentives that promote a global agenda under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 21st Conference of the Parties, Paris, France, Agreement. However, we also propose a framework to address national and local agendas that can be implemented under the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) by balancing conversion/development and conservation/restoration objectives.

TI  - Impact of forest conversion to oil palm and rubber plantations on microclimate and the role of the 2015 ENSO event
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - Oil palm and rubber expansion is a main driver of the widespread deforestation of tropical rainforests taking place in South-East Asia, particularly in Indonesia. The replacement of forests with monoculture plantations of rubber and oil palm reduces biodiversity and carbon pools but also modifies canopy structure, which is an important determinant of microclimate. There is, however, a lack of quantitative information characterizing the effect of such land transformation on microclimate. We report the first medium-term observations of below canopy microclimatic conditions (air temperature, relative humidity, vapour pressure deficit and soil temperature) across forest, jungle rubber agroforest, oil palm and rubber monoculture plantations in Sumatra/Indonesia. The data set covers a period of approximately three years (2013-2016) and includes one of the strongest El Nino-Southern Oscillations (ENSO) of the last decades. Forests were up to 2.3 and 2.2 degrees C cooler than oil palm and rubber monocultures respectively. The monocultures were also drier (11.9% and 12.8% less in oil palm and rubber respectively) and had higher vapour pressure deficit (632 Pa and 665 Pa higher in oil palm and rubber respectively) than the forest, while differences in soil temperature were less pronounced. Conversion from forest to other land uses, especially to monocultures, also amplified the diurnal range of all microclimatic variables studied. Jungle rubber stands out as the transformed land-use system that maintains more stable microclimatic conditions. Our results indicate that canopy openness is a key driver of below-canopy micro climate, and hence could be used in climate models to better evaluate climatic feedbacks of land-use change to rubber and oil palm. The ENSO event of 2015 led to warmer and drier conditions than in the previous two years in all four land-use systems, especially in the forest (up to 2.3 degrees C warmer, 8.9% drier and up to 351 Pa more during ENSO). The relative effect of ENSO was lower in the monoculture plantations, where below-canopy microclimate is generally more similar to open areas. Forests exhibited the largest differences with the pre-ENSO years, but still maintained more stable microclimatic conditions (lower temperatures and vapour pressure deficit and higher relative humidity) due to their higher climate regulation capacity. During ENSO, microclimatic conditions in jungle rubber were comparable to those in the monocultures, suggesting that while forests buffered the increase of temperature, jungle rubber might have surpassed its buffering capacity to extreme events. This capacity of buffering extreme climatic events should be considered when assessing the effects of land-use change.

TI  - Impact of Farm Management on Soil Fertility in Agroforestry Systems in Bali, Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Expansion and intensification of agricultural land in the tropics increasingly raises environmental concerns and questions about sustainability of production systems. A key parameter to consider when assessing the sustainability of production systems is soil fertility, and of particular interest are macronutrients, pH, electrical conductivity, and microbial communities. To understand which environmental factors influence soil fertility, we studied the abovementioned key parameters in two agroforestry systems (rustic and polyculture) in Bali, Indonesia. Via Generalized Linear Models, we found that agroforestry system, canopy cover, crop richness, tree richness, and yields had differing effects on topsoil (0-5 cm) and subsoil (10-15 cm) properties, including C:N ratios, conductivity, K, organic C, P, and total microbes. We found a higher C:N ratio in topsoil (p = 0.027), higher organic carbon content in topsoil (p = 0.009) and subsoil (p < 0.001), higher total microbes in subsoil (p = 0.001), and lower phosphorus levels in topsoil (p < 0.001) in rustic than in polyculture systems. Rustic systems may foster conditions conducive to soil fertility, and in our study, canopy cover (p < 0.001) and tree richness (p < 0.001) emerge as a key positive drivers of the total number of microbes in topsoil. The positive associations observed between crop and tree richness with electrical conductivity and total microbe counts underscore the importance of biodiversity in enhancing soil fertility, emphasizing the need for diversified agricultural systems to promote soil fertility. With soil fertility declining across the world due to global investments in agricultural intensification, it is vital that food production systems divert to the use of systems such as agroforestry in order to ensure soil sustainability and food security for future generations.

TI  - Abundance and richness of invertebrates in shade-grown versus sun-exposed coffee home gardens in Indonesia
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Complex agroforestry systems are suggested as a possible solution to reduce the effects of deforestation in the tropics while enhancing the livelihoods of local human populations. Coffee (Coffea spp.) is one of the most important commodity crops in the world that can easily be cultivated in complex agroforestry systems. Coffee agroforestry systems usually sustain higher biodiversity levels than sun-exposed fields while keeping similar levels of productivity considering the several benefits of growing coffee under a complex system. We aim to explore the richness and abundance of invertebrates in coffee home gardens in West Java, Indonesia by comparing 14 sun-exposed and 14 shade-grown gardens. We collected data in March/April 2019 via pitfall traps, pan traps, and beating tray in each field. We ran generalised linear models to assess whether the number of species and the number of individuals of insects differed between sun-exposed vs. shade-grown coffee gardens, and tested associations between main taxa. Overall, there was no difference in the richness (sun-exposed: 19.86 +/- SE1.19; shade-grown: 19.71 +/- SE1.19; Z-value = 0.12, p value = 0.904) and abundance (sun-exposed: 141.93 +/- SE 3.18; shade-grown: 139.93 +/- SE3.16; Z-value = 0.35, p value = 0.706) of invertebrates in coffee gardens, although taxa specific differences were present. Sun-exposed fields had a higher abundance of invertebrates considered as pests (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae, Ectobiidae; Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae, Lycidae and Tenebrionidae; Diptera: Anisolabididae, Drosophilidae and Sarcophagidae). Camponotus spp. were the most dominant ants in shade-grown gardens while Dolichoderus spp. and Myrmicaria spp. were more abundant in sun-exposed gardens. Despite the fact that sun-exposed coffee fields registered higher abundance of invertebrate pests than shade-grown coffee fields, the richness of invertebrates did not substantially vary between sun-exposed and shade-grown coffee, suggesting that the matrix of gardens offers advanced ecosystem services. It is important to keep the complexity of agroforestry systems that provide key habitats for biodiversity.

TI  - Evaluating bundles of interventions to prevent peat-fires in Indonesia
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - The carbon-dense peatlands of Indonesia are a landscape of global importance undergoing rapid land-use change. Here, peat drained for agricultural expansion increases the risk of large-scale uncontrolled fires. Several solutions to this complex environmental, humanitarian and economic crisis have been proposed, such as forest protection measures and agricultural support. However, numerous programmes have largely failed. Bundles of interventions are proposed as promising strategies in integrated approaches, but what policy interventions to combine and how to align such bundles to local conditions remains unclear. We evaluate the impact of two types of interventions and of their combinations, in reducing fire occurrence through driving behavioural change: incentives (i.e. rewards that are conditional on environmental performance), and deterrents (e.g. sanction, soliciting concerns for health). We look at the impact of these interventions in 10 villages with varying landscape and fire-risk contexts in Sumatra, Indonesia. A private-led implementation of a standardised programme allows us to study outcome variability through a natural experiment design. We conduct a systematic cross-case comparison to identify the most effective combinations of interventions, using two-step qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) and geospatial and socio-economic survey data (n = 303). We analysed the combined influence of proximate conditions (interventions, e.g. fear of sanction) and remote ones (context; e.g. extent of peat soil) on fire outcomes. We show how, depending on the level of risk in the pre-existing context, certain bundles of interventions are needed to succeed. We found that, despite the programme being framed as rewards-based, people were not responding to the reward alone. Rather sanctions and soliciting concern appeared central to fire prevention, raising important equity implications. Our results contribute to the emerging global interest in peat fire mitigation, and the rapidly developing literature on PES performance.

TI  - Tree diversity and social-ecological resilience of agroforestry after volcanic ash deposition in Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
AB  - Smallholder farmers and their agroecosystems in active volcanic landscapes need to deal with and recover from eruptions. Resilience to extreme shocks may increase with system diversity, enhancing food and income security and ecosystem services provision; however, the longer term effects of volcanic ash are rarely assessed. To test the hypothesis that tree diversity contributes to the social-ecological resilience of coffee-based agroforestry, we quantified (1) the immediate effects of deposition of a 15-cm ash layer on tree survival, (2) the effect of volcanic ash on aboveground C stocks, tree diversity and wood density frequencies, (3) litter layer dynamics, and (4) farming system and income recovery 3 years after. Observations in four land-use systems before and after ash deposition (remnant forest, coffee-based complex and simple agroforestry, annual crops) were complemented by 46 farmer interviews on tree species' survival, system, and financial recovery. Based on farmer interviews, low-wood-density trees were most affected by volcanic ash deposition. Ash deposition did not, after 3 years and across land-use systems, significantly change tree density, basal area, or C stocks. In contrast, species richness in coffee-based agroforestry increased significantly. Standing litter stocks in agroforestry decreased, but slower decomposition partially compensated for reduced litter input. Farmers stated that diversity and flexibility in coffee-based agroforestry support a system recovery that is faster than that for annual crops, suppressing income fluctuation. Farmer's adaptive responses to enhance species diversity contributed to the resilience of farms, by retaining basic system structure and functions of agroforestry, and increasing product diversity and income.

TI  - Short-term soil physical quality improvements promoted by an agroforestry system
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Concerns with environmental sustainability have promoted adoption of conservationist practices in agricultural production, mainly focused on soil quality preservation or recovery. The aim of this study was evaluating short-term soil physical quality improvements under agroforestry system management in Southern Brazil. The agroforestry system was implemented in 2013 in an Ultisol with Sandy Loam texture. Rows of agroforestry system (AFS-R) were composed by biomass producer trees intercalated with wood and fruit producer trees while in the inter-rows (AFS-IR) perennial sub-shrub, perennial grass, and summer and winter green manure annual species were implanted. Soil under native forest was used as control. Soil samples in the 0.0-0.1; 0.1-0.2 and 0.2-0.4 m depths were collected for the determination of physical attributes and the total organic carbon content in 2015, 2016 and 2017. Bulk density decreased about 9% (AFS-R) and 6% (AFS-IR) in 0.0-0.1 m between 2015 and 2017. Total porosity increased over time only in AFS-R, at a rate of 0.025 m(3)m(-3)year(-1). The total organic carbon content of AFS increased over time only in the 0.0-0.1 m layer, although remained up to 35% less in relation to the native forest. The agroforestry system resulted in consistent improvements of several soil physical attributes over short time, particularly in rows with arboreal plants, highlighting the role of diversified tree root systems and plant residues accumulation, which implied a rapid improvement in soil quality. In this context, long-term studies with agroforestry systems are crucial to understand the benefits on soil quality.

TI  - Sustainable development in Sao Paulo's Green Belt Biosphere Reserve: between the void of municipal environmental policies and the ecosystem management of the territory
T2  - REVISTA DE GESTAO AMBIENTAL E SUSTENTABILIDADE-GEAS
AB  - Introduction: The Green Belt Biosphere Reserve, with 2.33 million hectares and its internal urban area with 220 thousand hectares, is configured as a water security territory and expresses a direct relationship between urban development and areas that ensure well-being and ecosystem services for 12% of Brazil's population. With seventy-eight municipalities that fully or partially integrate the GBBR, the socioeconomic differences and the different contexts of urbanization and governance reflect on territorial management at the local level and impact the environmental and regional sustainable development agendas. Objective: Based on a survey of environmental policies and correlations between economic and socio-environmental indicators on a municipal scale for the entire study area, this article assesses the level of development of the main environmental public policies and identifies the relationship between these policies and socio-environmental indicators. Originality: Although the Green Belt Biosphere Reserve is an area recognized by the United Nations (UN), the management of its territory depends on municipal actions that comprise it. Little attention has been paid to environmental management, especially in terms of public environmental policies and a broad and ongoing understanding of the conservation of this area. Results: The analysis shows that the different municipalities in the GBBR have different levels of implementation regarding Environmental Agenda. When considering the Municipal Plans for Urban Afforestation, Adaptation to Climate Change, Atlantic Forest and Solid Waste, only Guaruja, Mogi das Cruzes, Santos and Sao Paulo have these four policies in preparation or completed, while for 33.3% (n=25) of the municipalities, none of these agendas was developed, and a positive correlation was identified between the HDI and the largest number of implemented policies. Contribution: Large and medium-sized cities in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, present studies addressing ecological patterns and processes, however, they do not address specific questions on the environmental sector itself, which this paper aimed at providing. Conclusion: As the Green Belt accounts for 72% of the volume of drinking water in all of Sao Paulo, the disparities between the municipal indicators analyzed reinforce the need to adopt the GBBR as a platform for adequate governance to integrate policies at different scales for sustainable regional development. Systemic efforts are needed, especially at the municipal scale, in order to carry out adequate environmental management of the GBBR territory.

TI  - Carbon Storage in Soil Size Fractions Under Two Cacao Agroforestry Systems in Bahia, Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Shaded perennial agroforestry systems contain relatively high quantities of soil carbon (C) resulting from continuous deposition of plant residues; however, the extent to which the C is sequestered in soil will depend on the extent of physical protection of soil organic C (SOC). The main objective of this study was to characterize SOC storage in relation to soil fraction-size classes in cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) agroforestry systems (AFSs). Two shaded cacao systems and an adjacent natural forest in reddish-yellow Oxisols in Bahia, Brazil were selected. Soil samples were collected from four depth classes to 1 m depth and separated by wet-sieving into three fraction-size classes (> 250 mu m, 250-53 mu m, and < 53 mu m)-corresponding to macroaggregate, microaggregate, and silt-and-clay size fractions-and analyzed for C content. The total SOC stock did not vary among systems (mean: 302 Mg/ha). On average, 72% of SOC was in macroaggregate-size, 20% in microaggregate-size, and 8% in silt-and-clay size fractions in soil. Sonication of aggregates showed that occlusion of C in soil aggregates could be a major mechanism of C protection in these soils. Considering the low level of soil disturbances in cacao AFSs, the C contained in the macroaggregate fraction might become stabilized in the soil. The study shows the role of cacao AFSs in mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emission through accumulation and retention of high amounts of organic C in the soils and suggests the potential benefit of this environmental service to the nearly 6 million cacao farmers worldwide.

TI  - Impact of peri-urban agriculture on runoff and soil erosion in the rapidly developing metropolitan area of Jakarta, Indonesia
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB  - Negative effects of land use change on water resources are among the most important environmental problems widely found in rapidly developing urban areas. Preserving green open spaces, including peri-urban agriculture, has been emphasized in urban planning to maintain or enhance the water catchment capacity of a landscape. However, the effect of agriculture on water-related landscape functions varies depending on the type, distribution, and management of farmland. This paper analyzes the dynamics of agricultural land and its effect on runoff and soil erosion, in order to support agricultural land management in Jabodetabek Metropolitan Area (JMA) with Indonesia's capital Jakarta at its core. In 2012, agricultural land in JMA covered 53% of the total area, mostly located in the peri-urban zone. Peak Flow and Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) models were used to quantify the increase of runoff and soil erosion in the three most important water catchment areas in JMA caused by an expansion of dryland agriculture and mixed gardens from 1983 to 2012. Critical zones, which generate most of the runoff and soil erosion, were identified in each of the catchment areas. While reforestation of farmland in these zones will be only an option on steep slopes given the great food demands and rural livelihood, adoption of soil and water conservation practices can make a substantial contribution to reduce flood risks and conserve the productivity of agricultural land. A specific set of policy incentives is recommended considering agricultural land use types distribution and their impact on runoff and soil erosion.

TI  - Exploring urban forests in Minas Gerais, Brazil: floristic diversity and biome-driven insights to green infrastructure planning
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - This study analyzed urban forests in cities of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, aiming to explore the floristic composition, determine whether native or exotic species predominate, and investigate whether the biome of origin influences species composition. A survey of floristic studies in urban areas conducted in 2002-2023, utilized four databases: Google Scholar, Scopus, Scielo, and Web of Science. The search used the following descriptors: "qualitative analysis", "urban afforestation", "urban forest", "urban green spaces", and "Minas Gerais". Species were classified by origin, i.e., native or exotic, and in relation to their biome (Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, and Caatinga). A total of 407 species were identified, with 56% classified as exotic. The floristic profile of the urban forest was characterized by high richness of Fabaceae and significant representation of species such as Cenostigma pluviosum, Moquilea tomentosa, Terminalia catappa, Ficus benjamina, and Murraya paniculata. A Wilcoxon test revealed a significantly higher number of exotic species than natives. Based on the results of non-metric multidimensional scaling, along with cluster analysis, it was confirmed that the species composition of the urban forest is not related to the biome of origin or associated with the mesoregions of Minas Gerais, demonstrating biotic homogenization. In conclusion, the notable number of exotic species highlights a lack of planning by municipal authorities in developing a Green Infrastructure System. We recommend that species selection for the urban forest composition consider ecological, economic, and sociocultural criteria, consider the biome of local ecosystems, and prioritize the native indigenous species.

T2  - SOIL CARBON: SCIENCE, MANAGEMENT AND POLICY FOR MULTIPLE BENEFITS
CP  - Benefits of Soil Carbon Workshop
AB  - Terrestrial ecosystems play a major role in regulating the concentrations of three greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4 and N2O), of which CO2 is the most important in terms of the impact on the global radiative balance. Soils play a major role in the global carbon (C) cycle and CO2 dynamics; thus, management of soil carbon appears essential and more and more inevitable.
   The capacity of natural and managed agroecosystems to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in a manner that is not immediately re-emitted into the atmosphere is known as carbon sequestration: carbon dioxide is absorbed by vegetation through photosynthesis and stored as carbon in biomass and soils, and released through autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration. Forests, croplands and grasslands can store large amounts of carbon in soils for relatively long periods. Soils are the larger terrestrial pool of organic carbon. Moreover, soil carbon sequestration is beneficial for soil quality, both over the short term and long term, and can be achieved through land management practices adapted to the specific site characteristics. The ability of soils to sequester carbon depends on climate, soil type, vegetation cover and land management practices.
   According to the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the total technical greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation potential of agriculture (considering all gases and sources) is estimated to be in the range 4.5-6 Gt CO2-equivalent year-1 by 2030. Estimates indicate that many of these options are of relatively low cost and generate significant co-benefits in the form of improved agricultural production systems, resilience and other ecosystem services. Moreover, many of the technical options are readily available and could be deployed immediately. About 90% of this potential can be achieved by soil C sequestration through cropland management, grazing land management, restoration of organic soils and degraded lands, and water management in rainfed and irrigated croplands. In most cases, such management practices include the management of organic residues produced on site or coming from outside the field or the farm. It has been estimated that the global world production of residues in the agriculture sector is about 3.8 Pg C and, to date, the use of this resource has not been optimized; a large part is still being burned.
   Over the past two decades, other practices have been tested and are still controversial, such as biochar or chipped ramial wood application in cultivated fields. Biochar is a stabile carbon amendment, produced from pyrolysis of biomass, which may increase biomass productivity as well as sequester C from the source biomass. The scientific validation of these practices is still incomplete.
   Full participation of the agricultural sector in GHG mitigation still faces some challenges and barriers related to measurement, monitoring and reporting requirements in C offset markets. Further improvements are needed in methodologies and approaches that would help project designers and policy makers to integrate significant mitigation effects in agriculture development projects.

TI  - Impacts of fire on canopy structure and its resilience depend on successional stage in Amazonian secondary forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Secondary forests in the Amazon are important carbon sinks, biodiversity reservoirs, and connections between forest fragments. However, their regrowth is highly threatened by fire. Using airborne laser scanning (ALS), surveyed between 2016 and 2018, we analyzed canopy metrics in burned (fires occurred between 2001 and 2018) and unburned secondary forests across different successional stages and their ability to recover after fire. We assessed maximum and mean canopy height, openness at 5 and 10 m, canopy roughness, leaf area index (LAI) and leaf area height volume (LAHV) for 20 sites across South-East Amazonia (ranging from 375 to 1200 ha). Compared to unburned forests, burned forests had reductions in canopy height, LAI, and LAHV, and increases in openness and roughness. These effects were more pronounced in early successional (ES) than later successional (LS) stages, for example, mean canopy height decreased 33% in ES and 14% in LS and LAI decreased 36% in ES and 18% in LS. Forests in ES stages were less resistant to fire, but more resilient (capable of recovering from a disturbance) in their post-fire regrowth than LS stage forests. Data extrapolation from our models suggests that canopy structure partially recovers with time since fire for six out of seven canopy metrics; however, LAI and LAHV in LS forests may never fully recover. Our results indicate that successional stage-specific management and policies that mitigate against fire in early secondary forests should be implemented to increase the success of forest regeneration. Mitigation of fires is critical if secondary forests are to continue to provide their wide array of ecological services.

Comparadas com florestas n & atilde;o queimadas, florestas queimadas tiveram redu & ccedil;& otilde;es na altura do dossel, LAI e LAHV, e aumentos nas clareiras e rugosidade. Esses efeitos foram mais pronunciados nos est & aacute;gios sucessionais iniciais (ES) do que em est & aacute;gios sucessionais mais tardios (LS), por exemplo, a altura m & eacute;dia do dossel diminuiu 33% no ES e 14% no LS e o LAI diminuiu 36% no ES e 18% no LS. Florestas no est & aacute;gio ES foram menos resistentes ao fogo, mas mais resilientes (capazes de se recuperar de uma perturba & ccedil;& atilde;o) em sua regenera & ccedil;& atilde;o p & oacute;s-fogo do que florestas no est & aacute;gio LS. A partir da extrapola & ccedil;& atilde;o de dados, nossos modelos sugerem que a estrutura do dossel se recupera parcialmente com o tempo desde o fogo para seis dos sete atributos do dossel, algumas m & eacute;tricas como LAI e LAHV em florestas LS talvez nunca se recuperem totalmente.

TI  - REDD plus implementation in a high forest low deforestation area: Constraints on monitoring forest carbon emissions
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries (REDD + ), is still a promising mechanism of the UNFCCC for many tropical countries that would like to receive a fair financial compensation for their historical and current efforts to avoid forest conversion at the expense of more economically land uses. Brazil has a great opportunity to successfully participate in REDD + not only because of its huge Amazon forest area (ca. 4 million km(2)) but also because of its advanced forest monitoring system "PRODES". However, this opportunity could be threatened due to the current differentiated monitoring capacities of most Brazilian Amazon states, markedly in High-Forest and Low-Deforestation (HFLD) regions. This is evident in the State of Amapa, which despite its political will to support actions towards the design of its REDD + strategy, is still struggling with key technical aspects of forest monitoring. To address this issue and to strengthen the ongoing REDD + design process we assessed a) land use and land cover (LULC) changes for period of 23 years (1985-2008); b) estimated CO 2 emissions associated to these LULC changes; c) identified the main drivers and agents of deforestation, and d) discussed policy implications for REDD + implementation in a HFLD area. We applied a methodology, which is capable of reducing cloud cover using temporal filters on the classified images, detecting deforestation (and forest degradation) in areas as small as 1 ha, and used the decision tree method to identify different LULC types. This methodology was able to demonstrate that forest cover in northern Amapa has remained almost untouched during the observed period of 23-years. As many other HFLD areas, this region has a great potential to receive financial benefits from the REDD + mechanism, especially from voluntary markets that are largely interested in the conservation value of these areas. However, the use of high accuracy LULC classification approaches, with appropriate Measuring, Reporting and Verification systems should be part of the REDD + implementation strategy of HFLD areas towards having high standards for certified carbon, and therefore improved chances to receive better prices for carbon offsets. The potential of REDD + to be a fair and efficient mechanism will also depend on the recognition of the historical efforts to avoid deforestation in HFLD areas, mainly by Federal Governments, as an incentive for low-carbon development.

TI  - Offsetting the Impacts of Mining to Achieve No Net Loss of Native Vegetation
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - Offsets are a novel conservation tool, yet using them to achieve no net loss of biodiversity is challenging. This is especially true when using conservation offsets (i.e., protected areas) because achieving no net loss requires avoiding equivalent loss. Our objective was to determine if offsetting the impacts of mining achieves no net loss of native vegetation in Brazil's largest iron mining region. We used a land-use change model to simulate deforestation by mining to 2020; developed a model to allocate conservation offsets to the landscape under 3 scenarios (baseline, no new offsets; current practice, like-for-like [by vegetation type] conservation offsetting near the impact site; and threat scenario, like-for-like conservation offsetting of highly threatened vegetation); and simulated nonmining deforestation to 2020 for each scenario to quantify avoided deforestation achieved with offsets. Mines cleared 3570 ha of native vegetation by 2020. Under a 1:4 offset ratio, mining companies would be required to conserve >14,200 ha of native vegetation, doubling the current extent of protected areas in the region. Allocating offsets under current practice avoided deforestation equivalent to 3% of that caused by mining, whereas allocating under the threat scenario avoided 9%. Current practice failed to achieve no net loss because offsets did not conserve threatened vegetation. Explicit allocation of offsets to threatened vegetation also failed because the most threatened vegetation was widely dispersed across the landscape, making conservation logistically difficult. To achieve no net loss with conservation offsets requires information on regional deforestation trajectories and the distribution of threatened vegetation. However, in some regions achieving no net loss through conservation may be impossible. In these cases, other offsetting activities, such as revegetation, will be required.

TI  - Bird Responses to Lowland Rainforest Conversion in Sumatran Smallholder Landscapes, Indonesia
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Rapid land-use change in the tropics causes dramatic losses in biodiversity and associated functions. In Sumatra, Indonesia, lowland rainforest has mainly been transformed by smallholders into oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) and rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) monocultures, interspersed with jungle rubber (rubber agroforests) and a few forest remnants. In two regions of the Jambi province, we conducted point counts in 32 plots of four different land-use types (lowland rainforest, jungle rubber, rubber plantation and oil palm plantation) as well as in 16 nearby homegardens, representing a small-scale, traditional agricultural system. We analysed total bird abundance and bird abundance in feeding guilds, as well as species richness per point count visit, per plot, and per land-use system, to unveil the conservation importance and functional responses of birds in the different land-use types. In total, we identified 71 species from 24 families. Across the different land-use types, abundance did not significantly differ, but both species richness per visit and per plot were reduced in plantations. Feeding guild abundances between land-use types were variable, but homegardens were dominated by omnivores and granivores, and frugivorous birds were absent from monoculture rubber and oil palm. Jungle rubber played an important role in harbouring forest bird species and frugivores. Homegardens turned out to be of minor importance for conserving birds due to their low sizes, although collectively, they are used by many bird species. Changes in functional composition with land-use conversion may affect important ecosystem functions such as biological pest control, pollination, and seed dispersal. In conclusion, maintaining forest cover, including degraded forest and jungle rubber, is of utmost importance to the conservation of functional and taxonomic bird diversity.

TI  - The effectiveness of a biopesticide in the reduction of coffee berry borers in coffee plants
T2  - CROP PROTECTION
AB  - Context: Crop pest outbreaks are expected to become more frequent and unpredictable due to climate change, posing risks to ecosystem health and farmers' livelihoods. At the same time, there is growing evidence that chemical pesticides can persist in the landscape and contribute to land degradation. The use of natural pesticides in place of chemical pesticides is hoped to manage pest outbreaks while also restoring pollinator populations and improving the quality of arable land. During the 1970s, many countries committed to promoting and legislating Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies (encouraging natural and holistic approaches to pest management), often including using natural pesticides, known as biopesticides.Objective: We assessed the effectiveness of a biopesticide on coffee berry borer (CBB; Hypothenemus hampei) presence in 57 small-holder coffee home gardens in West Java, Indonesia across three years.Methods: Prior to the application of the biopesticide, we randomly chose ten coffee plants from each field and recorded the proportion of healthy berries per plant (berries without pest infestation) as a control. In April 2020, we distributed the biopesticide in each of the 57 coffee home gardens and repeated the above experiment. The biopesticide was redistributed in October 2020 and April 2021. We repeated the experiment for the last time in April 2021.Results and conclusions: We found that CBB presence significantly decreased, with an inverse relationship between distance to natural forest and CBB presence and a positive relationship between shade cover and CBB presence. We also interviewed farmers in April 2021 to investigate their perception of the effectiveness of the biopesticide and 87% of farmers thought it was more effective than conventional pesticides.Significance: We contribute to the growing literature on the effectiveness of natural pesticides through assessing farmers' perceptions of these methods and providing empirical evidence for their effectiveness in remedying CBB infestation. We hope that this study will empower farmers to make conscious land-use choices and provide government authorities with evidence to support increased accessibility to biopesticides.

TI  - Designing a carbon market that protects forests in developing countries
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON SERIES A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB  - Firmly incorporated into the Kyoto Protocol, market mechanisms offer an innovative and cost-effective means of controlling atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. However, as with markets for many other goods and services, a carbon market may generate negative environmental externalities. Possible interpretations and application of Kyoto provisions under COP-6bis and COP-7 raise concerns that rules governing forestry with respect to the Kyoto carbon market may increase pressure on native forests and their biodiversity in developing countries. In this paper, we assess the following two specific concerns with Kyoto provisions for forestry measures. First, whether, under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), by restricting allowable forestry measures to afforestation and reforestation, and explicitly excluding protection of threatened native forests, the Kyoto Protocol will enhance incentives for degradation and clearing of forests in developing countries; second, whether carbon crediting for forest management in Annex I (industrialized) regions under Article 3.4 creates a dynamic that can encourage displacement of timber harvests from Annex I countries to developing nations. Given current timber extraction patterns in developing regions, additional harvest pressure would certainly entail a considerable cost in terms of biodiversity loss.
   In both cases, we find that the concerns about deleterious impacts to forests and biodiversity are justified, although the scale of such impacts is difficult to predict. Both to ensure reliable progress in managing carbon concentrations and to avoid unintended consequences with respect to forest biodiversity, the further development of the Kyoto carbon market must explicitly correct these perverse incentives. We recommend several steps that climate policymakers can take to ensure that conservation and restoration of biodiversity-rich natural forests in developing countries are rewarded rather than penalized. To correct incentives to clear natural forests through CDM crediting for afforestation and reforestation, we recommend for the first commitment period that policymakers establish an early base year, such as 1990, such that lands cleared after that year would be ineligible for crediting. We further recommend an exception to this rule for CDM projects that are explicitly designed to promote natural forest restoration and that pass rigorous environmental impact review. Restoration efforts are typically most effective on lands that are adjacent to standing forests and hence likely to have been recently cleared. Thus, we recommend for these projects establishing a more recent base year, such as 2000.
   For the second and subsequent commitment periods, we recommend that climate policymakers act to restrain inter-annex leakage and its impacts by ensuring that crediting for forest management in industrialized countries is informed by modelling efforts to anticipate the scale of leakage associated with different Annex I 'Land use, land-use change and forestry' policy options, and coupled with effective measures to protect natural forests in developing countries. The latter should include expanding the options permitted under the CDM to carbon crediting for projects that protect threatened forests from deforestation and forest degradation.
   Ultimately, carbon market incentives for forest clearing can be reduced and incentives for forest conservation most effectively strengthened by fully capturing carbon emissions associated with deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries under a future emissions cap. Finally, we note that these recommendations have broader relevance to any forest-based measures to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions developed outside of the specific context of the Kyoto Protocol.

TI  - Biomass Production and Carbon Sequestration Potential of Different Agroforestry Systems in India: A Critical Review
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Agroforestry systems (AFS) and practices followed in India are highly diverse due to varied climatic conditions ranging from temperate to humid tropics. The estimated area under AFS in India is 13.75 million ha with the highest concentration being in the states of Uttar Pradesh (1.86 million ha), followed by Maharashtra (1.61 million ha), Rajasthan (1.55 million ha) and Andhra Pradesh (1.17 million ha). There are many forms of agroforestry practice in India ranging from intensified simple systems of monoculture, such as block plantations and boundary planting, to far more diverse and complex systems, such as home gardens. As a result, the biomass production and carbon sequestration potential of AFS are highly variable across different agro-climatic zones of India. Studies pertaining to the assessment of biomass and carbon storage in different agroforestry systems in the Indian sub-continent are scanty and most of these studies have reported region and system specific carbon stocks. However, while biomass and carbon stock data from different AFS at national scale has been scanty hitherto, such information is essential for national accounting, reporting of C sinks and sources, as well as for realizing the benefits of carbon credit to farmers engaged in tree-based production activities. Therefore, the objective of this study was to collate and synthesize the existing information on biomass carbon and SOC stocks associated with agroforestry practices across agro-climatic zones of India. The results revealed considerable variation in biomass and carbon stocks among AFS, as well as between different agro-climatic zones. Higher total biomass (>200 Mg ha(-1)) was observed in the humid tropics of India which are prevalent in southern and northeastern regions, while lower total biomass (<50 Mg ha(-1)) was reported from Indo-Gangetic, western and central India. Total biomass carbon varied in the range of 1.84 to 131 Mg ha(-1) in the agrihorticulture systems of western and central India and the coffee agroforests of southern peninsular India. Similarly, soil organic carbon (SOC) ranged between 12.26-170.43 Mg ha(-1), with the highest SOC in the coffee agroforests of southern India and the lowest in the agrisilviculture systems of western India. The AFS which recorded relatively higher SOC included plantation crop-based practices of southern, eastern and northeastern India, followed by the agrihorticulture and agrisilviculture systems of the northern Himalayas. The meta-analysis indicated that the growth and nature of different agroforestry tree species is the key factor affecting the carbon storage capacity of an agroforestry system. The baseline data obtained across various regions could be useful for devising policies on carbon trading or financing for agroforestry.

TI  - Loss of plant cover mediates the negative effect of anthropogenic disturbance on the multifunctionality of a dryland
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
AB  - Aims Anthropogenic disturbances due to human economic activities may affect ecosystem services, which are the benefits provided by the ecosystem properties, such as soil water content and soil fertility. Also, these disturbances affect plant community biodiversity and cover, which are also known to affect multiple ecosystem properties. However, the strength of the relative effects of the disturbance itself and of the effect that is mediated by changes in the plant community is still unclear. Questions We evaluated the relative direct and indirect effects (mediated by changes in the plant community) of the anthropogenic disturbances on ecosystem multifunctionality. Location Dry forests within the Sustainable Development Reserve Ponta do Tubarao, northeastern Brazil. Methods We measured standing biomass, litter mass, soil fertility and soil water content in 52 vegetation plots along a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance. Also, we measured woody plant cover and species' functional traits to characterize the plant community functional structure. We measured livestock grazing, selective logging and past clear-cuts as proxies of anthropogenic disturbance to create an index that characterizes the additive effect of these human activities. By building a theoretical model using the structural equation modelling approach, we investigated how the plant community changes in cover and biodiversity due to anthropogenic disturbances mediate changes in ecosystem properties. Results Our results show that anthropogenic disturbances had negative effects on ecosystem properties. Plant cover loss caused by anthropogenic disturbances was the major determinant of the negative effect of disturbances. The functional structure of the plant community had a weak effect on these properties. Conclusions By assessing the effect of human activities on multifunctionality, we found a stronger negative effect of anthropogenic disturbances when compared to its effect on single ecosystem properties. The recovery of plant cover should be a major focus of projects aiming to restore and maintain the multifunctionality of this dryland.

TI  - PM2.5 removal by urban trees in areas with different forestry conditions in São Paulo using a big-leaf modeling approach
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS AMBIENTAIS
AB  - Air pollution is one of the main environmental problems in megacities, such as the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo (MASP), in Brazil. Urban forests can alleviate air pollution by providing a surface for the dry deposition of particles and trace gases. To benefit from this environmental service and design future green structures, it is crucial to estimate the removal rate of air pollutants by trees. The removal rates of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) by urban trees were quantitatively assessed for the first time in Brazil. A big-leaf modeling approach was adopted, using the i-Tree Eco software. In situ dendrometric data, hourly PM2.5 concentrations, and meteorological variables were used as inputs to the model. PM2.5 removal fluxes ranged between 0.06 and 0.21 g/m2/year in three study areas with contrasting urban forestry conditions. The neighborhood with the greatest canopy cover and tree diversity had the highest removal rates. The evergreen character of the urban forest in the MASP possibly contributed to the relatively high PM2.5 removal fluxes, as compared to other cities around the world. Removal rates were higher in the austral summer, when high precipitation rates restricted the resuspension of deposited particles back to the atmosphere. When extrapolated to the whole metropolitan area, assuming homogeneous forestry conditions, the estimated PM2.5 removal rates were comparable to the magnitude of vehicular emissions, showing that air pollution removal by trees can be substantial in the MASP. The results demonstrate the contribution of urban trees to the improvement of air quality and can boost the development of public policies on urban afforestation in the MASP.

TI  - Second-growth forests of the Mexican tropics are reservoirs of timber species similar to old-growth forest: Perspectives for sustainable forest management
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
AB  - Second-growth forests represent the largest area of forest in southern Mexico and can provide relevant information on how their structural attributes in are linked to anthropogenic factors and for their forest management. However, a knowledge gap remains at national level with little scientific literature available. Therefore, this research aimed to investigate the structure and tree richness of second-growth forests in the south of Quintana Roo State, Mexico. With stratified sampling through participatory mapping of local collaborators, secondary tropical forests of 7, 15, 27, 37, and >= 48 to 80 years (y) old-growth were identified. We categorized forests into three successional stage classes: 5-20 y (Class I; forests of 7 and 15 y); 25-40 y (Class II; forests of 27 and 37 y), and old-growth forest (Class III; forests 48-80 y). In each forest (7, 15, 27, 37, 48, and 80 y of time since abandonment [tSA]) three plots were randomly chosen and established within the forest. Each age class was composed of two forests and six sample plots. In total there were 18 plots of 500 m2 2 each. Subsequently, we: i) calculated the land use intensity (LUI) to which the sites were subjected, ii) described the following structural attributes: floristic similarity, true diversity (effective number of species), stem density, and basal area (AB), and iii) evaluated if tSA and LUI influence the aforementioned structural attributes. Tree diversity was characterized with Hill numbers associated with observed species richness (0D), richness of equally abundant species (1D), and dominant species (2D). Forest structure was analyzed by density (number of trees ha(-1)) and distribution of stems by diameter class ha(-1) and basal area (BA, m(2) ha(-1)). The second-growth forest was derived from the milpa agricultural system under moderate land use intensity (LUI index = 0.02- 0.1). Floristic structure was at least similar between Class I and Class III. Forest age and LUI do not affect tree composition of the forests (p >= 0.1667). However, these two factors affected stem density and BA. Only the species richness (0D) of second-growth forest and old-growth forest was influenced by tSA (p = 0.0002). In second-growth forests, Classes I and II, 78 species (0D) were recorded, 8 and 8 exclusive species, 28 and 36 equally abundant species (1D), and 15 to 24 dominant species (2D). In the old-growth forest, Class III, 70 species were recorded, and 38 and 26 equally abundant (1D) and dominant species (2D), as well as 5 exclusive species. The density of stems decreased with increasing forest age and increasing BA. Second-growth forest and old-growth forest all showed a high density of small diameter stems. These results indicate that second-growth forests are important tree species reservoirs (including those for timber purposes), comparable to old-growth or mature forests, and therefore they are relevant not only as biodiversity conservation areas or carbon sinks, but also for planned sustainable forest management.

TI  - Changes in tropical terrestrial vertebrate communities along two anthropogenic gradients: Forest degradation and accessibility
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Forest degradation and hunting are two major drivers of species declines in tropical forests, often associated with forest production activities and infrastructure. To assess how the medium-to-large bodied terrestrial vertebrate community varied across these two main gradients of anthropogenic impact, we conducted a camera-trap survey across three production forest reserves in central Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, each with different past and current logging regimes. We analyzed data from a 32-species community using a Bayesian community occupancy model, investigating the response of occurrence, diversity, and composition to forest degradation and accessibility (a proxy for hunting pressure). We found forest degradation to be a strong driver of occurrence of individual species. Such responses led to declines in diversity and shifts in community composition, where forest-dependent species decreased while disturbance-tolerant species increased in occupancy probability with increasing forest degradation. Accessibility had a weaker effect on community diversity and species occupancy, and low-level hunting pressure and management of access to our study sites likely played an important role in mitigating accessibility effects. Nonetheless, our results showed accessibility had compounding effects on a wildlife community already affected negatively by forest degradation. Despite the impacts of forest degradation and accessibility on the terrestrial vertebrate community, our results highlight how the application of more sustainable practices-reducing forest disturbance and managing unauthorized access to logging roads-resulted in more intact wildlife communities. Understanding how both disturbances combined affect the terrestrial vertebrate community is essential for evaluating and developing effective sustainability guidelines.Abstract in malay is available with online material.
   Kemerosotan hutan dan pemburuan adalah dua faktor utama penurunan spesies di hutan tropika. Kedua-dua ancaman ini selalu dikaitkan dengan aktiviti pembalakan dan pembangunan infrastruktur. Untuk menilai bagaimana komuniti haiwan vertebrata darat sederhana dan besar bertindak balas terhadapkedua-dua ancaman antropogenik ini, kami menjalankan survei perangkap kamera di tiga hutan simpan di pedalaman Sabah, wilayah Borneo Malaysia, masing-masing dengan rejim pembalakan yang berbeza pada masa lalu dan kini. Kami menganalisis data dari 32 spesies menggunakan model Bayesian community occupancy untuk meneliti corak occupancy, diversity dan composition terhadap kemerosotan hutan dan kebolehcapaian (sebagai proksi tekanan pemburuan). Kami mendapati bahawa kemerosotan hutan adalah pemacu kuat kepada occupancy- spesies. Respon tersebut mengakibatkan penurunan dalam diversity dan perubahan dalam composition komuniti, di mana spesies yang bergantung kepada hutan menurun sementara spesies yang lebih bertahan terhadap kemerosotan hutan meningkat dari segi occupancy. Kebolehcapaian (proksi tekanan pemburuan) menunjukkan kesan yang lebih lemah pada diversity dan occupancy. Tekanan pemburuan pada kadar yang rendah dan pengawalan akses ke lokasi survei kami berkemungkinan memainkan peranan penting dalam mitigasi kesan kobolehcapaian. Namun demikian, hasil kajian kami menunjukkan kebolehcapaian memberi kesan secara akumulatif kepada komuniti spesies yang sudah terpengaruh negatif oleh kemerosotan hutan. Meskipun ada impak kemerosotan hutan dan kebolehcapaian kepada komuniti vertebrata darat, hasil kajian kami menyoroti bagaimana pengurusan hutan yang lebih mampan seperti mengurangkan gangguan hutan dan menghadkan akses pemburu akan menghasilkan komuniti hidupan liar yang lebih utuh. Memahami bagaimana kedua-dua gangguan tersebut mengaruhi komuniti vertebrata darat secara bergabung adalah penting untuk menilai dan membangunkan garis panduan kelesterian alam yang efektif.
   This study examines the impact of forest degradation and hunting on the terrestrial vertebrate community in Malaysian Borneo. Using camera traps across three forest reserves, it reveals that forest degradation significantly affects species occurrence, diversity, and composition, leading to declines in forest-dependent species and increases in disturbance-tolerant ones. While hunting pressure has a weaker effect, managing access to logging roads helps mitigate its impact, emphasizing the importance of sustainable practices for maintaining intact wildlife communities.image

TI  - An appraisal of Indonesia's immense peat carbon stock using national peatland maps: uncertainties and potential losses from conversion
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Background: A large proportion of the world's tropical peatlands occur in Indonesia where rapid conversion and associated losses of carbon, biodiversity and ecosystem services have brought peatland management to the forefront of Indonesia's climate mitigation efforts. We evaluated peat volume from two commonly referenced maps of peat distribution and depth published by Wetlands International (WI) and the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), and used regionally specific values of carbon density to calculate carbon stocks.
   Results: Peatland extent and volume published in the MoA maps are lower than those in the WI maps, resulting in lower estimates of carbon storage. We estimate Indonesia's total peat carbon store to be within 13.6 GtC (the low MoA map estimate) and 40.5 GtC (the high WI map estimate) with a best estimate of 28.1 GtC: the midpoint of medium carbon stock estimates derived from WI (30.8 GtC) and MoA (25.3 GtC) maps. This estimate is about half of previous assessments which used an assumed average value of peat thickness for all Indonesian peatlands, and revises the current global tropical peat carbon pool to 75 GtC. Yet, these results do not diminish the significance of Indonesia's peatlands, which store an estimated 30% more carbon than the biomass of all Indonesian forests. The largest discrepancy between maps is for the Papua province, which accounts for 62-71% of the overall differences in peat area, volume and carbon storage. According to the MoA map, 80% of Indonesian peatlands are < 300 cm thick and thus vulnerable to conversion outside of protected areas according to environmental regulations. The carbon contained in these shallower peatlands is conservatively estimated to be 10.6 GtC, equivalent to 42% of Indonesia's total peat carbon and about 12 years of global emissions from land use change at current rates.
   Conclusions: Considering the high uncertainties in peatland extent, volume and carbon storage revealed in this assessment of current maps, a systematic revision of Indonesia's peat maps to produce a single geospatial reference that is universally accepted would improve national peat carbon storage estimates and greatly benefit carbon cycle research, land use management and spatial planning.

TI  - Interactions between land use and soil type drive soil functions, highlighting water recharge potential, in the Cantareira System, Southeast of Brazil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Most of the soil quality assessment protocols are focused on crop production and conservation management, while studies on vital soil functions, such as water recharge potential, should be incorporated into the monitoring of impacts on environmental quality. Our objective was to evaluate, through the Nexus approach, how dynamic (land use and management) and inherent (soil type) factors impact soil physical properties and processes that drive water recharge potential, biomass production, and water erosion in the Cantareira System, Brazil. The assessment considered three soils (Typic Hapludult, Typic Dystrudept, and Typic Usthortent) and four land uses (native forest, rotational grazing, extensive grazing, and eucalyptus), which constitute the main soils and land uses in the Cantareira System region. Representative soil samples were collected at 0-5 and 30-35 cm depth and analyzed for several soil physical quality indicators, which were used to calculate a Soil Physical Quality Index based on soil functions. Converting the native forest to eucalyptus and pasture reduced the overall soil physical quality and water recharge potential. The groundwater recharge potential function in the topsoil has the highest score of 0.72 for Typic Dystrudept in native forest contrasting with 0.16 for extensive pasture. Typic Dystrudept obtained the highest value of the SPQI value (0-5 cm: 0.85; 30-35 cm: 0.90) for native forests when compared to Typic Hapludult (0-5 cm: 0.76; 30-35 cm: 0.57) and Typic Usthortent (0-5 cm: 0.75; 30-35 cm: 0.72). Our findings sustain that land use effects on soil functions depends on soil type. Inclusion of soil type into the Nexus approach increases the understanding of natural resources and derived benefits of water, energy and food in the Cantareira System.

TI  - Functional connectivity supported by forest conservation in urban sprawl landscape in Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
AB  - The rapid transformation of natural environments is driven by urban sprawl for a growing human population, mainly characterized by peri-urbanization that threatens the conservation of critical ecological species and processes. In this approach, our main objective was the prioritization of areas for forest conservation, aiming at functional connectivity in a landscape under urban sprawl. Firstly, based on the literature review, we defined the criteria, assigning them weights through expert opinions. However, we proposed an improvement in this stage, which was the evaluation of criteria influence and their respective control level. Thus, the final weights bring these two important characteristics to the criteria maps, which were normalized to 255 bytes scale with coincidence between the highest values and priority levels. The selected criteria were proximity to forest fragments, Landscape Resistance Index (LRI), proximity to the drainage network, Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), and slope. We produced the priority map, aggregating criteria using the Weighted Linear Combination, a Multicriteria Evaluation method. The sensitivity analysis validated the criteria and the spatialization of areas proposed by their aggregation. Our results indicated the highest priority areas (37.3% of the landscape) with values between 188 and 255 bytes were represented in 32% by proximity to forest fragments, 27% by the LRI, proximity to the drainage network amounted to 26%, TWI (8%), and slope (7%). We concluded that our model supports the prioritization of areas for functional forest connectivity based on robust criteria representing landscape features. And that the criteria robustness depends on the level of their influence control. Finally, the sensitivity analysis validates the decision process since it identifies the criteria contributing to the final map and its respective priority levels.

TI  - Tree diversity assessment and above ground forests biomass estimation using SAR remote sensing: A case study of higher altitude vegetation of North-East Himalayas, India
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
AB  - Forest biomass is one of the significant components for assessing the productivity and sustainability of the forest's ecosystem. In the present study, the mapping and estimation of above ground biomass (AGB) was performed using field observations employing allometric equations and C band Sentinel 1A and L band Advanced Land Observation System (ALOS) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) remote sensing satellite images for the parts of north eastern Himalayan forests, Arunachal Pradesh. Total 57 transects of 500 m x 10 m size was laid in West Kameng and Tawang districts (altitude range: 1047-4161 m) of Arunachal Pradesh, in which a total of 12203 individuals of 67 tree species (Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) range: 3.18-235.45 cm) was recorded. The study exhibited higher tree density (428 individuals' ha(-1)) and basal cover (7658.63 m(2)ha(-1)) in the studied forests. The highest above ground biomass was contributed by Castanopsis indica (103.82 t ha(-1)) followed by Pinus roxburghii (46.24 t ha(-1)) and Quercus semicarpifolia (23.14 t ha(-1)). Further, AGB was estimated using the Horizontal-Horizontal (HH), Horizontal-Vertical (HV) polarizations acquired by the ALOS PALSAR 50m mosaic (2008) dataset and Vertical-Vertical (VV), Vertical-Horizontal (VH) polarizations acquired by the Sentinel 1A dataset. The relationship between field based AGB and radar backscatter for selected sample plots was established using pair wise correlation. While comparing the two satellite-based SAR images, it is observed that high correlation between radar backscatter and field based AGB was observed in ALOS PALSAR as compared to Sentinel 1A SAR. This is due to higher sensitive to backscatter values and higher penetration level of L band ALOS PALSAR as compared to C band Sentinel 1A SAR. The correlation study indicates high correlation of HV polarizations in ALOS PALSAR (HV polarization R-2= 0.63; HH polarization R-2= 0.58) as compared to Sentinel 1A (VV polarization R-2= 0.054 and VH polarization R-2= 0.044). The most accurate and reliable method to estimate AGB is the field based method, but it is time consuming and tedious. Whereas, AGB estimation by L band SAR remote sensing is time effective and can be used for larger area in comparatively less time. The present study exhibited poor species diversity in higher altitudes northeast Himalayan forests as species diversity decreases with increase in altitudes. On the other hand, the higher AGB in the studied forests may be due to favorable environmental conditions including less temperature and more nutrient availability as well as less biotic interferences in terms of anthropogenic disturbances, herbivory and grazing. The study signifies the potential use of L and C band backscatter information in the reliable estimation of spatial AGB in subtropical to alpine forests of Arunachal Pradesh.

TI  - An approach to achieve sustainable development goals through participatory land and forest conservation: a case study in South Kalimantan Province, Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
AB  - The delivery of sustainable development goals (SDGs) through a participatory land and forest conservation initiative was evaluated in South Kalimantan Province, Indonesia. The initiative focused on the rehabilitation of a 410 ha forest that was managed by local villagers. A forest rehabilitation and management initiative was developed through participatory action, establishing a well-managed rubber plantation that provided new livelihood opportunities. Poverty reduction was promoted, evidenced by a reduction in inequality amongst the local community. Between 2010 and 2018 the Gini coefficient of inequality declined from 34.6% to 31.3%, demonstrating a contribution to SDGs 1 (No Poverty) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities). In addition, forest rehabilitation resulted in improved carbon stock and biodiversity management contributing to SDG15 (Life on Land). This was attributed to successful forest rehabilitation and the reduced incidence of forest fires. Cooperation amongst local villagers categorized as living in poor households was improved, facilitated by capacity building. This focused on rubber plantation management, cooperative action, and firefighting activities. This capacity building contributed to the delivery of SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). Results from a socio-economic survey demonstrated that group activities and cooperation amongst stakeholders were essential to improve both livelihoods and forest management practices.

TI  - Migration and ethnicity as cultural impact factors on land use change in the rainforest margins of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - STABILITY OF TROPICAL RAINFOREST MARGINS: LINKING ECOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONSTRAINTS OF LAND USE AND CONSERVATION
CP  - International Symposium on Stability of Tropical Rainforest Margins
AB  - Human activity endangers tropical forests in different parts of the world. The conflicting interests of nature conservation on the one hand, and the livelihood of farmers living at the forest margins, on the other, clash noticeably in so-called hotspots of biodiversity, such as the Lore Lindu region of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. Biodiversity generally decreases along a land use gradient from natural forest to agroforestry and annual crop systems. Thus, before solutions for a sustainable balance between conservation and the needs of people living at the forest margins can be sought, changing land use strategies and the factors that influence them must be analyzed. While similar studies often concentrate on economic indicators of land use change only, this chapter highlights the importance of two cultural realities, namely migration and ethnicity. We will demonstrate the great influence of these two factors on land use decisions and on the accessibility of land in the Lore Lindu region.
   Based on results from previous qualitative studies, we selected three upland villages, which represent a continuum that leads, in terms of migration history, from a pre-transition village, to a transitional village, to a post-transition village. We used quantitative and qualitative methods for our analysis.
   The results show a general land use change in the region, ranging from a strategy that places food first (e.g., rice) to one that places cash first, especially by the cultivation of cacao. This change cannot be observed to the same extent in the study region as a whole. It varies from village to village, depending on the share of households belonging to the Bugis migrants. Bugis as an ethnic group and as migrants have an enormous effect on the land use decisions of local ethnic groups in their respective villages. Strong ethnic networks among Bugis migrants play an important role not only with respect to their village preferences, but also with respect to the transfer of knowledge regarding agricultural management. A lack of interaction between local and migrant ethnic groups results in differences in the efficiency of cacao cultivation. While the Bugis migrants mainly buy their agricultural land from local farmers or, depending on the village's migration history, from other Bugis households, members of the autochthonous ethnic group usually clear the primary forest. The findings of the present study reveal that an analysis of migration and ethnicity is a crucial precondition to finding sustainable solutions for ensuring that the margins of the rainforest in the Lore Lindu region remain stable. This chapter will emphasize that, in addition to economic considerations, an analysis of the cultural forces that influence land use changes cannot be neglected.

TI  - Social innovation and social-ecological development in the Cerrado: the case of agroforestry systems in the Federal District, Brazil
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Global demands for food and feed result in deforestation and consequent social-ecological disturbances across (especially) the Global South. In the Brazilian Cerrado, only 19.8% of natural vegetation remains undisturbed, owing to agribusiness operations. Concerns around the need for more sustainable land-uses hence stir debates in scientific and policy-making arenas. Among these debates, the potentials of agroforestry systems (AFS) have been brought to the fore. AFS have proven to promote more sustainable human-environment interactions, enhance rural livelihoods and partially offset the negative impacts from the loss of natural vegetation in the Cerrado. Uncovering the elements that influence AFS' functioning and outcomes is key for understanding these strategic roles. The aim of this paper is to analyze the mechanisms enabling and hindering the role of AFS as a sustainable development strategy in the Cerrado. More specifically, we analyze the social-ecological interrelationships that shape socially innovative agroforestry practices in the Hydrological Basin of Ribeir & atilde;o Pipiripau, Federal District. Our results show the key role of socially innovative agroforestry in counteracting social-ecological disturbances that characterize the Cerrado. Importantly, our case study contradicts theses positing that increased poverty results in the increased degradation of natural resources. Nonetheless, our results also highlight the complex socio-political structures threatening-and hindering the up-scaling of-the sustainability of the AFS under study. We stress the need for global-to-local policies and practices aiming at enhancing relationships between food and different layers of society.

TI  - Ecosystem nutrient use efficiency, productivity, and nutrient accrual in model tropical communities
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Ecosystem nutrient use efficiency-the ratio of net primary productivity to soil nutrient supply-is an integrative measure of ecosystem functioning. High productivity and nutrient retention in natural systems are frequently attributed to high species diversity, even though some single-species systems can be highly productive and effective at resource capture. We investigated the effects of both individual species and life-form diversity on ecosystem nutrient use efficiency using model tropical ecosystems comprised of monocultures of three tree species and polycultures in which each of the tree species was coplanted with species of two additional life forms. Tree species significantly influenced nutrient use efficiency by whole ecosystems in monocultures; however, in polycultures, the additional life forms interacted with the influence exerted by the dominant tree. Furthermore, the presence of the additional life forms significantly increased nutrient uptake and uptake efficiency, but in only two of the three systems and 2 of the 4 years of the study period. These results indicate that the effect of life-form diversity on ecosystem functioning is not constant and that there may be temporal shifts in the influence exerted by different components of the community. Furthermore, although species (and life forms) exerted considerable influence on ecosystem nutrient use efficiency, this efficiency was most closely related to soil nutrient availability. These findings demonstrate that ecosystem nutrient use efficiency is an outcome not only of the characteristics of the species or tife forms that comprise the system but also of factors that affect soil nutrient supply. The results argue against the simple upward scaling of nutrient use efficiency from leaves and plants to ecosystems.

TI  - Changes in soil phosphorus pool induced by pastureland intensification and diversification in Brazil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The adoption of more intensive and diversified pasture systems is a promising alternative to improve sustainability of grazing lands in Brazil. Phosphorus (P) is one of the main determinants of ecosystem function in these management systems; therefore, we assessed the effects of adopting more intensive and diversified pasture management systems on soil P dynamics in a set of field experiments. Treatments included fertilized pasture (FP), integrated crop-livestock (ICL), integrated livestock-forest (ILF), compared to conventional management systems (CS) under contrasting climatic conditions (tropical humid, tropical mesic and subtropical). P fractions and total P were determined by soil layer to 1 m depth. Size and distribution of P stocks were related to soil organic matter (SOM) fractions and to clay type and content. Based on the results, P biological fraction represented 9% of P in the soil, on average, in CS under the three assessed climatic conditions. Management systems with FP and the ones with ICL and ILF mainly influenced labile (0.01, 0.02 and 0.03 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively), moderately labile (0.03, 0.01 and 0.07 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively) and total soil P fractions (0.21, 0.08 and 0.20 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively). Clay content and pH were the soil properties mostly related to P fractions; besides, P fractions presented close relationship with these fractions and with total soil C and N, as well as with different SOM fractions. These results can be the scientific basis for governmental initiatives focused on recovering degraded pasture sites in Brazil. The establishment of management practices that favor efficient P use are essential to improve the sustainability of production systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - REDD+ and forest fires: Implications for the legal and policy forest fire management framework in Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND PLANNING LAW JOURNAL
AB  - Forest fires are responsible for forest degradation and are one of the most direct causes of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The REDD+ initiative is considered to be a partial solution in reducing forest fires by incentivising behaviour which prevents further deforestation and degradation. In Indonesia, this mechanism may provide a significant driver for law reform and policy change to reduce forest fires. This article examines the legal and policy frameworks in Indonesia to implement and integrate REDD+ into forest fire reduction strategies. It examines the international framework of REDD+, the moratorium on forest and peatland concessions and presents a case study of the first REDD+ pilot project in Central Kalimantan. The article evaluates these initiatives and their outcomes. It then considers a number of recent strategies which Indonesia has adopted to strengthen forest and peatland protection.

TI  - Bird richness and Ecosystems Services across an urban to natural gradient in south-eastern Brazil: implications for landscape planning and future scenarios
T2  - ONE ECOSYSTEM
AB  - In natural and altered environments, the Ecosystem Services (ES) provided by the presence of vegetation, especially regulating ES such as climate regulation and air pollutant removal, are essential to improve human health and well-being. In this study, we focused on a tropical -subtropical river basin which covers urban, peri-urban and rural landscape types of a Brazilian municipality located in the ecotone between the Atlantic Forest and the Cerrado (Brazilian savannah). The research aimed to assess the current state of ES and bird richness (as a biodiversity indicator) and their relationships across an urban -rural -natural gradient. We assessed the cooling effect (as microclimate regulation indicator), air pollutant removal (PM10), nature -based recreation opportunities and bird richness and analysed the variations associated with a shift in the prevailing land- cover types along a gradient of urbaniszation. The results indicated a higher bird richness in periurban and rural landscapes, as well as greater pollutant removal and cooling effect provided by vegetation. However, recreation opportunities provided mainly by human infrastructure were higher inside the urban zone and in some peri-urban areas. The landscape type significantly influenced the availability and intensity of these four variables (p < 0.001). Bird richness, air pollutant removal, and cooling effect were positively correlated (r > 0.539; p <= 0.048);, however, a trade-off between them and recreation opportunities (r = -0.59, R2 = 0.348, p < 0.001) was found. We simulated possible scenarios of reforestation actions in urban areas to predict the ES values when vegetation cover area is increased. According to the results, the urban planning and efforts to improve nNature-based solutions in the studied river basin should consider the observed trade-off to promote sustainable nature -based recreation opportunities in places with higher values of ES (cooling effect, air pollutant removal, and bird richness) and/or to increase the ES values in urban landscape through environmental policies, such as reforestation.

TI  - Meta-analysis of carbon stocks and biodiversity outcomes across Brazilian restored biomes
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Ecosystem restoration strategies vary widely in the techniques applied and ecological contexts. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate how restoration success varies across socio-ecological contexts, taxonomic groups and biomes. Restoration success is quantified as the percentage of each ecological metric value attained in the restoration site compared to the reference systems. We show that restoration success is different for plants, animals, and soils and across ecological indicators. Abundance of individuals is easier to restore than carbon stocks, which are easier than species diversity. However, abundance may be a poor indicator of ecosystem recovery because there is no unidirectional trend over time, and abundance often fails to distinguish restored from degraded areas. We also found that carbon stocks in the soil and in the vegetation are restored at analogous paces, but the recovery of soil carbon stocks is less variable than plant stocks across sites. Our results demonstrate that different restoration techniques are effective in recovering diversity and carbon stocks, but assisted natural regeneration showed a slightly higher success compared to other strategies. However, there is a considerable difficulty in restoring converted and degraded areas to achieve conditions similar to the original ecosystems. It is critical and timely to investigate benefits and effectiveness of ecosystem restoration techniques to biodiversity and carbon recovery different ecosystem types to improve the restoration effectiveness.

TI  - Grazing deteriorates the soil carbon stocks of Caatinga forest ecosystems in Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Grazing by domestic ungulates can have substantial impacts on forests in arid and semi-arid regions, possibly including severe loss of carbon from the soil. Predicting net livestock impacts on soil organic carbon stocks remains challenging, however, due to the dependence on animal loads and on soil and environmental parameters. The objective of this study was to better understand grazing effects on soil organic carbon in seasonal tropical dry forests of north-eastern Brazil (Caatinga) by quantifying carbon stocks of the upper soil profile (0-5 cm depth) and greater soil depths (>5 cm depth down to bedrock) along a gradient of grazing intensity while accounting for other influencing factors such as soil texture, vegetation, landscape topography, and water availability. We analysed soil organic carbon, soil clay content, altitude above sea level, soil depth to bedrock, distance to the nearest permanent water body, species diversity of perennial plants and aboveground biomass on 45 study plots located in the vicinity of the Itaparica Reservoir, Pernambuco, Brazil. Livestock (mainly goats and cattle) are unevenly distributed in the studied ecosystem, thus grazing intensity was accounted for based on the weight of livestock droppings per square metre and classified as no or light, intermediate, or heavy grazing. The mean soil organic carbon in the area was 16.86 +/- 1.28 Mg ha(-1) C with approximately one-quarter found in the upper 5 cm of the soil profile (4.14 +/- 0.43 Mg ha(-1) C) and the remainder (12.57 +/- 0.97 Mg ha(-1) C) in greater soil depths (>5 cm). Heavy grazing led to significantly lower soil organic carbon stocks in the upper 5 cm, whereas no effect on soil organic carbon of the soil overall or in greater soil depths was detectable. The soil's clay content and the altitude proved to be the most relevant factors influencing overall soil organic carbon stocks and those in greater soil depths (>5 cm). Our findings suggest that grazing causes substantial release of carbon from Brazilian dry forest soils, which should be addressed through improved grazing management via a legally compulsory rotation system. This would ultimately contribute to the conservation of a unique forest system and associated ecosystem services. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Large-Scale Green Liver System for Sustainable Purification of Aquacultural Wastewater: Construction and Case Study in a Semiarid Area of Brazil (Itacuruba, Pernambuco) Using the Naturally Occurring Cyanotoxin Microcystin as Efficiency Indicator
T2  - TOXINS
AB  - The aquaculture industry in Brazil has grown immensely resulting in the production of inefficiently discarded wastewater, which causes adverse effects on the aquatic ecosystem. The efficient treatment of aquaculture wastewater is vital in reaching a sustainable and ecological way of fish farming. Bioremediation in the form of the Green Liver System employing macrophytes was considered as wastewater treatment for a tilapia farm, COOPVALE, in Itacuruba, Brazil, based on previously demonstrated success. A large-scale system was constructed, and the macrophytes Azolla caroliniana, Egeria densa, Myriophyllum aquaticum, and Eichhornia crassipes were selected for phytoremediation. As cyanobacterial blooms persisted in the eutrophic wastewater, two microcystin congeners (MC-LR and -RR) were used as indicator contaminants for system efficiency and monitored by liquid-chromatography-tandem-mass-spectrometry. Two trial studies were conducted to decide on the final macrophyte selection and layout of the Green Liver System. In the first trial, 58% MC-LR and 66% MC-RR were removed and up to 32% MC-LR and 100% MC-RR were removed in the second trial. Additional risks that were overcome included animals grazing on the macrophytes and tilapia were spilling over from the hatchery. The implementation of the Green Liver System significantly contributed to the bioremediation of contaminants from the fish farm.

TI  - Soil Organic Matter Responses to Mangrove Restoration: A Replanting Experience in Northeast Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Mangroves are among the most relevant ecosystems in providing ecosystem services because of their capacity to act as sinks for atmospheric carbon. Thus, restoring mangroves is a strategic pathway for mitigating global climate change. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the organic matter dynamics in mangrove soils during restoration processes. Four mangrove soils under different developmental stages along the northeastern Brazilian coast were studied, including a degraded mangrove (DM); recovering mangroves after 3 years (3Y) and 7 years (7Y) of planting; and a mature mangrove (MM). The soil total organic carbon (C-T) and soil carbon stocks (SCSs) were determined for each area. Additionally, a demineralization procedure was conducted to assess the most complex humidified and recalcitrant fractions of soil organic matter and the fraction participating in organomineral interactions. The particle size distribution was also analyzed. Our results revealed significant differences in the SCS and C-T values between the DM, 3Y and 7Y, and the MM, for which there was a tendency to increase in carbon content with increasing vegetative development. However, based on the metrics used to evaluate organic matter interactions with inorganic fractions, such as low rates of carbon enrichment, C recovery, and low C content after hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment being similar for the DM and the 3Y and 7Y-this indicated that high carbon losses were coinciding with mineral dissolution. These results indicate that the organic carbon dynamics in degraded and newly planted sites depend more on organomineral interactions, both to maintain their previous SCS and increase it, than mature mangroves. Conversely, the MM appeared to have most of the soil organic carbon, as the stabilized organic matter had a complex structure with a high molecular weight and contributed less in the organomineral interactions to the SCS. These results demonstrate the role of initial mangrove vegetation development in trapping fine mineral particles and favoring organomineral interactions. These findings will help elucidate organic accumulation in different replanted mangrove restoration scenarios.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
AB  - Tropical mountain peatlands in Brazil's Southern Espinha & ccedil;o Range are vital ecosystems, acting as carbon reservoirs, hydrological buffers, and biodiversity hotspots while sustaining traditional livelihoods and preserving paleoenvironmental records. Despite their importance, peatlands outside protected areas face degradation by grazing and fires, threatening their ability to regulate ecosystem processes sensitive to temperature, such as greenhouse gas emissions, water cycling, biological activity, and organic matter decomposition. Since 2016, we have monitored peat temperatures in two contrasting peatlands-one preserved (within a protected area) and one disturbed (outside the protected area)-to understand how anthropogenic disturbances and climate variability impact these fragile ecosystems. Seasonal patterns dominated temperature variation, accounting for 60% of air and 81%-92% of peatland temperature variation. However, average temperatures and amplitudes differed between peatlands and depths. Interannual variability revealed stronger trends in the disturbed peatland, where a 1 degrees C increase in air temperature caused the trend to increase 0.70 degrees C-0.87 degrees C on average at depths of 0.85 m-0.92 m. By contrast, the preserved peatland showed smaller increases (0.20 degrees C-0.24 degrees C) at comparable depths (1.06 m-1.24 m), suggesting a greater resilience. Temperature variation in the monitored peatlands was majorly driven by seasonal patterns, as revealed by time series decomposition and sinewave fit. Average temperature and amplitude varied between the two peatlands and among sampling sites, reflecting differences in environmental conditions and measurement depth. Interannual variability also exhibited distinct effects between peatlands and monitoring sites. The time series trend component showed more pronounced fluctuations at shallower depths and in the disturbed peatland. For every 1 degrees C increase in the trend component of the air temperature, the trend component of the peatland time series increased by 0.70 degrees C and 0.87 degrees C on average at depths of 0.85 m and 0.92 m, respectively, in the disturbed peatland. In contrast, the preserved peatland exhibited smaller increases of 0.20 degrees C and 0.24 degrees C at comparable depths (1.06 m and 1.24 m). These findings highlight the potential for feedback responses between peatland disturbance and climate change, threatening their critical role in regulating carbon and water cycles. Expanding long-term monitoring, strengthening conservation efforts, and raising public awareness are essential to safeguard the ecosystem services provided by tropical mountain peatlands.

TI  - A Complete Assessment of Carbon Stocks in Above and Belowground Biomass Components of a Hybrid Eucalyptus Plantation in Southern Brazil
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Hybrid eucalypt clones are grown for fiber production worldwide and to provide an ecosystem service that can store atmospheric carbon at a very fast rate. This study assessed the carbon stocks in the soil and various tree fractions in a 10-year-old plantation of Eucalyptus urophylla S. T. Blake x Eucalyptus globulus Labill. in Southern Brazil. Four experimental plots were established, and an inventory of Eucalyptus trees was conducted by considering five diametric classes. Three trees in each diametric class were harvested for biomass and carbon quantification. The understory biomass of native trees was quantified in five subplots and the litter was quantified in 16 subplots. Organic C was quantified in the soil (SOC) and roots (diameter <= 0.5 cm) to a depth of 100 cm. The C concentration in the di ff erent biomass fractions of the eucalyptus trees were 55.7% (+/- 0.6), 50.4% (+/- 0.4), 49.5% (+/- 0.6) and 45.4 % (+/- 0.9) for leaves, branches, wood and bark, respectively. The C concentrations in the understory fractions were 51.4% (+/- 1.0) for the canopy and 50.0% (+/- 0.9) for the stem. The carbon concentration in the fine root biomass was 45.7% (+/- 1.4). Soil C concentrations were 1.23% (+/- 0.32), 0.97% (+/- 0.10), 0.45% (+/- 0.14), and 0.24% (+/- 0.10) for depths of 0-25, 25-50, 50-75, and 75-100 cm. C was allocated in: (a) the trees (aboveground fraction = 118.45 Mg ha(-1) and belowground fraction = 30.06 Mg ha(-1)), (b) the understory = 1.44 Mg ha(-1), (c) the litter = 8.34 Mg ha(-1), and (d) the soil (without roots) = 99.7 Mg ha(-1). The share of total C stock (a + b + c + d = 258.0 Mg ha(-1)) was similar in the aboveground (49.7%) and belowground (50.3%) fractions, thus indicating a very high rate of C sequestration in the biomass. Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil are fast growing (for this study = 36.7 m3 ha(-1) year 1) and contribute to intense carbon sequestration in above and belowground biomass (14.8 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)).

TI  - Flower Visitation Time and Number of Visitor Species Are Reduced by the Use of Agrochemicals in Coffee Home Gardens
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Pollination services, from both wild and managed populations of insect pollinators, have degraded as a result of agricultural intensification. Whilst 75% of economically important crops depend on insect pollinators for cultivation, 40% of insect pollinator species are threatened with extinction. Pollination services must be preserved if there is to be enough food for a global population whose demand is expected to double, if not triple, by 2050. Pollinator diversity and pollinator efficiency have been found to increase as a result of wildlife-friendly farming practices (i.e., natural chemicals and fertilizers and agroforestry). We evaluated the presence of insect pollinators in 42 coffee home gardens in West Java, Indonesia. Via generalized linear mixed models, we found that number of visitor species (beta = 0.418 +/- SE 0.194, p = 0.031) and visitation time (beta = 0.845 +/- SE 0.308, p = 0.006) decreased as farms were more intensely managed, (i.e., used chemical pesticides), compared to fields using organic practices. As knowledge of pollination services is widespread amongst smallholder farmers in Indonesia and beyond due to the long-held tradition of beekeeping, these results will add to their existing knowledge and empower farmers to enhance resources for pollinator species through agroforestry and natural pest management. Although we found significant differences in pollination services provided in intensely managed and wildlife-friendly farms, chemical use can affect farms far beyond a particular area of production. Therefore, pollinator conservation must be applied at a landscape level and involve all stakeholders, including farmers, when making effective policies.

TI  - Neighborhood effects in the Brazilian Amazonia: Protected areas and deforestation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - This article investigates whether protected areas are efficient instruments against deforestation in the Brazilian Amazonia. A Dynamic Spatial Durbin Model taking into account both the location bias and the spatial spillover effects between municipalities allows to assess the impact of the different types of protected areas (integral protected areas, sustainable protected areas and indigenous lands) on deforestation. We show that deforestation decisions are strategic complements. The econometric results differ according to the type of protected area. It is shown that: i) integral protected areas and indigenous lands allow for reducing deforestation; ii) sustainable use areas do not help to reduce deforestation; and iii) the spillover effects generated by integral protected areas and indigenous lands lead a reduction in deforestation in their vicinity. A 10% increase in the surface area of integral protected areas (indigenous lands) allows an estimated 9.32 sq. km (10.08 sq. km) of avoided deforestation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Brushwood and artificial perch did not facilitate forest regeneration in Urochloa spp. grassland
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - In Brazil, many pastures are formed by grasses of the genus Urochloa, which have recognized inhibitory effects on regeneration of native vegetation. Using facilitation practices for natural regeneration of these areas aims to promote forest restoration by creating safe sites in the seedbed. This study aimed to assess the efficiency of brushwood and artificial perch as techniques to improve native plant establishment in an area covered by the inhibitory grasses of Urochloa. Field work was conducted between February 2014 and February 2016, in an area of lowland Atlantic rainforest in Morretes-PR. A set of 12 8 m x 5 m plots were established, corresponding to three treatments and four replicates, organized according to randomized block and split-plot design. The treatments were: brushwood, brushwood + artificial perch and control treatment. Evaluations were conducted at 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 months after the experiment was installed by counting and identifying regenerating woody species and visually estimating cover percentage of herbs and subshrubs species. Brushwood treatments with and without perch initially reduced Urochloa grasses; however, over time the initial effects ceased due to the rapid growth of grass at plot edges. Likewise, perches in this treatment did not increase native/woody species. We concluded that the ecological restoration of Urochloa pastures requires additional measures to control grasses and increase local resilience in order to improve the seedbed.

TI  - Looking for indicator bird species in the context of forest fragmentation and isolation in West Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - In the context of Borneo's drastic landscape fragmentation, we assessed the role of diverse forest and land uses-swidden agriculture, mixed garden, smallholder rubber and oil palm plantations-in determining (1) diversity levels and composition of bird species in different vegetation types; (2) the potential for bird species to act as indicators of habitat quality; and (3) the agricultural matrix's contribution to preserving forest-dependent species. Field campaigns across West Kalimantan sites were conducted during both rainy and dry seasons, using mist nets and 10-min point count recordings along transects. We used four diversity indices, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and the Indicator Value index (IndVal) for our analysis. Our results endorsed the general trend found across the tropics of a significant reduction in bird species richness, from the complex natural and old secondary forest structures to the simplified monoculture habitats. We recorded 10,519 individuals across 214 bird species, representing almost 90% of Borneo's lowland forest species. NMDS differentiated intact forest from forest fragments and land under different agriculture uses. Eighty percent of the bird species preferred an intact forest environment. Industrial oil palm sites were the most `avoided' vegetation type. Using IndVal, we found six indicator species significantly associated with forest, three indicator species for depleted forest, one for mixed garden, and none for oil palm plantation. Farm-dependent species richness was strikingly low, and species had little conservation value as per IUCN standards; industrial oil palm plantations were poorest in bird species. Notable exceptions were traditional mixed gardens and old fallows associated with swidden agriculture, when in proximity to forest. These traditional agroforestry systems have higher conservation value than industrial and smallholder monoculture plantations, however, their long-term preservation is uncertain, and monitoring programs are lacking that can contribute to long-term biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service maintenance. More data are needed to determine the viable population sizes for the bird indicator species identified in our study. Such knowledge on population trends can be used to monitor habitat quality and health of forest agriculture landscape mosaics and improve the effectiveness of management, conservation and monitoring in future.

TI  - SUSTAINABLE RECOVERY PLAN FOR AN URBAN-RURAL COMMUNITY AFFECTED BY THE FUNDÃO DAM DISASTER IN BRAZIL
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT
AB  - The rupture of Fund & atilde;o Dam spilled contaminated tailings across the Doce river basin, severely damaging municipalities such as the urban Barra Longa and the rural Gesteira. The wave of tailings led to the sediment deposition in rivers margins, causing the loss of riparian forests and cropping areas. Sediment analyses confirmed the presence of toxic compounds (sodium and ether amine) and a very low fertility. In consequence, there was a sharp decline in agro-pastoral production in Gesteira, leading to land abandonment and rural exodus. In the urban area of Barra Longa, the wave of tailings damaged the urban floodplain and the square, which were rehabilitated using grey infrastructure. Alternatively, we proposed a new landscape recovery plan for both Barra Longa and Gesteira based on Nature and Community-based solutions that contemplate the inclusion of green infrastructure, the remediation of toxic compounds, the restoration of soil fertility, permeability and stabilization, riparian forest rehabilitation and the recovery of agro-pastoral productivity, ultimately aiming at reducing the flood risk and land abandonment.

TI  - IMPLEMENTATION OF MULTI-SYSTEM SILVICULTURE (MSS) TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE OF PRODUCTION FOREST MANAGEMENT: A CASE STUDY OF PT. SARPATIM, CENTRAL KALIMANTAN
T2  - INDONESIAN JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
AB  - To date, performance of the management of Indonesian production forests are discouraging. The concession areas, timber production and employment have been decreasing over time. To concern on these matter and to improve management, a research was conducted for six years (2008-2013) and resulted in recommendations to implement the Multi-System of Silviculture (MSS) systems. Two products were generated in MSS; criteria and indicator to guide the selection of appropriate silvicultural system and supersilvik, a model to develop the best business plans. This paper evaluates and strengthens the recommendations through the simulation of MSS products in PT. Sarmiento Parakantja Timber (Sarpatim), Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Various data variables were used, such as thematic maps of forest areas, data of stand, materials, equipments, labors, finances and incomes. Data were processed in a variety of formulations which were connected to each other in model systems to produce a variety of outcomes, such as production, finance, employment and tax contributions. Results offer four options to improve PT. Sarpatim performance, one of which is the best choice. Compared to the former business model under limited silvicultural systems, MSS projected an increase in the use of land, timber production and employment by 151-753%. Implementing MSS will provide a better and healthier finance for company with an increase of NPV up to 193%; as well as for government tax revenues with an increase up to 308%. This MSS case study strongly suggests using the new theory that the management of production forests is a land and plant-based enterprises, which should put the land as the major capital and silvicultural aspects as the driving engine for production. The policy makers should be able to use these results as a reference in implementing MSS widely as part of Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) practices.

TI  - Deforestation and Reforestation of Latin America and the Caribbean (2001-2010)
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Forest cover change directly affects biodiversity, the global carbon budget, and ecosystem function. Within Latin American and the Caribbean region (LAC), many studies have documented extensive deforestation, but there are also many local studies reporting forest recovery. These contrasting dynamics have been largely attributed to demographic and socio-economic change. For example, local population change due to migration can stimulate forest recovery, while the increasing global demand for food can drive agriculture expansion. However, as no analysis has simultaneously evaluated deforestation and reforestation from the municipal to continental scale, we lack a comprehensive assessment of the spatial distribution of these processes. We overcame this limitation by producing wall-to-wall, annual maps of change in woody vegetation and other land-cover classes between 2001 and 2010 for each of the 16,050 municipalities in LAC, and we used nonparametric Random Forest regression analyses to determine which environmental or population variables best explained the variation in woody vegetation change. Woody vegetation change was dominated by deforestation (541,835km2), particularly in the moist forest, dry forest, and savannas/shrublands biomes in South America. Extensive areas also recovered woody vegetation (+362,430km2), particularly in regions too dry or too steep for modern agriculture. Deforestation in moist forests tended to occur in lowland areas with low population density, but woody cover change was not related to municipality-scale population change. These results emphasize the importance of quantitating deforestation and reforestation at multiple spatial scales and linking these changes with global drivers such as the global demand for food. Resumen Los cambios en la cobertura de bosque tienen efectos directos sobre la biodiversidad, el ciclo global del carbono, y el funcionamiento de los ecosistemas. Muchos estudios en la region de America Latina y el Caribe han documentado extensa deforestacion; sin embargo, existen estudios locales que reportan recuperacion del bosque. Ambas dinamicas, deforestacion y reforestacion, han sido relacionadas con cambios demograficos y socioeconomicos. Por ejemplo, dinamicas poblacionales, como la migracion rural urbana, pueden estimular la recuperacion del bosque, mientras que el aumento en la demanda mundial de alimentos puede promover la expansion agricola. Dado a que ningun estudio ha evaluado conjuntamente los procesos de deforestacion y reforestacion a escala municipal o regional, no existe un analisis sobre de la distribucion espacial de estos procesos. Hemos superado esta limitacion al producir, simultaneamente, mapas del cambio en las coberturas de vegetacion lenosa y usos del suelo entre 2001 y 2010 para cada uno de los 16,050municipios de America Latina. Se utilizo el analisis no parametrico de regresion Random Forest para determinar cuales de las variables demograficas o medioambientales explican la variacion del cambio en vegetacion lenosa. Los cambios mas significativos en la cobertura de vegetacion lenosa fueron causados por procesos de deforestacion (541,835km2), particularmente en los biomas de bosque humedo, bosque seco, y en las sabanas o matorrales de America del Sur. Igualmente, se registro un aumento en la cobertura de vegetacion lenosa (362,430km2), especialmente en zonas aridas o empinados poco favorables para la agricultura industrial.
   La deforestacion en los bosques humedos tiende a ocurrir en zonas de baja elevacion y de poca densidad poblacional, sin embargo, los cambios en vegetacion lenosa no estuvieron relacionados con cambios en poblacion a nivel de municipio. Estos resultados enfatizan la importancia de cuantificar la deforestacion y la reforestacion a multiples escalas espaciales y de vincular estos cambios con acontecimientos globales, como el incremento mundial en la demanda de alimentos.

TI  - Does the Presence of Shade Trees and Distance to the Forest Affect Detection Rates of Terrestrial Vertebrates in Coffee Home Gardens?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Complex agroforestry systems can host similar biodiversity levels to adjacent continuous forests and can offer important ecosystem services for wildlife. Species inhabiting adjacent forests, as well as species that prefer agroforestry systems, can benefit from this habitat matrix. It is necessary, however, to understand the species-specific adaptability to such a complex matrix. Indonesia is a biodiversity hotspot and hosts many endemic species that are threatened with extinction. Its human population relies heavily on agriculture, meaning that finding a balance between crop productivity and biodiversity is key for the long-term sustainability of local communities and wildlife. We aim to determine the influence of the presence of shade trees and distance to the forest on the detection rates of wildlife in coffee home gardens. In West Java, Indonesia, we monitored 23 gardens between April 2018 and March 2021 via camera traps, totalling 3856 days of monitoring in shade-grown and 3338 days in sun-exposed gardens. We also collected data in the nearby montane rainforest, totalling 1183 days of monitoring. We used Generalized Additive Models to estimate the influence of shade cover and distance to the forest on the detection rates of wildlife. The Sunda leopard cat Prionailurus javanensis was found more frequently in shade-grown gardens and used both the forest and agroforest matrix. Wild boars Sus scrofa mostly occurred in gardens adjacent to the forest, while barred buttonquails Turnix suscitator were associated with gardens far (>1 km) from the forest. Several species (civets Viverricula indica and Paradoxus musangus javanicus, Horsfield's treeshrew Tupaia javanica, Javan ferret badger Melogale orientalis, Javan mongoose Herpestes javanicus) were not influenced by shade cover and distance to the forest, suggesting they are well adapted to the agroforestry system. Still, species of high conservation importance, such as Javan leopard Panthera pardus melas, Sunda porcupine Hystrix javanica, and grizzled langur Presbytis comata, were present in the forest but not in the agroforest, suggesting that the replacement of the forest by the agroforestry matrix is still detrimental. Nevertheless, it is important to maintain the complexity of the agroforestry system and connectivity with the neighbouring continuous forest to favour the long-term sustainability of this environment and the conservation of endemic species.

TI  - The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions™ as a tool for enhancing the sustainable development of marine aquaculture
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB  - This paper applies the IUCN Global Standard for Nature based Solutions (TM) self-assessment tool (published in 2020) to two aquaculture case studies. Data from the case studies were compiled by the authors. In Zanzibar, secondary data were obtained through a previous project, which included a stakeholder workshop in Zanzibar (in 2019) and one deliverable published by the IUCN on Zanzibar of their catalogue "Aquaculture and Marine Conservation". In Indonesia, the original data were provided by the Blue Natural Capital Funding Facility (BNCFF) and the associated local teams. The analysis of the data, the information provided, and the scoring itself were done by the authors, in association with local teams in both areas. The results of the two assessments, discussed in the paper and presented in detail in the Supplementary materials, can be considered original research, never previously published in a scientific journal. The concept of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) was proposed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to protect, restore, and sustainably manage natural and modified ecosystems for achieving a variety of societal benefits. The IUCN released the IUCN Global Standard for NbS (TM) to help design, assess, strengthen, and upscale NbS interventions. In the current context of growing uncertainties for the future of coastlines and oceans, aquaculture has been recognized as a positive activity for achieving sustainable development in coastal communities; supporting food security, poverty alleviation, and economic resilience; and contributing to the conservation of marine ecosystems in some cases. However, the sustainability of aquaculture systems has often been criticized. Aquaculture initiatives in coastal areas can achieve both nature conservation and sustainable development objectives, but reflection on the conditions under which this would happen is needed. This article examines aquaculture systems through the lens of the NbS concept and the IUCN Global Standard for NbS (TM), along with other sustainability concepts and instruments currently used in the context of aquaculture. The application of the IUCN Global Standard for NbS (TM) 's to two case studies is explored: seaweed farming in Zanzibar in marine conservation areas and shrimp farming coupled with mangrove restoration in Indonesia. The results show that the NbS concept underpinning the IUCN Global Standard for NbS (TM) could help in the overall assessment of aquaculture systems and improve their sustainability by highlighting both their positive outcomes and issues requiring further examination in relation to marine biodiversity benefits, socio-economic development, and/or governance. The IUCN Global Standard for NbS (TM) could provide an operational framework to implement existing concepts, such as the Ecosystem Approach to Aquaculture, contribute to clarifying critical issues in aquaculture development, and provide guidance for the development of a new type of aquaculture project, specifically designed as NbS. This finding advocates the context-dependent exploration and promotion of aquaculture projects as NbS.

TI  - The birth of a new cropping system: towards sustainability in the subtropical lowland agriculture
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
AB  - Developing cropping systems that meet multiple demands of high production, resource-use efficiency and low ecological footprint is a major global challenge. In Southern Brazilian lowlands, irrigated rice (Otyza sativa L.) in combination with fallow for beef production is the dominant cropping system. This system is key to Brazilian food security but faces problems of resource use efficiency, soil preservation and greenhouse gas emissions typically associated to rice irrigation. In this research, a multi-criteria analysis of the usual rice-fallow system, and a number of alternative production Schemes - i.e., the more recent rice-soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) rotations and the newly developed systems based on large ridges, was made. The latter is based on the construction of large ridges (8 m width) on which rainfed maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean, conducted in no-tillage, are integrated with either beef-livestock production or cover crops in winter. This study was done in an experiment that lasted for nine years. The five cropping systems were managed as independent fields and a range of indicators related to crop management, productivity and sustainability was measured. The Rice-Fallow system required the lowest amount of energy, but it had the lowest energy use efficiency and highest carbon-based environmental footprints, when expressed as greenhouse gasses emitted per kg of food produced. The rice soybean rotation system presented an improved performance for the carbon-based footprints in comparison to the rice-fallow system. Within rice-soybean rotation, using minimum-tillage instead conventional tillage increased the overall carbon balance and the carbon sequestered into the soil as organic matter. Most strikingly, the new ridge-based systems exhibited the most favourable values for many of the indicators. The more diverse rotation system, and particularly the extension of the growing season to winter, resulted in improvements in soil quality, biomass production and carbon sequestration into the soil. Water- and light- use efficiency were increased, whereas greenhouse gas emissions reduced. The ridge-based crop-livestock integration offered the best balance between food production and environmental preservation. This cropping system is potentially one of best alternatives to increase agricultural diversification and sustainability in the sub-tropical lowlands such as in southern Brazil. This shows that modifications of cropping systems can result in major simultaneous improvements in yield, resource-use efficiency and ecological sustainability.

TI  - Influence of intensive cropping of vegetables on physical and hydraulic properties and functions of an Oxisol in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - CATENA
AB  - The intensification of agricultural systems (e.g., vegetable production) to supply the food demand of the world's population has increased over the last decades. In Brazil, the largest area of vegetable cropping systems is located in the Oxisols within the Cerrado biome. These areas are characterized by intensive land use and large-scale mechanized agriculture, which may affect the soil physical quality over time. This study aims to understand the effects of vegetable cropping (VG) systems on physical-hydric properties of highly weathered Oxisols. To this end, soil physical properties were assessed in representative VG systems of different ages [15 (VG15), 20 (VG20), and 30 (VG30) years old] and in a native Cerrado vegetation (CV), which was used as a reference of an intact system. Several analyses were conducted, including soil water retention curve, soil bulk density (p), soil penetration resistance (PR), saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), disaggregation index, and structural stability index. In addition, a soil physical quality index (SPQI) was developed to assess the effects of soil management on soil functions and ecosystem services in the VG systems evaluated. It was observed that VG systems promoted soil compaction as indicated by the increase in p and PR values compared to the CV. This resulted in changes in soil porosity with mesopores being the most affected. The changes in soil porosity reduced Ksat and field capacity, and increased the permanent wilting point, leading to a reduction in available water capacity. The SPQI was reduced by 34, 32, and 43% in VG15, VG20, and VG30, respectively, compared to the CV (0.89). Based on our SPQI, support of root development and resistance to erosion and degradation were the soil functions most affected, regardless of the VG system age. Our results indicate the need to improve the current management used in VG systems to mitigate soil compaction and improve soil physical quality of Oxisols under these systems in the Brazilian Cerrado. This is essential to restore soil functionality and to ensure the sustainable food production of these systems in the long term.

TI  - Climate change and land use from Brazilian cow-calf production amidst diverse levels of biodiversity conservation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Pasture-based animal production is a determinant in shaping biomes worldwide, with historical and cultural effects. It affects land use, landscapes, ecosystem conservation, and climate change. Converting forages into high-value-food livestock production evolved as essential for human nutrition and health, economics, and poverty reduction. A better understanding of the interactions of livestock with the environment to fundament alternatives to mitigate impacts of beef production comes up against the scarcity of studies on the environmental impact of livestock systems that include estimates of biodiversity and the availability of specific indicators. In this work, we provide elements to support the proposition of sustainable practices, looking at cow-calf production in different Brazilian biomes to estimate their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land use (LU) amidst diverse levels of biodiversity conservation. GHG emissions and LU were analyzed using the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. We express the level of biodiversity conservation as average scores (1 = low conservation to 5 = high conser-vation) of four indicators: native vegetation, monocultures, soil organic carbon, and endangered fauna and flora species in each biome. Respectively in the Amazon, Cerrado, Pampa, and Pantanal, GHG emissions were 7.14, 6.54, 9.10, and 13.49 kg of CO2 equivalent *kg of live weight gain (LWG)(-1), the LU was 89.30, 87.94, 158.84, and 307.24 m(2)y *kg LWG(-1), and the mean biodiversity scores were 4.5, 3.0, 3.5, and 4.3. These results demonstrate that the proposed indicators were able to show differences in biodiversity between the studied systems consistent with current scientific knowledge. This information contributes to the definition of different production priorities according to the peculiarities and current levels of biodiversity conservation in each biome. Holistic management and different pasture improvement strategies have been suggested to increase production, decrease environmental impacts, and regenerate ecosystems. Thus, new opportunities arise to mitigate impacts without generating other problems, increase income, improve the quality of life, and preserve sensitive areas that make up the diversity of Brazilian biomes.

TI  - A hybrid optimization-agent-based model of REDD plus payments to households on an old deforestation frontier in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
AB  - REDD+ was initially conceived of as a multi-level carbon-based payment for environmental services (PES). It is still often assumed to be a cost-effective climate change mitigation strategy, but this assumption is mostly based on theoretical studies and static opportunity cost calculations. We used spatial and socioeconomic datasets from an Amazonian deforestation frontier in Brazil to construct a simulation model of REDD + payments to households that can be used to assess REDD + interventions. Our SimREDD + model consists of dynamic optimization and land-use/cover change allocation sub-models built into an agent-based model platform. The model assumes that households maximize profit under perfect market conditions and calculates the optimal household land-use/cover configuration at equilibrium under a given REDD + PES scenario. These scenarios include PES based on (1) forest area and (2) carbon stocks. Insights gained from simulations under different conditions can assist in the design of more effective, efficient, and equitable REDD + programs. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Biodiversity, threats and conservation challenges in the Cerrado of Amapa, an Amazonian savanna
T2  - NATURE CONSERVATION-BULGARIA
AB  - An Amazonian savanna in northern Brazil known as the Cerrado of Amapa is under imminent threat from poor land-use planning, the expansion of large-scale agriculture and other anthropogenic pressures. These savannas house a rich and unique flora and fauna, including endemic plants and animals. However, the area remains under-sampled for most taxa, and better sampling may uncover new species. We estimate that only similar to 9.16% of these habitats have any kind of protection, and legislative changes threaten to further weaken or remove this protection. Here we present the status of knowledge concerning the biodiversity of the Cerrado of Amapa, its conservation status, and the main threats to the conservation of this Amazonian savanna. To secure the future of these unique and imperilled habitats, we suggest urgent expansion of protected areas, as well as measures that would promote less-damaging land uses to support the local population.

TI  - Can our current knowledge and practice allow ecological restoration in the Cerrado?
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
AB  - Ecological knowledge plays a significant role in ensuring efficient ecological restoration. We conducted a systematic review to assess if sufficient ecological knowledge has been accumulated to aid restoration practices for the Cerrado, a Brazilian biome dominated by savanna ecosystems and threatened by anthropogenic disturbances. Most Cerrado restoration studies were performed by few research groups and focused primarily on two vegetation types: cerrado sensu stricto (typical savanna) and riparian forest. We also found that defining reference ecosystems and selecting plant species for restoration programs is neglected, mostly disregarding their original occurrence and proportion of plant growth forms. Furthermore, studies lacked standardized and systematic evaluation of restoration outcomes. Hence, we argue that current ecological knowledge is insufficient to guarantee the success of large-scale ecological restoration of the Cerrado. We strengthen the need to explicitly define the reference ecosystem for each Cerrado ecosystem and use its structure and composition as guidance for ecological restoration research, which should be based on a scientific approach. We encourage investigations into ecological dynamics and natural regeneration of the different vegetation types of the Cerrado and highlight the importance of integrating such knowledge with environmental laws, societal engagement and cost-effective techniques to advance Cerrado ecological restoration.

TI  - Contrasting Effects of Chronic Anthropogenic Disturbance on Activity and Species Richness of Insectivorous Bats in Neotropical Dry Forest
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - For prioritizing conservation actions, it is vital to understand how ecologically diverse species respond to environmental change caused by human activity. This is particularly necessary considering that chronic human disturbance is a threat to biodiversity worldwide. Depending on how species tolerate and adapt to such disturbance, ecological integrity and ecosystem services will be more or less affected. Bats are a species-rich and functionally diverse group, with important roles in ecosystems, and are therefore recognized as a good model group for assessing the impact of environmental change. Their populations have decreased in several regions, especially in the tropics, and are threatened by increasing human disturbance. Using passive acoustic monitoring, we assessed how the species-rich aerial insectivorous bats-essential for insect suppression services-respond to chronic human disturbance in the Caatinga dry forests of Brazil, an area potentially harboring ca. 100 bat species (nearly 50% are insectivorous), but with > 60% its area composed of anthropogenic ecosystems under chronic pressure. Acoustic data for bat activity was collected at research sites with varying amounts of chronic human disturbance (e.g., livestock grazing and firewood gathering). The intensity of the disturbance is indicated by the global multi-metric CAD index (GMDI). Using Animal Sound Identifier (ASI) software, we identified 18 different bat taxon units. Using Hierarchical Modeling of Species Communities (HMSC), we found trends in the association of the disturbance gradient with species richness and bat activity: species richness was higher at sites with higher human disturbance, whereas bat activity decreased with increasing human disturbance. Additionally, we observed taxon-specific responses to human disturbance. We conclude that the effects of chronic anthropogenic disturbance on the insectivorous bat fauna in the Caatinga are not homogeneous and a species-specific approach is necessary when assessing the responses of local bats to human disturbances in tropical dry forests, and in other biomes under human pressure.

TI  - Analysis of results of biomass forest inventory in northeastern Amazon for development of REDD plus carbon project
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
AB  - In Brazil, a significant reduction in deforestation rates occurred during the last decade. In spite of that fact, the average annual rates are still too high, approximately 400.000 ha/year (INPE/Prodes). The projects of emissions reduction through avoided deforestation (REED+) are an important tool to reduce deforestation rates in Brazil. Understanding the amazon forest structure, in terms of biomass stock is key to design avoided deforestation strategies. In this work, we analyze data results from aboveground biomass of 1,019.346,27 hectares in the state of Para. It was collected data from 16,722 trees in 83 random independent plots. It was tested 4 allometric equations, for DBH > 10cm: Brown et al. (1989), Brown and Lugo (1999), Chambers et al. (2000), Higuchi et al. (1998). It revealed that the biggest carbon stock of above ground biomass is stocked on the interval at DBH between 30cm and 80cm. This biomass compartment stocks 75.70% of total biomass in Higuchi et al. (1998) equation, 75.56% of total biomass in Brown et al. (1989) equation, 78.83% of total biomass in Chambers et al. (2000) equation, and 73.22% in Brown and Lugo (1999) equation.

TI  - Heavy metals in hair of small mammals from the cacao agroforestry and Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - The current growing demand for resources, food production, and agricultural crops leads to a drastic reduction in biodiversity and ecosystem services. One of the options to mitigate the recurring effects of land use changes is the adoption of wildlife-friendly systems, such as cacao agroforestry systems, which integrates production with biodiversity conservation. Cacao management involves the frequent use of pesticides, such pesticides are comprised of heavy metals that are considered non-point sources of pollution. Animal hair is considered an excellent cumulative bioindicator of contamination. Small mammals are known as bioindicators of pollution, as they provide a warning of adverse effects on ecosystems. The main objective was to determine the concentrations of six heavy metals (Pb, Ni, Cr, Cd, Mn, and Cu) in hair of small mammals in traditional cacao agroforests and Atlantic Forest fragments in the southern region of Bahia, Brazil. The study covered 12 traditional cacao agroforests and 12 Atlantic Forest fragments. A total of 34 small mammals were captured in the traditional cacao agroforests, representing 12 species, while 18 were captured in the Atlantic Forest fragments, representing 6 species. We found that small mammals in both habitats had similar levels of lead in their hair. Heavy metals concentrations in the hair of small mammals were higher in individuals from traditional cacao agroforests than the Atlantic Forest fragments (Cacao agroforest (mg/Kg): Pb - 26.42 & PLUSMN; 16.42; Ni - 5.31 & PLUSMN; 4.3; Mn 1.64 & PLUSMN; 2.63; Cu - 1.13 & PLUSMN; 1.15; Cd - 1.42; Atlantic Forest (mg/Kg): Pb - 19.28 & PLUSMN; 14.46; Ni - 0.18; Mn - 0.34 & PLUSMN; 0.40; Cu - 1 & PLUSMN; 2.05). Marsupials exhibited higher lead concentrations compared to rodents (Didelphimorphia (mg/Kg): Pb - 28.66 & PLUSMN; 18.73; Rodentia (mg/Kg): Pb - 18.44 & PLUSMN; 9.85), likely due to their distinct eating habits and habitat use. Body condition of the small mammals did not differ between the two habitat types, and there was no relationship between the bioaccumulation of heavy metals in small mammals and body condition. This is the first study to evaluate heavy metal contamination in small mammals in traditional cacao agroforests and Atlantic Forest fragments, thus providing important data that indicate the presence of heavy metals in the hair of the small mammals sampled, and consequently, the presence of these heavy metals in the environment where these small mammals lived.

TI  - Avoidance of tree-site mismatching of modelled cacao production systems across climatic zones: Roots for multifunctionality
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - CONTEXT: Protective roles of shade trees for climate-resilient cacao appear to depend on tree-site matching. Agroforestry practices involve a wide range of context-specific management options, which can be complex and pose challenges due to tradeoffs. OBJECTIVE: To assess the benefits and drawbacks, across a range of contexts, of various cacao-based land use systems on multifunctionality and economic performance. METHODS: We used the process-based Water, Nutrient and Light Capture in agroforestry systems (WaNuLCAS) model to assess the performance of five cacao-based land use systems (cacao monoculture, cacao + annual crops, cacao + fruit tree, cacao + fast-growing tree, and cacao + slow-growing tree), in three climate regimes (tropical rainforest, monsoon, and savannah), two soil textures, and two sources of data for cacao root length density (W Africa and Indonesia, respectively). Several metrics quantified the performance of each land use system, including the Land Equivalent Ratio for production (LERP),multifunctionality (LERM), Net Present Value (NPV), Return to Labour (RtL), and Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Simulated cacao production per tree, positively or negatively influenced by intercrops, responded to the number of days cacao grew under water-limited conditions. High cacao root density supported higher LERP values (an average of 1.15 versus 0.95 in other cases). In the savanna, the LERP difference between cacao with high root density and those with low root density became 0.27. Among agroforestry systems, cacao + annual crops had the highest LERP of 1.13, followed by cacao + slow-growing trees (1.09), while the lowest outcome (0.98) was for cacao + fruit trees. These values were higher in rainforest climates, and lowest for savanna. Soil texture had no effect on the average LERP across other main factors. Tree-based agroforestry had a higher time-averaged carbon stock than monocultures or systems with annual crops. However, their effects on other environmental performance aspects, averaged over a 20-year life cycle, were modest, and variation in LERM was small. Economic performance indicators diverged, with the highest NPV were for cacao + annual crops or cacao + fruit trees, the highest BCR was for cacao + fruit trees, and the highest RtL was for cacao + fruit trees followed by cacao + slow-growing trees. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study highlights that the potential benefits of cacao-based agroforestry practices depend on strong root development by the cacao trees. In selecting for high yields in monocultures, the benefits of intercropping may be forfeited, especially in drier climates with the lower values for root length density measured in W Africa.

TI  - Effects of forest regeneration on landscape connectivity in the state of Rondônia, Amazon, Brazil
T2  - NATIVA
AB  - The maintenance of biodiversity in forest environments depends on landscape connectivity; this linkage between forest habitats is directly affected by deforestation. Forest restoration can facilitate the movement of individuals between forest habitats. Thus, through connectivity indices, this study aimed to evaluate the contribution of increased forest regeneration areas to landscape connectivity in the state of Rondonia. Landsat images were utilized for this analysis. The Random Forest algorithm conducted soil classification on the Google Earth Engine platform. Landscape connectivity metrics were calculated, including the Equivalent Connected Area Index (ECA) and the Connectivity Probability Difference (dPC), both computed with GuidosToolbox software. The results revealed that the state of Rondonia showed no significant disparities with the increase in forest regeneration areas in either landscape connectivity metric. The most notable outcome was the heightened importance of connectivity for large nodes and large -sized fragments with the addition of regeneration areas. Therefore, it was concluded that forest regeneration areas contributed to improving connectivity indicators, albeit not notably.

TI  - The role of forest plantations for the native vegetation conservation in the protected areas surroundings
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
AB  - Protected areas are essential for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, the conservation of these areas depends on the management of their surroundings to promote landscape connectivity. In agricultural landscapes, the preservation of native vegetation in rural properties is one of the main strategies to promote the connectivity of the protected area. Forest certifications that require compliance with environmental laws can work as an important instrument to maintain native vegetation in forest plantation areas. In Brazil, most commercial plantations consist of exotic species, predominantly eucalyptus, pine, and teak. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the land-use/land-cover (LULC) and the landscape connectivity changes in the surrounding area of a protected area between 1986 and 2019 and understand if commercial forest plantations have contributed to maintaining native vegetation on private lands. For this, we evaluated LULC in 1986, 2008 and 2019, focusing on the application of the so-called New Forest Act (NFA). We compared LULC change with agricultural land suitability to check for trends. The landscape connectivity and the importance of the surrounding native vegetation fragments were verified based on the Graph Theory. Property boundaries were extracted from a land tenure model based on the Rural Environmental Registry. To verify the perception of landowners and planted forest industries, we sent a questionnaire with open and closed questions. Our results showed that pasture was the main LULC in the area but has decreased giving space to native vegetation regeneration and mostly to forest plantation and soybean expansion. Pasture with lower agricultural suitability is converted to forest plantation and native vegetation, while pasture with higher agricultural suitability becomes soybean crops. At the rural property level, forest plantations presented the largest area and the largest native vegetation cover compared to other agricultural sectors but still presented a significant riparian vegetation deficit, according to the NFA. Forest fragmentation has increased over the years, even with the increase in native vegetation in 2019 compared to 2008. Regarding the landowner's perception, farmers and industries have demonstrated knowledge and intent to comply with the NFA, but most do not know the Capa similar to o Bonito Nacional Forest (CBNF). Our results show that forest plantations have an important role in protecting native vegetation in the protected area surroundings, and the forest certification helps environmental legislation compliance. However, the conservation strategies between landowners, planted forest industries, and the protected area must be improved, mainly the Permanent Preservation Area deficits (riparian zones) inherited from pastures and which were converted into forest plantations. Furthermore, strategies to engage the local population in conserving the protected area, such as through agroforestry systems promotion, are fundamental.

TI  - Protected area types, strategies and impacts in Brazil's Amazon: public protected area strategies do not yield a consistent ranking of protected area types by impact
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - The leading policy to conserve forest is protected areas (PAs). Yet, PAs are not a single tool: land users and uses vary by PA type; and public PA strategies vary in the extent of each type and in the determinants of impact for each type, i.e. siting and internal deforestation. Further, across regions and time, strategies respond to pressures (deforestation and political). We estimate deforestation impacts of PA types for a critical frontier, the Brazilian Amazon. We separate regions and time periods that differ in their deforestation and political pressures and document considerable variation in PA strategies across regions, time periods and types. The siting of PAs varies across regions. For example, all else being equal, PAs in the arc of deforestation are relatively far from non-forest, while in other states they are relatively near. Internal deforestation varies across time periods, e.g. it is more similar across the PA types for PAs after 2000. By contrast, after 2000, PA extent is less similar across PA types with little non-indigenous area created inside the arc. PA strategies generate a range of impacts for PA types-always far higher within the arc-but not a consistent ranking of PA types by impact.

TI  - Applied nucleation under high biodiversity silvopastoral system as an adaptive strategy against microclimate extremes in pasture areas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
AB  - This study aimed to assess the influence of the high biodiversity silvopastoral system (SPSnu) on the microclimate, pasture production, and pasture chemical composition. Microclimate variables and pasture production and chemical composition were measured in pared paddocks under SPSnu and treeless pasture (TLP) in a commercial farm during four seasons in Southern Brazil. SPSnu measurements were subdivided into two areas: around the nuclei (AN) and area inter-nuclei (IN). In the TLP paddocks, we plotted fictitious nuclei with the same areas and distributions of SPSnu, however without trees. For the microclimate measurements, these areas were noted when shaded or unshaded by the nuclei trees. In each season, the microclimate variables air temperature (AT, degrees C), relative humidity (RH, %), illuminance (Ilu, lux), wind speed (WS, m/s), and soil surface temperature (SST, degrees C) were measured. In addition, botanical composition (%), pasture production (kg/DM/ ha), and pasture chemical composition were evaluated. The SPSnu provided the lowest values of microclimate variables in all seasons (p < 0.05), except for the relative humidity. Winter had the highest thermal amplitude in the systems. The highest difference between SPSnu and TLP for AT (4.3 degrees C) and SST (5.2 degrees C) was measured during the hot seasons (spring and summer). In contrast, during cold seasons (autumn and winter) it observed highest thermal amplitude between SPSnu and TLP. Overall, the highest annual pasture production was observed in the SPSnu (p < 0.05). During the summer, the SPSnu areas showed the highest values of crude protein and dry matter (p < 0.05). During the winter, the TLP showed the lowest values (p < 0.05) of pasture production and dry matter. It was observed that SPSnu improved the microclimate at the pasture level, influencing pasture production and pasture chemical composition. The enhanced microclimate can partially mitigate some of the effects of climate change on pastoral agroecosystems, creating conditions for ecological rehabilitation of ecosystem processes and services. These conditions could be amplified to a biome level through a payment for ecosystem services program.

TI  - Stakeholders' incentives for land-use change and REDD plus : The case of Indonesia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - The opportunity costs of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) accruing to different stakeholders in Indonesia, including companies and the national, provincial and district level governments, are estimated, with particular emphasis on the influence of alternative discount rates. A cost-benefit analysis of the opportunity costs of avoided deforestation is conducted. The three major land-use activities considered are commercial logging, timber and oil palm plantation. The opportunity cost of oil palm plantations on mineral soil preceded by logging of degraded forest is prohibitively high. REDD+ measures that impose restrictions on the development of those land-use activities would lead to a substantial loss of public revenues at the various government levels. The results of this study reveal that land-use management in Indonesia is rather centralistic, where the national government retains most of the revenues from land-use alternatives to REDD+. To influence their behaviour towards land-use change, REDD+ schemes need to create a direct link between the distribution of public revenues and district governments' decisions on land-use activities in their localities.

TI  - Agroforestry Species Selection for Forest Rehabilitation in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Meta-Analysis on High-Level Taxonomy
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Agroforestry is important for forest management and rehabilitation in the southeast Asia-Pacific Region (APR), where economic issues, intensive land use, deforestation, and forest degradation are common. Species selection is a key process in establishing agroforestry systems. In this study, we reviewed the agroforestry literature across eight economies within the southeast APR, documented the species used, and compared the existing systems to better understand the challenges and opportunities for the region's agroforestry expansion. We conducted rule and Maptree analyses using 108 species, belonging to 95 genera and 49 families of plants, to unravel the various agroforestry practices in this region. We identified the most common plant families used in agroforestry combinations within each economy. We then divided the economies into three groups based on the most commonly used genera: (1) Thailand, Vietnam, Papua New Guinea and Fiji (Hevea, Oryza, Eucalyptus, Acacia, and Zea); (2) Nepal and Yunnan China (Zea, Leucaena, Morus, and Hevea); and (3) Indonesia and the Philippines (Oryza, Hevea, Zea, and Brassica). Although this study focused on high-level taxonomic classification (family and genus), we believe that this work will fill the current knowledge gaps, offering guidance to economies in the southeast APR regarding species selection and the adoption of sustainable agroforestry practices.

TI  - Drivers of biomass stocks and productivity of tropical secondary forests
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Young tropical secondary forests play an important role in the local and global carbon cycles because of their large area and rapid biomass accumulation rates. This study examines how environmental conditions and forest attributes shape biomass compartments and the productivity of young tropical secondary forests. We compared 36 young secondary forest stands that differed in the time since agricultural land abandonment (2.3-3.6 years) from dry and wet regions in Ghana. We quantified biomass stocks in living and dead stems, roots, and soil, and aboveground biomass and litter productivity. We used structural equation models to evaluate how macroclimate, soil nutrients (N, P), and forest attributes (structure, diversity, and functional composition) affect ecosystem functioning. After three years of succession, tropical wet forests stored on average 115 t biomass ha-1 (the sum of aboveground living and dead biomass, belowground fine root biomass, and soil organic matter), and dry forests stored 99 t ha-1. These values represent 31% (in the wet forest) and 39% (in the dry forest) of the biomass compared with neighboring old-growth forests. The majority of forest ecosystem biomass was stored in the soil (70%) and aboveground living vegetation (25%). Macroclimate strongly shaped forest attributes, which in turn determined biomass stocks and productivity. Soil phosphorus strongly increased litter production and soil organic matter, confirming that it is a limiting element in tropical ecosystems. Tree density and species diversity increased forest biomass stocks, suggesting crown packing and complementary resource use enhance forest functioning. A more conservative trait composition (high wood density) increased biomass stocks but reduced productivity, indicating that quantity, identity, and quality of species affect ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Identification of beef production farms in the Pampas and Campos area that stand out in economic and environmental performance
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Worldwide, native grasslands are being converted to non-native pastures and cropland. This process threatens local grassland biomes as well as the livelihoods of farm families that utilize these grasslands.
   In the Rio de la Plata grasslands region meat production and multispecies native grasslands have coexisted for more than 400 years. Low levels of meat productivity and farm income, however, trigger replacement of native grasslands by crops and leys and threaten the survival of local beef farming systems. We studied the economic and environmental performance of beef farming in the region based on interviews and field measurements on 280 case study farms with the following aims: (a) to identify the multi-functional economic and environmental performance of beef farms across the Rio de la Plata grasslands biome; (b) to identify farms with 'outstanding' multi-functional performance; (c) to compare performance levels with those found in other regions; and (d) to discuss the implications of the outstanding farms for the development of new systems of meat production. The representativeness of the case study farms was ascertained by comparing them with a farm typology constructed from survey data of 15,448 beef farms situated predominantly on native grasslands in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. We identified seven farm types on the basis of farm size, labour, farm specialization, land use and stocking rate.
   We identified positive deviant farms based on Pareto-ranking and compared these with a classification based on threshold values provided by experts. Out of the 280 farms, 41 were ranked as Pareto-optimal, i.e. out-performed other farms in one or more indicators without being outperformed in other indicators. Out of these, 5 were positive deviants, achieving on average 192 kg LW ha(-1) yr(-1) of livestock productivity and 201 US$ ha(-1) year(-1) farm income, having most favourable values for fossil energy consumption, phosphorus balance, carbon footprint and having over 95% of their land under native grassland as a proxy for biodiversity conservation value. Four of these farms belonged to farm types that together represented 55% of the population, suggesting scope for widescale improvement.
   Compared to the values reported for the OECD countries the beef farming systems of the Rio de la Plata grasslands region consume less energy and positive deviant farms demonstrated approximately average livestock productivity and carbon footprint. Increasing livestock productivity in the Rio de la Plata grasslands region resulted in a stronger decline of the carbon footprint without compromising the current negligible levels of fossil fuel energy use. Further elucidation of management practices that lead to positive deviant performance will require modelling of the interaction of pasture and herd dynamics at farm level and is needed to support targeted policy support for sustainable natural grassland-based beef production in the region.

TI  - Fire-sensitive and threatened plants in the Upper Paraguay River Basin, Brazil: Identifying priority areas for Integrated Fire Management and ecological restoration
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Extreme wildfires present an ever-increasing problem in different landscapes around the world. Here, we explore recent wildfires to prioritize recovery efforts and mitigate effects of future wildfires in the Pantanal, the largest continuous wetland in the world. Using ecological niche modeling (ENM), we categorize affected areas based on potential levels of degradation by fire and the predicted suitability for threatened and fire-sensitive plants. Based on this information, we identify key areas for fire prevention. Under land cover change scenarios predicted for 2050, approximately 25 % of the land cover under future threat will have potentially high biomass accumulation. We identified 1272 km(2) in priority areas with forest formation, with restoration cost of at least US$ 576,189. This case study provides an analysis workflow that can be used to assess other wildfire-threatened parts of the world. These results can inform public policy to establish new fire brigades, conservation efforts using Integrated Fire Management, and restoration areas to mitigate biodiversity loss.

TI  - Secondary forest growth deviation from chronosequence predictions in central Amazonia
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Nearly all published rates of secondary forest (SF) regrowth for Amazonia are inferred from chronosequences. We examined SF regrowth on abandoned pastures over a 4-year period to determine if measured rates of forest recovery differ from chronosequence predictions. We studied the emergence, development and death of over 1300 stems in 10 SFs representing three age classes (< 1-5, 6-10 and 11-14 years old). Mean tree biomass accumulation in both the < 1-5 and 6-10 years old (4.4 and 5.7 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively) abandoned pastures was lower than predicted and deviated significantly (57% and 41%) from rates estimated from the chronosequence. The older SFs, with a mean growth rate of 9.9 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) followed the rate predicted by the chronosequence. Understocking was the primary cause of low biomass recovery rates in the youngest forests; although the youngest stands had a diameter at breast height increment three times the oldest stands, the youngest stands lacked sufficient density to cumulatively produce high biomass accumulation rates. Four years of measurement indicated that the youngest stands had developed 59% of the stems measured in the older stands during the same time period. The 6-10-year-old stands were rapidly self-thinning and approached stem density values measured in the same aged stands at the onset of the study. Mortality was high for all stands, with 54% of the original stems remaining after 4 years in intermediate-aged stands. The forests were dominated by the tree Vismia, which represented 55-66% of the biomass in all stands. The Vismia share of the biomass was decreasing over time, with other genera replacing the pioneer. Our measured rates of regrowth indicate that generalized estimates of forest regrowth through chronosequence studies will overestimate forest regrowth for the youngest forests that were under land use for longer time-periods before abandonment. Certified Emission Reductions under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto protocol should consider these results when predicting and compensating for carbon sequestered under natural forest management.

TI  - Open ecosystems restoration: a global review shows biases and mismatches between theory and practice
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Ecological restoration aims to recover the structure, biodiversity, and function of degraded ecosystems. However, open ecosystems have been largely overlooked in restoration, and the extent of theory-based restoration is unclear. We systematically review papers on open ecosystems restoration from 2011 to 2021, examining publication trends with data on restored site age, size, indicators, and assessment frequency. We also explore the relationships between interventions, indicators, and ecological concepts. By analyzing 343 papers, we found that open ecosystems restoration is concentrated in North America and Europe, with nearly 75% of restored areas originating in these continents. Restored areas are small, assessed for a short duration, with a plethora of indicators and no establishment of clear control or reference areas for meaningful comparisons. Common open ecosystems restoration sites interventions involved trees and shrubs management, soil management, seeding, and transfer of plant material as the main interventions. From our analyzed papers, we found that 30% of them mentioned any ecological concepts, with community assembly and succession being the most mentioned ones. Furthermore, our exploratory analysis revealed no relationship between interventions, indicators, and ecological concepts, suggesting a widespread mismatch between theory and practice. As the Decade for Ecosystem Restoration unfolds, we call practitioners, researchers, and stakeholders working on open ecosystems to address challenges and curtail widespread biases. Despite the uniqueness of each restoration project, a clear, well-planned design encompassing site-specific variables and solid theoretical bases is expected to enhance restoration outcomes, optimizing costs and biodiversity gains.

TI  - Practical critique: Bridging the gap between critical and practice-oriented REDD plus research communities
T2  - ASIA PACIFIC VIEWPOINT
AB  - Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) is an ambitious global programme oriented towards improving forest carbon management. It aims to attract new sources of green' capital to fund emissions reductions from avoided deforestation and sustainable forest management. REDD+ is transforming forest conservation, as a diverse array of new stakeholders become involved. Not surprisingly, REDD+ has proved divisive, as critics concern themselves with issues of power, justice, and commodification, while practice-oriented researchers tackle similar issues from different perspectives, focusing on benefit sharing, safeguards, additionality, measuring and verification. In this paper we explore the different roles of critical and practical research, and argue that there is a need for greater sharing of knowledge across current divides. We draw on our own experiences of conducting a research project on REDD+ in Indonesia that involved critical and practice-oriented researchers. We argue that critical research disconnected from practical matters can have perverse outcomes for practitioners who are ultimately working towards similar goals; while uncritical practice-oriented research has the potential to lead to a dilution of core values of environmental justice and conservation. In contrast, forms of practical critique provide ways of researching REDD+ that have practical value while maintaining critical insights.

TI  - Titled Amazon Indigenous Communities Cut Forest Carbon Emissions
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Indigenous communities (ICs) have emerged as important players in global efforts to reduce forest carbon emissions, in part because they are viewed as conscientious stewards of the forest lands to which they have legal title. Yet ICs tend to be located in remote areas where deforestation would be limited regardless of who manages them. Therefore, to determine whether IC management actually cuts forest carbon emissions, it is important to control for such confounding factors. To that end, we use propensity score matching and regression to analyze the effects on 2001-2013 deforestation and forest carbon emissions of IC management in the Amazon regions of Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador and Colombia. We find that IC management reduces both deforestation and forest carbon emissions in Bolivia, Brazil and Colombia. We are not able to discern a statistically significant effect in Ecuador. These findings suggest that IC management can, in fact, help combat climate change.

TI  - Developing a nationally appropriate mitigation measure from the greenhouse gas GHG abatement potential from livestock production in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Brazil is one of the first major developing countries to commit to a national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions target that requires a reduction of between 36.1% and 38.9% relative to baseline emissions by 2020. The country intends to submit agricultural emissions reductions as part of this target, with livestock production identified as offering significant abatement potential. Focusing on the Cerrado core (central Brazilian savannah), this paper investigates the cost-effectiveness of this potential, Which involves some consideration of both the private and social costs and benefits (e.g. including avoided deforestation) arising from specific mitigation measures that may form part of Brazil's definition of Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Measures (NAMAs). The analysis used an optimisation model to define abatement costs. A baseline projection suggests that beef production in the region will emit 2.6 Gt CO(2)e (CO2 equivalent) from 2010 to 2030, corresponding to 9% of national emissions (including energy, transport, waste, livestock and agriculture). By implementing negative-cost measures identified in a marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) by 2030, the 2.6 Gt CO(2)e could be reduced by around 24%. Pasture restoration, involving avoided deforestation, offers the largest contribution to these results. As the Brazilian Cerrado is seen as a model for transforming other global savannahs, the results offer a significant contribution by identifying alternatives for increasing productivity while minimizing national and global external costs.

TI  - Extending the baseline of tropical dry forest loss in Ghana (1984-2015) reveals drivers of major deforestation inside a protected area
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Tropical dry forests experience the highest deforestation rates on Earth, with major implications for the biodiversity of these ecosystems, as well as for its human occupants. Global remote sensing based forest cover data (2000 2012) point to the rapid loss of tropical dry forest in South America and Africa, also, if not foremost, inside formally protected areas. Here, we significantly extend the baseline of tropical dry forest loss inside a protected area in Ghana using a generalizable change detection technique. The forest cover change detection is based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from historical Landsat data (1984-2015). Field measurements were carried out in dry semi-deciduous forest and in the adjacent savanna and woodland. Estimates of the canopy area index and above ground woody biomass were related to NDVI derived from Landsat 8 data. The change detection indicated significant NDVI decrease in a large area initially covered by tropical dry forest, associated with deforestation. The peak in deforestation was found to have occurred between 1990 and 2002, hereafter, the conservation status of the area was improved. A combination of remote sensing data corroborated by secondary data sources provides evidence for the almost complete clearance of a tropical dry forest inside a strictly protected area, attributable to logging and land clearing for arable farming. The NDVI change detection also revealed NDVI increase in the adjacent woodlands from 2002 to 2015, demonstrating woody encroachment. Historical fire data from the MODIS burned area product indicate that the deforested area experienced a high frequency of anthropogenic burning since 2004, which may have caused further degradation and largely prevents forest regeneration. The results show the ongoing destruction of tropical ecosystems even within ostensibly protected areas and ask for the revision of protection and management strategies of such areas.

TI  - The role of government in operationalising markets for REDD plus in Indonesia
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - The global climate initiative Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD +) initially included carbon markets as one potential policy mechanism to finance a range of forestry projects in developing countries. Indonesia was an early leader on REDD +, and set up the regulatory frameworks and monitoring systems to support demonstration projects that could trade credits in voluntary carbon markets. This article applies a neoliberal govemmentality framework to evaluate the development of REDD + market institutions in Indonesia during the Readiness period between 2008 and 2013. It critiques the role of the state in this process, and how the authority of public agencies shapes the actions of private subjects. The case of Indonesia indicates a pivotal role for government agencies at multiple levels in integrating the operation of FtEDD + market activities within a supportive regime of forest and land management. Critical to this process was legislation to trade in forest carbon and obtain project licenses, devolved land-use planning and forest management that could support conunercial activities, and robust MRV surveillance systems to oversee on-ground activities. Despite these efforts, projects were often subject to an uncertain and highly contested forest management regime, undermining attempts to demonstrate the viability of operationalising market mechanisms at the local scale.

TI  - Land quality changes following the conversion of the natural vegetation into silvo-pastoral systems in semi-arid NE Brazil
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - The presence of trees in grasslands frequently results in resource islands of higher soil quality. Therefore, some native trees are often preserved or agroforestry species are interplanted when land is cleared for pasture. We evaluated soil quality changes associated with the conversion of a native thorn forest (caatinga) into silvo-pastoral systems in semiarid NE Brazil. Soil nutrients, organic matter, microbial biomass and soil enzymes under native caatinga, the canopy of two preserved native (Ziziphus joazeiro and Spondias tuberosa) and one introduced tree species (Prosopis juliflora), and under a planted pasture of Cenchrus ciliaris were compared. The two preserved tree species maintained high nutrient and organic matter contents and high biological activity levels not only relative to the grass but also relative to the native caatinga. The non-deciduous Z. joazeiro was more effective than the deciduous S. tuberosa, and enriched surface soils by 100 mg P kg(-1). The complete replacement of natural caatinga with C. ciliaris pasture or a C. ciliaris-P. juliflora silvopastoral system had, after 14 years, decreased microbial biomass C and N contents, and ss-glucosidase activity, but did not affect soil nutrient or organic matter status. The biological activity under the trees of the tree-grass association was greater than under grass alone, although P. juliflora did not maintain higher nutrient or organic matter levels. The search for indigenous alternatives to the main agroforestry species may provide viable alternatives for improved land management and the conservation of biodiversity. Microbiological and biochemical parameters responded more readily to changes in land management than chemical fertility indices. They are important indices for the impact of vegetation changes and its associated land quality changes.

TI  - Forest restoration in southern Amazonia: Soil preparation triggers natural regeneration
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Forest regeneration in abandoned pastures in Amazonia has been well studied, but active restoration o f non- resilient pastures has not. In this work, we evaluated large-scale active restoration of intensively used pastures in southern Amazonia, where the highest deforestation rates are observed. With the construction o f the Jirau Dam in the Madeira river (state o f Rondonia, Brazil), a 3000-ha forest buffer zone has been established. This area was previously covered by African pasture grasses for cattle ranching. Eight mixed-species planting sites with variable grass management and ranging from 6 to 60 months post-planting were measured three times over 2.5 years. We also tested a gradient o f restoration intensity in an experimental planting: (i) no intervention (control), (ii) harrowing and herbicides to control grasses, and (iii) harrowing and herbicides plus tree planting. Our goals were to understand the initial trajectory o f actively restored sites, the role of harrowing and herbicide application in triggering natural regeneration, and the role of seedling planting on the initial vegetation structure. All tree species >= 30 cm in height were sampled in five circular 10-m-radius plots per site. Plant cover was also monitored using the step-point method. At 18 months, stem density ranged from 2500 to 14,490 ind ha(-1), demonstrating that density increased suddenly in most sites through colonization, although this was highly variable. Tree cover reached 81% in five years, virtually eliminating grass cover after 36 months. Recruits contributed more to basal area than planted seedlings. Although 17 species, on average, were planted in restoration sites, the number of species at the sites steadily increased over time, at a rate of 7 species yr(-1) per 1570 m(2). Cecropia spp. and Trema micrantha recruits had the highest stem densities and basal areas. Harrowing and grass control were enough to trigger succession in sites where natural regeneration was not taking place, shifting these sites to the highly resilient route o f early secondary forest succession in the Amazon. Future restoration efforts should use a combination o f methods, first evaluating the potential for natural regeneration and then gradually eliminating barriers.

TI  - Growth and survival of potential tree species for carbon-offset in degraded areas from southeast Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Brazil must restore 12 million hectares of degraded areas by 2030 to meet its goal of the Paris Global Climate Agreement (PGCA). In view of this, the development of mixed planting projects related to carbon-offset in degraded areas is increasing, which demonstrates environmental and social responsibility of corporate and governmental organizations. Despite the great potential of mixed restoration plantations to mitigate climate change, Brazil must overcome major challenges in achieving the ratified goals of the PGCA as well as the effectiveness of its carbon-offset projects. In this context, this study has focused on the evaluation of the growth and survival of tree species in a carbon-offset plantation from a degraded area in southeastern Brazil. Five-hundred-and-nine seedlings (15 forest species) were planted in a completely randomized design. Diameter at the soil level and height of individuals were measured at 40 months. Three individuals of each species were selected and was scaling by a non-destructive method. Timber volume was estimated from the sum of the volume of the sections of the individuals, obtained by the Smalian formula. The average annual carbon increment of the individuals was estimated by the equation adjusted from the Schumacher & Hall model. The potential of carbon-offset of the tested plants was evaluated from the SP and mu C analysis. The REML (Restricted Maximum Likelihood)/BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) method was used to predict mu C values for species ordering with carbon -offset potential. Survival was 47.54% at 40 months. The carbon stock of the planting was 2.60 +/- 6.2 Kg C individual(-1), and the average annual increase in carbon (AAIC) was 0.78 Kg C individual(-1) year(-1). The AAIC value was lower than the average value stipulated for carbon-offset projects (6.0 Kg CO2 individual(-1) year(-1)). Pioneer species contributed more to carbon storage than non-pioneer species.

TI  - Land cover changes and carbon storage before and after community forestry program in Bleberan village, Gunungkidul, Indonesia, 1999-2018
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - This study investigated the land cover changes, carbon storage dynamics and their underlying socio-economic processes before and after a community forest permit in Bleberan village, Gunungkidul, Indonesia, during 1999-2018. We used a combination of the forest canopy density model, carbon conversion and socio-economic related data to analyze land cover classes in the periods of 1999-2003, 2003-2009, and 2009-2018, representing the phases of several years before community forestry permit, initial phase of community forestry establishment and several years after community forestry permit, respectively. Results showed that at baseline (1999), where illegal logging was started on the ground, the condition of the 40 ha investigated area was dominated by non-forest in the form of open land by 54% with an amounted carbon storage of 1352.62 ton. In the phase of before community forestry permit (1999-2003), when there was continuous illegal logging, the open land rise quickly achieved to 83%, with only 312.09 ton of carbon storage remaining. In the initial phase of community forestry establishment (2003-2009), when the government issued a legalization of community forest, the mixed dryland agriculture shifted to dominate the area by 55%, with the carbon storage being increased to 1840.94 ton. The last phase, several years after community forestry permit (2009-2018), which characterized by active engagement of the community in forest rehabilitation, the area was altered to fully stocked teak plantation forest by 82%, with a carbon storage enhancement of 3379.16 ton or two times higher than that at baseline. Such results are important for the forest community authority and related stakeholder for designing appropriate forest-related policies and supporting REDD + implementation.

TI  - Do the impact of organic residues on soil quality extend beyond the deposition area under oil palm?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY
AB  - Recycling empty fruit bunches (EFBs) in mature oil palm stands usually consists in distributing them over a limited area representing 3%-10% of the plot. The impact of this practice on soil quality, including soil biodiversity, is not well known at the plot scale. We analysed soil physical, chemical, and biological variables. Five zones were defined around the palm tree to assess spatial heterogeneity due to plant cover and application of organic and inorganic fertilisers. Each zone was analysed separately. Our study revealed marked variations in mineral contents around the palm tree, ranging from deficiency to excess or nutrient imbalance in adjacent zones, particularly in available P and K, Mg and pH. Similar variations in macrofauna were observed both in the litter and the soil. Our results demonstrate that the changes caused by plant cover and applications of fertiliser are mainly limited in space, but that earthworm communities move as a function of variations in nutrient availability or stress associated with EFB deposition over time. The Amacher index, adapted to the soil nutrient status for oil palm, indicated that average mineral fertility at the plot scale was rather good. The average density of soil macrofauna and nematofauna was low compared to other tropical ecosystems, but reference data from Indonesia are lacking. Application of EFBs on the harvest path mainly improved the homogeneity of soil quality within the elementary plot around the palm. However these data did not show that recycling EFB stimulates soil fauna communities or carbon sequestration at the plot scale. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Performance of Guazuma ulmifolia Lam. in subtropical forest restoration
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
AB  - We evaluated the initial development of Guazuma ulmifolia Lam. in a reforestation experiment in the southwestern region of Parana State, Southern Brazil. In a 70 native tree species plantation (3x2 m spacing) data were collected biannually, up to 48 months, from 72 individuals of Guazuma ulmifolia. The species performance was evaluated regarding its survival (96%), root collar diameter (6.79 cm), total height (12.84 m), crown projection area (14.36 m(2)) and crown volume (49.86 m(3)). The species growth at the age of 48 months, associated to its high survival and sprouting rates, tells of excellent behavior in the region, and it could be highly recommended as a shading species for fast canopy fulfillment in forest restoration projects, especially in regions with frost occurrence.

TI  - Geometric morphology and soil properties of shallow karst fissures in an area of karst rocky desertification in SW China
T2  - CATENA
AB  - Serious soil erosion and an extremely low rate of soil formation leads to a thin layer of surface soil that makes tree growth difficult in areas of karst. Meanwhile, surface soil, driven by runoff, enters shallow karst fissures (SKFs); these SKFs filled with soil have become the major habitat type in the area. Here, we explore the morphological characteristics of shallow karst fissures as well as the soil physical and chemical properties of the SKFs and comprehensively analyse the factors that influence the soil properties. Three key results are presented. First, a high heterogeneity of morphological characteristics exists for shallow karst fissures. According to the different characteristics of the vertical section, the SKFs can be divided into 5 types. These types are Rectangle-type, Pyramid-type, Funnel-type, Net-type and Diamond-type. In addition, the SKF dip angles were mainly between 60 and 90 (76.39%), the width of the top aperture was mainly between 20 and 40 cm (51.39%), and the trace lengths were mainly between 80 and 160 cm (76.39%). Second, compared with their characteristics of surface soil, the bulk density and fractal dimension of soil particles of the SKFs were both large, and the main composition of the SKF soil was clay. Third, the soil nutrients of the SKFs (the organic matter, total nitrogen and total phosphorus) were lower than the surface soil nutrients but not significantly so. The total potassium (TIC) of the SKFs was greater than that observed for the surface and increased as the depth of the SKF increased. The soil nutrients of the SKFs were significantly affected by the fissure morphology. The poorly connected fissures had better soil fertility. When the morphological characteristics and soil properties of the SKFs were comprehensively considered, the vegetation types that were determined to be the best for use in the ecological restoration of areas of karst rocky desertification were deep-rooted plants with especially strong root penetration. The result of this study can supply some reference for future studies of karst rocky desertification control and vegetation restoration in the karst area of Southwest China; in the South Claw Silicon Island in Yogyakarta Province, Indonesia; and in other karst regions with the same ecological background.

TI  - Sustainable intensification of Brazilian livestock production through optimized pasture restoration
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Grassland degradation compromises the profitability of Brazilian livestock production, and pasture recovery is a promising strategy for sustainable intensification of agriculture (SAI). Recovery increases carbon sequestration into the soil and can potentially avoid deforestation; thereby reducing emissions intensity (EI), but only at increased investment cost per unit of area. We develop a multi-period linear programming (LP) model for grazing beef production planning to represent a typical Cerrado stocking and finishing beef farm. We compare economic and environmental performance of two alternative optimized pasture management approaches relative to the traditional practice (TRP), which is based on restoring pasture after a full degradation cycle of 8 years. The scenarios considered the difference made by access to subsidized credit through the Low Carbon Agriculture program ("Programa ABC"). The model estimates El using upstream life cycle assessment (LCA), and dynamically estimates soil organic carbon (SOC) changes as a function of pasture management The results show net present values (NPV) ranging from 67 Brazilian reals per hectare-year (R$.ha(-1).yr(-1)) to around 300R$.ha(-1).yr(-1), respectively for traditional and optimized pasture management strategies. Estimated El of the TRP is 9.26 kg CO2 equivalent per kg of carcass weight equivalent (kg CO(2)e/kg ONE) relative to 3.59 kg CO(2)e/kg CWE for optimized management Highest emission abatement results from improved SOC sequestration, while access to credit could further reduce EI by around 20%. We consider the effects of alternative credit interest on both NPV and EL The results provide evidence to inform the design of Brazil's key domestic policy incentive for low carbon agriculture, which is an important component of the country's Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) on emissions mitigation. The results also contribute to the global debate on the interpretation of SAL (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Locating REDD: A global survey and analysis of REDD readiness and demonstration activities
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB  - Mechanisms that support reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD/REDD+) have potential to counteract a large share of global greenhouse gas emissions if implemented effectively across the tropics. In 2007 the conference of parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change called upon parties and international organizations to promote REDD through investments in capacity building and demonstration activities. This prompted many new actors to become involved in REDD activities at a variety of locations and scales. A global survey of REDD activities was undertaken in 2009 to enable better understanding of the intensity and geographic distribution of these activities. Existing compilations, literature review, web-based sources, face-to-face and telephone interviews, and e-mail questionnaires were used to compile data for the inventory. Inter alia, data were collected on the location of activities and official and unofficial factors influencing location choices. Inventory data were combined with secondary data to estimate a statistical count model (Poisson) of factors affecting the number of REDD activities undertaken in the 64 developing countries that experienced significant emissions from deforestation. The results show that there were at least 79 REDD readiness activities and 100 REDD demonstration activities as of October 2009. Of these, the largest shares of REDD readiness and demonstration activities were implemented in Indonesia (7 and 15 respectively) and Brazil (4 and 13 respectively), countries widely agreed to have the greatest potential for reducing forest-based emissions. The statistical results found no national characteristic to have a statistically-significant effect on the number of REDD readiness activities, but five national characteristics to have significant effects on the number of REDD demonstration projects. Baseline CO2 emissions, forest carbon stock, number of threatened species, quality of governance, and region all had significant effects. The results reveal the importance of biodiversity and good governance, and the relative unimportance of human need and opportunity cost of land. The results also reveal a bias against Africa and toward Latin America. Unless this pattern is countered, REDD and REDD+ may have geographic biases that undermine its broad political support.

TI  - What makes ecosystem restoration expensive? A systematic cost assessment of projects in Brazil
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Limited funding is a major barrier to implementing ambitious global restoration commitments, so reducing restoration costs is essential to upscale restoration. The lack of rigorous analyses about the major components and drivers of restoration costs limit the development of alternatives to reduce costs and the selection of the most cost-effective methods to achieve restoration goals. We conducted detailed restoration cost assessments for the three most widespread biomes in Brazil (Amazon, Cerrado, and Atlantic Forest) and estimated the restoration costs associated with implementing Brazil's National Plan for Native Vegetation Recovery (12M hectares). Most surveys (60-90%) reported using the costly methods of planting seedlings or sowing seeds throughout the site, regardless of the biome. Natural regeneration and assisted regeneration approaches were an order of magnitude cheaper but were reported in < 15% of projects. The vast majority of tree planting and direct seeding costs were incurred during the implementation phase, and nearly 80% of projects ended maintenance within 30 months. We estimated a price tag of US$0.7-1.2 billion per year until 2030 to implement Brazil's restoration plan depending on the area that recovers through natural regeneration. Our results offer valuable insights for developing strategies to make restoration cheaper and to increase its cost-effectiveness for achieving diverse benefits in Brazilian ecosystems. Our survey also provides a starting point for sound assessments of restoration costs and their drivers in other biomes, which are needed to reduce the financial barriers to scaling up restoration at a global scale.

TI  - Litterfall-Associated Carbon Deposition and Vertical Profiles of Soil Organic Carbon in Different Land-Use Systems
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - Litterfall is one of the major inputs for soil nutrients. Understanding the connection of litterfall and soil organic carbon (SOC) as the part of ecological processes is a key step towards carbon sequestration as a climate change mitigation strategy. Yet, it remains inadequate to support by empirical pieces of evidence particularly in tropical ecosystems. In this study, litter traps were used to monitor the monthly organic carbon deposition over a year through litterfall, and soil samples were collected vertically up to 30 cm depth to define the SOC depth distribution in three different land use types located at Wondo Genet district, southern Ethiopia. The results were interpreted by deploying both the carbon stratification ratio (CSR) and carbon flow balance ratio (CFBR) as ecological indicators. The results revealed that both the annual litterfall amount and associated organic carbon input in plantation forest (958.4 +/- 112 g center dot m-2 center dot yr-1; 391.4 +/- 112 g center dot C center dot m-2 center dot yr-1) were higher than those in the homegarden (183.5.4 +/- 26 g center dot m-2 center dot yr-1; 67.4 +/- 10 g center dot C center dot m-2 center dot yr-1), conceivably due to few litter contributors (trees) present in the homegarden. The CSR of the homegarden (1.3 +/- 0.01) was found between the ratio obtained for crop (1.2 +/- 0.01) and plantation forest (1.4 +/- 0.01), indicating that it is definitely a combination of pure plantation forest and crop system. The CFBR was higher in plantation forest (3.4 yr-1) than in soil of homegarden (0.77 yr-1), implying the net accumulation of soil carbon over time in the latter system. Hence, homegardens could be considered as a system of climate-smart practice with multiple-biogeochemistry pathways, which simultaneously address the social-absolute needs. Given the current tendency of transforming homegarden agroforestry to monoculture types owing to economical drivers, such indicators can dictate of making rational decisions related to land use planning and soil fertility management.

TI  - Effectiveness of Protected Areas in the Pan-Tropics and International Aid for Conservation
T2  - GEOMATICS
AB  - Evaluation of the effectiveness of protected areas is critical for forest conservation policies and priorities. We used 30 m resolution forest cover change data from 1990 to 2010 for similar to 4000 protected areas to evaluate their effectiveness. Our results show that protected areas in the tropics avoided 83,500 +/- 21,200 km(2) of deforestation during the 2000s. Brazil's protected areas have the largest amount of avoided deforestation at 50,000 km(2). We also show the amount of international aid received by tropical countries compared to the effectiveness of protected areas. Thirty-four tropical countries received USD 42 billion during the 1990s and USD 62 billion during the 2000s in international aid for biodiversity conservation. The effectiveness of international aid was highest in Latin America, with 4.3 m(2)/USD, led by Brazil, while tropical Asian countries showed the lowest average effect of international aid, reaching only 0.17 m(2)/USD.

TI  - Ecological indicators for monitoring coffee agroforestry systems in protected areas: A case study in Sao Paulo State, Brazil
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - CONTEXT: Biodiverse coffee agroforestry systems (AFS) offer high potential for forest restoration. However, long-term monitoring using appropriate indicators is necessary to ensure successful ecological restoration. In the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, legal instruments define ecological indicators and reference values for monitoring AFSmediated ecological restoration. OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether biodiverse coffee AFS of different age groups achieved legal reference values in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and recommended strategies for improving legal instruments. METHODS: We evaluated four ecological indicators in AFS areas of two age groups and compared them with reference values. Additionally, we analyzed the relationships among the ecological indicators under study. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Half of the AFS sites did not achieve reference values for all ecological indicators, primarily owing to the management practices used. Additionally, we found that canopy cover had a direct relationship with soil cover; thus, not only did most AFS areas where farmers pruned native trees had canopy cover values lower than those required by legislation but, indeed, lower than the reference value for soil cover. However, this is subject to improvement via ecological restoration-friendly practices, reinforcing the feasibility of establishing this AFS design in protected areas. Despite proper choice of ecological indicators, we recommend that tree and sapling population density be measured separately. SIGNIFICANCE: Despite its narrow scope, this study provided novel insights into the effects of coffee AFS management on the trajectory of ecological restoration and on the construction of proper monitoring frameworks using ecological indicators evaluated in other Brazilian regions or countries.

TI  - Fast natural regeneration in abandoned pastures in southern Amazonia
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Abandoned pastureland provides a prime opportunity for forest recovery of these degraded areas in the Amazon. Many factors impact forest regeneration, including time and intensity of pasture use before abandonment, and proximity of a source of propagules. Given these conditions, it is necessary to better investigate the effect of such factors on the natural regeneration of abandoned pastureland. Here we employed chronosequences to study secondary forest succession in abandoned pastures along the Madeira River, Rondonia, Brazil. We installed 314 m(2) plots in 36 abandoned pastures previously subjected to long-term use (average of 9 years), but now at different stages of natural regeneration. All tree species stems >= 30 cm in height were identified, and their diameter was measured at ground level. Using a historical series of Landsat satellite images, time of pasture encroachment ("encapoeiramento"), time of pasture use, and time since last use were all calculated. The percentage of forest cover adjacent to each plot was calculated using a circular buffer (120 m radius) overlaid on a land-cover classification. Model selection procedure was used to access the importance of four predictors on natural regeneration variables (species density, basal area, stem density). We sampled 6380 stems belonging to 202 morphospecies grouped into 138 genera and 51 families. The two most important species were Vismia guianensis and Vismia gracilis that together represented 40% of abundance, 70% of frequency, and 101% of IVI (Importance Value Index) of the plants sampled. Most species (164) were recorded in a maximum of four out of 36 plots sampled. Species density increased by ca. five species per year after pasture encroachment. Occurrence of rare species increased with time following encroachment, while relative abundance and basal area of the main pioneer species decreased with the advance of forest succession. Time of pasture encroachment, time of pasture use, and time since last use had significant effect on natural regeneration, whereas cover of surrounding forest had limited influence. Although constrained by long-term use, "natural regeneration in abandoned pastures occurred relatively rapidly based on the high occurrence of resprouting pioneer species, which formed secondary sites during the first years of succession. Afterwards, regeneration was incremented by the establishment of a number of late succession species. We conclude that forest restoration of abandoned pastures in the Amazon should use the natural potential of forest regeneration, considering both the speed and intensity of the process.

TI  - FEW DOMINANT NATIVE WOODY SPECIES: HOW SUBTROPICAL RAINFOREST SUCCESSIONAL PROCESS ACTS ON ABANDONED PASTURES IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - In Brazil, a high number of woody species have been used for forest restoration plantings. However, this action is widely questionable due to the no re-establishment of a considered "normal" successional trajectory. In this study, we analyzed subtropical rainforest natural regeneration at abandoned pastures and we showed that vegetation is characterized, predominantly, by few high dominant native woody species, highlighting especially Vernonanthura discolor (Asteraceae), Myrsine coriacea (Primulaceae), and Piptocarpha regnellii (Asteraceae). Our results also indicate that these high dominance species favor the lowest diversity of natural regeneration. In this regard, we suggest implementing actions that provide improvements and facilitate natural processes of ecological succession by planting dominant native woody species. This takes into consideration the re-establishment of a considered "normal" successional trajectory.

TI  - Policy sequencing to reduce tropical deforestation
T2  - GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Non-technical summary Tropical deforestation continues apace despite a proliferation of commitments made by companies and governments to control it. Halting and reversing deforestation requires multiple, complementary interventions by state and non-state actors at different scales. We argue that the order in which these instruments and actors are introduced into the policy mix matters. Sequences of interventions from case studies in Latin America show that government commitment is a critical first step, implemented through command-and-control measures and then incentives. Combined with REDD+, they create an enabling environment for supply chain initiatives. A more coordinated and deliberate polycentric governance is needed to achieve zero-deforestation. Technical summary Avoided deforestation provides a natural climate solution for reducing emissions while generating co-benefits for people and nature. However, unleashing this potential requires improved governance. Diverse coalitions of actors are designing interventions to protect forests, each with different motivations and specialization of strategies. We introduce a policy sequencing framework to advance our understanding of how to improve polycentric zero-deforestation governance. Focusing on commodity production in Costa Rica, Brazil, and Colombia, we reconstructed the policy mix of zero-deforestation interventions across three domains - domestic public policies, REDD+, and supply chain initiatives. We classified interventions according to their instrument mechanism - disincentives, incentives, enabling measures - and when they were introduced into the policy mix. We found a sequence of interventions that reflects stages of forest cover dynamics, but also depends on local political will and institutional capacity. Government command-and-control measures are needed early in the policy sequence to slow deforestation, with incentives added to increase legal compliance. REDD+ helps governments build an enabling environment that supports supply chain initiatives seeking to increase forest cover at later stages of the sequence. Policy sequencing and policyscape concepts advance the design of more deliberate polycentric forest governance that enhances actor coordination and instrument synergies in the policy mix.

TI  - Abundance and phenology drive plant-pollinator network responses to restoration in the Southern Atlantic rainforest in Brazil
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Ecological restoration has been increasingly considering biotic interactions. Different restoration strategies usually rely on different composition and abundance of plants with potential impact on the establishment of plant-pollinator interactions. We evaluated the restoration of plant-pollinator interaction networks in young restoration areas in the South Atlantic rainforest, Brazil. We assessed the relative contribution of two restoration strategies (natural regeneration vs. reforestation), geographic distance, plant composition, pollinator composition, abundance of flowers and insects, and plant-pollinator temporal overlap, that is, phenological coupling, to predict the establishment of pairwise interactions. We expected that restoration strategies would indirectly affect the patterns (identity and frequency) of pairwise interactions due to their influence on the processes driving interactions. We sampled monthly pollinators and the plants they visited on six reforestation sites and six natural regeneration sites during 20 months. We surveyed flower abundance in summer. We analyzed the relative contribution of each factor to predict the identity and frequency of pairwise interactions using structural equation modeling. Contrary to expectations, the restoration strategy did not predict interactions, probably because the sites under restoration were surrounded by natural and conserved landscapes. Since we found no effect of restoration strategies on plant composition, abundance, and phenological coupling, the restoration strategy did not predict interactions. Phenological coupling explained more than half of the interaction patterns, representing the best predictor of interactions followed by abundance and plant composition. Therefore, these predictors should be considered to select plant species in restoration projects that encompass interactions and pollination services.

TI  - Will funding to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and (forest) Degradation (REDD+) stop conversion of peat swamps to oil palm in orangutan habitat in Tripa in Aceh, Indonesia?
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Tripa is the last remaining peat-swamp forest that harbours a potentially viable Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii) sub-population in a formally but not effectively protected area. It appears to be a simple showcase where current efforts to financially support reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) converge with biodiversity and social co-benefits. In practice, however, situation is more complex. REDD+ efforts interact with global palm oil trade and regulatory approaches (the moratorium) to achieve national goals for emissions reduction under umbrella of nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMA). To contextualize this debate, we assessed (i) land-use history and formal basis of palm-oil companies' rights; (ii) carbon (C) stocks, historical emission levels and potential emissions that can be avoided; (iii) economic benefits of land-use options and opportunity costs of avoiding emissions; (iv) biodiversity and environmental services; and (v) alternative options for "high C stock development" and employment generation. Natural forest cover declined (54 % in 1995, 18 % in 2009) while oil palm increased 4-39 %. Aboveground C stocks decreased from 148 Mg ha(-1) in 1990 to 61 Mg ha(-1) in 2009, leading to average annual emissions of 14.5 Mg (carbon dioxide) CO(2)e ha(-1) year(-1). While 41 % of these emissions yield less than American Dollar (USD) 5 of current economic benefits per Mg CO(2)e emitted and might be compensated by REDD+, nearly all new emissions derive from a breach of existing laws, regulations and voluntary palm-oil standards. Substantial investment in alternative employment is needed, rather than carbon payments per se, to support livelihoods in a low carbon emissions economy.

TI  - Heterogeneous impacts of community forestry on forest conservation and poverty alleviation: Evidence from Indonesia
T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
AB  - Community forestry is a participatory approach aiming to achieve sustainable forest management while also reducing poverty among rural communities. Yet, evidence of the impacts of community forestry programmes on both forest conservation and poverty alleviation is scarce, and there is limited understanding of impacts across different social and biophysical contexts. We applied a matching method to assess the extent to which deforestation has decreased and village well-being has improved as a result of Indonesia's community forestry scheme, Hutan Desa (Village Forest). We assessed five dimensions of well-being: basic (living conditions), physical (access to health and education), financial (income support), social (security and equity) and environmental (natural hazard prevention). We found that Hutan Desa was associated with reduced deforestation and poverty. 'Win-win' outcomes were found in 51% of cases, comprising (a) positive outcomes for both forests and poverty, (b) a positive outcome for one aspect and a negligible outcome for the other, or (c) a positive outcome for poverty in areas where natural forest had already been lacking prior to Hutan Desa tenure. Benefits to forests and people systematically differed depending on land-use zones, reflecting subtle interactions between anthropogenic pressures and community livelihood characteristics. In Watershed Protection Zones, which are dominated by subsistence-based forest livelihoods, community forestry provided mild conservation benefits, but resulted in the greatest improvements in well-being through improved land tenure. In Limited Production Zones, community forestry provided modest benefits for both conservation and well-being because restrictions on timber harvest due to Hutan Desa designation reduced the financial well-being of logging communities. The greatest conservation benefits were experienced in Permanent or Convertible Production Zones, but well-being improvements were minimal. Here, living conditions and environmental well-being were reduced due to pressure to intensify agricultural production under increased land scarcity in these predominantly cash crop-oriented communities. Our results highlight the spatial and contextual variation in impacts of community forestry policies on poverty alleviation and forest conservation outcomes. Crucially, our study provides vital objective information for future policy development in Indonesia and other tropical countries implementing community forestry schemes.

TI  - Influence of cashew Anacardium occidentale L. Cultivation on termite diversity in the Korhogo savannah zone (Northern Cote d'ivoire)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
AB  - Termites play an important role in the process of decomposition of organic matter in tropical ecosystems and participate in the evolution of soil structure. This study was carried out in the north of Cote d'Ivoire to evaluate the influence of cashew tree orchards' age on termite assemblages. The standardised method for rapid estimation (RAP) of biodiversity was used to collect termites in four (4) classes of cashew tree orchards (Class 1: < 5 years, Class 2: 5-10 years, Class 3: 11-20 years, Class 4: 21 years and above) in comparison to savannah. The results showed that species richness, were low in young orchards of class 1 (9 species). This increased progressively with age to its maximum in older orchards of class 4 (30 species). These old orchards were even richer in termite species than the savannah (27 species). Shannon-Weiner diversity index varied in the same way as species richness. The abundance of termites, were low in young orchards (45 occurrences), higher in older orchards of class 4 (423 occurrences), with a predominance of fungus-growing termite species. This study showed the recovery of termite diversity in cashew tree orchards after the stoppage in agricultural activities. Suggesting that, this form of agroforestry would allow for the conservation of diversity of the soil fauna while ensuring food security in the area.

TI  - Balancing carrots and sticks in REDD plus : implications for social safeguards
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - Reducing carbon emissions through avoided deforestation and forest degradation and enhancement of carbon stocks (REDD+) is key to mitigating global climate change. The aim of REDD+ social safeguards is to ensure that REDD+ does not harm, and actually benefits, local people. To be eligible for results-based compensation through REDD+, countries should develop nationallevel safeguard information systems to monitor and report on the impacts of REDD+. Although safeguards represent a key step for promoting social responsibility in REDD+, they are challenging to operationalize and monitor. We analyzed the impacts of different types of REDD+ interventions (incentives vs. disincentives) on key safeguard-relevant indicators, i.e., tenure security, participation, and subjective well-being, as well as on reported forest clearing. We used household-level data collected in Brazil, Peru, Cameroon, Tanzania, Indonesia, and Vietnam from approximately 4000 households in 130 villages at two points in time (2010-2012 and 2013-2014). Our findings highlight a decrease in perceived tenure security and overall perceived well-being over time for households exposed to disincentives alone, with the addition of incentives helping to alleviate negative effects on well-being. In Brazil, although disincentives were associated with reduced reported forest clearing by smallholders, they were the intervention that most negatively affected perceived well-being, highlighting a clear trade-off between carbon and noncarbon benefits. Globally, although households exposed to REDD+ interventions were generally aware of local REDD+ initiatives, meaningful participation in initiative design and implementation lagged behind. Our analysis contributes to a relatively small literature that seeks to operationalize REDD+ social safeguards empirically and to evaluate the impacts of REDD+ interventions on local people and forests.

TI  - Impact of cropping methods on biodiversity in coffee agroecosystems in Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - The sustainable management of biodiversity and productivity in forested lands requires an understanding of key interactions between socioeconomic and biophysical factors and their response to environmental change. Appropriate baseline data are rarely available. As part of a broader study on biodiversity and profitability, we examined the impact of different cropping methods on biodiversity (plant species richness) along a subjectively determined land-use intensity gradient in southern Sumatra, ranging from primary and secondary forest to coffee-farming systems (simple, complex, with and without shade crops) and smallholder coffee plantings, at increasing levels of intensity. We used 24 (40 x 5 m) plots to record site physical data, including soil nutrients and soil texture together with vegetation structure, all vascular plant species, and plant functional types (PFTs-readily observable, adaptive, morphological features). Biodiversity was lowest under simple, intensive, non-shaded farming systems and increased progressively through shaded and more complex agroforests to late secondary and closed-canopy forests. The most efficient single indicators of biodiversity and soil nutrient status were PFT richness and a derived measure of plant functional complexity. Vegetation structure, tree dry weight, and duration of the land-use type, to a lesser degree, were also highly correlated with biodiversity. Together with a vegetation, or V index, the close correspondence between these variables and soil nutrients suggests they are potentially useful indicators of coffee production and profitability across different farming systems. These findings provide a unique quantitative basis for a subsequent study of the nexus between biodiversity and profitability.

TI  - Avoided deforestation in Brazilian Amazonia: Simulating the effect of the Juma Sustainable Development Reserve
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The Juma Sustainable Development Reserve, located in Brazil's state of Amazonas, was the first protected area in Brazil to be benefited by a Reducing Emissions from a Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) project. However, the carbon benefits of REDD projects may be compromised by leakage, or displacement of deforestation to areas outside of the reserve. Through environmental modeling techniques it is possible to simulate scenarios that represent changes in land use and land cover and thus assess the possible trajectories and magnitude of deforestation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Juma reserve in reducing deforestation and to estimate projected carbon emission by 2050. The simulated scenarios were: (1) baseline scenario, without the creation of the Juma reserve; (2) scenario with leakage (SL) where the creation of the reserve would cause a spatial shift in deforestation, and (3) scenario with reduced leakage (SRL), where the amount of deforestation resulting from leakage is reduced. Considering the study area as a whole (Juma reserve +120-km buffer zone), there would be a 16.0% (14,695 km(2)) reduction in forest cover by 2050 in the baseline scenario, 15.9% (14,647 km(2)) in the SL and 15.4% (14,219 km(2)) in the SRL, as compared to what was present in 2008. The loss of forest cover within the limits of the Juma reserve by 2050 would be 18.9% (1052 km(2)) in the baseline scenario and 7.1% (395 km(2)) in the SL and SRL. From the simulated scenarios, the carbon stock in the total study area was estimated to be reduced from 1.63 Pg C (Pg = 10(15) g = 1 billion tons) in 2008 to 1.37 Pg C in 2050 in the baseline scenario and in the SL and to 1.38 Pg C in the SRL. In the area of the Juma reserve, the carbon stock would be reduced from 0.10 Pg C in 2008 to 0.08 Pg C in 2050 (baseline) or 0.09 Pg C (SL and SRL). The Juma reserve was effective in reducing carbon emission by 2050, but the reduction would be substantially less than that calculated in the Juma REDD project. Leakage must be accounted for in REDD projects because the deforestation resulting from this effect could generate "hot air" (carbon credit with no additionality). Over longer time horizons the benefits of reserves are greater and leakage losses are recovered. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Microbiome resilience of Amazonian forests: Agroforest divergence to bacteria and secondary forest succession convergence to fungi
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - An alarming and increasing deforestation rate threatens Amazon tropical ecosystems and subsequent degradation due to frequent fires. Agroforestry systems (AFS) may offer a sustainable alternative, reportedly mimicking the plant-soil interactions of the natural mature forest (MF). However, the role of microbial community in tropical AFS remains largely unknown. This knowledge is crucial for evaluating the sustainability of AFS and practices given the key role of microbes in the aboveground-belowground interactions. The current study, by comparing different AFS and successions of secondary and MFs, showed that AFS fostered distinct groups of bacterial community, diverging from the MFs, likely a result of management practices while secondary forests converged to the same soil microbiome found in the MF, by favoring the same groups of fungi. Model simulations reveal that AFS would require profound changes in aboveground biomass and in soil factors to reach the same microbiome found in MFs. In summary, AFS practices did not result in ecosystems mimicking natural forest plant-soil interactions but rather reshaped the ecosystem to a completely different relation between aboveground biomass, soil abiotic properties, and the soil microbiome.

TI  - FOREST RESTORATION PROGRESS AND LESSONS LEARNED IN GUNUNG PALUNG NATIONAL PARK, INDONESIA
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Restoring forests, especially within deforested or degraded protected areas, is critical to prevent global biodiversity loss and climate change. In this article, we explore the current conditions and progress of forest restoration in Gunung Palung National Park in Indonesian Borneo. The aim of this research was to review forest restoration projects and their success in the park, and to analyse lessons learned from those projects. From 2009 till 2018, nearly 5000 ha of damaged forest in Gunung Palung National Park were replanted, but with only a 1% restoration success rate. The main reason for failed restoration is wildfire. We found four issues that should be resolved in forest restoration projects: fire management, weed management, cost calculation and defining an appropriate restoration strategy. Restoration projects in the park have estimated the price per seedling at around USD0.36 to USD0.78 for one year. We proposed a revised price per seedling of USD1 for the first year, with an additional 10 cents per year for the following three years, to account for maintenance and labour costs. One-time projects that focus only on planting are likely to fail, especially without fire prevention management. Successful forest restoration projects should do more than simply planting trees by also including care and maintenance after they are planted. With this in mind, we provide a standardised framework to guide decision-making and successful forest restoration. Our results should help increase forest restoration success, improve sustainability and allow for the persistence of forested landscapes.

TI  - Potential conditions for fire occurrence in vegetation in the Peruvian Andes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
AB  - Fire activity in the Peruvian Andes has increased significantly in recent decades, but climatic parameters associated with drought, which may indirectly contribute to the occurrence of severe forest fires, have not yet been investigated. Because fire prevention tools are scarce, strategies for deterring burning are necessary in order to reduce impacts in regions where forest fires usually result from human activity. This study explores the conditions conducive to forest fire in the Andes of Peru. Daily precipitation and temperature observed data from the PISCO gridded dataset for the 2002-2016 period were used. In addition, MODIS satellite images (MOD09A1 product) were collected to characterise Andean vegetation using spectral indices. Analysis of daily temperature and rainfall indicates that climatic parameters such as cumulative precipitation, dry-day frequency and hot-day frequency are statistically associated with conditions that could contribute to increased forest fire occurrence. Our findings suggest that a decrease in the water content of vegetation, estimated by the Global Vegetation Moisture Index during the dry period and wet period onset, can be used to identify potential conditions for forest fire occurrence. This study suggests that forest managers should consider implementing prevention strategies that include continuous monitoring of climate and vegetation parameters.

TI  - Resource heterogeneity moderates the biodiversity-function relationship in real world ecosystems
T2  - PLOS BIOLOGY
AB  - Numerous recent studies have tested the effects of plant, pollinator, and predator diversity on primary productivity, pollination, and consumption, respectively. Many have shown a positive relationship, particularly in controlled experiments, but variability in results has emphasized the context-dependency of these relationships. Complementary resource use may lead to a positive relationship between diversity and these processes, but only when a diverse array of niches is available to be partitioned among species. Therefore, the slope of the diversity-function relationship may change across differing levels of heterogeneity, but empirical evaluations of this pattern are lacking. Here we examine three important functions/properties in different real world (i.e., nonexperimental) ecosystems: plant biomass in German grasslands, parasitism rates across five habitat types in coastal Ecuador, and coffee pollination in agroforestry systems in Indonesia. We use general linear and structural equation modeling to demonstrate that the effect of diversity on these processes is context dependent, such that the slope of this relationship increases in environments where limiting resources (soil nutrients, host insects, and coffee flowers, respectively) are spatially heterogeneous. These real world patterns, combined with previous experiments, suggest that biodiversity may have its greatest impact on the functioning of diverse, naturally heterogeneous ecosystems.

TI  - Coffee Rust Severity Analysis in Agroforestry Systems Using Deep Learning in Peruvian Tropical Ecosystems
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Agroforestry systems can influence the occurrence and abundance of pests and diseases because integrating crops with trees or other vegetation can create diverse microclimates that may either enhance or inhibit their development. This study analyzes the severity of coffee rust in two agroforestry systems in the provinces of Ja & eacute;n and San Ignacio in the department of Cajamarca (Peru). This research used a quantitative descriptive approach, and 319 photographs were collected with a professional camera during field trips. The photographs were segmented, classified and analyzed using the deep learning MobileNet and VGG16 transfer learning models with two methods for measuring rust severity from SENASA Peru and SENASICA Mexico. The results reported that grade 1 is the most prevalent rust severity according to the SENASA methodology (1 to 5% of the leaf affected) and SENASICA Mexico (0 to 2% of the leaf affected). Moreover, the proposed MobileNet model presented the best classification accuracy rate of 94% over 50 epochs. This research demonstrates the capacity of machine learning algorithms in disease diagnosis, which could be an alternative to help experts quantify the severity of coffee rust in coffee trees and broadens the field of research for future low-cost computational tools for disease recognition and classification

TI  - Rainforest transformation reallocates energy from green to brown food webs
T2  - NATURE
AB  - Terrestrial animal biodiversity is increasingly being lost because of land-use change(1,2). However, functional and energetic consequences aboveground and belowground and across trophic levels in megadiverse tropical ecosystems remain largely unknown. To fill this gap, we assessed changes in energy fluxes across 'green' aboveground (canopy arthropods and birds) and 'brown' belowground (soil arthropods and earthworms) animal food webs in tropical rainforests and plantations in Sumatra, Indonesia. Our results showed that most of the energy in rainforests is channelled to the belowground animal food web. Oil palm and rubber plantations had similar or, in the case of rubber agroforest, higher total animal energy fluxes compared to rainforest but the key energetic nodes were distinctly different: in rainforest more than 90% of the total animal energy flux was channelled by arthropods in soil and canopy, whereas in plantations more than 50% of the energy was allocated to annelids (earthworms). Land-use change led to a consistent decline in multitrophic energy flux aboveground, whereas belowground food webs responded with reduced energy flux to higher trophic levels, down to -90%, and with shifts from slow (fungal) to fast (bacterial) energy channels and from faeces production towards consumption of soil organic matter. This coincides with previously reported soil carbon stock depletion(3). Here we show that well-documented animal biodiversity declines with tropical land-use change(4-6) are associated with vast energetic and functional restructuring in food webs across aboveground and belowground ecosystem compartments.

TI  - Defining ecological restoration of peatlands in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Indonesia declared an ambitious plan to restore its degraded and fire-prone peatlands, which have been a source of significant greenhouse gas and haze. However, the progress has been slow and the plan cannot succeed without sustained social supports and political will. Although many previous studies argued for the need to see ecological restoration in socio-economic contexts, empirical assessments have been lacking for how restoration is operationalized on the ground. We interviewed 47 key informants involved in four different projects in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, and assessed their definitions, goals, and practices of peatland restoration. Most of the actors we interviewed defined peatland restoration primarily in an ecological context following the global concept of ecological restoration. However, all four restoration projects were designed without determining reference and trajectory conditions. Their intermediate goals and practices were more focused on engaging local communities and developing sustainable livelihood options than improving the ecological conditions of peatlands. To be internally consistent, peatland restoration needs to recognize a social dimension in its process, as well as in its goal. Setting clear trajectory conditions is also important to clarify achievable goals and measurable intermediate outcomes. We propose the following definition of peatland restoration: a process of assisting the recovery of degraded peatland ecosystems to achieve the appropriate trajectories defined through multi-stakeholder collaboration within social-ecological contexts. We hope to generate healthy debates to further refine the definition that encompasses both social and ecological dimensions to generate broader support for sustaining and expanding peatland restoration projects in Indonesia.

TI  - Ant assemblages (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in three different stages of forest regeneration in a fragment of Atlantic Forest in Sergipe, Brazil
T2  - SOCIOBIOLOGY
AB  - In this study we compared the epigeic ant assemblages in forest fragments with three different status of plant recovery (an area reforested in 2007, another reforested in 2005 and another one of secondary forest, with over 35 years of plant regeneration), located in the municipality of Laranjeiras, Sergipe, Brazil. The ants were sampled in February (dry season) and June (rainy season) of 2012. We tested the following hypotheses: (1) the species richness of ants increases with time after the process of forest restoration; and (2) there are significant changes in species composition of ants among the three stages of forest regeneration. Twenty-five pitfall traps were installed in each area. A total of 82 morphospecies of ants were sampled, distributed in 31 genera and seven subfamilies. The richness of ants was similar among the three sites (F = 1.71, p = 0.19). The composition of ant species, however, was different in the area of late regeneration (35 years) compared to other areas of early reforestation (p < 0.05). Thus, epigeic ants were partially sensitive to changes in the habitat studied in response to reforestation, presenting changes in species composition but no differences in ant species richness among areas. We conclude that seven years after reforestation are not enough to restore the same ant diversity in disturbed environments.

TI  - Integrated assessment of carbon dioxide removal portfolios: land, energy, and economic trade-offs for climate policy
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is crucial to achieve the Paris Agreement's 1.5 degrees C-2 degrees C goals. However, climate mitigation scenarios have primarily focused on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation/reforestation, and recently direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS). This narrow focus exposes future climate change mitigation strategies to technological, institutional, and ecological pressures by overlooking the variety of existing CDR options, each with distinct characteristics-including, but not limited to, mitigation potential, cost, co-benefits, and adverse side-effects. This study expands the scope by evaluating CDR portfolios, consisting of any single CDR approach-BECCS, afforestation/reforestation, DACCS, biochar, and enhanced weathering-or a combination of them. We analyse the value of deploying these CDR portfolios to meet 1.5 degrees C goals, as well as their global and regional implications for land, energy, and policy costs. We find that diversifying CDR approaches is the most cost-effective net-zero strategy. Without the overreliance on any single approach, land and energy impacts are reduced and redistributed. A diversified CDR portfolio thus exhibits lower negative side-effects, but still poses challenges related to environmental impacts, logistics or accountability. We also investigate a CDR portfolio designed to support more scalable and sustainable climate mitigation strategies, and identify trade-offs between reduced economic benefits and lower environmental impacts. Rather than a one-size-fits-all scaling down, the CDR portfolio undergoes strategic realignment, with regional customization based on techno-economic factors and bio-geophysical characteristics. Moreover, we highlight the importance of nature-based removals, especially in Brazil, Latin America, and Africa, where potentials for avoided deforestation are the greatest, emphasizing their substantial benefits, not only for carbon sequestration, but also for preserving planetary well-being and human health. Finally, this study reveals that incentivizing timely and large-scale CDR deployment by policy and financial incentives could reduce the risk of deterring climate change mitigation, notably by minimizing carbon prices.

TI  - Ten principles for restoring campo rupestre, a threatened tropical, megadiverse, nutrient-impoverished montane grassland
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - To achieve the ambitious goals of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, restoration frameworks should embrace the diversity of ecosystems found on Earth, including open-canopy ecosystems, which have been largely overlooked. Considering the paucity of scientific foundations promoting restoration science, policy, and practice for open tropical ecosystems, we provide overarching guidelines to restore the campo rupestre, a Neotropical, open megadiverse grassland that has been increasingly threatened by multiple human activities, especially mining. Restoration techniques for tropical grasslands are still at its infancy, and attempts to restore campo rupestre have had, so far, low to moderate success, highlighting the need for a tailored restoration framework. In a scenario of increasing degradation and scarcity of on-site restoration experiments, we propose 10 principles to improve our ability to plan, implement, and monitor restoration in campo rupestre: (1) include socioeconomic dimensions, (2) implement active restoration, (3) keep low soil fertility, (4) restore disturbance regimes, (5) address genetic structure and adaptation potential, (6) restore geographically restricted and specialized ecological interactions, (7) incorporate functional approaches, (8) use seed-based restoration strategies to enhance biodiversity, (9) translocation is inevitable, and (10) long-term monitoring is mandatory. Our principles represent the best available evidence to support better science and practice for the restoration of campo rupestre and, to some extent, can be useful for other megadiverse, fire-prone, and nutrient-poor ecosystems.

TI  - Relationship between herbaceous vegetation and regeneration of woody species in abandoned pastures in the Atlantic Rain Forest in Southern Brazil
T2  - ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA
AB  - (Relationship between herbaceous vegetation and regeneration of woody species in abandoned pastures in the Atlantic Rain Forest in Southern Brazil) - Deforestation and conversion of forests to pasture is one of the most degrading activities impacting the Atlantic Rain Forest. We analyzed pastures abandoned for 8, 14, 48 50 and 96 months in Antonina (Parana state; 25 degrees 19 degrees 15 '' S; 45 degrees 24'24 '' W) to verify if herb cover reduces the natural regeneration of the Atlantic forest. We identified species and assessed shoot biomass of herbaceous species (in 24 1 in 2 plots), and calculated the volume of all woody species (height >= 1m; in 24 25 m(2) plots). We collected 59 herbaceous species (1,062 individuals) most of which were allochthonous species (95%), including Brachiaria decumbens and B. humidicola. We also sampled 104 woody species (2,234 individuals). There were significant floristic and structural changes in the community during the first four years since the pasture was abandoned. Woody vegetation development was negatively related to herb species' biomass, Suggesting that grasses (B. decumbens) inhibited forest regeneration. Our results suggested that management, including Brachiaria slip removal, is necessary for the restoration of abandoned pastures in the Atlantic Forest region.

TI  - Regeneration after fire in campo rupestre: Short- and long-term vegetation dynamics
T2  - FLORA
AB  - The Cerrado (Brazilian savanna) is the second largest biome in Brazil, covering 22% of the country, and campo rupestre is one of the most biodiverse ecosystem. Campo rupestre are extremely old mountaintop tropical ecosystems, composed of a mosaic of herbaceous, shrubland and savanna vegetation, generally located above 900 m above sea level characterized by shallow, acidic and nutrient-poor soils. In the context of increased land-use changes, effective conservation and management projects appear necessary to guarantee the conservation of these ecosystems. Although fire is a natural disturbance in campo rupestre, the effects of fire on vegetation dynamics remain poorly understood. Our objective was to assess the effects of fire on vegetation recovery and plant composition on both the short- and long-term in the main herbaceous vegetation types: the sandy and stony grasslands. We monitored plant community composition before and after a wildfire in order to assess the short- term vegetation recovery. Diachronic analyses of grasslands burnt at various dates were used to understand the effects of fire on the long-term vegetation dynamics. Our results highlighted a rapid recovery of campo rupestre vegetation after wildfires, suggesting a high adaptation to fire of plant communities. We did not find a significant variation in species richness of sandy grasslands according to time after fire, whereas higher species richness was observed in the recently burnt stony grasslands. No change in plant composition of campo rupestre in response to fire was highlighted, probably due to the high heterogeneity of this ecosystem. After fire, biomass gradually increased over time in both vegetation types. High biomass accumulation could lead to stronger fires. Further studies are necessary to understand the relationship between biomass accumulation and fire intensity in campo rupestre in order to set up adapted fire management strategies to conserve campo rupestre biodiversity.

TI  - Meta-analysis reveals that vertebrates enhance plant litter decomposition at the global scale
T2  - NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
AB  - Evidence is mounting that vertebrate defaunation greatly impacts global biogeochemical cycling. Yet, there is no comprehensive assessment of the potential vertebrate influence over plant decomposition, despite litter decay being one of the largest global carbon fluxes. We therefore conducted a global meta-analysis to evaluate vertebrate effects on litter mass loss and associated element release across terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Here we show that vertebrates affected litter decomposition by various direct and indirect pathways, increasing litter mass loss by 6.7% on average, and up to 34.4% via physical breakdown. This positive vertebrate impact on litter mass loss was consistent across contrasting litter types (woody and non-woody), climatic regions (boreal, temperate and tropical), ecosystem types (aquatic and terrestrial) and vertebrate taxa, but disappeared when evaluating litter nitrogen and phosphorus release. Moreover, we found evidence of interactive effects between vertebrates and non-vertebrate decomposers on litter mass loss, and a larger influence of vertebrates at mid-to-late decomposition stages, contrasting with the invertebrate effect known to be strongest at early decomposition stage. Our synthesis demonstrates a global vertebrate control over litter mass loss, and further stresses the need to account for vertebrates when assessing the impacts of biodiversity loss on biogeochemical cycles.
   Across terrestrial and aqueous ecosystems, vertebrates increase litter decomposition, both directly and indirectly, by 6.7% on average, and this effect interacts with but generally occurs at a later stage of decomposition than the effect of invertebrates.

TI  - REDD plus and Green Growth: synergies or discord in Vietnam and Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
AB  - Green Growth (GG) has emerged as a global narrative, replacing to some extent and integrating earlier sustainable development narratives, while Reducing Emissions through avoiding Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) has developed as major item in climate change negotiations. GG and REDD+ are both considered important strategies and are often seen as synergistic in achieving major changes in economic, regulatory and governance frameworks. Of concern, however, is that GG is sometimes seen as greenwashing of economic activities (which could include forest conversion to other land uses) by an oversimplified presentation of win-win solutions without challenging the actual root causes of unsustainable growth. How GG and REDD+ can contribute to transformational change in policy and practice depends on the relationship between these narratives, especially whether their adoption in national level policies manifests synergies or discord. In this paper, we will answer this question through analysing: (1) how the two narratives have unfolded in Vietnam and Indonesia and to what extent REDD+ and GG rhetoric include concrete policy objectives; (2) what issues policy actors perceive as challenges for their implementation. A comparative, mixed methods approach was employed to analyze how REDD+ and GG are framed in national policy documents. This analysis was supported by data from interviews with policy actors in both countries in two points of time, 2011/12 and 2015/16. The findings highlight the challenges for implementation of both REDD+ and GG as individual policy programmes, and the dilution of the REDD+ agenda and decision makers' confusion about a GG strategy when these narratives are joined and translated by decision makers. Actors still perceive development and environmental objectives as a zero-sum struggle, favouring a development narrative that might lead to neither REDD+ nor green policy action. We conclude that REDD+ and GG can go hand in hand, if there is action to tackle deforestation and degradation.

TI  - Termite diversity along a land use intensification gradient in a semi-arid savanna
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
AB  - Disturbance, particularly agricultural expansion is one of the major threats to the biodiversity and ecological functions of tropical and sub-tropical ecosystems. In this regard, we examined changes in the species richness, abundance, and diversity of termites across different disturbance treatments in a sub-tropical semi-arid savanna in south eastern Zimbabwe. Nine transects (100 x 2 m) representing three habitat disturbance treatments (primary woodland; grazing area; agricultural field) were sampled for termites using a rapid biodiversity assessment protocol. Termites were more abundant and species-rich in primary woodland and grazing area than in the agricultural field. Twelve termite species from three sub-families were present, with Microtermes sp. constituting 35% of the identified termite species. Termite feeding group structure differed significantly among land-use types, and of all termites present, wood-feeding termites were the most abundant while soil-feeders were rare in the agricultural field. In conclusion the observed pattern in termite species richness and relative abundance indicates that termites are very resilient to natural disturbance and might actually benefit from some natural disturbances like they did in the grazing area of this study, but they are not resilient to extreme anthropogenic disturbance. Although there was no notable difference in termite species richness and relative abundance between agricultural field and primary woodland, the pattern observed across the three sites may be potential support for the IDH suggesting that intermediate levels of physical disturbance intensity influence the structure and functioning of termite assemblages in semi-arid savanna.

TI  - Shade tree cover criteria for non-point source pollution control in the Rainforest Alliance coffee certification program: A snapshot assessment of Costa Rica's Tarrazu coffee region
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Management of non-point source pollution is of great importance in the context of coffee agriculture, as this land use often coincides with headwater streams that influence water quality at the basin scale. Sustainability certification programs, such as the Rainforest Alliance (RA), provide management guidelines that promote non-point source pollution control in coffee. One of these practices is the maintenance of shade trees within farms, required by RA at a minimum of 40% shade tree cover. Here we assess the effectiveness of this practice in Tarrazii, a high elevation coffee growing region in Costa Rica. We monitored indicators of non-point source pollution in streams with both high and low shade tree cover. Streams with High Shade Tree Cover (HSTC, N= 5 subwatersheds) had 35-55% cover, approximating or exceeding the RA recommendation of at least 40%; and streams with Low Shade Tree Cover (LSTC, N= 5 subwatersheds), had 18-31% cover. We monitored the ten study streams during the dry (April & December), transition (July), and peak (October) rainfall seasons of 2013, and compared responses using t-tests. We found support for the effectiveness of shade tree cover in controlling non-point source pollution: HSTC streams had significantly (p = 0.042) lower mean annual turbidity and significantly (p =0.004) lower turbidity during the transition season. HSTC streams also had significantly (p= 0.05) lower conductivity values during the transition period, although this trend was weaker through the year. Subwatersheds with HSTC streams were characterized by a higher percentage of RA-certified coffee than LSTC streams. Our study provides evidence of the benefits of RA shade tree cover criteria for managing water quality within high elevation tropical agro-ecosystems, especially if implemented at the watershed scale. These results contribute to our understanding of the role of agroforestry certification on tropical ecosystem conservation, and are the first account of the effectiveness of a specific coffee certification guideline on non-point source pollution control.

TI  - ORGANIC CARBON AND SOIL CHEMICAL ATTRIBUTES IN FOREST AREAS
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate organic carbon contents and soil chemical attributes in forest areas in Campo Belo do Sul, Santa Catarina, Brazil, with the following land use: native grassland (NG); 12-year-old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) reforestation (P12); 20-year-old loblolly pine reforestation (P20); 18-year-old araucaria (Araucaria angustifolia) reforestation (A18); and native forest with araucaria (NF). The soil samples were systematically collected with eight replicates, in the layers of 0.0-0.05; 0.05-0.1; 0.1-0.2 and 0.2-0.4 m. The pinus and araucaria reforestations showed organic C stocks similar to those in native forest and grassland areas, reaching 12.5 to 14.2 kg m(-2) in the layer of 0.0-0.4 m depth. Soil acidity and available P contents were highest, in the mean of the analyzed soil layers, under the P20 treatment. Soil nutrient status ranged from low to medium for available P and exchangeable K, Ca and Mg.

TI  - Impacts of livestock and pasture management on forest regeneration in Araucaria Forest remnants
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
AB  - In some regions of Southern Brazil, historic silvopastoral systems, known as caivas in Santa Catarina State and faxinais in Parana State, are used in remnants of Araucaria Forest. In these systems, the herbaceous stratum of the forest is composed of natural pasture on which animals graze. In order to better understand the impact of caivas on the conservation of the Araucaria Forest, the effects of different intensities of pasture management, mowing practices, and cattle grazing on natural regeneration were assessed. The experiment was carried out in eight caivas from 2015 to 2016, during which the forest regeneration was monitored every six months. Throughout the study period, 48 tree species that are characteristic of the Araucaria Forest were identified. In all evaluated scenarios, the regeneration of tree species was present, dynamic, and continuous in the caivas. The intensity of pasture use did not affect the indicators of diversity, species richness, and regeneration density. However, there was limited similarity among caivas with the same type of pasture management. Mowing had the greatest impact on regeneration, with a marked reduction in the density of regenerants, although it did not affect species richness. Given the abundance of species in the regeneration, including many species typical of advanced forest succession, it is possible to confirm that these systems present high levels of resilience with respect to the conservation of biodiversity, despite the occurrence of livestock grazing for generations. The results also indicate that it is possible to successfully implement strategies for pasture intensification in caivas. However, this practice must be associated with preservation strategies in forest areas that are more fragile and diverse, in order to ensure the system is sustainable across all dimensions.

TI  - Pinus elliottii Engelm as facilitator of riparian forest regeneration in savanna region, Assis, SP, Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
AB  - This study was conducted in a riparian area of Cerrado (savanna) in order to verify if a native plant community is positively or negatively influenced by reforestation with a fast growing exotic species (Pinus elliottii Engelm), on the basis of the ecological processes involved. Four treatments were compared: Pinus trees planted at 3 x 3 m, 3 x 2 m and 2 x 2 m, and a control (not planted). Every treatment consisted of four replications in randomized blocks and in 16 plots set along the stream. Variables related to growth for both planted and native species were evaluated, as well as the number of native species regenerating, dispersal syndrome, and also the ground cover by grasses. After eleven years from the beginning of the experiment, the higher the density of Pinus, the higher the density, number of species and diversity of native plants regenerating. Therefore the exotic trees facilitated the regeneration processes of native species. Analysis of explanatory variables showed that such facilitation was due to an indirect effect of the shading by Pinus trees, which reduced ground grass cover and prevented the inhibitory effect over plant community regeneration and growth. Further evaluations to detect competition between Pinus trees and the native community would be necessary to check if the facilitation effects persist in the long term.

TI  - Palynological approaches to forest restoration in Southeast Asia: Challenges and opportunities for Thailand-A systematic review
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
AB  - Southeast Asia (SEA) has experienced significant deforestation and increasing encroachment on its forests over time. This ongoing environmental issue arises from the persistent exploitation of protected forest areas by local communities, leading to further deforestation and the degradation of remnant forests. Although several organizations have implemented restoration measures, these efforts have primarily focused on reforestation. However, replacing once-diverse forests with only a single type of vegetation or non-native species undermines the fundamental objectives of restoration and exacerbates the vulnerability of these ecosystems, particularly affecting biodiversity and ecosystem functions, making them more susceptible to collapse. This paper reviews the application of paleoecology to conservation and restoration efforts in forests worldwide, with a specific focus on SEA, through a systematic review. Out of 833 documents related to palynology and forest restoration worldwide, 19 studies were selected for review based on their clear topical focus on SEA. Of these, 18 studies concentrate on Holocene sediments, while one examines the Pleistocene to Holocene transition. Most studies were conducted in Indonesia, primarily focusing on wetland restoration, particularly in peat swamps. The use of palynological methods in these conditions proves valuable for restoration strategies. Additionally, the review examined challenges and opportunities associated with the palynological approach to forest restoration in Thailand. The findings indicate that there is currently no up-to-date, in-depth palynological analysis in Thailand that incorporates forest restoration efforts. Nevertheless, the palynological approach offers valuable opportunities for forest restoration in Thailand and similar regions.

TI  - Community Managed Protected Areas Conserve Aboveground Carbon Stocks: Implications for REDD
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Protected Areas (PAs) represent a broad spectrum of outcomes and governance systems. Among PAs, Community Managed PAs have emerged from communities that are not exclusively indigenous and have developed social organizations to acquire land rights, participate in forest governance, and in some cases, engage in REDD+. However, regardless of the scale or counterfactual, there is no clear consensus about Community Managed PAs' effectiveness in forest conservation and climate change mitigation. Furthermore, previous studies have been devoted to estimating PAs' effects on deforestation before REDD+ projects began to operate. Based on Community Concessions in Peten (Guatemala) and Extractive Reserves in Acre (Brazil), we analyzed Community Managed PAs' temporal and spatial effects on carbon stocks and avoided emissions relative to unprotected lands, other Sustainable Use PAs (IUCN V-VI), and Strict PAs (I-IV). We used carbon density maps, matching methods, geographic discontinuity designs, and sensitivity analysis between 2003 and 2015. After controlling for the influence of market access and agriculture suitability, our analysis shows that Community Managed PAs were more effective than Other Lands (i.e., unprotected) and Sustainable Use PAs, and at least as effective as Strict PAs, in preserving carbon stocks and avoiding emissions. For instance, relative to Other Lands between 2011 and 2015, Community Managed PAs resulted in net avoided emissions of 4.6 tCO2-eq/ha in Peten (Guatemala) and 2.15 tCO2-eq/ha in Acre (Brazil). While these net avoided emissions were lower than in previous years, they seem to be driven by a reduction in carbon emissions outside Community Managed PAs. Spatially, the boundaries of Community Managed PAs varied across jurisdictions. For example, the boundaries of Acre's Community Managed PAs' have become less effective in avoiding emissions, which translates into reduced effects on conserving carbon stocks. Our results highlight the need to assess temporal effects to exhibit jurisdiction-wide land-use dynamics and spatial effects to identify local land-use pressures emerging inside or around the boundaries of PAs. Our analysis also shows that decentralized governance in Community Managed PAs may contribute to climate change mitigation through REDD+ and forest conservation targets.

AB  - Since 2016, peatland restoration policy is implemented in Central Kalimantan province through facilitation and coordination by Peat Restoration Agency (Badan Restorasi Gambut [BRG]), with the goals of reducing the peat subsidence, greenhouse gas emissions, and vulnerability to fire of peat areas. After years of implementation, local peat fires persist, however, and knowledge is still lacking about the challenges and opportunities for supporting the restoration process. This study examines policy implementation from the perspective of regional stakeholders by unraveling the dynamics of stakeholder interactions associated with the policy process. It reveals that the current state of governance somewhat restricts the ability of restoration actors to adaptively address emerging policy challenges and proposes measures for addressing these challenges.

TI  - Entomofauna Associated with Agroforestry Systems of Timber Species and Cacao in the Southern Region of the Maracaibo Lake Basin (Merida, Venezuela)
T2  - INSECTS
AB  - Agroforestry systems are environment-friendly production systems which help to preserve biodiversity while providing people with a way of earning a living. Cacao is a historically important crop in Venezuela that traditionally has been produced in agroforestry systems. However, few studies have evaluated how different trees used in those systems affect the dynamics and abundance of insects. The present study evaluated the entomofauna assemblages associated with different combinations of four timber-yielding trees and four Criollo cacao cultivars established in a lowland tropical ecosystem in Venezuela. A randomized block design with two replicates was used, each block having 16 plots which included all 16 possible combinations of four native timber trees (Cordia thaisiana, Cedrela odorata, Swietenia macrophylla, and Tabebuia rosea) and four Criollo cacao cultivars (Porcelana, Guasare, Lobatera and Criollo Merideno). Insects were collected with yellow pan traps and sorted to order. Coleoptera and parasitoid Hymenoptera were determined to the family level. In total, 49,538 individuals of seven orders were collected, with Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Hemiptera being the most abundant, although only Lepidoptera and Coleoptera abundances were significantly influenced by the timber tree species. Twenty-three families of parasitoid Hymenoptera and 26 of Coleoptera were found. Significant differences in insects' assemblages were found both in parasitoid Hymenoptera and Coleoptera families associated to every shade tree, with the families Eulophidae and Lycidae being indicators for Cordia, and Chalcididae for Swietenia. The entomofauna relationship with the cacao cultivar was barely significant, although Scydmaenidae and Scarabaeidae were indicators for Lobatera and Merideno, respectively. No significant effects were found for interaction with cacao cultivars and native trees. We concluded that the particular insect assemblages found in Cedrela odorata and Cordia thaisiana, together with their high growing rates, make these two species an optimal choice for cacao agroforestry systems.

TI  - Natural regeneration in a mixed ombrophilous forest remnant in southern Brazil
T2  - NEOTROPICAL BIOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - The study of forest regeneration allows the diagnosis of conservation status of fragments and estimating population parameters that are essential for management projects. This study evaluated the structure, diversity and dynamics of the tree regenerating component of a remnant of mixed ombrophilous forest, aiming to support management actions for this forest type. The study was developed at the Parque Estadual das Araucarias (PEAR), located in the western region of the state of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil. A total of 100 plots of 25 m(2) (0.25 ha) were allocated, all individuals with height = 1.0 m and DBH < 5 cm were sampled. Shannon's diversity index (H'), Pielou's equability index (J) and total natural regeneration rate (TNR) were estimated. We sampled 1,425 individuals from 99 species and 39 families, with an estimated total density of 5,700 individuals by hectare. The richest families were Fabaceae (13), Myrtaceae (10) and Lauraceae (7). The H' was 3.76 and the J was 0.80. The TNR rate ranged from 0.05 to 8.12%, highlighting Trichilia elegans, with the highest rate and Araucaria angustifolia with low potential for natural regeneration. The analysis of the results indicated a high diversity in the regenerating component of the PEAR compared to other studies, probably because the area presents itself as a successional mosaic due to past disturbances.

TI  - Native forest cover dynamics in the Guandu River hydrographic basin, Espirito Santo state, Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DE GESTAO AMBIENTAL E SUSTENTABILIDADE-GEAS
AB  - Objective: We aimed to evaluate the temporal dynamics of the native forest cover in the Guandu River hydrographic basin (GRHB) between the years 1985 and 2020, using landscape ecology metrics.
   Methodology: The land cover and land use values from the MapBiomas project in the years 1985 and 2020 were used. The native forest fragments were classified according to their size, as C1 (< 5 ha), C2 (5-25 ha), C3 (25.1-50 ha), and C4 (> 50 ha). Landscape ecology metrics were calculated using the V-Late 2.0 extension in ArcGIS (R).
   Originality/Relevance: Study of the temporal dynamics of forest cover of hydrographic basins is essential to define strategic forest conservation and restoration actions aimed at protecting water resources.
   Results: The native forest cover of the GRHB increased by approximately 12%, with an increase in the number and average area of fragments. In general, the forest remnants became closer to each other and demonstrated a higher edge density. A high number of small fragments (< 5 ha) was verified and the largest fragments (> 50 ha) were the main factor responsible for the expansion of the native forest cover in the basin.
   Social/management contributions: Forest restoration actions in the GRHB should prioritize the connectivity of smaller fragments. In addition to supporting forest restoration projects, the results contribute to the application of methodologies to implement water resource management instruments, helping to define practices and policies for sustainable water use.

TI  - Morphometric indices in the Curu?-Una River sub-basin as potential indicators for forest restoration in hydrographic mesoregions in the Central Amazon
T2  - BRAGANTIA
AB  - Watersheds are planning units because they are delimited by topographic divisions formed by a main river and its tributaries, in which water drainage is channeled into a course of greater water volume, such as the Amazon basin, which flows into the Atlantic Ocean. The objective of this work was to analyze the morphometry of the hydrographic sub-basin of the Curua-Una River (SBHRM), that integrates the Curua-Una hydrographic micro-region in western Para, Brazil, and its surroundings. Data from abiotic variables integrated in a geographic information system were used to identify the areas that most need restauration using production systems such as agroforestry as part of a forest restoration process, necessary to land degradation in the sub-basin and its surroundings. It was found that the sub-basin of the Curua-Una River has a more elongated shape, confirmed by the circularity index, compactness coefficient, and shape factor. It is a fifth order sub-basin with a densely branched drainage network with a low probability of flooding due to the predominance of undulating relief. The morphometric characteristics present conditions that can be used in anthropic areas integrated into production systems such as agroforestry. The existence of tree species such as andiroba, copaiba, and the Brazil nut tree in the Tapajos basin, as inventoried by the Project RADAMBRAZIL, must be included in agroforestry arrangements in the recovery of degraded areas in western Para.

TI  - Resource Availability and Use in Restored, Unmanaged, and Aquaculture Mangrove Ecosystems in Indonesia
T2  - RESOURCES-BASEL
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems are some of the most productive on our planet but have declined globally by 30-50%. Many species rely on mangrove habitats; thus, their conversion to aquaculture farms has led to noticeable losses in commodities such as wild fish stocks. This study aimed to assess the influence of aquaculture and restoration projects on the ecosystem's ability to provide resources. We collected data on mangrove vegetation (i.e., biomass, richness, and abundance), soil nutrients (i.e., organic carbon, aluminium, and nitrogen), crab abundance, and fishing pressure at six sites. We set up 15 plots at each site and collected data between May and July 2023. Via generalised linear mixed models, we found that the abundance and richness of crabs was significantly higher in aquaculture plots than in non-aquaculture plots. Aquaculture plots had higher topsoil aluminium, higher topsoil and subsoil nitrogen, and lower topsoil carbon than non-aquaculture sites. Restored sites had less nitrogen in the topsoil than unmanaged sites. The biomass did not change between aquaculture, restored, and unmanaged plots. We found a negative correlation between crab abundance and richness and mangrove diameter at breast height (DBH), suggesting that the species of crabs present preferred areas with propagules for feeding (e.g., Grapsidae crabs). The content of nitrogen in the subsoil was positively correlated with mangrove richness, diversity, and height, suggesting the importance of nitrogen availability for mangrove growth. The content of aluminium in the subsoil was negatively correlated with the content of organic carbon in both the topsoil and subsoil, suggesting the detrimental effect of aluminium on the carbon cycle. Fishing practices were observed at all sites during the data collection period. Despite the lack of significant impact on most vegetation parameters and the limited differences between managed and unmanaged sites, key variables such as soil aluminium, carbon, and nitrogen contents and crab assemblages exhibited high variability, highlighting the complex interactions within mangrove ecosystems.

TI  - Toward an ecological understanding of a flood-pulse system lake in a tropical ecosystem: Food web structure and ecosystem health
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB  - Tonle Sap Great Lake (TSL) is the largest freshwater lake ecosystem in Southeast Asia and receptacle of impressive biodiversity. However, there is surprisingly little knowledge of its ecosystem structure and functioning. The main objective of the current work was to quantify the food web structure and assess the ecosystem health status of the TSL system by constructing the first holistic food web model using Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE). The results indicate that the ecotrophic efficiency (EE) values were very high for most of functional groups (EE > 0.5) except molluscs (0.146) and macrophytes (0.102). The high EE values together with the MTI (Mixed Trophic Impact) analysis indicated the overexploitation and degradation of fishery resources in the TSL system. The discrete trophic levels varied from 1 (phytoplankton, macrophytes and detritus) to 3.17 (snakehead). The energy transfer in the TSL food web was based mostly on the detrital food chain (77.9%) rather than the grazing food chain (22.1%), with an average transfer efficiency of 8.27%. The ratios of total primary production to respiration (TPP/TR) and to biomass (TPP/TB) were 1.23 and 2.04, respectively, while the Ascendency and Finn cycling index (FCI) of the system were estimated at 27.4% and 23.62%. Nevertheless, the connectance index (CI: 0.253) and system omnivory index (SOI: 0.075) were in-between compared to other lake ecosystems, which indicated that the food web structure was characterized by linear, rather than web-like features. Systematic analysis and indicators suggested that the ecosystem was a relatively healthy ecosystem achieving a certain stage of maturity, albeit with a vulnerable food web structure. Accordingly, some ecosystem-based strategies are presented for the improvement of fishery management and ecosystem conservation in TSL. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Global carbon dioxide removal rates from forest landscape restoration activities
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Background: Forest landscape restoration (FLR) has been adopted by governments and practitioners across the globe to mitigate and adapt to climate change and restore ecological functions across degraded landscapes. However, the extent to which these activities capture CO2 with associated climate mitigation impacts are poorly known, especially in geographies where data on biomass growth of restored forests are limited or do not exist. To fill this gap, we developed biomass accumulation rates for a set of FLR activities (natural regeneration, planted forests and woodlots, agroforestry, and mangrove restoration) across the globe and global CO2 removal rates with corresponding confidence intervals, grouped by FLR activity and region/climate.
   Results: Planted forests and woodlots were found to have the highest CO2 removal rates, ranging from 4.5 to 40.7 t CO2 h(-1) year(-1) during the first 20 years of growth. Mangrove tree restoration was the second most efficient FLR at removing CO2, with growth rates up to 23.1 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) the first 20 years post restoration. Natural regeneration removal rates were 9.1-18.8 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) during the first 20 years of forest regeneration, followed by agroforestry, the FLR category with the lowest and regionally broad removal rates (10.8-15.6 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1)). Biomass growth data was most abundant and widely distributed across the world for planted forests and natural regeneration, representing 45% and 32% of all the data points assessed, respectively. Agroforestry studies, were only found in Africa, Asia, and the Latin America and Caribbean regions.
   Conclusion: This study represents the most comprehensive review of published literature on tree growth and CO2 removals to date, which we operationalized by constructing removal rates for specific FLR activities across the globe. These rates can easily be applied by practitioners and decision-makers seeking to better understand the positive climate mitigation impacts of existing or planned FLR actions, or by countries making restoration pledges under the Bonn Challenge Commitments or fulfil ling Nationally Determined Contributions to the UNFCCC, thereby helping boost FLR efforts world-wide.

TI  - Seed rain into a degraded tropical peatland in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Forested tropical peatlands in Southeast Asia are important as global carbon stores and for biodiversity conservation yet are being rapidly converted to agriculture or degraded into fire-prone non-forest vegetation. Although large areas have been abandoned, there is little evidence for the subsequent recovery of forest. As part of a study of forest degradation and recovery, we assessed seed rain into an area of non-forest regrowth in degraded tropical peatland in the former Mega Rice Project: an abandoned attempt to convert 1 million hectares of tropical peatland for rice production in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Fifty seed traps were placed in the open and fifty under trees. Seeds were collected every 15 +/- 3 days for 1 year. Seed rain and foreign seed rain (species different from the tree over the trap) was higher for traps under trees (1127.8 seeds and 465.0 seeds m(-2) y(-1) respectively) than for traps in the open (95.2 seeds m(-2) y(-1)). Foreign seed rain consisted largely of species that also grow in mature forest, but was dominated by a few abundant wind-dispersed species (particularly from the woody liana, Uncaria elliptica, and the tree, Combretocarpus rotundatus) and the majority of animal-dispersed foreign seeds were found under trees. While seed rain both in the open and under trees appears sufficient for the development of woody plant cover, diversity will be limited in the early stages of succession. We recommend enrichment planting with species that would have been present before forest destruction but are not represented in the current seed rain. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Soil organic carbon, microbial biomass and enzyme activities responses to natural regeneration in a tropical dry region in Northeast Brazil
T2  - CATENA
AB  - Natural regeneration may be a cost-effective method for recovering areas previously used for intensive agricultural purposes. Plant diversity in the succession periods has been well documented; however, less attention has been paid to the changes in soil attributes, which may work as an instrument for the validation of regeneration methods. The present study is part of a broader interdisciplinary research project assessing the effects of natural regeneration on biodiversity and the quality of the soil. We investigated the effects of natural regeneration on the physicochemical attributes of the soil, as well as on soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and enzyme attributes. We assessed three stages and five areas of each natural regeneration stage (early-ER, intermediate-IR and late-LR) in two layers: 0-5 and 5-10 cm. The present study found a 20% SOC increase due to natural regeneration. In the first layer, SOC, urease, acid phosphatase and arylsulfatase absolute activities were significantly higher in the two older natural regeneration stages (IR and LR) than those found in the ER stage. We found a reduction in specific enzyme activities per SOC unit in the ER areas. Natural regeneration influenced SOC and MBC, the absolute enzyme activities, and the specific enzymes per SOC unit, mainly in the surface layer. The present study provided some of the first data concerning the beneficial effects of natural regeneration on the quality of soil as measured through enzyme activity, SOC and MBC in a tropical dry region in Northeastern Brazil.

TI  - Facilitation and competition influence succession in a subtropical old field
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
AB  - The effects of neighboring vegetation and soil fertility on the establishment, survival and growth of tree species were studied in a subtropical old-field area in south Brazil. Seed damage, germination and seedling establishment of four tree species plus growth and survival of two transplanted tree species were monitored under factorial combinations of the following treatments: (1) pioneer vegetation (presence and absence); (2) soil fertility (addition of NPK and control). Facilitation was the main process affecting plant performance. The presence of pioneer vegetation significantly improved germination, establishment, growth and survival of most study species. Around 90% of sown seeds were damaged and the removal of pioneer vegetation significantly increased seed damage for all species studied, decreased germination in three out of four species, and decreased establishment in one species. Moreover a significantly higher seedling growth rate of Inga virescens was found after the first year of the experiment in plots where vegetation was present. The presence of vegetation significantly increased seedling survival of I. virescens by protecting seedlings from leaf loss due to winter frosts. Competition was detected by the second year when a higher growth of transplanted seedlings of the species Araucaria angustifolia occurred in plots where vegetation was present and fertilizer were applied. A lower growth rate was detected in plots where vegetation was present but fertilizer was not applied. These results indicate a balance between competition for soil nutrients and protection by neighbor vegetation. Damage of seedlings by leaf cutter ants was an important barrier for plant survival. Damage occurred in 80% of the A. angustifolia seedlings and 58% of these damaged seedlings died. The presence of neighboring vegetation tended to protect seedlings from ant damage. Although competition occurred, facilitation seems to be the main process driving early successional changes in this subtropical old field. This was mainly due to the improvement of local microclimatic conditions and protection against herbivores by neighboring vegetation. Facilitation occurred during establishment and growth phases in a subtropical area that is considered a productive, low stress environment. Our results indicate that facilitation may be more frequent in productive environments than previously thought.

TI  - Litter as an Ecological Indicator of Forest Restoration Processes in a Dense Ombrophylous Lowland Forest
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate the influence of spacing, species richness, and sampling time on accumulated litter in forest restoration areas in the state of Espirito Santo, Brazil. The experiment was conducted under a randomized complete block design, in a subdivided plot scheme. Six treatments were evaluated, consisting of a combination of spacing levels and species richness. Accumulated litter samples were weighed and chemically analyzed to obtain nutrient concentrations. The variables analyzed in the restoration process, in general, did not influence litter biomass and nutrient concentrations. The time elapsed between restoration implantation and data sampling for the present study may have been insufficient for the occurrence of differences in variables evaluated. Despite the small amount of accumulated litter, it is of great importance for soil physical protection and fertility improvement, generating conditions for the stabilization of new forest species in the restoration area.

TI  - Biodiversity responses to land-use change in the equatorial Andes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Land-use change is a primary driver of biodiversity loss. Tropical ecosystems face rapid conversion rates due to the encroachment of agricultural lands and supply needs for goods and services from an increasing population and changing market demands. Measuring the effect of land conversion on species diversity is challenging due to incomplete and uneven knowledge of different taxonomical groups. Here, we contrast different metrics for measuring biodiversity loss across three land-use typologies: secondary forest, agroforestry, and monoculture for five taxonomic groups: birds, frogs, fish, dung beetles, and macroinvertebrates in the Andean piedmont forests of the western equatorial Andes. Albeit our limited and uneven sample in space and time, we found that rarity, Non Metric Multidimensional Scaling, and Multinomial Classification Model (i.e., classifications of habitat specialists and generalists) constitute a more sensitive set of indicators to assess land-use change impacts on tropical mountain biodiversity compared to classical metrics. Likewise, our results showed that land-use intensification influenced community assemblages in the five taxonomic groups. These non-classical biodiversity metrics can provide better insight into the effect of land conversion on these highly biodiverse ecosystems composed of many rare species.

TI  - Evaluation and characterization of passive restoration of an Atlantic forest tree community with focus on the understory
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - In this study, we evaluated the potential of the passive restoration approach in recovering the original forest in a region particularly important for the conservation of the Atlantic forest biodiversity. This biome has been fragmented and reduced to only 11.7% of its original range and currently its conservation relies considerably on the spontaneous regeneration of native forests in abandoned agricultural lands, a widespread phenomenon referred to in this study as passive restoration. We compare the regeneration strata of a 25-year-old secondary forest (restoration site) and of a primary forest (reference site) based on tree and shrub data in order to evaluate and characterize passive restoration in the surroundings of the Iguacu National Park, in western Parana State, Brazil. We recorded 589 individuals from 43 species in the restoration site and 831 individuals from 48 species in the reference site. We found smaller values of density, diversity, proportions of individuals from zoochoric and non-pioneer species; and a distinct floristic composition at the restoration site. However, plant diameter, species richness and proportions of zoochoric and non-pioneer species did not differ between sites, suggesting an appropriate successional trajectory, and the potential for the application of the passive restoration approach in the region. We found a greater number of indicator species at the reference site and some primary forest specialists were not even found at the restoration site, showing the importance of the maintenance of primary forests in the fragmented landscape in order to allow passive restoration to recover original forest attributes.

TI  - Evaluation of eligible areas for forest CDM projects implementation in the Pardo River basin, in Minas Gerais, Brazil
T2  - NATIVA
AB  - An instrument for climate changes mitigation was proposed in Kyoto Protocol, ratified in 1997 - the Clean Development Mechanism - CDM - through which developed countries can meet their emission reduction goals by forestry projects financing in developing countries. For this, the starting point is to assess the CO2 sequestration potential of the eligible areas. In this sense, the objective of the present work was to evaluate the CO2 sequestration potential and carbon credits generation through forestry CDM projects in the Pardo river basin, Minas Gerais state. The methodology consisted of mapping the eligible and suitable areas for projects implementation, through orbital images multitemporal analysis, and the simulation of forest restoration and reforestation scenarios with eucalyptus species. For forest restoration projects, the CO2 sequestration potential is about 10,215,818 Mg, in 20 years, which could generate more than US $ 102,000,000 in carbon credits. For reforestation, the CO2 sequestration potential is about 12,000,000 Mg in six years, and would generate about US $ 120,000,000. A mixed scenario, with projects in both modalities, was considered ideal for the basin and the proposed methodology is feasible for prospective evaluation, and can be consolidated using local biomass parameters.

TI  - Connectivity value of Atlantic forest fragments: pathways towards enhancing biodiversity conservation
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - An accurate combination of remote sensing-based techniques with predictive modeling is critical to evaluate the effects of fragmentation on forest fragments' connectivity. Our study aimed to classify the landscape and evaluate its ecology in a highly fragmented region within the Atlantic Forest. We combined satellite image-based data, and spatial data of a region in Southern Brazil with Random Forest (RF) supervised algorithms. Using this combination, we defined the land use and native forest classes and estimated landscape metrics. Overall, native forest fragments varied widely, especially regarding their areas (ha), shape, and the number of core areas. Among all fragments, the one in the Rio Doce State Forest Park (PERD) holds the largest area, most regular shape, and the highest number of core habitats in the study region. However, most (64.4%) of the fragments, especially the small ones (< 0.4 hectares), are close to each other (i.e., average distances up 100 m). Our findings demonstrate that the closely connected fragments may be potential candidates to enhance forest connectivity, and support ecological restoration plans in the study region. Further, we indicated that fragments like the PERD Park are a conservation priority due to their importance in connecting smaller fragments.

TI  - The potential of the soil seed bank for the regeneration of a tropical urban forest dominated by bamboo
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
AB  - Isolated forest fragments are subject to natural and anthropogenic disturbances that can alter forest properties. Native bamboo species are favored by disturbances. Few studies have attempted to demonstrate the influence of bamboos regarding the availability of soil seed bank and their implications for management. The present study aims to evaluate whether the dominance and the maintenance of the forest in the early stages of succession has been facilitated by the structure of the local seed bank within an urban fragment of Atlantic forest in Brazil. We also evaluated the forest regeneration potential of the soil seed bank under a bamboo-dominated area and a control area. A total of 5181 (units) seeds were germinated, corresponding to 81 plant species in 31 families. Miconia cf cinnanomifolia was the most abundant species in the seed bank for both forests (72.6% in control and 43.9% in bamboo-dominant). Despite the low diversity and evenness found in both areas, the seed bank in the bamboo-dominated area had higher species richness and diversity, and a heterogeneous floristic composition of shrub and tree species when compared to the control area. In both areas early-successional species of trees and shrubs dominated the seed bank (>90%). The results are discussed in terms of the regeneration ability, and it is suggested that in spite the area being a remnant with disturbed forest patches invaded by bamboos, the soil seed bank still represents an important seed source for forest regeneration.

TI  - Ecosystem restoration after bauxite mining: favorable indicators for Technosols construction and soil management using liming and subsoiling
T2  - NEW FORESTS
AB  - Although its economic importance, bauxite mining causes the loss of natural ecosystems. In this sense, the Technosols building from materials made or modified by man, such as mine tailings, is necessary for recovering degraded areas. Additionally, the Technosols management, such as subsoiling and liming, increases chances of plants establishment and growth. In this study, a degraded area by bauxite mining with constructed Technosol in the Eastern Amazon, Brazil, was tested under three different soil management treatments: Technosol-1 (Tech-1), Liming only; Technosol-2 (Tech-2), Subsoiling + 200 g of NPK in the pit; Technosol-3 (Tech-3), Scarification + liming + all Tech-2 procedures. In every treatment and in a reference forest (R-forest), 8 years after the initial seedling planting, three types of indicators were assessed: structural (horizontal vegetation structure, density of natural regeneration, and soil cover), compositional (species diversity, ecological groups, and dispersal syndromes), and functional (chemical properties of Technosols and dry matter and nutrients from the litter stock). The most representative species in all treatments were Croton matourensis and Vismia guianensis, both coming from the natural regeneration and common in early successional stages. Coverage rates in all treatments showed less than 5% of exposed Technosol and the diversity, ecological group, and dispersal syndrome indexes followed a successful trajectory along 8 years. Tech-2 and Tech-3 presented the best chemical attributes and nutrients in the litter stock, but they would probably last several decades to reach the R-forest attributes. Thus, subsoiling alone or with liming provided the best chemical results for soil, litter, and vegetation performance, being recommended to speed up restoration of degrades areas by bauxite mining in the Amazon.

TI  - The Role of Protected Areas in the Avoidance of Anthropogenic Conversion in a High Pressure Region: A Matching Method Analysis in the Core Region of the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Global efforts to avoid anthropogenic conversion of natural habitat rely heavily on the establishment of protected areas. Studies that evaluate the effectiveness of these areas with a focus on preserving the natural habitat define effectiveness as a measure of the influence of protected areas on total avoided conversion. Changes in the estimated effectiveness are related to local and regional differences, evaluation methods, restriction categories that include the protected areas, and other characteristics. The overall objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of protected areas to prevent the advance of the conversion of natural areas in the core region of the Brazil's Cerrado Biome, taking into account the influence of the restriction degree, governmental sphere, time since the establishment of the protected area units, and the size of the area on the performance of protected areas. The evaluation was conducted using matching methods and took into account the following two fundamental issues: control of statistical biases caused by the influence of covariates on the likelihood of anthropogenic conversion and the non-randomness of the allocation of protected areas throughout the territory (spatial correlation effect) and the control of statistical bias caused by the influence of auto-correlation and leakage effect. Using a sample design that is not based on ways to control these biases may result in outcomes that underestimate or overestimate the effectiveness of those units. The matching method accounted for a bias reduction in 94-99% of the estimation of the average effect of protected areas on anthropogenic conversion and allowed us to obtain results with a reduced influence of the auto-correlation and leakage effects. Most protected areas had a positive influence on the maintenance of natural habitats, although wide variation in this effectiveness was dependent on the type, restriction, governmental sphere, size and age group of the unit.

TI  - Assessment of ecological indicators in restoration by applied nucleation with different ages
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
AB  - Monitoring through good ecological indicators is still a challenge in assessing the results of ecological restoration in Brazil. In this sense, the aim of this work was to evaluate ecological indicators of the restoration process by applied nucleation implanted two years and seven years ago in the south of Brazil. A total of twenty 5 m x 5 m plots were evaluated in each area, arranged systematically under the nuclei. All shrub-tree individuals with height greater than 30 cm were counted and identified. The species were classified according to the dispersion syndrome and shade tolerance. Shannon's diversity and Pielou's evenness indices were calculated. Canopy coverage was verified by a convex spherical densiometer. Analysis of variance (p<0.05) were used to compare floristic composition, structure and function group indicators between areas. We adjusted simple linear regression models between the area occupation of the nucleus and the richness and number of individuals of natural regeneration to verify the nuclei expansion. The results showed greater richness, diversity and canopy coverage percentage in the area with applied nucleation from seven years. There was a significant difference for composition, structure and function group indicators. The simple linear regression model for the nucleus area as a function of the number of individuals was significant (p<0.05). We concluded that the nuclei implanted seven years ago are being effective for ecological restoration. The post-implantation chronological period should be considered as a variable of influence on the effectiveness of the restoration.

TI  - Ecological indicators of forest regeneration in areas of Araucaria Forest in South Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Assessing and monitoring are essential steps for the restoration process. These processes require ecological indicators to evaluate the re-establishment of the ecological processes that maintain the forest dynamics. However, the majority of studies involving ecological indicators developed in Brazil are aimed at monitoring active restorations, with specific indicators. In this context, the current study aimed to characterize the seed rain and litterfall, and verify their applicability as relevant ecological indicators in the evaluation of the passive forest restoration process in riparian forest. These areas are of different ages, post-harvest of Pinus taeda L. stands, within the Araucaria Forest, which is part of an important global hotspot for biodiversity conservation. We evaluated the floristic composition of the seed rain and the measurement of the litter supply at five different ages of the restoration process, for one year. The efficiency of these indicators was defined by means of a classification based on aspects and descriptors. We hypothesized that these two indicators are suitable for assessing and monitoring the restoration trajectory and can describe the reestablishment of ecological processes in anthropized areas. These indicators are important because they determine the restoration of the functionality of altered ecosystems. The results showed that both are good indicators, mainly due to the sensitivity and scale criteria, since the indicators showed seasonal differences in the evaluated period. They can be used as scientific indicators for monitoring forest restoration in altered ecosystems.

TI  - Birds as predators in tropical agroforestry systems
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Insectivorous birds reduce arthropod abundances and their damage to plants in some, but not all, studies where predation by birds has been assessed. The variation in bird effects may be due to characteristics such as plant productivity or quality, habitat complexity, and/or species diversity of predator and prey assemblages. Since agroforestry systems vary in such characteristics, these systems provide a good starting point for understanding when and where we can expect predation by birds to be important. We analyze data from bird exclosure studies in forests and agroforestry systems to ask whether birds consistently reduce their arthropod prey base and whether bird predation differs between forests and agroforestry systems. Further, we focus on agroforestry systems to ask whether the magnitude of bird predation (1) differs between canopy trees and understory plants, (2) differs when migratory birds are present or absent, and (3) correlates with bird abundance and diversity. We found that, across all studies, birds reduce all arthropods, herbivores, carnivores, and plant damage. We observed no difference in the magnitude of bird effects between agroforestry systems and forests despite simplified habitat structure and plant diversity in agroforests. Within agroforestry systems, bird reduction of arthropods was greater in the canopy than the crop layer. Top-down effects of bird predation were especially strong during censuses when migratory birds were present in agroforestry systems. Importantly, the diversity of the predator assemblage correlated with the magnitude of predator effects; where the diversity of birds, especially migratory birds, was greater, birds reduced arthropod densities to a greater extent. We outline potential mechanisms for relationships between bird predator, insect prey, and habitat characteristics, and we suggest future studies using tropical agroforests as a model system to further test these areas of ecological theory.

TI  - The human-macaque interface: Conservation implications of current and future overlap and conflict in lore Lindu National Park, Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST
AB  - Here, I examine overlapping resource use of forest and cultivated resources by villagers and tonkean macaques (Macaca tonkeana) in Lore Lindu National Park, Sulawesi, Indonesia. An integrative research design was employed, using methods from primatology and cultural anthropology, in conjunction with quantitative measurements of cacao crop loss. The results indicate that the current patterns of overlapping resource use may not be severely affecting the tonkean macaques or villagers in Lindu. The research does, however, point to possible future difficulty if cacao crop raiding by macaques increases, and as changing socioeconomic trends and loss of traditional folklore result in further modification of macaque habitat. Successful strategies to ameliorate human-macaque conflict may require efforts aimed at the adoption of alternative buffer zone crops that use shade-management systems, the deliberate protection of important macaque food species, and increasing local tolerance to crop raiding by exploring the role of macaques in forest regeneration.

TI  - A Matter of Scale: Historical and Environmental Factors Structure Anuran Assemblages from the Upper Madeira River, Amazonia
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Biogeographical history and current ecological interactions have usually been addressed separately to explain the spatial distribution of patterns of biodiversity. In this study, we evaluated the integrated effects of biogeographical and environmental factors in structuring the diurnal amphibian anuran assemblages of the upper Madeira River, southwestern Amazonia. We used a sampling design involving 98 standardized units, distributed across seven locations covering both banks of the river's course in the state of Rondonia, Brazil. We conducted searches for frogs in three campaigns between February 2010 and February 2011, aiming to: (1) evaluate the effect of the Madeira River as a biogeographic barrier at the species-assemblage level, and (2) test the influence of seven environmental variables (vegetation structure, vegetation cover, soil nutrients, soil structure, slope, elevation, and distance from the river bank) on the spatial structure of the frog assemblages, separately on each riverbank. Thirteen species of diurnal frogs were recorded, six of which were restricted to one of the river margins. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated a significant effect of the river as a barrier. Multiple regression analyses suggested that the environmental variables structuring frog assemblages differ on either side of the river. We found that both historical elements (on a regional scale) and environmental factors (at a local scale) shaped the occurrence and distribution of frog species in the study area.

TI  - Structure and management of cocoa agroforestry systems in Central Sulawesi across an intensification gradient
T2  - TROPICAL RAINFORESTS AND AGROFORESTS UNDER GLOBAL CHANGE: ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC VALUATIONS
AB  - Central Sulawesi is a major cocoa producing region in Indonesia. Nevertheless; very little is known about the basic socio-economic and pedological properties of cocoa agroforestry systems in the region. In the vicinity of Lore Lindu National Park (LLNP), 144 cocoa plots covering an intensification gradient were selected for an intensive 1-year cocoa management study including a subset of 48 plots for extended soil analyses.
   Local cocoa plots are mostly established by converting natural forest lands, and they are increasingly intensified by removal of their natural shade tree cover. Soil nutrient status is mostly sufficient but total P availability and stagnant soil water conditions limit yields. Phytosanitary and soil amelioration management are often suboptimal and may need to be improved. Marketing of cocoa beans takes place mostly via small traders from the same village. Farm gate prices account for around 70% of world prices. No price incentives exist for enhancing bean quality by better processing.
   Cocoa bean yield varies strongly by season. A structural intensification index integrating data on canopy closure; cocoa tree density; number of native forest trees and number of intercrops, was positively correlated with yields. Labour input also increases yield. Labour input was not correlated with the structural intensification index but expenses for material inputs and hired labour as well as biophysical parameters as rainfall and phosphor content were. The strong economic incentive for farmers to intensify cocoa agroforests threatens local biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Afforestation effects on vegetation structure and diversity of grasslands in southern Brazil: The first years
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
AB  - We evaluated the effects of afforestation on the composition and structure of southern Brazilian subtropical grasslands directly beneath tree plantations, in pastures, and in permanent protection areas near watercourses. Cover of plants was registered in 120 plots of 1 m(2) in grasslands located at two distances from small watercourses in pasture and eucalypt plantation areas within a livestock ranching landscape. Livestock density is reduced in plantation areas. Species composition beneath tree plantations was significantly different from both pasture and nearby permanent protection areas. Permanent protection areas near plantations were also compositionally different from pastures. Eucalypt plantation was the environment type where ruderals were most abundant. Growth form cover distribution in pasture areas showed a consistent pattern, with graminous herbs being the most common growth form followed by prostrate herbs, prostrate subshrubs, and standing subshrubs. In plantation areas, the dominance of the graminoid herb growth form increased markedly, as well as standing herbs. These increases occurred mainly at the expense of prostrate herbs and subshrubs, which were significantly reduced. Plot-level species density was significantly affected by distance from watercourse and, more importantly, was significantly influenced by the interaction between management regime and distance to watercourse. It was reduced in eucalypt plantations relative to permanent protected areas. Current management of eucalypt plantations in southern Brazil produce unsuitable conditions for grassland species to thrive within plantations. Livestock densities <1.0 animal unit ha(-1) in eucalypt plantations undermines the ability of surrounding permanent protection areas to act as ecological networks for biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Agroforestry systems, nutrients in litter and microbial activity in soils cultivated with coffee at high altitude
T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
AB  - Agroforestry systems are an alternative option for sustainable production management. These systems contain trees that absorb nutrients from deeper layers of the soil and leaf litter that help improve the soil quality of the rough terrain in high altitude areas, which are areas extremely susceptible to environmental degradation. The aim of this study was to characterize the stock and nutrients in litter, soil activity and the population of microorganisms in coffee (Coffea arabica L.) plantations under high altitude agroforestry systems in the semi-arid region of the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. Samples were collected from the surface litter together with soil samples taken at two depths (0-10 and 10-20 cm) from areas each subject to one of the following four treatments: agroforestry system (AS), native forest (NF), biodynamic system (BS) and coffee control (CT). The coffee plantation had been abandoned for nearly 15 years and, although there had been no management or harvesting, still contained productive coffee plants. The accumulation of litter and mean nutrient content of the litter, the soil nutrient content, microbial biomass carbon, total carbon, total nitrogen, C/N ratio, basal respiration, microbial quotient, metabolic quotient and microbial populations (total bacteria, fluorescent bacteria group, total fungi and Trichoderma spp.) were all analyzed. The systems that were exposed to human intervention (AS and BS) differed in their chemical attributes and contained higher levels of nutrients when compared to NF and CT. BS for coffee production at high altitude can be used as a sustainable alternative in the high altitude zones of the semi-arid region in Brazil, which is an area that is highly susceptible to environmental degradation.

TI  - Forest transitions in tropical landscapes: A test in the Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - Analyzing temporal changes in forest amount and configuration is paramount to better design future forest management interventions. Such analyses are especially required for tropical biomes, which are usually subject to dynamic and heterogeneous land uses. Recent studies have suggested that many tropical biomes are passing through the process of "forest transition", i.e. an overall change from forest loss to forest gain. However, this hypothesis remains scarcely tested, due to the difficulty of obtaining detailed, quantitative historical records of forest cover. In this study, we investigate 38 years of land use change in Brazil's Atlantic Forest, a biodiversity hotspot, from 1976 to 2014, using multitemporal datasets from aerial photographs and satellite images. We classified the historical series to produce land use maps and calculated a set of landscape metrics, including total forest cover, patch size, patch shape and patch connectivity. Our results indicated non-linear changes through time in forest loss and gain and also in landscape structure, which can be classified into two distinct periods. The first period (1976-1996) was marked by expressive forest loss and fragmentation, whereas the second (1996-2014) was characterized by a much less intense forest dynamics, with little deforestation being balanced by forest regeneration. We attribute the forest dynamics observed to temporal changes in socioeconomic factors, such as increasing human settlements and changes in environmental protection policies. Our results show that current forests are a heterogeneous mosaic of forests with different ages, and support the hypothesis that forest transition is occurring in Atlantic Forest landscapes.

TI  - The Nature of Seedling Assemblages in a Fragmented Tropical Landscape: Implications for Forest Regeneration
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Whether aging forest fragments are able to recover original assemblages or progressively move toward impoverished successional stages remains as an open question. This study tested the hypothesis that seedling assemblages in forest fragments differ from those across mature forest stands and examined to what extent the uncovered patterns supported the notion that edge-affected habitats tend to support impoverished tree assemblages dominated by pioneer species. We contrasted a series of small forest remnants (391ha) to old-growth stands located in the largest (ca 3500ha) and best preserved forest remnant in northeastern Brazil and found that tree seedling assemblages inhabiting forest fragments exhibited reduced species richness (up to 50%) at different spatial scales in comparison to seedling assemblages in mature forest and adult assemblages in both fragments and mature forest stands. Moreover, ordination analyses clearly segregated fragment seedling assemblages in taxonomic/functional terms and segregation correlated to the richness of pioneer species. Seedlings of pioneer species and those bearing medium-sized seeds (0.61.5cm) increased in fragments, whereas large-seeded species (1.53.0cm) were reduced by more than a half. Such a multiple-scale replacement of the old-growth flora by pioneers was also confirmed by an indicator species analysis and the resulting pioneer indicator species. Our results suggest that small forest fragments support impoverished and distorted seedling assemblages. This floristic/functional drift implies that forest remnants or edge-affected habitats tend to be dominated by a small set of pioneer tree species rather than supporting a substantial portion of the old-growth flora as do mature forest stands.

TI  - NATIVE FOREST COVER DYNAMICS IN THE GUANDU RIVER HYDROGRAPHIC BASIN, ESPIRITO SANTO STATE, BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA DE GESTAO AMBIENTAL E SUSTENTABILIDADE-GEAS
AB  - Objective: We aimed to evaluate the temporal dynamics of the native forest cover in the Guandu River hydrographic basin (GRHB) between the years 1985 and 2020, using landscape ecology metrics.
   Methodology: The land cover and land use values from the MapBiomas project in the years 1985 and 2020 were used. The native forest fragments were classified according to their size, as C1 (< 5 ha), C2 (5-25 ha), C3 (25.1-50 ha), and C4 (> 50 ha). Landscape ecology metrics were calculated using the V-Late 2.0 extension in ArcGIS((R)).
   Originality/Relevance: Study of the temporal dynamics of forest cover of hydrographic basins is essential to define strategic forest conservation and restoration actions aimed at protecting water resources.
   Results: The native forest cover of the GRHB increased by approximately 12%, with an increase in the number and average area of fragments. In general, the forest remnants became closer to each other and demonstrated a higher edge density. A high number of small fragments (< 5 ha) was verified and the largest fragments (> 50 ha) were the main factor responsible for the expansion of the native forest cover in the basin.
   Social/management contributions: Forest restoration actions in the GRHB should prioritize the connectivity of smaller fragments. In addition to supporting forest restoration projects, the results contribute to the application of methodologies to implement water resource management instruments, helping to define practices and policies for sustainable water use.

TI  - Topsoil for restoration: Resprouting of root fragments and germination of pioneers trigger tropical dry forest regeneration
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Tropsoil translocation has been effective for the restoration of plant communities, but until recently this method had not been used for tropical dry forest restoration. We tested different methods of topsoil deposition for restoring a dry forest on an abandoned limestone quarry. We also tested the effects of irrigation during the first dry season after topsoil deposition. The study was conducted in the Federal District of Brazil. A 2.1-ha area was cleared of vegetation, and the topsoil from that site was deposited on an exotic pasture field 1.4 km away. First, a secondary forest was clear-cut, and the first 30 cm of topsoil were removed and translocated. The soil was transported in dump trucks to the deposition site, which had been scarified in advance, and deposited by either forming 1.25-m-tall mounds or by leveling the soil into a 40-cm or 20-cm deep layer using a hydraulic excavator. The seed bank and the availability of root and stem fragments in the soil were both surveyed. The origin of the regenerants was categorized as either from seed or resprouting. We estimated vegetation cover for each life form, and measured all trees and lianas. After six months, 74% of the tree individuals and 60% of the liana individuals came from resprouting. Ruderal herbs and shrubs germinated from seeds. After 28 months, there were 51 species of trees, 8 species of lianas, 12 species of shrubs, and 34 species of herbs in the deposition treatments. The three deposition treatments were thickly covered with herbaceous/shrubby species, and had nine times the number of species (44 vs. 5) and five times the tree density (1.17 ind./m(2) vs. 0.25 ind./m(2)) as the non deposition control. Tree survival was relatively high in both the non-irrigated and irrigated treatments. The total cost of topsoil translocation was 9604 USD, and the output was 0.43 ha deposited/ha excavated when forming mounds of soil, 5951 USD and output of 0.75 when leveling to a 40-cm layer, and 3551 USD and 1.5 for a 20-cm layer of deposited material. However, deposition and transportation costs are fixed costs of establishing a new quarry that can be deducted from the total cost of restoration. Topsoil translocation was effective in kick-starting the succession process of a tropical dry forest. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Arrested development? Investigating the role of bamboo in Araucaria Forest succession in Southern Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY
AB  - Aims
   Assessing the role of a dominant native bamboo species on tree species diversity and structure in the medium term.
   Methods
   Over a 7-year period, we studied the natural regeneration of two dominant forest types in Southern Brazil (Araucaria Forest or AF; Bamboo Forest or BF) after a bamboo (Merostachys skvortzovii Send.) die-off between 2004 and 2006. The study was carried out in the Embrapa Research Station in Cacador, Santa Catarina State, Brazil.
   Important Findings
   The die-off provided ideal conditions for the establishment of several species and it kickstarted forest succession dynamics, which in turn affected regeneration diversity. Tree species richness was relatively stable with a transitory increase between 2007 and 2014 in both AF and BF. However, species richness rose in BF because of a relative increase in abundance of some species (especially late and secondary species) while a plunge in some pioneer species drove an increase in diversity. Overall, we found that BF has a lower diversity of recruits and that density declined over time, while AF is more diverse, with a more stable density. In BF, the bamboo die-off created optimal conditions for initial regeneration development (mainly fast-growing pioneer trees), which quickly transited to higher size classes. Yet, after this initial stage of pioneer recruitment, the number of recruits dropped followed by a virtual absence of growth regardless of the species group as a result of a quick bamboo reestablishment. As bamboo recreated a dense understory it reduced species diversity to original levels, suggesting a self-maintaining cycle that halts forest succession. On the other hand, the bamboo die-off had little impact on AF where a slow recruitment process typical of old-growth forests was observed. The results indicate that the die-off event had a temporary effect on species diversity i.e. restricted to forests where bamboos are dominant in a similar process described in other southern South American forests. As the first study to observe the medium-term forest dynamics related to bamboo die-off, we can conclude that when being dominant, native bamboos can hinder forest regeneration, maintaining lower levels of diversity and arresting forest succession that lasts well beyond the short-term, post-die-off effects. Many forest fragments in the region are dominated by bamboos, thus their potential for conservation is at risk and requires appropriate management.

TI  - A common-sense approach to tropical peat swamp forest restoration in Southeast Asia
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Tropical peat swamp forests (TPSFs) are found mainly in Southeast Asia and especially Indonesia. A total of 61% were lost between 1990 and 2015 and 6% remained in a pristine condition by 2015. Tropical peat swamps store vast amounts of carbon in their peat, but peat degradation, through drainage and fire, leads to high greenhouse gas emissions. This is gaining much international attention and, with it, policy initiatives and funding for restoration from local to landscape scales are being promoted. Unfortunately, although there is a now strong desire and need for TPSF restoration, methods are lacking. Ecological understanding is still at an early stage, and, even more so, in its applied use. There is an imbalance between the activities of TPSF restoration and sound ecological application. Furthermore, while many activities are underway and knowledge is being gained, these techniques are yet to be published. This article has been written to provide a common-sense, practical guide to tropical peatland forest restoration which summarizes what we know to date, while acknowledging the gaps in our understanding. Topics covered include species selection, land assessment, land selection, and appropriate nursery, transplanting, and monitoring methods. The authors make no apologies that in places this reads like a manual as, given the importance of tropical peatland recovery and the recent attention and funding opportunities available, it is essential we now provide techniques to restoration practitioners working on the ground, and a basic common-sense approach must be the starting point.

TI  - Impact of logging on the biodiversity and composition of flora and fauna in the mangrove forests of Bintuni Bay, West Papua, Indonesia
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The mangrove ecosystem of Bintuni Bay, West Papua, Indonesia is one of the largest in the world covering more than 250,000 ha. In the southern part of the bay, ? 82,120 ha of mangroves and surrounding area is managed and harvested under a 30-year rotation cycle to produce wood chips, with strict compliance to sustainable forest management standards. Flora and fauna have been continuously monitored for a period of 10 years (2009?2018), to assess the effectiveness of environmental management programs on the biological aspect. Mangrove flora and fauna recorded in the area comprise 28 true mangrove species representing 11 families along with 103 birds (40 families), 9 reptiles (6 families) and 7 mammals (5 families). Results confirm previous studies that secondary mangrove forest shows significant growth and recovery, with 5 true mangrove species consistently becoming dominant species in primary and secondary mangrove forest. Logging on mangroves significantly impacted the biodiversity of flora as Rhizopora apiculata become more dominant in secondary forest covering 69% of total species composition. Abundance and diversity of fauna in secondary forest was higher in younger forests as compared to older stands. About 18% of total fauna individual was categorized as keystone species. Fauna composition was not significantly impacted by logging most likely due to the abundance of habitat (untouched forest) remaining in the surrounding harvest area. With appropriate environmental management programs, impact of logging on mangrove forest can be minimized and the ecosystem could be restored effectively to provide adequate habitat for flora and fauna.

TI  - The impact of sustainability criteria on the costs and potentials of bioenergy production - Applied for case studies in Brazil and Ukraine
T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
AB  - The goal of this paper is to analyse the impact of the implementation of a certification system on the management system (costs) of and the availability of land (quantity) for bioenergy production. Twelve socio-economic areas of concern (food supply, child labour, (minimum) wages, employment, health care and education) and environmental areas of concern (soil erosion, depletion of fresh water resources, nutrient losses and soil nutrient depletion, pollution from chemicals and biodiversity) are included. Since there is no generally accepted definition of sustainability, a loose and strict set of criteria are defined. Short rotation coppice (SRC) production systems in Ukraine and South East Brazil in 2015 are taken as case studies. The results indicate that it seems feasible to produce biomass for energy purposes at reasonable cost levels and meeting strict sustainability criteria at the same time. The loose set of criteria has no impact on the costs of energy crop production, which are calculated to be 1.7 (sic) GJ(-1) in Brazil and 2.1 (sic) GJ(-1) in Ukraine. The strict set of criteria results in an increase of the costs of energy crop production by 42 % in Brazil and 14 % in Ukraine. In general, compliance with strict socio-economic criteria has a limited impact on the costs, because SRC is relatively labour extensive. Strict environmental criteria likely have a larger impact.

TI  - Individual Biomass and Carbon Equations for Mimosa scabrella Benth. (Bracatinga) in Southern Brazil
T2  - SILVA FENNICA
AB  - Mimosa scabrella Benth. is an important native species of southern Brazil widely used for energy and promising for reforestation carbon offsets. Quantification of biomass and carbon stock is valuable for both purposes. From a forest inventory conducted in southern Brazil, data of M. scabrella were analyzed. Thirty sample trees were felled, excavated and weighed in the field and brought to laboratory for biomass and carbon determination. The total aboveground biomass represented 85% of the tree biomass, while roots corresponded to 15%. Correlation matrix of diameter at 1.3 m height (D), tree height (H) versus total and compartment biomass (P) indicated strong association between tree dimensions and biomasses. Five regression models were tested and equations were fitted to data of five biomass compartments and total tree biomass. The best fitting model for total biomass was P = -0.49361 + 0.034865 x (DH)-H-2 whereas for the partial biomass of the compartments was InP = beta(0) + beta(1) x In(D) + beta(2) InH. Carbon concentration was statistically significantly different in foliage than in other compartments. Three approaches of calculating carbon stocks were evaluated and compared to actual data:) Estimated total biomass x weighted mean carbon concentration; 2) Estimated partial (compartment) biomass x compartment average carbon concentration; and 3) Carbon regression equations. No statistical difference was detected among them. It was concluded that biomass equations fitted in this study were accurate and useful for fuelwood and carbon estimations.

TI  - Enabling Factors of NTFP Business Development for Ecosystem Restoration: The Case of Tamanu Oil in Indonesian Degraded Peatland
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Indonesia's tropical peatlands are one of the world's largest carbon sinks, and they are facing the threat of extensive degradation and conversion. The Indonesian government is committed to peat restoration. However, restoration is still a costly, top-down approach lacking community participation, and is focused on the 3R scheme (rewetting, revegetation, and revitalization). Peatland restoration businesses are part of the innovative effort to finance this endeavor. Unfortunately, there is not much information available about the pre-conditions required to create a restoration business. This study seeks to understand the enabling conditions for the development of peatland restoration, with a focus on the tamanu oil business, and to assess whether the same situation might apply in the context of the restoration of degraded peatland. PEST analysis is used to describe the macro-environmental factors of the tamanu oil business and its development opportunities in degraded peatlands. Tamanu oil-based peat ecosystem restoration businesses offer good prospects because of the growing it has grown the bioenergy and biomedical markets, and they can cover a larger area of degraded peatland landscape. For tamanu oil businesses to succeed in peat ecosystem restoration, we recommend that policy documents at various levels include tamanu as a priority commodity for peatland restoration and alternative community businesses, followed by planting programs by all stakeholders. The government and social organizations must take positions as initiators and catalysts, establish a significant number and extent of pilot tamanu plantations, and create a mutually supportive business climate between entrepreneurs and peatland managers.

TI  - Spatial analysis and machine learning prediction of forest fire susceptibility: a comprehensive approach for effective management and mitigation
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Forest fires (FF) in tropical seasonal forests impact ecosystem. Addressing FF in tropical ecosystems has become a priority to mitigate impacts on biodiversity loss and climate change. The escalating frequency and intensity of FF globally have become a mounting concern. Understanding their tendencies, patterns, and vulnerabilities is imperative for conserving ecosystems and facilitating the development of effective prevention and management strategies. This study investigates the trends, patterns, and spatiotemporal distribution of FF for the period of 2001-2022, and delineates the forest fire susceptibility zones in Odisha State, India. The study utilized: (a) MODIS imagery to examine active fire point data; (b) Kernel density tools; (c) FF risk prediction using two machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF); (d) Receiver Operating Characteristic and Area Under the Curve, along with various evaluation metrics; and (e) a total of 19 factors, including three topographical, seven climatic, four biophysical, and five anthropogenic, to create a map indicating areas vulnerable to FF. The validation results revealed that the RF model achieved a precision exceeding 94 % on the validation datasets, while the SVM model reached 89 %. The estimated forest fire sus- ceptibility zones using RF , SVM techniques indicated that 20.14 % and 16.72 % of the area, respectively, fall under the " Very High Forest Fire " susceptibility class. Trend analysis reveals a general upward trend in forest fire occurrences (R 2 = 0.59), with a notable increase after 2015, peaking in 2021. Notably, Angul district was identified as the most affected area, documenting the highest number of forest fire incidents over the past 22 years. Additionally, forest fire mitigation plans have been developed by drawing insights from forest fire man- agement strategies implemented in various countries worldwide. Overall, this analysis provides valuable insights for policymakers and forest management authorities to develop effective strategies for forest fire prevention and mitigation.

TI  - AVIFAUNA AS A BIOINDICATOR FOR THE EVALUATION OF FOREST RESTORATION: A CASE STUDY IN A 40-YEAR OLD RESTORED FOREST IN VICOSA, MINAS GERAIS STATE
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
AB  - The point-counts method was used to evaluate the bird community in a small patch of forest (1 ha) restored through reforestation, with more than 40 years of deployment, in Vicosa, MG state. In total, 20 points were sampled in the reproductive period of the birds, during 2011. A total of 31 bird species and 160 contacts were recorded, and all species were identified as typical from a semi-deciduous forest and included five endemic species of the Atlantic forest biome. In the present study, the presence of frugivorous and insectivorous birds in the understory with little tolerance for open environments and strong insolation, suggests the good quality of the sampled habitat, confirming that the restored forest is in an advanced stage of succession. The results of this study also demonstrate that even in a small area, and with a few days of sampling, it is possible to obtain a rapid characterization of the bird community, being possible to associate it to the habitat conditions and allowing a safe evaluation of the success of a forest restoration project.

TI  - Does tree planting change minds? Assessing the use of community participation in reforestation to address illegal logging in West Kalimantan
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - Gunung Pa lung National Park in West Kalimantan, Indonesia has been persistently threatened by illegal logging for the past several decades. Subsequent fires have led to the encroachment of noxious grasses such as Imperata cylindrica, which have arrested succession to secondary forest within and around the park. Since 2009, local NGO Alam Sehat Lestari (ASRI) has reforested 20 hectares of degraded lmperata grassland within the park, with the goal of restoring forest area and decreasing the incidence of illegal logging inside the park by providing jobs and income to local people. In February 2013, a survey was conducted to assess the social impacts of the reforestation program, and to test the hypothesis that participation in reforestation can reduce instances of illegal logging through two pathways: (1) economic improvement for participants; (2) altering perceptions towards illegal logging. Structured interviews were conducted with 50 local residents, one-third of which identified as former illegal loggers, to gauge their perceptions towards forest conservation and illegal logging. The survey found that 80% of respondents believed that the reforestation program helped to reduce illegal logging in the park. However, the pathways through which this change occurred were different from those hypothesized. There was little evidence supporting the "perceptions change" pathway, but greater evidence supporting the "economic improvement" pathway through the medium of skill-building rather than direct economic improvement. Approximately 50% of participants reported engaging in self-directed tree planting activities post-involvement. These results suggest that forest restoration can effectively be used as a community-engagement tool to address illegal logging.

TI  - Accounting for twenty-first-century annual forest loss in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil using high-resolution global maps
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Deforestation in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest has been mapped since 1986 by SOS Mata Atlantica in partnership with the National Institute for Space Research under the project named Atlas dos Remanescentes Florestais da Mata Atlantica (SOSMA). The mapping results depict a worrying scenario of over-fragmentation and reduction of forest cover. The limited information provided, however, may underestimate deforestation in this Brazilian biome. We analysed the use of new high-resolution global deforestation datasets to quantify 10 years of deforestation in a heterogeneous landscape, where forest fragments are immersed in an agricultural and urban matrix. We set up a framework based on high-resolution satellite images available on Google Earth to visually inspect whether the areas of Global Forest Change (GFC) and SOSMA considered to be forest loss corresponded to actual deforestation. Results showed that no more than 21% of the forest loss area of the GFC were considered deforestation of Atlantic Forest remnants. More than 55% of the mapped patches (counts) were considered misclassifications. Misclassifications varied throughout the years, revealing the absence of a clear pattern, and they were considered dependent on the year. Forest plantation, forest regeneration, and grassland were the main sources of misclassifications. Despite errors, GFC accounted for significantly more deforestation than the official Brazilian mapping of the Atlantic Forest (SOSMA), showing that many small forest fragments that are important for maintaining biodiversity are being lost with little or no concern about it. We suggest that instead of sustaining an entire national programme that relies on acquiring and processing imagery, it would be better to work alongside a global programme such as the GFC by providing visual inspection, cross-validation, local knowledge, and further improvements.

TI  - Artificial perches increase bird-mediated seed rain in agricultural fallow area in southern Brazil
T2  - WEB ECOLOGY
AB  - One of the main barriers to restoration is the arrival of diaspores in degraded areas. However, this process can be hampered in open areas without trees in the landscape. For that, artificial perches are used to attract and provide a landing area for avian seed dispersers, to enhance seed rain. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of the distance of artificial perches in relation to a forest fragment on the diversity and composition of seed rain in an agricultural fallow area, including alien invasive plant species. We also aimed to record and characterize the bird species that potentially act as seed dispersers. Thus, we used artificial perches at three different distances from a forest fragment (5, 25, and 50 m). Four seed traps were arranged under the perches at each distance, and four control seed traps were interspersed with these and distanced at 7.5 m. Furthermore, we placed four seed traps inside the forest fragment at 5 m from the edge. We also carried out 80 h of focal observation of the avifauna that used artificial perches. A total of 24 655 seeds were sampled across all treatments. There was a significant difference in seed abundance and richness between artificial perches, control seed traps, and forest seed traps. Seed deposition increased with distance from the forest fragment (50, 25, and 5 m). An ordination procedure indicated the formation of three plant seed communities, with the forest community being most distinct. The invasive exotic species Pittosporum undulatum (Australian cheesewood) was the third most abundant in the seed rain. We observed 24 bird species from 12 families using artificial perches. The Tyrannidae family was the most represented. We showed that artificial perches are efficient structures for attracting birds, increasing the richness and abundance of seed species. Artificial perches at 25 and 50 m were more efficient possibly due to the provision of greater visibility for birds. Therefore, artificial perches are efficient in increasing seed rain in the fallow area but should be used with caution in landscapes with the presence of alien species. These findings contribute to increasing knowledge about overcoming the first barrier to ecological restoration, which is the arrival of diaspores in degraded areas, and showing the importance of birds in this process.

TI  - Genetic diversity among Hymenaea courbaril L. genotypes naturally occurring in the north of Mato Grosso State, Brazil
T2  - GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH
AB  - Hymenaea courbaril L. is a tropical tree species with economic and medicinal potential largely used in programs for the recovery of degraded areas. The use of molecular markers in genetic studies can help in the definition of forest restoration strategies. This study was conducted to analyze the genetic diversity among H. courbaril ('jatoba') genotypes naturally occurring in the north of Mato Grosso State, Brazil, using ISSR markers, aiming to contribute to the development of seed collection and seedling production strategies. Twenty-four H. courbaril individuals were sampled by collecting leaves for DNA extraction by the CTAB method. The individuals were genotyped using 14 ISSR primers, resulting in the amplification of 87 bands in total, 65 of which were polymorphic. The ISSR markers presented average polymorphism information content of 0.44. Dissimilarity values based on the Jaccard coefficient ranged from 0.12 to 0.52. The most divergent individuals were 3 and 22, whereas 14 and 19 were the most genetically similar. The UPGMA and Tocher clustering methods indicated the formation of four distinct groups, revealing genetic variability among the 24 H. courbaril genotypes. Therefore, all the evaluated genotypes can be used for seed collection and seedling production, but the most divergent individuals should be prioritized.

TI  - Direct seeding of native fruit tree species with economic benefits in a Brazilian Cerrado managed landscape
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Planting native species of economic interest is attractive to ecological restoration and biodiversity conservation because of their potential to generate income, products and services, combining socioeconomic and environmental demands. Direct seeding is a low-cost restoration technique compared to nursery-raised seedling planting, but there is still a lack of information about restoration success in different savanna habitat types in Brazil. We tested direct seeding of six fruit tree species of the Brazilian Cerrado in a landscape compressed by five management regimes used by traditional farmers in a rural settlement in northern Minas Gerais State, Southeastern Brazil. We monitored germination, survival, growth and establishment for three years. Of the 9000 seeds planted, 18.7% germinated, 29.8% survived and 8.9% were established three years after sowing. Eugenia dysenterica (Mart.) DC. and Dypterix alata Vogel had higher germination, survival and establishment rates and are, thus, the most appropriate species. E. dysenterica showed high rates on native and managed Cerrado and D. alata in agroforestry system, hillside fields and lower field. The species studied are well adapted to conditions of water scarcity and low soil fertility. However, phosphorus concentration may be a limiting factor to species growth. Our results suggest that direct seeding of fruit tree species of the Cerrado is promising to some species, and to others, the sowing should be done with more seeds, or using nursery-raised seedling. The planting of fruit trees could be a practice that allow smallholders farmers to increase biodiversity at the same time that could contribute to their livelihoods.

TI  - Assessing forest restoration effectiveness in the Seasonal Semideciduous Forest in the Upper Parana Atlantic Forest ecoregion using epigaeic ant assemblages
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Itaipu Hydroelectric Power Plant initiated a large reforestation programme after the expropriation of the areas destined for the formation of the reservoir. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of forest restoration of the Seasonal Semideciduous Forest in the Upper Parana Atlantic Forest ecoregion, Brazil, using epigaeic ant assemblages as bioindicators, by comparing ant species richness and composition in the Reservoir Protection Strip with adjacent areas, such as the primary forest of the Iguacu National Park and the Permanent Preservation Area located on a rural property and agricultural areas. In total, 171 ant species were identified. Ant species richness was higher in forest than in agricultural areas and did not differ among forest areas. However, ant species composition in forest areas, regardless of the restoration technique used, was not similar to the primary forest, possibly due to variation in forest recovery time. This study highlights the great value of the Iguacu National Park as a conservation unit. Also, it reveals that the efforts for the creation and maintenance of the Reservoir Protection Strip, which remains without anthropic interventions for years, might indeed lead to a complete recovery of the ant species composition over time, reinforcing their great importance for biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Assessing carbon sequestration in a high-diversity restoration plantation in the Atlantic Forest of southwestern Brazil
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB  - The United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration spotlights the urgent need for global efforts to restore ecosystems and mitigate climate change. In the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, restoration plantations often lack diversity, prompting inquiries into the optimal species count for maximal ecosystem productivity and services. This study aimed to assess aboveground carbon storage in a high-diversity restoration, comparing carbon stocks across 70 native tree species. We examined differences in carbon storage among species groups, employed regression models to project carbon accumulation over time, and identified top-performing species for carbon-focused projects in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Our high-diversity plantation, comprising 70 species, stored 46.04 MgC ha-1 at 8.5 years. The simulation revealed that planting only the most effective species could more than double carbon storage to 114.82 MgC ha-1 at the same age. Notably, filling group species consistently stored more carbon than diversity group species across all ages. We pinpointed seven top-performing filling group species: Guazuma ulmifolia, Croton urucurana, Mimosa scabrella, Trema micrantha, Solanum mauritianum, Croton floribundus, and Piptadenia gonoacantha and six from the diversity group: Inga vera, Zanthoxylum rhoifolium, Peltophorum dubium, Ceiba speciosa, Albizia polycephala, and Ficus enormis, for their superior carbon storage. Prioritizing these species can heighten carbon sequestration rates and effectively address the ongoing climate crisis. An approach combining selected filling and diversity group species emerges as the optimal strategy to achieve short- and long-term goals. Further research on species interactions and carbon stocks in scenarios with fewer planted species is imperative.

TI  - INTERCROPPING NATIVE TREE SPECIES OF SEASONAL SEMIDECIDUOUS FOREST WITH CASSAVA (Manihot sculenta Crantz) FOR RESTORATION OF RIPARIAN FOREST
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
AB  - Intercropping of trees and annual crops could be an important alternative for promoting forest restoration in small farms. The objective of this study was to evaluate the intercropping of cassava (Manihot sculenta Crantz) with native trees for restoration of natural forest in riparian areas in the western Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The experimental design was randomized blocks with six replications for comparing two restoration systems: pure afforestation and afforestation intercropped with cassava. It was evaluated the variables related to seedling development (height, crown diameter, crown cover, and height/crown diameter ratio), mortality and the economic impact were assessed for using cassava. No differences were found between treatments for any dendrometrical variable and mortality. Economic impact of the intercroppoing treatment was positive because costs for establishment of intercropped system were partially reduced by the income from the cassava crop, which covered 32% of total costs. Cassava income made final costs 19% lesser than restoration in the pure afforestation system.

TI  - The use of phytosociology in effective evaluation of forest restoration in a Mogi Guacu River degraded floodplain, Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
AB  - This study objective was to evaluate the effective revegetation in a Mogi Guagu River degraded floodplain area, located at Luiz Antonio municipality (21 degrees 31'S e 47 degrees 55'W), Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Two native riparian forest remnants (RIP1 and RIP2) and three 10-year-old reforested areas, planted of native species (R1, R2 and R3), were analyzed by using phytosociological describers of the arboreal stratum (trees with DBH >= 5 cm) as indicators. The arboreal stratum inventory was accomplished by 180 plots (10 x 10 m each), 60 representing every native forest and 20 for every reforested area. A total of 60 arboreal species was recorded, only six species (Cecropia hololeuca, Croton urucurana, Genipa americana, Inga striata, Nectandra megapotamica e Peltophorum dubium) occurring in all the five studied areas. Seventeen species were common to both native forests, and nine species were recorded in all the reforested areas. Sebastiania commersoniana and Guarea macrophylla were recorded in the native forests (RIP1 and RIP2), and Cecropia hololeuca, Croton urucurana and Inga striata occurring in all the reforested areas, were the species that best characterize the physiognomy of local diversity and were the most important among the studied species. The results showed that the rehabilitation of the areas made by the reforestation created conditions to implant forests with similar structures of the adjacent natural remainders. The reforestation with native species performed in the degraded floodplain of Mogi Guagu River, initially with the predomination of invasive grasses, has been effective at the first stage of the ecological restoration process. The reforestation is making possible the natural regeneration of species from the adjacent remnants, what indicates that the similarity between planted forests and the native ones are rising through the time. The phytosociology, accomplished ten years after the planting date, is adequate to evaluate the effectiveness of the reforestation during the restoration process of degradated areas in the Mogi Guagu floodplain.

TI  - Direct seeding reduces costs, but it is not promising for restoring tropical seasonal forests
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Direct seeding is a potential technique to restore forests; however, further studies are needed before its application on a large scale. We carried out a field experiment in a deforested area in southern Brazil to test the technical and economic feasibility of a direct seeding system with high tree species diversity to restore the tropical seasonal forest. We also compared species performances and tested the effects of seed size and successional group on tree seedling emergence and development. The trial was established at two different sowing times using 31 tree species. For two years after sowing we evaluated seedling emergence, establishment, survival and early growth of tree species, weed competition and costs for plantation establishment and early maintenance. Most species had low seedling emergence and establishment, but high survival rates, implying that low seedling emergence is the main barrier to community assembly that must be overcome. The most successful species had larger seeds, belonged to non-pioneer categories and had slower growth rates. Final costs after two years were lower than has been reported in the literature for most restoration planting using seedlings both in Brazil and elsewhere; however, seedling density was low. Although direct seeding may be a feasible alternative to decrease planting costs, the poor species performances and low seedling density may reduce its applicability. Thus, we recommend direct seeding only in association with the planting of pioneer species seedlings.

TI  - Carbon balance of plywood from a social reforestation program in Indonesia
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Social reforestation programs plant trees on degraded, uncultivated land in low-income regions to allow the local population to generate income from selling wood products and-in case of agroforestry systems-to grow food. For fundraising it is of interest to demonstrate not only positive social impacts but also environmental ones. Proving negative greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions would allow the programs to enter the market for carbon offsetting projects and liberate further funding. In a case study, a social reforestation program in Kalimantan, Indonesia, is analyzed. GHG emissions (according to ISO 14067, PAS 2050 and EU ILCD Handbook for LCA) of the main product, laminated veneer lumber plywood, are determined as 622 and 21 kg CO2-e/m(3) for short-term and long-term (above 100 years) plywood use, respectively. Switching to lignin-based resins and renewable electricity could reduce emissions down to - 363 kg CO2-e/m(3) for long-term use. The analyzed agroforestry system produces almost carbon-neutral plywood today and could be climate positive in the mid-term.

TI  - Voluntary carbon market and its contributions to sustainable development: analysis of the Monte Pascoal-Pau Brazil Ecological Corridor
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This paper aims to analyse the co-benefits of reforestation projects developed in the voluntary carbon market based on the analysis of a single case study: the Ecological Corridor Project Monte Pascoal-Pau Brazil, the first forest restoration project in Latin America to receive the seal climate community and biodiversity (CCB). To achieve this purpose, the research combined: i) primary sources, obtained from visits and interviews with key actors and script for semi-structured, with; ii) secondary sources, including reports of institutions on this theme and references. The results presented showed that forestry projects have positive co-benefits beyond those achieved in reducing deforestation and carbon sequestration, whether in environmental and social benefits. The case study had interesting picture of forest governance, growing in transparent structures of popular participation, but has exposed deficiencies in the sector, as the absence of a strong institutional framework which leads to legal uncertainty and policy.

TI  - Functional Fruit Trees from the Atlantic and Amazon Forests: Selection of Potential Chestnut Trees Rich in Antioxidants, Nutrients, and Fatty Acids
T2  - FOODS
AB  - The Amazon rainforest and the biodiversity hotspot of the Atlantic Forest are home to fruit trees that produce functional foods, which are still underutilized. The present study aimed to select potential functional nut donor trees from two Brazilian chestnuts, by evaluating the nutritional and antioxidant composition of the nuts and the fatty acid profile of the oil. The nutritional characteristics, antioxidants, oil fatty acid profile, and X-ray densitometry of the nuts were evaluated, as well as the characterization of leaf and soil nutrients for each parent tree. The nut oil was evaluated through Brix (%), mass (g), yield (%), and the fatty acid profile. For L. pisonis, the most nutritious nuts were produced by L. pisonis tree 4 (N > P > K > Mg > Ca > Zn > Fe) and L. pisonis tree 6 (P > Ca > Mg > Mn > Zn > Cu > Fe), and for the species L. lanceolata, L. lanceolata tree 6 (N > P > Ca > Mg > Zn > Fe > Cu) and L. lanceolata tree 2 (P > K > Mg > Zn > Cu). In L. pisonis, the highest production of anthocyanins, DPPH, total phenolics, and flavonoids was obtained from the nuts of L. pisonis tree 4 as well as for L. lanceolata, from L. lanceolata tree 1, except for flavonoids. The Brix of the oil from the nuts of both species showed no difference between the trees and the fatty acid profile with a similar amount between saturated (48-65%) and unsaturated (34-57%) fatty acids. Both species have nuts rich in nutrients and antioxidant compounds and can be considered unconventional functional foods. The data collected in the present study confirm that the nuts of these species can replace other foods as a source of selenium.

TI  - Initial development and biomass partitioning of Physocalymma scaberrimum Pohl (Lythraceae) under different shading levels
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
AB  - The Cerrado Biome lost wide areas of native vegetation over the last decades. This fact reveals a high demand for studies that assess the potential of native species for reforestation purposes. Given this gap, this study aimed to evaluate the initial development of seedlings of Physocalymma scaberrimum under different shading levels, because of the potential of the species for reforestation and forest restoration. This research was conducted in a nursery at 0 % (full sun), 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% shading. Parameters were evaluated for germination, biomass and root, number of leaves, stern diameter, height and Dickson quality index of seedlings (DQI) at 150, 180, 210, 240 and 270 days after seedling emergence. The results between treatments were compared by ANOVA and regression analysis. The higher values of stem diameter, number of leaves, root and total biomass and DQI were found in the intermediate levels of shading. For large scale production of seedlings of P. scaberrimum with optimum quality we recommend the intermediate levels of shading, preferably 50 %.

TI  - POTENTIAL AREAS FOR THE FORMATION OF ECOLOGICAL CORRIDORS BETWEEN REMNANTS OF ATLANTIC FOREST
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
AB  - In Brazil, the remaining areas of Atlantic Forest are intensely fragmented. The connection of forest fragments through ecological corridors is an important step in biodiversity conservation. Certain areas are more resilient, and in those areas, natural forest regeneration, for example, can be encouraged. The aim of this study was to identify areas of greater resilience in order to support the connection of Atlantic Forest fragments with ecological corridors. Forest fragments in the municipality of Paraiba do Sul, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, were mapped using the supervised maximum likelihood classification of an Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Landsat-8 sensor image. Next, we analyzed the influence of terrain attributes (aspect, incident solar radiation, slope, and curvature profile) on natural regeneration. The areas with the greatest potential to achieve natural regeneration and to form ecological corridors were indicated through fuzzy membership functions. Within Paraiba do Sul, 31% of the territory is covered by vegetation in different stages of regeneration. Recordings were made of 1,251 forest fragments in a middle or advanced stage of regeneration. These fragments are usually situated in the southeast, south, and southwest aspects, in areas that receive the least amount of global solar radiation (Wh.m(-2)) per year, and on slopes with an angle of inclination greater than 20%. The adjustment of fuzzy functions identified 17,327.5 ha with a tendency to recover, and which are therefore strategic areas in the development of ecological corridors.

TI  - The Potential Ecological Impact of Oil Palm Agroforestry as Term of Improvement for Restoring Harapan Rainforest
T2  - JURNAL MANAJEMEN HUTAN TROPIKA
AB  - Around 20.000 ha of forestland in the Harapan Rainforest, Jambi Province, Indonesia, is currently under encroachment by local communities. Local communities encroach on forest land converted into oil palm plantations. Expanding oil palm plantations into forest areas led to biodiversity loss and massive carbon emissions. The annual net carbon emissions of oil palm transformation from the forest in Indonesia is around 12.41-25.83 ton ha year . Oil palm agroforestry is considered to be able to increase carbon sequestration and the biodiversity level. CRC990/EFForTS has established an oil palm agroforestry experimental plot in Jambi Province, Indonesia, namely B11 plot. This study compares the carbon sequestration and biodiversity level between oil palm monoculture and agroforestry. The data collected in this study was obtained from the CRC-990 experimental plots. We collected data on the CRC-990 oil palm agroforestry plot in 6 plots of 40 m x 40 m and 6 plots of 20 m x 20 m. We chose the location and theme of this research because, until now, no research has been conducted yet to calculate the potential carbon absorption capacity and biodiversity level of oil palm agroforestry patterns in B11 plot. This study uses an allometric equation and IPCC guidelines to estimate biomass and carbon sequestration. SNI 8014 is used to evaluate the biodiversity level. This study found that oil palm agroforestry has more significant carbon sequestration. Increasing intercropping in oil palm agroforestry will increase the amount of carbon sequestration. This study also found that oil palm agroforestry has a higher biodiversity level. The species diversity of oil palm agroforestry is moderate, while oil palm monoculture is low. These potential ecological impacts can be considered an initial step in restoring the Harapan Rainforest. It is important to choose appropriate intercrops and proper management to increase the successful implementation of oil palm agroforestry.

TI  - Pesticide use in banana plantations in Costa Rica-A review of environmental and human exposure, effects and potential risks
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Biodiversity is declining on a global scale. Especially tropical ecosystems, containing most of the planetary biodiversity, are at risk. Agricultural monocrop systems contribute to this decline as they replace original hab-itats and depend on extensive use of synthetic pesticides that impact ecosystems. In this review we use large-scale banana production for export purposes in Costa Rica as an example for pesticide impacts, as it is in production for over a century and uses pesticides extensively for more than fifty years. We summarise the research on pesticide exposure, effects and risks for aquatic and terrestrial environment, as well as for human health. We show that exposure to pesticides is high and relatively well-studied for aquatic systems and humans, but hardly any data are available for the terrestrial compartment including adjacent non target ecosystems such as rainforest fragments. Ecological effects are demonstrated on an organismic level for various aquatic species and processes but are not available at the population and community level. For human health studies exposure evaluation is crucial and recognised effects include various types of cancer and neurobiological dysfunctions particularly in children. With the many synthetic pesticides involved in banana production, the focus on insecticides, revealing highest aquatic risks, and partly herbicides should be extended to fungicides, which are applied aerially over larger areas. The risk assessment and regulation of pesticides so far relies on temperate models and test species and is therefore likely underestimating the risk of pesticide use in tropical ecosystems, with crops such as banana. We highlight further research approaches to improve risk assessment and, in parallel, urge to follow other strategies to reduce pesticides use and especially hazardous substances.

TI  - Global forest restoration opportunities to foster coral reef conservation
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Sediment runoff from disturbed coastal catchments is a major threat to marine ecosystems. Understanding where sediments are produced and where they are delivered enables managers to design more effective strategies for improving water quality. A management strategy is targeted restoration of degraded terrestrial areas, as it provides opportunities to reduce land-based runoff from coastal areas and consequently foster coral reef conservation. To do this strategically, a systematic approach is needed to identify watersheds where restoration actions will provide the highest conservation benefits for coral reefs. Here, we develop a systematic approach for identifying global forest restoration opportunities that would also result in large decreases in the flux of sediments to coral reefs. We estimate how land-use change affects sediment runoff globally using high-resolution spatial data and determine the subsequent risk of sediment exposure on coral reefs using a diffusion-based ocean transport model. Our results reveal that sediment export is a major issue affecting 41% of coral reefs globally. The main coastal watersheds with the highest sediment export are predominantly located in Southeast Asian countries, with Indonesia and the Philippines accounting for 52% of the sediment export in coastal areas near coral reefs. We show how restoring forest across multiple watersheds could help to reduce sediment export to 63,000 km(2) of coral reefs. Although reforestation opportunities in areas that discharge onto coral reefs are relatively small across watersheds, it is possible to achieve large sediment reduction benefits by strategically targeting watersheds located in regions with a high density of corals near to the coast. Thus, reforestation benefits on coral reefs do not necessarily come from the watersheds that produce the highest sediment export. These analyses are key for generating informed action to support both international conservation policy and national restoration activities.

TI  - Aboveground carbon stock in a restored neotropical mangrove: influence of management and brachyuran crab assemblage
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Mangrove forests are important sinks of atmospheric carbon, and the internal deposits and fluxes of organic matter can reflect how these ecosystems respond to disturbances and environmental changes. Data on carbon content of mangrove forests vary geographically due to differences in abiotic (climate, geomorphic settings, tides) and biotic (diversity, herbivory, bioturbation) conditions. Mangroves have been degraded worldwide and ecological restoration is an alternative to recover these ecosystems and their functionality. However, although growing and biomass after disturbances have been addressed, studies on the recovery of faunal groups are rare. The brachyuran crab assemblage is strongly integrated to carbon recycling and ecosystem functioning, since propagule consumption and fossorial activity can affect the diversity and biomass of mangroves. We assessed the aboveground biomass and carbon stock of differently managed mangrove areas in northeastern Brazil, after being deforested for shrimp culture and then abandoned, and compared data with other forests worldwide. After a decade, the area restored with Rhizophora mangle showed higher carbon stock than the self-recovered forest and similar amount as an older forest. We discuss the applied rehabilitation measures regarding the effects of management and brachyuran crabs on forest aboveground carbon storage. The effects of herbivory and bioturbation of brachyurans on the low recruitment of Laguncularia racemosa propagules, contributed to higher biomass levels in the restored forest through reinforcing the predominance of R. mangle, which stocks more aboveground carbon with respect to Laguncularia. This suggests that the particularities of target tree species and brachyuran assemblage need to be considered in mangrove restoration, since they are related to function recovering and carbon cycling in the ecosystem.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of microclimate on dairy cows' behaviors and their preferences for different pasture areas under high biodiversity silvopastoral system (SPSnuclei) in a subtropical climate. We surveyed three different pasture areas under SPSnuclei: shaded area around the nuclei (SAN), unshaded area around the nuclei (UAN), and all-day sunny area distant from the nuclei (SDN). In each area, the microclimatic variables were measured-air temperature (degrees C), relative humidity (%), illuminance (lux), wind speed (m/s), and soil surface temperature (degrees C). In addition, the diurnal behaviors of 39 Jersey dairy cows were evaluated. Grazing, standing rest, lying rest, standing rumination, and lying rumination were registered by scans every 10 min; drinking water was observed continuously. Microclimate differed (p < 0.05) among the SPSnuclei areas. Areas around the nuclei provided better conditions of air temperature (SAN, 31.05 degrees C; UAN, 31.92 degrees C; SDN, 33.39 degrees C), illuminance (SAN, 5665 lx; UAN, 61,065 lx; SDN, 75,380 lx), and soil surface temperature (SAN, 27.35 degrees C; UAN, 32.38 degrees C; SDN, 35.87 degrees C). The frequency of use of each SPSnuclei area by dairy cows was different (p < 0.01); the highest frequencies of the grazing (SAN, 12.6%; UAN, 4.8%; SDN, 11.1%), rumination (SAN, 21.7%; UAN, 3.1%; SDN, 1.9%), and rest (SAN, 35.6%; UAN, 5.4%; SDN, 3.7%) were registered in the areas around the nuclei. The microclimate of the high biodiversity silvopastoral system leads the animals to perform grazing, ruminating, and resting preferentially on the areas around the nuclei even with no shade.

TI  - Natural regeneration in a degraded tropical peatland, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia: Implications for forest restoration
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Forested tropical peatlands in Southeast Asia are important global carbon stores and for biodiversity conservation, yet are being rapidly converted to agriculture or degraded into fire-prone non-forest vegetation. Although large areas previously cleared for agriculture have been abandoned, there is little evidence of subsequent forest recovery. We assessed the composition of non-forest regrowth in a degraded peatland in the former Mega Rice Project: a failed attempt to convert 1 million hectares of tropical peatland for rice production in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Regrowth was assessed in 223 20 m x 20 m plots distributed at 100 m intervals along transects through the deforested area. Individual woody plants >= 0.5 m in height were counted and identified. A total of 6085 woody plants 0.5-3 m high and 2720 woody plants >3 m were counted from 79 morphospecies. The mean density of woody plants was 0.09 individuals m(-2), with a range of 0.005-0.53 individuals m(-2) across plots. Most woody species also grew in mature forest, but regrowth was dominated by a few abundant wind-dispersed species (particularly Combretocarpus rotundatus) and most other species were potentially dispersed by bulbuls (Pycnonotidae) and other small- to medium-sized birds. Most regeneration reflects the availability of dispersal agents, with additional woody species probably sprouting from vegetative remnants of the previous forest cover, although a role for additional dispersal agents cannot be ruled out. Ground cover was dominated by fern species not typically found in mature forest and may be inhibiting woody plant regrowth. Continuous woody canopy cover is probably achievable by unassisted regeneration in degraded peatlands, but it will be slow and patchy with low species diversity. We recommend enrichment planting with species from intact peat swamp forest, but only after an initial survey of the existing regrowth. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Spread and impact of introduced conifers in South America: Lessons from other southern hemisphere regions
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
AB  - The history of conifers introduced earlier elsewhere in the southern hemisphere suggests that recent invasions in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay are likely to increase in number and size. In South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, early ornamental introductions and small forestry plantations did not lead to large-scale invasions, while subsequent large plantations were followed with a lag of about 20-30 years by troublesome invasions. Large-scale conifer plantation forestry in South America began about 50-80 years later than in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, while reports of invasions in South America lagged behind those in the latter nations by a century. Impacts of invading non-native conifers outside South America are varied and include replacement of grassland and shrubland by conifer forest, alteration of fire and hydrological regimes, modification of soil nutrients, and changes in aboveground and belowground biotic communities. Several of these effects have already been detected in various parts of South America undergoing conifer invasion. The sheer amount of area planted in conifers is already very large in Chile and growing rapidly in Argentina and Brazil. This mass of reproductive trees, in turn, produces an enormous propagule pressure that may accelerate ongoing invasions and spark new ones at an increasing rate. Regulations to control conifer invasions, including measures to mitigate spread, were belatedly implemented in New Zealand and South Africa, as well as in certain Australian states, inspired by observations on invasions in those nations. Regulations in South America are weaker and piecemeal, but the existing research base on conifer invasions elsewhere could be useful in fashioning effective regulations in South America. Pressure from foreign customers in South Africa has led most companies there to seek certification through the Forestry Stewardship Council; a similar programme operates in Australia. Such an approach may be promising in South America.

TI  - Recruitment Niches of Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Vell.) Morong: Functional Acclimations to Light
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Adjustments that a tree species displays in acclimating to light conditions may explain its fate in different forest successional stages. Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Vell.) Morong is a tree found in contrasting light environments and used in reforestation programs because of its rapid growth. This study analyzed the performance of tamboril seedlings grown in three light environments: FSfull sun (100% of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and a red/far-red ratio (R/FR) of 1.66), Sshade net (38% of PAR and a R/FR of 1.54) and IInsulfilm((R)) (Insulfilm, SAo Paulo, Brazil) shade cloth (24% of PAR and a R/FR of 0.69). Greater net assimilation, higher root/shoot ratio, higher stomatal density, and reduced leaf area are some of the functional traits developed by tamboril to acclimate to full sun. On the other hand, a larger leaf area associated with a greater specific leaf area, higher leaf area ratio, higher leaf number and leafing intensity, as well as higher chlorophyll and carotenoid contents are among the most important traits for tamboril to acclimate to shade. The seedlings growing in FS displayed the best quality index. However, the traits developed in the nursery under each light condition could promote the successful installation and survival of tamboril seedlings under similar conditions in the field.

TI  - Is Direct Seeding a Biologically Viable Strategy for Restoring Forest Ecosystems? Evidences from a Meta-analysis
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Ecological restoration has become an important technique for mitigating the human impacts on natural vegetation. Planting seedlings is the most common approach to regain lost forest cover. However, these activities require a large economic investment. Direct seeding is considered a cheaper and easier alternative technique, in which tree seeds are introduced directly on the site rather than transplanting seedlings from nurseries. To evaluate the effectiveness of direct seeding, we conducted a comprehensive search of the literature using restoration', direct seeding' and sowing' as keywords, and we performed a meta-analysis using 30 papers and 89 species. We used two different measures of restoration success: seed germination probability and success probability (the chance that a seed germinates and survives until the end of the experiment). In general, restoration attempts using direct-seeding techniques were relatively unsuccessful. On average, seed germination and success probability were 0239 and 0114, respectively, and were not affected by climate, species successional group or the application of pre-germinative treatments. Germination and success probability increased with seed size, and the use of physical protections resulted in a nearly twofold increase in germination probability, but this effect faded by the end of the experiments. Because of the low rate of seedling success, we suggest the use of direct seeding as a complementary technique to reduce restoration costs, particularly for species with large seeds and known high germination rates, but our results do not support direct seeding as a substitute for seedling planting.

TI  - Natural regeneration on land degraded by coal mining in a tropical climate: Lessons for ecological restoration from Indonesia
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - There are few examples of primary succession from tropical conditions, especially on land degraded by human activity, for example, mine wastes. Such studies would assist in informing ecological restoration of these degraded sites. Here, a chronosequence approach was used to investigate early-stage primary succession on overburden spoil wastes derived from coal mining in a tropical climate over a 64-month period. Plant species composition and several microclimatic and spoil physicochemical and microbial properties were measured, and responses analysed using regression and multivariate (nonmetric multidimensional scaling) analyses. A clear primary successional process was described showing that vegetation cover and species richness generally increased through time with a successional pathway from graminoids and herbs as the early dominants, shrubs in midsuccession, and trees in the later-successional stages. Two important differences were noted between our results and primary successions elsewhere; a lower abundance of nitrogen-fixing species and the colonization by some late-successional shrubs and trees at the start. During the succession, aggregate stability and organic matter (total C) increased-whereas electrical conductivity and some potentially toxic elements (Al, B) decreased. The constant high spoil moisture content appears to be an important determinant of vegetation development during primary succession and may be a factor in the rapid pace of succession detected here. The lessons for ecological restoration for coal overburden spoil under tropical conditions are that succession can proceed relatively rapidly.

TI  - Secondary forest regeneration under fast-growing forest plantations on degraded Imperata cylindrica grasslands
T2  - NEW FORESTS
AB  - Natural regeneration of native tree species in the understoreys of fast-growing plantation tree species (Acacia mangium, Gmelina arborea and Paraserianthes falcataria) and in adjacent natural riverine forest and non-cultivated grassland areas were studied on Imperata cylindrica grassland sites in Riam Kiwa plantation area, South Kalimantan, Indonesia. Seedling and sapling densities as well as species composition and richness were assessed in a total of 35 ha by a systematic line plot survey.
   Floristic composition was similar in A. mangium and P. falcataria stands which differed distinctly from G. arborea stands and Imperata grassland area. Riverine forest was characterized by later successional species. In A. mangium and P. falcataria stands, a total of 63 species from 24 families were recorded. Seedling stock consisted merely of pioneer and secondary species, but also several fairly commonly occurring primary forest species. Euphorbiaceae was the most common family representing 42% of sapling and 29% of seedling densities. The most abundant regeneration occurred in A. mangium stands (4,706 seedling/sapling ha(-1)), followed by P. falcataria (2,242 ha(-1)) and G. arborea (554 ha(-1)). Seedling recruitment was significantly lower in plots dominated by grass vegetation than those dominated by no vegetation or shrub vegetation. Breast height diameter and basal area of canopy trees as well as coverage and height of ground vegetation did not explain seedling/sapling density. Results show that plantation establishment with suitable fast-growing tree species facilitates recruitment of a variety of native tree species. This provides potential for rapid restoration of forest ecosystem and for further development of the mixed stands of fast-growing exotics and naturally regenerated native species.

TI  - FOREST RESTORATION IN THE ATLANTIC FOREST: PASSIVE RESTORATION, NUCLEATION AND HIGH DIVERSITY PLANTATION
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
AB  - Due to the increasing environmental degradation, the understanding of how reforestation and other restoration techniques function became fundamental to base the reestablishment of degraded ecosystems. The aim of this study was to perform a vegetation survey in a restoration site through three different techniques. The study site has 7.2 ha in a subtropical forest in Dois Vizinhos, Parana state, Brazil and it is approximately 20 m from a secondary forest fragment. The experiment consisted of 12 plots with three treatments (T1-3) randomly distributed in four blocks. T-1: natural regeneration through passive restoration. T-2: set of nucleation techniques. T-3: seedlings planted through filling and diversity lines (3x2 m). For sampling purposes, each plot was divided into 24 subplots. In order to evaluate plant presence, two years and eight months after the treatments implementation, a survey was conducted in three random subplots for each plot, where all plants taller than 50cm were identified and quantified. Native species richness was higher than 87% in all treatments, whereas the presence of herbaceous species was higher at passive restoration and woody species at plantation. The most common dispersal syndromes were anemochory and zoochory. By comparing planted and regenerated individuals for the three treatments, the plantation technique had the highest Shannon diversity index (3.017), with 148 individuals and 53 species sampled. However, there was no statistically significant difference. This higher diversity is related to the larger number of species planted, but it is still not facilitating regeneration species in its understory at this age. Considering only regenerated individuals, nucleation showed the highest Shannon diversity index (2.078) with a total of 908 individuals of 40 species, however, it wasn't statistically significant different of passive restoration (Shannon = 1.965) which had 2,018 individuals of 40 species. The most floristic similar treatments were passive restoration and nucleation. Nucleation facilitated species natural regeneration (17 planted and 40 regenerated species) while passive restoration showed high resilience, therefore the use of passive restoration can be considered an effective alternative since its results did not differ statistically from nucleation, and the main advantage of this technique is the reduced cost.

TI  - Mapping Atlantic rainforest degradation and regeneration history with indicator species using convolutional network
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The Atlantic rainforest of Brazil is one of the global terrestrial hotspots of biodiversity. Despite having undergone large scale deforestation, forest cover has shown signs of increases in the last decades. Here, to understand the degradation and regeneration history of Atlantic rainforest remnants near Sao Paulo, we combine a unique dataset of very high resolution images from Worldview-2 and Worldview-3 (0.5 and 0.3m spatial resolution, respectively), georeferenced aerial photographs from 1962 and use a deep learning method called U-net to map (i) the forest cover and changes and (ii) two pioneer tree species, Cecropia hololeuca and Tibouchina pulchra. For Tibouchina pulchra, all the individuals were mapped in February, when the trees undergo mass-flowering with purple and pink blossoms. Additionally, elevation data at 30m spatial resolution from NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and annual mean climate variables (Terraclimate datasets at similar to 4km of spatial resolution) were used to analyse the forest and species distributions. We found that natural forests are currently more frequently found on south-facing slopes, likely because of geomorphology and past land use, and that Tibouchina is restricted to the wetter part of the region (southern part), which annually receives at least 1600 mm of precipitation. Tibouchina pulchra was found to clearly indicate forest regeneration as almost all individuals were found within or adjacent to forests regrown after 1962. By contrast, Cecropia hololeuca was found to indicate older disturbed forests, with all individuals almost exclusively found in forest fragments already present in 1962. At the regional scale, using the dominance maps of both species, we show that at least 4.3% of the current region's natural forests have regrown after 1962 (Tibouchina dominated, similar to 4757 ha) and that similar to 9% of the old natural forests have experienced significant disturbance (Cecropia dominated).

TI  - Mapping Forest Stability within Major Biomes Using Canopy Indices Derived from MODIS Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Deforestation and forest degradation from human land use, including primary forest loss, are of growing concern. The conservation of old-growth and other forests with important environmental values is central to many international initiatives aimed at protecting biodiversity, mitigating climate change impacts, and supporting sustainable livelihoods. Current remote-sensing products largely focus on deforestation rather than forest degradation and are dependent on machine learning, calibrated with extensive field measurements. To help address this, we developed a novel approach for mapping forest ecosystem stability, defined in terms of constancy, which is a key characteristic of long-undisturbed (including primary) forests. Our approach categorizes forests into stability classes based on satellite-data time series related to plant water-carbon relationships. Specifically, we used long-term dynamics of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the canopy (fPAR) and shortwave infrared water stress index (SIWSI) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for the period 2003-2018. We calculated a set of variables from annual time series of fPAR and SIWSI for representative forest regions at opposite ends of Earth's climatic and latitudinal gradients: boreal forests of Siberia (southern taiga, Russia) and tropical rainforests of the Amazon basin (Kayapo territory, Brazil). Independent validation drew upon high-resolution Landsat imagery and forest cover change data. The results indicate that the proposed approach is accurate and applicable across forest biomes and, thereby, provides a timely and transferrable method to aid in the identification and conservation of stable forests. Information on the location of less stable forests is equally relevant for ecological restoration, reforestation, and proforestation activities.

TI  - Influence of nutrient management on growth and nutrient use efficiency of two plant species for mineland revegetation
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Rehabilitation of degraded areas by mining activities is necessary to achieve sustainable mining. For an effective revegetation, the understanding of plant growth and the nutrient requirements of native plant species, especially those with the potential to be used in the rehabilitation of mined areas such as waste piles or mine pits, is indispensable. In this study, we evaluated the growth performance, nutrient levels, and nutrient use efficiency of an endemic plant (Mimosa acutistipula var. ferrea) and ruderal shrub (Solanum crinitum) that are both found in ferriferous savannas, locally called canga in Carajas Mineral Province, Brazil. An experiment was conducted under greenhouse conditions using samples of three different soils (oxisol, canga soil, and iron mining waste) without and with nutrient application; additionally, an omission trial was carried out in canga soils. Fertilization increased the growth of both plant species in all substrates. Macronutrient omission reduced the growth of plants stronger than micronutrient omission, indicating that the lack of N, P, and K may especially impact the rehabilitation of areas. The growth of S. crinitum was higher than M. acutistipula var. ferrea, highlighting its preponderance in mineland rehabilitation, although concerns regarding its role as a ruderal species persist. Therefore, further research is necessary for a risk assessment of the propagation of S. crinitum within mineland restoration projects.

TI  - REFORESTATION DYNAMICS IN AREAS OF RESTORATION AFTER MINING IN UNIT OF FOREST CONSERVATION IN THE AMAZON
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
AB  - The objective of this paper was to evaluate density of planting, of mortality and annual periodic increment (API) of growth in diameter and height of species used in reforestation in areas of forest restoration after mining in conservation units in Amazonia. It was also analyzed the soil management practices in plantation areas. The monitoring covered a period of 13 years (1996-2009), at the National Forest Saraca Taquera, in Porto Trombetas, Para State, Brazil. The species were distributed in classes of mortality. We analyzed the size and the ecological suitability, based on mortality and growth increments (diameter and height) of the species in the artificial ecosystem restored. The annual periodic increment of diameter considering the studied species allowed the following classification: excellent (7 species), high (33), low (20) and very low (9) and similarly, the grow of tree height it was found: excellent (9 species), superior (20), low (31) and very low (9). The ecological aptitude of 69 species in the study area, based on mortality and the increments in diameter and height, allowed the identification of the following groups of species aptitude: excellent (3), good (16), regular (25), low (21); improper (20) and inept (5). The use of soil practices during the activities of restoration should be reviewed due to strong evidence of mortality and growing of planted trees being influenced by soil storage time, the amount of top soil spread superficially, the acidity and fertility of soil and the top soil depth and the distance of transport to the target areas.

TI  - Forest aboveground biomass along an elevational transect in Sulawesi, Indonesia, and the role of Fagaceae in tropical montane rain forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB  - Aim
   This study investigates how estimated tree aboveground biomass (AGB) of tropical montane rain forests varies with elevation, and how this variation is related to elevational change in floristic composition, phylogenetic community structure and the biogeography of the dominant tree taxa.
   Location
   Lore Lindu National Park, Sulawesi, Indonesia.
   Methods
   Floristic inventories and stand structural analyses were conducted on 13 plots (each 0.24 ha) in four old-growth forest stands at 1050, 1400, 1800 and 2400 m a.s.l. (submontane to upper montane elevations). Tree AGB estimates were based on d.b.h., height and wood specific gravity. Phylogenetic diversity and biogeographical patterns were analysed based on tree family composition weighted by AGB. Elevational trends in AGB were compared with other Southeast Asian and Neotropical transect studies (n = 7).
   Results
   AGB was invariant from sub- to mid-montane elevation (309-301 Mg ha-1) and increased slightly to 323 Mg ha-1 at upper montane elevation. While tree and canopy height decreased, wood specific gravity increased. Magnoliids accounted for most of the AGB at submontane elevations, while eurosids I (including Fagaceae) contributed substantially to AGB at all elevations. Phylogenetic diversity was highest at upper montane elevations, with co-dominance of tree ferns, Podocarpaceae, Trimeniaceae and asterids/euasterids II, and was lowest at lower/mid-montane elevations, where Fagaceae contributed > 50% of AGB. Biogeographical patterns showed a progression from dominant tropical families at submontane to tropical Fagaceae (Castanopsis, Lithocarpus) at lower/mid-montane, and to conifers and Australasian endemics at upper montane elevations. Cross-continental comparisons revealed an elevational AGB decrease in transects with low/no presence of Fagaceae, but relatively high AGB in montane forests with moderate to high abundance of this family.
   Main conclusions
   AGB is determined by both changes in forest structure and shifts in species composition. In our study, these two factors traded off so that there was no net change in AGB, even though there were large changes in forest structure and composition along the elevational gradient. Southeast Asian montane rain forests dominated by Fagaceae constitute important carbon stocks. The importance of biogeography and species traits for biomass estimation should be considered by initiatives to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) and in taxon choice in reforestation for carbon offsetting.

TI  - Response of vegetation to sheep dung addition in a degraded Cerrado area
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
AB  - Cerrado is the second largest biome in Brazil and is classified as a biodiversity hotspot. The establishment of hydroelectric power stations in Brazil originated degraded areas due to the removal of soil for construction of dams, in which native vegetation sometimes fails to reestablish due to the bad soil conditions. Sheep excrete most of the nutrients they ingest, such as phosphorus, calcium, potassium and nitrogen. This study aimed at investigating whether sheep dung contributes to the improvement of soil quality and stimulates the process of ecological succession in areas affected by the construction of the hydroelectric power station of Ilha Solteira. Four areas were selected, located at the Experimental Farm of Unesp Ilha Solteira/SP, and ten plots of 1 m(2) each were established. From October 2014 to December 2015, five replicates received 150 g fresh sheep dung every 15 days. In December 2015 soil sample from top 0.10 m was collected for the determination of soil attributes. Aboveground biomass was also collected, separated into four functional groups, oven-dried and weighed. Data were analysed to check the effect of dung addition upon soil and vegetation variables. Dung addition stimulated the development of several functional groups and changed soil nutrient concentrations in all four studied areas.

TI  - Influence of Removal of a Non-native Tree Species Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth. on the Regenerating Plant Communities in a Tropical Semideciduous Forest Under Restoration in Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Exotic species are used to trigger facilitation in restoration plantings, but this positive effect may not be permanent and these species may have negative effects later on. Since such species can provide a marketable product (firewood), their harvest may represent an advantageous strategy to achieve both ecological and economic benefits. In this study, we looked at the effect of removal of a non-native tree species (Mimosa caesalpiniifolia) on the understory of a semideciduous forest undergoing restoration. We assessed two 14-year-old plantation systems (modified "taungya" agroforestry system; and mixed plantation using commercial timber and firewood tree species) established at two sites with contrasting soil properties in So Paulo state, Brazil. The experimental design included randomized blocks with split plots. The natural regeneration of woody species (height a parts per thousand yen0.2 m) was compared between managed (all M. caesalpiniifolia trees removed) and unmanaged plots during the first year after the intervention. The removal of M. caesalpiniifolia increased species diversity but decreased stand basal area. Nevertheless, the basal area loss was recovered after 1 year. The management treatment affected tree species regeneration differently between species groups. The results of this study suggest that removal of M. caesalpiniifolia benefited the understory and possibly accelerated the succession process. Further monitoring studies are needed to evaluate the longer term effects on stand structure and composition. The lack of negative effects of tree removal on the natural regeneration indicates that such interventions can be recommended, especially considering the expectations of economic revenues from tree harvesting in restoration plantings.

TI  - Ecological methods and indicators for recovering and monitoring ecosystems after mining: A global literature review
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Mining contributes significantly to the world's economy. However, it brings strong environmental impacts, including the destruction of the original vegetation. In this way, the recovery of degraded areas by mining has been a mandatory procedure in many countries. With the objective to review this subject, a bibliometric analysis was carried out using scientific articles published in the period 1990-2018. A total of 700 articles in 171 journals were sampled. Ecological Engineering and Restoration Ecology were the journals with the largest number of articles. There was a significant increase of articles along time approaching the use of geotechnologies and arbuscular fungi. Recovered or recovering ecosystems were studied in 45 countries, mainly in Brazil, Australia, USA, China, and Spain. Coal and bauxite were the most common resources mined. The most frequent recovery methods were: seedling planting, direct seeding, natural regeneration, and hydroseeding, with techniques employed in some of them. In 35.71% of the articles, a small number of species (2-5) were used for the initial plant's establishment. The number of articles decreased as the number of both, plant species used in the initial recovery phase, and ecosystem's age increased. In monitoring, the most important indicators were classified as functional or functional plus structural. From the functional indicators, the Technosols or rebuilt soils were the most evaluated. Future perspectives on forests recovery includes methods tailored to peculiar features (soil and economic) of each ecosystem. For the forest recovery monitoring, the use of geotechnologies, mainly the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), as well as wildlife indicators tend to increase rapidly.

TI  - Reconciling Conflict of Interest in the Management of Forest Restoration Ecosystem: A Strategy to Incorporate Different Interests of Stakeholders in the Utilization of the Harapan Rainforest, Jambi, Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The Harapan Rainforest is the only remaining lowland rainforest in Sumatera Island, Indonesia, that the Ministry of Forestry has designated for restoring lowland rainforest ecosystems. In the Harapan Rainforest, several stakeholders are interested in using the forest for several things. For example, the local community uses the forestland for their oil palm plantation, while PT Restorasi Ekosistem Indonesia (PT REKI) as forest manager, uses the forest for ecosystem restoration goals, causing a conflict of interest. This study aims to identify the stakeholders involved and provide a policy recommendation for the contestation in the Harapan Rainforest. We conducted key-person interviews to identify the stakeholders involved and analyze the interest and influence of all important stakeholders related to the utilization of the the Harapan Rainforest. The stakeholder analysis method analyzes and categorizes stakeholders' interests and influences in the Harapan Rainforest utilization. According to the study, three of the eight stakeholders have a direct role in the Harapan Rainforest's utilization. The last section of this paper ends by giving an alternative strategy for considering policy options and a win-win solution that prioritizes all stakeholders' interests. This study concludes that the utilization of the Harapan Rainforest should be conducted with multiple-use forest management for production and rehabilitation.

TI  - Deep soil carbon loss offsets rapid aboveground carbon accumulation after reforestation
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Carbon (C) sequestration following land restoration is an efficient measure of climate change mitigation. However, most studies including the international "4 per 1000 '' Initiative focus on topsoil C only. Here, we studied the response of deep soil C to different land restoration approaches. Samples were taken from rural sites in the Atlantic Forest Biome (Brazil), using a paired site design with triplicates of different 16-to-19-year-old restoration approaches of former arable land: reforestation, natural regeneration, and agroforestry sites. Adjacent arable land and a > 25-year-old secondary forest served as references. We determined aboveground and belowground C pools, including deep soil until 3 m depth. We did not find statistical differences among the three restoration methods for the C sequestration in the whole ecosystem. However, the C stock in the aboveground living biomass in the reforestation site was 85 +/- 15 Mg ha (-1), significantly exceeding the respective aboveground C in natural regeneration (40 +/- 13 Mg ha(-1)) and agroforestry system (25 +/- 5 Mg ha(-1)), respectively. This order, however, was reversed in soil, where reforestation caused a loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) by 27 Mg ha(- 1) below 40 cm depth, whereas SOC stocks in the agroforestry system and natural regeneration site increased by 41 and 25 Mg C/ha, respectively, compared to arable land. We thus conclude that deep soil carbon losses can negate aboveground carbon accrual after land restoration, which emphasizes the importance of including this pool in C sequestration studies.

TI  - Distance to forest, mammal and bird dispersal drive natural regeneration on degraded tropical peatland
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Restoration of peat swamp forest (PSF) on degraded Southeast Asian peatlands could reduce global carbon emissions and biodiversity loss. However, multiple ecological barriers are believed to hinder natural regeneration of native trees on degraded peatland and make restoration expensive. We evaluated if natural PSF regeneration occurs and what factors may influence it on eight different land use and land cover (LULC) classes with different types of disturbance, including drainage and fire, in a retired Acacia crassicarpa Benth. (Acacia) plantation landscape. The study involved 42 plots inside five PSF LULCs - intact, logged, burnt (1997, 2015), remnant and 212 plots at distances up to 2 km from the PSF edge in three Acacia plantation LULCs - unharvested, harvested, and burnt. The number of species per plot were similar between intact PSF (25 +/- 6 (SD) per 20 m x 10 m plot), logged forest (30 +/- 6) and 1997 burnt forest (30 +/- 13) but lower in 2015 burnt forest (11 +/- 10) and remnant forest (18 +/- 11). Regeneration away from the PSF across all degraded LULCs varied from fern dominated areas with no regeneration to clusters with high stem densities. The plantation LULCs, unharvested (94 species) and harvested Acacia (71 species), had similar overall species diversity after 3-4 years of regeneration to the intact and logged PSF (90 species). In unharvested Acacia, total species diversity, species per plot and stem density decreased with distance from forest edge (1-300 m - 87 species; 9 +/- 6 (SD) species per 20 m x 10 m plot; 1,056 stems/ha; 301-500 m - 33; 5 +/- 2; 511 and > 500 m - 38; 6 +/- 3; 683). In harvested Acacia, there was low plot species diversity irrespective of distance from the forest (1-300 m - 51; 4 +/- 2; 578; 301-500 m - 17; 4 +/- 2; 1,100; > 500 m - 48; 4 +/- 2; 780). Factors which may influence regeneration differed between different LULCs, but there was a clear influence of distance from forest edge and dispersal mechanism - i.e. whether a tree was bird or mammal dispersed and the interaction between these two factors. While our study suggests that if not further disturbed by logging, drainage and/or fire, degraded PSF could regenerate naturally to a similar species diversity as intact PSF, the lower levels of natural regeneration further away from the forest may warrant selective planting of species which do not disperse over long distances. More study is needed on the factors facilitating natural regeneration, whether it leads to restoration of PSF ecosystem functioning and the role of Acacia as a potential regeneration catalyst.

TI  - Influence of soil characteristics on physiological and growth responses of Cytharexyllum myrianthum Cham. (Verbenaceae) to flooding
T2  - ACTA PHYSIOLOGIAE PLANTARUM
AB  - The success of watershed riparian forest restoration programs can be affected by the selection of plant species tolerant to flooding and soil types that occur along water courses. We evaluated physiological and growth responses of Cytharexyllum myrianthum seedlings to flooding in three different soil types representative of the Almada River Watershed (ARW), southern Bahia, Brazil. The soils selected, based on the relative abundance and importance in the ARW, were: Luvisol, Argisol, and Spodosol. After 35 days of flooding, the Argisol had the lowest and the Spodosol had the highest reduction-oxidation (redox) potential (E-h). After 35 days of flooding, the Luvisol had higher pH and electrical conductivity (E-c) than the other soils. Stomatal conductance (g(s)) and net photosynthesis (A) significantly declined in all soil types after 7 days of flooding. After that period, morphological changes characteristic of flood-tolerant plants, such as lenticel hypertrophy and adventitious root formation, were observed in all flooded plants. Following the morphological changes, g(s) and A in flooded plants increased to values close to those of the non-flooded plants. The highest relative growth rates based on mass (RGRm) and net assimilation rates (NAR) for the non-flooded plants were observed in the Argisol. After 35 days of flooding, no significant differences in RGRm or NAR were observed between non-flooded and flooded plants in the Luvisol, but large significant decreases in RGRm and NAR were observed for the flooded plants in the Spodosol. Our results demonstrated that the ability of seedlings of the same species to acclimate to flooded soil conditions differs among soil types. Therefore, the characteristics of soils present in a watershed should be considered when selecting tree species for the reforestation of riparian forests.

TI  - The influence of chinese fan palm in the regeneration of the Montane Ombrophilous Dense Forest in Serra da Cantareira, SP
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
AB  - The Montane Ombrophilous Dense Forest belongs to Atlantic Forest's domain, an important biodiversity hotspot. In Brazil, most of the invasion reports are related to terrestrial plants, being this forest the most affected. In this context is the Cantareira State Park (PEC), Sao Paulo. The PEC is home to a remnant that has a focus of invasion by several plant species, including Livistona chinensis (N.J. Jacquin) R. Brown ex Mart., known as Chinese Fan Palm. Given the potential for invasion of this species, a floristic-phytosociological study was conducted in order to analyse a possible inhibition effect in the natural regeneration process of the arboreous component caused by juveniles individuals of Livistona chinensis, with heights varying between 3 and 6 m. For each palm were installed 8 plots of 1 x 1 m, placed in quadrants, with the palm's stipe in the center, in a way that half of the plots were placed under the canopy and half around the palm. In the analysis were considered arboreal and palms specimens >= 20 cm in height and with a Perimeter at Breast Height (PAP) <= 15 cm. The results pointed to a drastic reduced number of seedlings and saplings (28.95% and 29.85%) and of the species richness (16.13% and 8.33% of species) occurring under the canopies of these exotic palm trees in comparison with the surroundings (71.05% and 70.15% of the sampled individuals; and 61.29% and 58.33% of species, respectively). The study has shown the inhibiting effect of young individuals of this species on the forest regeneration in the PEC, by substantially reducing the richness of species and the abundance of arboreal individuals under the projection of their canopies, possibly because they serve as a shield and cause excessive shading of the place.

TI  - RADIAL WOOD ALLOCATION IN SCHIZOLOBIUM PARAHYBA
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Premise of the study: Pioneer species of tropical trees allocate wood specific gravity (SG) differently across the radius. Some species exhibit relatively uniform, low SG wood, whereas many others exhibit linear increases in SG across the radius. Here, we measured changes in SG across the radius of Schizolobium parahyba (Fabaceae-Caesalpinioideae), a wide-ranging, neotropical pioneer, used extensively in land reclamation and forest restoration in Brazil.
   Methods: Pith-to-bark radial wood cores were extracted with increment borers from 42 trees at five sites, in Central and South America. Cores were cut into 1-cm segments whose specific gravities were determined and analyzed via linear and nonlinear regression. Wood specific gravity, very low initially at 0.15-0.20, doubled or tripled across the tree radius to 0.45-0.65 for large adults.
   Key results: Unlike linear increases in other tropical pioneers, the increases in Schizolobium were nonlinear (convex up). At one site with even-aged trees, the magnitude of the radial increase was similar in all trees, despite a 4-fold difference in diameter among trees, implying that the radial increases in Schizolobium were regulated by tree age, not by tree size.
   Conclusions: This unique pattern of development should provide an extended period of growth when SG is low, facilitating hyper-extension of the bole, at some risk of structural failure. Later in growth, the SG rate of increase accelerates, reinforcing what was a precarious bole. Overall, these results suggest a third model for xylem allocation in tropical trees, a model that may be associated with monopodial stem development and limited life span.

TI  - Climate change mitigation on tropical peatlands: A triple burden for smallholder farmers in Indonesia
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - The agricultural use and conversion of tropical peatlands is considered a major source of land-based greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, the protection and restoration of tropical peatlands has recently turned into an important strategy to mitigate global climate change. Little research exists that has investigated the impacts and dynamics that such climate mitigation efforts evoke in local communities living in and around peatlands. We present in-sights on this from Sumatra, Indonesia and use a climate justice lens to evaluate local outcomes. We show how an increasingly transnational network of state and non-state actors has become involved in developing new laws, policy programs and land-use agreements on Sumatra's coastal peatlands, aiming at supposedly win-win low-carbon development pathways. We argue that such efforts are open to much of the same criticism that has been raised regarding previous policies and projects aimed at reducing GHGE from deforestation and forest degradation. These projects disregard local perspectives on development, fail to deliver the promised benefits and, through a reconfiguration of local land-use rights, reduce the capabilities of smallholder farmers to benefit from their land. In sum, our analysis suggests that recent policies and projects aimed at mitigating GHGE from tropical peatlands contribute to a redistribution of the global climate mitigation burden onto smallholder farmers in Indonesia. This occurs through their threefold assignment to protect forests, prevent fires and help restore degraded peatlands.

TI  - Soil organic carbon recovery and coffee bean yield following bauxite mining
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Bauxite mining requires the removal of the vegetation and topsoil, thus causing considerable impacts on both natural and managed ecosystems. This is typically the case of agricultural activities across Minas Gerais, South-eastern Brazil, where bauxite mining often displaces pastures and coffee plantations. In this study, our objective was to assess the effects of chemical and organic fertilizations combined with cover crops on the re-establishment of coffee plantations following bauxite mining. The experiment consisted of a split-plot design which main plot received 4 types of fertilization: no fertilization, chemical fertilization (CF), poultry litter (PL), and CF+PL. In subplots, 4 cover crops were cultivated in between the rows of the coffee plantation, including: no cover crops, grass (Brachiaria brizantha [B]), legume (Stylosanthes spp. [S]), and B+S. We had 4 blocks as replicates. Organic and chemical fertilization (PL+CF) combined with cover crops (B+S) led to significant recovery of soil organic carbon (SOC), soil organic nitrogen (SON), and KMnO4-oxidizable SOC. PL+CF and B+S also led to SOC increments of 14.5g kg(-1) soil (0-10-cm depth). Based on isotopic data (C-13), both cover crops, isolated or combined, contributed to the recovery of SOC. Over 3 consecutive harvests, coffee bean yield was consistently above 1,800 kg ha(-1) under PL or PL+CF, except when B was the only cover crop. Managing fertilization and cover crops can determine the recovery of SOC, SON and the capacity of soil to sustain the re-establishment of coffee plantations following bauxite mining.

TI  - Nucleario, cardboard, or manual crowning: which maintenance technique is most cost-effective in tree seedling survival establishment?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - In ecological restoration, one of the main challenges is to develop new methods, techniques, and incentives that both favour and reduce maintenance costs in restoration projects. Besides, post-planting maintenance is often neglected hampering seedling survival over time owing to alien grasses, which compete strongly with native plants for resources. To solve these issues, recently, an innovative technology called Nucleario has been developed in Brazil. Aiming to hinder alien competition filters, the Nucleario also attempts to condition a better microenvironment, reducing drought stress through the water storage tank, decreasing temperatures, which facilitates the survival and growth of seedlings in areas under restoration. Another method used to decrease alien grasses, which is inexpensive, is seedling crowning using cardboard lowing maintenance needs in restored areas. Cardboard has similar functions to Nuclear-la, such as protecting soil against loss of water and nutrients and reducing competition with invasive exotic grasses. Therefore, comparing them also with traditional manual weeding (i.e., clean-weeded crown by hoe), we aimed to verify which technique is most cost-efficient for seedling crown maintenance of Dipteryx alata Vog., which is an indigenous tree species with high economic value owing to its nuts. We tested three techniques in areas under restoration in the Cerrado, in the Environmental Protection Area "Corrego Guariroba" located in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. We monitored seedlings submitted to the three methods in the wet and the dry periods for biotic (competition with exotic grasses, herbivory, and growth) and abiotic (moisture and soil temperature) indicators. We observed that the Nuclear-la was the treatment that maintained the highest soil moisture, resulting in a larger canopy area. However, these effects do not reflect increases in the survival rate, diameter, and height of the seedlings. None of the treatments was effective in reducing herbivory. Nuclear-la was the most effective treatment in reducing the competition of seedlings with invasive grasses. Cardboard presented an implementation value 21.5 times lower than Nuclear-la and 1.2 times than manual crowning. Given the high purchase price, the Nucleario's cost-benefit ratio was very high compared to the crowning of cardboard and the manual weeding, which discourages us from recommending it for this species with high survival rates. Its project can be revised to decrease herbivory rates, as well as its efficiency tested in the short and long term in different ecosystems and species, particularly species susceptible to water stress.

TI  - Vegetation regeneration in a sustainably harvested mangrove forest in West Papua, Indonesia
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Bintuni Bay, located in the south of the Bird's Head Peninsula of West Papua, Indonesia, contains one of the largest mangrove forests in the world, growing in a variety of environmental conditions and geomorphologies. In the southern area of the bay, 82,120 ha of mangrove forest are actively undergoing a management regime conducted by PT. Bintuni Utama Murni Wood Industries (PT. BUMWI). Operations are focused upon woodchip production; however, sustainable forest management is also a priority as the area is Forest Stewardship Council (R) (FSC (R)) certified. Currently, PT BUMWI is approaching the completion of a 25-year rotation (with stands ranging from 0 to 25 years) which presents a good time to examine and evaluate current management practices and their effects on the forest concession. Part of a successful regeneration of a forest stand is attaining the range of ecological integrity and ecosystem functions similar to baseline forests. Forest structure and complexity, along with biodiversity at the stand level could function as regeneration criteria to evaluate the success of a sustainable forest management program. The objective of the study was to observe if the forest structure and biodiversity in secondary stands, considered as proxies for ecological integrity, would regenerate to similar levels within the 25 years as baseline forests. Post-harvest forest regeneration was evaluated in different aged secondary forest stands by measuring biomass, species composition and forest structure in circular plots along transects. Nonlinear regression was used to determine and predict different forest structure dynamics (sapling and stem densities, tree height, DBH), diversity and volumes throughout and beyond the 25-year rotation period. Dynamics in species composition and diversity of tree species was observed. Results suggest that the forest structure in secondary stands follows a natural regeneration dynamic over the rotation period but had not yet attained the same structure and composition as baseline forests at 25 years. Furthermore, growth models suggest that the harvest rotation may need to be extended to 30-40 years for secondary stands to attain similar ranges of forest structure, compositions and volumes to that of baseline forests. These observations will help future forest management of the concession as the company strives to manage secondary forests to keep the same ecosystem functions and high volumes observed in baseline forests.

Yet, there is often a diversity of views and goals of restoring tropical peatlands. While technical approaches dominate peatland restoration literature, this study introduces a novel social-ecological framework that analyzed the value-driven priorities that shape restoration goals. Based on semi-structured interviews with 14 key informants and six focus groups with development agencies, local governments, non-governmental organizations, and local communities, participants highlight key issues in restoring peatlands, often influenced by the socioeconomic and historical context in which they are positioned. These results exemplify specific objectives for restoration in developing countries with relatively smaller yet equally important peatlands. The study's novelty lies in applying sense-making and value-centric approaches to tropical peatland restoration, contributing to discourse by demonstrating how diverse social perspectives and values critically shape restoration outcomes, an underrepresented dimension in predominantly technical restoration literature.

TI  - Land Use, Land Cover Change and Sustainable Intensification of Agriculture and Livestock in the Amazon and the Atlantic Forest in Brazil
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The Amazon and the Atlantic Forest are Brazilian biomes that suffered an intense land use and land cover change, marked by the loss of native forest and expansion of agriculture and livestock. This article aims to analyze land use and land cover change history and to propose a sustainable alternative for agriculture and livestock as an opportunity for rural development in these biomes. The statistics of the platform from the Annual Mapping Project for Land Use and Land Cover in Brazil (MapBiomas) were used in an annual historical series from 1985 to 2020. The analysis of land use and land cover changes indicates that the Amazon native forest was reduced by 44.53 million hectares (Mha), while pasture, agriculture and planted forest increased by 38.10, 6.06 and 0.26 Mha, respectively, over the 35 years (1985 to 2020). In the Atlantic Forest, for the same period, forest and pasture reduced by 0.99 and 11.53 Mha, respectively, while agriculture expanded by 8.06 Mha and planted forest by 2.99 Mha. Sustainable land use strategies, such as the Integration Crop-Livestock-Forest (ICLF), can support the increase in agricultural production while recovering and preserving the environment. Policies and programs should consider regional particularities and barriers for more significant adoption of this strategy.

TI  - Atlantic Forest Ecosystems: Are There Significant Differences When Compared at the Same Stage of Regeneration?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - For the monitoring and assessment of Atlantic Forest ecosystems, key indicators of the regeneration stage are considered. However, the current classification of these stages by experts does not consider the possible differences among such ecosystems. In order to test the hypothesis of significant differences, Atlantic Forest ecosystems in southern Brazil were compared at the same stage (initial, medium, and advanced stages of regeneration). An extensive database of the floristic forest inventory of Santa Catarina state, southern Brazil, with 460 sampling units, was used, addressing the seasonal deciduous forest (SDF), dense ombrophilous forest (DOF), and mixed ombrophilous forest (MOF). The regeneration stage of each sample unit was previously classified by experts using five key indicators (basal area per hectare-BA/ha; number of individuals per hectare-N/ha; number of species-S; Shannon biodiversity index-H'; and diameter at breast height-DBH). The Kruskal-Wallis method and pairwise multiple comparisons based on Dunn's procedure were applied, considering two-way tests with 5% significance, and 95% power. The statistical tests confirmed the research hypothesis, namely, that the key indicators had significant differences in the later regeneration stages of Atlantic Forest ecosystems. For instance, S in DOF was statistically higher (p < 0.001) than in MOF and SDF (44 +/- 9); N in SDF was significantly lower (394 +/- 248 at mid-stage) compared to MOF (475 +/- 233) and DOF (545 +/- 173); and H' showed increasing differences towards more advanced stages. Considering that the stage of forest regeneration is the main criterion for decision-making between suppression and conservation of forest ecosystems, the results achieved should support the review of current procedures applied to the classification of successional stages. Given the demonstrated differences, in the next steps of research, we will evaluate and propose specific standards for each Atlantic Forest ecosystem, i.e., intervals of discriminating values for the key indicators applicable to this biome.

TI  - Invasive alien species in protected areas: the dynamics of Pinus taeda at Rio Canoas State Park-Brazil
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB  - Biological invasion is a growing problem, and species of the genus Pinus are known to be a problem in the forests of southern Brazil, including in conservation units. Here, we studied the ecology of Pinus taeda L. invasion in Rio Canoas State Park (PAERC) in regards to forest inventory, soil seed bank analysis, and seed rain assessment, in three distinct successional stages inside the park referred to as "Pinus invasion", "Old Growth Vegetation", and "Initial Vegetation". The forest inventory of 33 (20 m x 20 m) plots found Pinus in two of the three evaluated environments. Seed rain was collected bimonthly using 33 (1 m x 1 m) seed traps for a period of 1 year. The major seed distribution periods were in April and June, confirming data found in the literature. The seed bank was analyzed in February (summer) and June (winter) of 2018. Samples were kept in a greenhouse for a period of 120 days each. Summer evaluation showed no emergence of Pinus taeda seedlings, but the winter evaluation (June) did show the emergence of seedlings. The results showed that the soil seed bank is not persistent. Accordingly, the Pinus invasion reported at PAERC requires a restoration program, as well as one that controls reinfestation.

TI  - Climate change is expected to restructure forest frugivorous bird communities in a biodiversity hot-point within the Atlantic Forest
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
AB  - Aim Changes in climatic conditions are predicted to impact species distribution and hence alter their diversity patterns. Modifications in the composition of biological communities are expected as a result of the loss and replacement of species due to global warming. Forest frugivorous birds already suffer from habitat loss and may disappear locally due to suitable area contraction or range shifts to novel areas, disrupting seed dispersal and consequently the functioning of natural ecosystems. Here, we investigate the impacts of different climate scenarios on alpha and beta diversities of forest frugivorous birds. Location Central Corridor of the Atlantic Forest (CCAF), Brazil. Methods We used ecological niche models to project species distribution of 68 frugivorous birds for the baseline and future (2050 and 2070) scenarios. We generated binary maps of suitable areas for each species by climate scenario to calculate alpha and beta diversities. Results Most forest frugivorous birds were projected to lose suitable area, as a consequence of climate change, reducing alpha diversity in future scenarios and increasing temporal beta diversity, which is dominated by the nestedness component. In addition, species richness decreased from the east to the west portion of the CCAF, while differentiation of bird communities increased in the same direction, a pattern consistent across all climate scenarios evaluated. Main conclusions Climate change may exert drastic alterations in the composition of frugivorous bird communities in the CCAF. As forest frugivorous birds are critical to seed dispersal of forest plant species, impoverishment of their communities can drastically affect forest regeneration, diversity, and structure in the decades to come. Therefore, a better comprehension of spatio-temporal changes in diversity patterns of frugivorous birds can help us to avoid the disruption of seed dispersal and its consequences, such as cascading effects that will trigger biodiversity loss in the CCAF.

TI  - Opportunities and risk management of peat restoration in Indonesia: lessons learned from peat restoration actors
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Significant efforts have been invested to restore degraded peatlands in Indonesia considering the high mitigation potential as an effective natural climate solution. However, peat restoration in Indonesia faces challenges such as suboptimal planning and risk management. In this study, we assessed the national potential peat restoration area using spatial analysis and identified the associated risks based on lessons learned from past restoration efforts. We estimated the extent of potential restoration areas by analyzing canal networks, burnt areas, and critical land maps at the national scale. We conducted focus group discussions (FGD), in-depth interviews, followed by a national workshop with relevant stakeholders to assess the potential risks and develop risk management strategies for peat restoration. Our analysis estimated 6 Mha, or 45% of Indonesia's total peatland area, as potentially restorable areas for rewetting and/or revegetation efforts. Of this potential area, 50% falls under concession holder management. The identified risks consisted of technical (39%), management (38%), social (17%), and economic (6%) factors, with 15 and 22% classified as extreme and high risk, respectively. Policymakers can use these findings to strengthen regulations and improve the chances of successful restoration implementation, supporting Indonesia's emissions reduction target and providing economic benefits for restoration actors.

TI  - Headwater control:: Despatches from the research front
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RECONSTRUCTION IN HEADWATER AREAS
CP  - NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Environmental Reconstruction in Headwater Areas
AB  - Headwater Control is about integrated land management. Effective headwater management requires better information, better technologies, better management structures, change in land husbandry and direct engineering interventions. Headwater regions often waste their resources. In Jammu and Kashmir, 40% (and in South Africa and Iranian Azerbaijan 60%) of the water resource runs to waste. Azerbaijan's planners believe that 25% could be collected for agriculture. In Xinjiang, China, by contrast, over-utilisation of the headwater resources in the Tarim Basin has caused desertification and large-scale farmland abandonment downstream Better systems of water resource accounting are required. Eventually, the Lesotho Highlands Water Project may generate 25% of that nation's foreign exchange earnings. Acidification is linked to the human impact in headwaters. Previously, pH was controlled by climatic, lithologic, edaphic and biologic factors. New Japanese work stresses the role of the weathered layer beneath the soils of tropical steeplands in moderating the hydrologic impacts of forestation and acid precipitation Elsewhere, pollution plays a critical role, especially the deposition of air pollutants. Time trends of NO3- and SO42- deposition may be dwarfed by natural geographical variations within a smalt basin. However, the chief agencies are decreasingly SO42-, increasingly NO3- and more generally agricultural chemicals and other human wastes. Riverine microbial biofilms act as both sinks and sources for pollutants. In Canada, effective prevention of non-point-source pollution required a compromise between the net welfare of farmers, the wider non-farm community and the environment. Better systems of water quality management are required. The riparian zone is often counted critical. Fragmentation of both the riparian zone and its management rank among the most serious challenges for land managers. However, while restoring riparian vegetation reduces sediment loads and increases the biodiversity of affected rivers, it may not mitigate acidification. Mathematical models for predicting runoff from alpine catchments are evaluated. USDAHL with GIS, HEC-1 and RUNOFF-5 are generally satisfactory and HYRROM is useful for engineering.
   Empirical studies show that forests moderate hydrological and erosional processes. In Serbia, 15-years study in steep headwater basins finds that forest covers > 70%, rather than < 49%, yield smaller flood peaks and provide a more sustained flow (dry for 13.4 days/year-1 vs. 121.4 or more). In Japan's mountain headwaters, reforestation reduces water losses. Here, increased evapotranspiration is compensated by decreased deep seepage. In Alaska, tree roots prove as important as pore water pressure in regulating landsliding on steep dopes with shallow soils. Soil erosion remains a major problem. In Brazil, regional estimates of soil loss were a seventh of those due to rill and gully erosion in fields under conventional tillage. In Lithuania, soil depth declines ranging from 0.12 - 0.94 m and soil fertility declines ranging from 22% to 63% are reported. In the Himalaya soil nutrient deficiencies are widespread and agricultural inputs are inadequate to the maintenance of fertility levels. Overgrazing, forest conversion, the harvesting of wild medicinal herbs, road construction and mining cause soil degradation and permit ecological invasion by alien weed species. The situation of the headwater farmer, struggling with land degradation, contrasts with that of the padi farmer downstream, whose fields are enriched with soils and nutrients lost from the uplands. Elsewhere, sediment and agrochemical pollution causes problems downstream In Canada, conservation tillage proves best pollution control practice for both the farmers and non-farm community. In Brazil, rill and gully erosion was eliminated by the adoption of no-till agriculture. In Lithuania, returning steeper slopes to pasture reduced soil losses to zero. Cover management reduced soil losses in Algeria Small grain cultivation reduced soil losses to a half or a third of bare fallow. In Japan, stone mulches prove effective against erosion. In Yunnan, China, contour cultivation with straw mulching is more effective against erosion than contour cultivation and, in descending order, inter-cropping, no-till, polythene mulching or conventional agriculture. Soil losses are widely linked to individual aggressive rainfall events. In Nepal the two most severe storms each year commonly account for >80% of total soil loss. In the Himalaya and Sierra Nevada, overgrazing, and in Brazil, India, and China, agricultural extension, are other major causes. In Serbia, headwater depopulation reduced soil losses, Headwater Control requires improved land husbandry. The empowerment of local communities is the best route. UNCED's Chapter 13 echoes the MC belief in working with local communities to match economic land use with land capability. New participatory institutional frameworks, based on public trust doctrines and 'basin citizenship', are introduced.

TI  - The Tropical Peatland Plantation-Carbon Assessment Tool: estimating CO2 emissions from tropical peat soils under plantations
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Land use change on Indonesian peatlands contributes to global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Accessible predictive tools are required to estimate likely soil carbon (C) losses and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from peat soils under this land use change. Research and modelling efforts in tropical peatlands are limited, restricting the availability of data for complex soil model parameterisation and evaluation. The Tropical Peatland Plantation-Carbon Assessment Tool (TROPP-CAT) was developed to provide a user friendly tool to evaluate and predict soil C losses and CO2 emissions from tropical peat soils. The tool requires simple input values to determine the rate of subsidence, of which the oxidising proportion results in CO2 emissions. This paper describes the model structure and equations, and presents a number of evaluation and application runs. TROPP-CAT has been applied for both site specific and national level simulations, on existing oil palm and Acacia plantations, as well as on peat swamp forest sites to predict likely emissions from future land use change. Through an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, literature reviews and comparison with other methods of estimating soil C losses, the paper identifies opportunities for future model development, bridging between different approaches to predicting CO2 emissions from tropical peatlands under land use change. TROPP-CAT can be accessed online from www.redd-alert.eu in both English and Bahasa ndonesia.

T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - As part of a larger study evaluating several silvicultural techniques for restoring tropical moist forests on abandoned agricultural lands in southeastern Brazil, direct seeding with five early-successional Atlantic forest species was tested at three degraded sites, characterized by different soil types and land-use histories, within the Environmental Protection Area at Botucatu, SP. The species used in this study were Chorisia speciosa, Croton floribundus, Enterolobium contorstisiliquum, Mimosa scabrella, and Schizolobium parahyba. Scarified seeds of each of these species were sown in prepared seed spots in replicated, 0.25 ha mixed-species plots at an initial espacement of 1 m x 1 m at each site. Of the five species planted, only two, Enterolobium and Schizolobium, showed good seed germination, seedling survival, and early growth rates, averaging 4.1-4.6 cm stem diameter and 1.5-1.7 m height growth during the first 2 years after sowing. These two species constituted 88-100% of the total stand density, which ranged from 1050 to 1790 stems ha(-1) at 2 years. Despite the poor performance of the other species tested, we observed that the natural regeneration of native forest species originating from remnant forests in the general vicinity of our study sites was significantly greater within the direct-seeded plots than in unplanted control plots that were protected from fire and other disturbances.

TI  - Modeling Environmental Vulnerability for 2050 Considering Different Scenarios in the Doce River Basin, Brazil
T2  - WATER
AB  - Understanding climate change and land use impacts is crucial for mitigating environmental degradation. This study assesses the environmental vulnerability of the Doce River Basin for 2050, considering future climate change and land use and land cover (LULC) scenarios. Factors including slope, elevation, relief dissection, precipitation, temperature, pedology, geology, urban distance, road distance, and LULC were evaluated using multicriteria analysis. Regional climate models Eta-HadGEM2-ES and Eta-MIROC5 under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios were employed. The Land Change Modeler tool simulated 2050 LULC changes and hypothetical reforestation of legal reserve (RL) areas. Combining two climate and two LULC scenarios resulted in four future vulnerability scenarios. Projections indicate an over 300 mm reduction in average annual precipitation and an up to 2 degrees C temperature increase from 2020 to 2050. Scenario 4 (RCP 8.5 and LULC for 2050 with reforested RLs) showed the greatest basin area in the lowest vulnerability classes, while scenario 3 (RCP 4.5 and LULC for 2050) exhibited more high-vulnerability areas. Despite the projected relative improvement in environmental vulnerability by 2050 due to reduced rainfall, the complexity of associated relationships must be considered. These results contribute to mitigating environmental damage and adapting to future climatic conditions in the Doce River Basin.

TI  - The role of agroforestry in restoring Brazil's Atlantic Forest: Opportunities and challenges for smallholder farmers
T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
AB  - 1. Restoring the degraded Atlantic Forest is one of the biggest conservation challenges in Brazil. In a biome with high human presence, understanding the potential for restoration approaches, such as agroforestry, to provide benefits to smallholder farmers and biodiversity is essential in developing equitable restoration strategies.
   2. Smallholder or family farmers are essential to national food security, producing most fruit and vegetables consumed in Brazil. Their farms can also provide ecological stepping stones for biodiversity. To better understand their role in Atlantic Forest restoration, this study explores the use of agroforestry by smallholder farmers from the Movimento Sem Terra (MST), the Rural Landless Workers' Movement, in Pontal do Paranapanema.
   3. We use quantitative and qualitative data to assess farmer perceptions of the measures which support agroforestry farming, barriers to implementation and its impact on indicators of wellbeing. We find agroforestry farmers report significant benefits in 8 of 18 tested indicators. Attitudes to agroforestry are varied, but common themes emerge including the high value of tree cover for shade and cooling effects, and the difficulties in selling agroforestry products. Our results show lack of policy support and initial investment needs are the biggest constraints to agroforestry, but opportunity cost is not considered a large barrier.
   4. Tailored policies and financial measures are needed to integrate thousands of smallholder farmers into the Atlantic Forest restoration agenda, helping to reach biome restoration targets while supporting rural livelihoods and national food security. Further research is required into links between additional socio-economic and biogeographical variables and agroforestry uptake in the region.

TI  - Tropical Peatland Burn Depth and Combustion Heterogeneity Assessed Using UAV Photogrammetry and Airborne LiDAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - We provide the first assessment of tropical peatland depth of burn (DoB) using structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry, applied to imagery collected using a low-cost, low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system operated over a 5.2 ha tropical peatland in Jambi Province on Sumatra, Indonesia. Tropical peat soils are the result of thousands of years of dead biomass accumulation, and when burned are globally significant net sources of carbon emissions. The El Nino year of 2015 saw huge areas of Indonesia affected by tropical peatland fires, more so than any year since 1997. However, the Depth of Burn (DoB) of these 2015 fires has not been assessed, and indeed has only previously been assessed in few tropical peatland burns in Kalimantan. Therefore, DoB remains arguably the largest uncertainty when undertaking fire emissions calculations in these tropical peatland environments. We apply a SfM photogrammetric methodology to map this DoB metric, and also investigate combustion heterogeneity using orthomosaic photography collected using the UAV system. We supplement this information with pre-burn airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, reducing uncertainty by estimating pre-burn soil height more accurately than from interpolation of adjacent unburned areas alone. Our pre-and post-fire Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) show accuracies of 0.04 and 0.05 m (root-mean-square error, RMSE) respectively, compared to ground-based global navigation satellite system (GNSS) surveys. Our final DoB map of a 5.2 ha degraded peat swamp forest area neighboring Berbak National Park (Sumatra, Indonesia) shows burn depths extending from close to zero to over 1 m, with a mean (+/- 1 sigma) DoB of 0.23 +/- 0.19 m. This lies well within the range found by the few other studies available (on Kalimantan; none are available on Sumatra). Our combustion heterogeneity analysis suggests the deepest burns, which extend to similar to 1.3 m, occur around tree roots. We use these DoB data within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default equation for fire emissions to estimate mean carbon emissions as 134 +/- 29 tC.ha(-1) for this peatland fire, which is in an area that had not had a recorded fire previously. This is amongst the highest per unit area fuel consumption anywhere in the world for landscape fires. Our approach provides significant uncertainty reductions in such emissions calculations via the reduction in DoB uncertainty, and by using the UAV SfM approach this is accomplished at a fraction of the cost of airborne LiDARalbeit over limited sized areas at present. Deploying this approach at locations across Indonesia, sampling a variety of fire-affected landscapes, would provide new and important DoB statistics for producing optimized carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions estimates from peatland fires.

TI  - A comparison of satellite remote sensing data fusion methods to map peat swamp forest loss in Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - The loss of huge areas of peat swamp forest in Southeast Asia and the resulting negative environmental effects, both local and global, have led to an increasing interest in peat restoration in the region. Satellite remote sensing offers the potential to provide up-to-date information on peat swamp forest loss across large areas, and support spatial explicit conservation and restoration planning. Fusion of optical and radar remote sensing data may be particularly valuable in this context, as most peat swamp forests are in areas with high cloud cover, which limits the use of optical data. Radar data can 'see through' cloud, but experience so far has shown that it doesn't discriminate well between certain types of land cover. Various approaches to fusion exist, but there is little information on how they compare. To assess this untapped potential, we compare three different classification methods with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images to map the remnant distribution of peat swamp forest in the area surrounding Sungai Buluh Protection Forest, Sumatra, Indonesia. Results show that data fusion increases overall accuracy in one of the three methods, compared to the use of optical data only. When data fusion was used with the pixel-based classification using the original pixel values, overall accuracy increased by a small, but statistically significant amount. Data fusion was not beneficial in the case of object-based classification or pixel-based classification using principal components. This indicates optical data are still the main source of information for land cover mapping in the region. Based on our findings, we provide methodological recommendations to help those involved in peatland restoration capitalize on the potential of big data.

TI  - What Can Restoration Do for Bee Communities? An Example in the Atlantic Rainforest in Parana State, Southern Brazil
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Biodiversity conservation is a challenge for today. Studies regarding different ecosystems have become extremely important for understanding communities and promoting strategies for conservation, especially those involving forest restoration as strategy to reverse biodiversity loss. We compared bee diversity indices between three remnants of Atlantic rainforest in southern Brazil and four adjacent areas that were reforested after shale mining, and which are now under different restoration levels. Seven sites were monitored for over 5 years (2011-2016), by sampling bees directly on flowers or in flight using an entomological net, with 400 collected individuals/site/year. Bee species composition differed between post-mining ages and between sites. In all, we sampled 14.185 specimens and 236 bee species. The introduced Africanized Apis mellifera Linnaeus was the most frequent and abundant species, followed by Trigona spinipes and Psaenythia bergii Holmberg. Among habitats, the reforested area in initial phase showed lower richness and diversity in relation all others sample sites. Conversely, all indices were higher in forest remnants, middle phase II, and advanced phase reforested areas, reinforcing the importance of reforestation for conservation, notably endangered species, such as Oxytrigona sp., Schwarziana quadripunctata (Lepeletier), and the solitary species of the genus Hylaeus, all found in the restored areas. These results represent an important contribution for understanding the recovery of the bee fauna in restored mining habitats. The dataset reveals an interesting response in areas that were mined for shale extraction and are now undergoing different levels of restoration, suggesting that older reforested habitats have a higher probability of having a fully recovered bee community.

TI  - Stabilizing the agricultural frontier: Leveraging REDD with biofuels for sustainable development
T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
CP  - IEA Bioenergy Task 38 Meeting on Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Bioenergy Systems - Impacts of Timing, Issues of Responsibility
AB  - We evaluate the potential of a proposed policy model that would explicitly link the cultivation of biofuels with forest conservation (Biofuel + FC) as part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The model postulates that a ratio of 4:1 forest conservation to biofuel cultivation be linked to proposals for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD + Biofuel), while a ratio of 9:1 biofuel cultivation to reforestation on degraded landscape (RDL + Biofuel) be linked to the afforestation/reforestation component of the Clean Development Mechanism. Both biofuel production options would be limited to the cultivation of woody perennial biofuel species on low biomass landscapes in order to maximize the carbon benefits of the proposed policy model. The potential to conserve forest, avoid GHG emissions, improve carbon sequestration, and produce renewable energy are evaluated by an illustrative model for five case studies (Para - Brazil, East Kalimantan - Indonesia, Madagascar, Colombia and Liberia). The Biofuel + FC policy model is then compared with three counterfactual scenarios: REDO Alone with no biofuel cultivation; Biofuel Alone with expanded biofuel cultivation in the absence of REDD and a Most Likely scenario where REDD and biofuel cultivation are implemented without explicit regulatory linkages. The proposed policy model would leverage forest carbon with biofuel markets, which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and conserve biodiversity, as well as improve human welfare in developing countries, a win-win-win strategy for sustainable development.

TI  - Coupled social and ecological outcomes of agricultural intensification in Costa Rica and the future of biodiversity conservation in tropical agricultural regions
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - Tropical ecosystem conversion to agriculture has caused widespread habitat loss and created fragmented landscapes composed of remnant forest patches embedded in a matrix of agricultural land uses. Non-traditional agricultural export (NTAE) crops such as pineapple are rapidly replacing multiuse landscapes characterized by a diverse matrix of pasture and smallholder crops with intensive, large-scale, monoculture plantations. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we conduct a case study to examine the coupled social and ecological implications of agricultural intensification in this region, with larger application to regions experiencing similar patterns of agricultural intensification. Guided by frameworks from both political and landscape ecology, we: (1) describe the social and economic implications of pineapple expansion, specifically the concentration of land, labor and financial resources, (2) quantify pineapple cultivation's spatial characteristics, and (3) assess the effects of pineapple expansion on surrounding forest ecosystems, on the agricultural matrix and on biodiversity conservation. Our results indicate that pineapple production concentrates land, labor, and financial resources, which has a homogenizing effect on the agricultural economy in the study region. This constrains farm-based livelihoods, with larger implications for food security and agricultural diversity. Landscape ecology analyses further reveal how pineapple production simplifies and homogenizes the agricultural matrix between forest patches, which is likely to have a negative effect on biodiversity. To offset the effects of pineapple expansion on social and environmental systems, we recommend developing landscape level land use planning capacity. Furthermore, agricultural and conservation policy reform is needed to promote landscape heterogeneity and economic diversity within the agricultural sector. Our interdisciplinary research provides a detailed examination of the social and ecological impacts of agricultural intensification in a tropical landscape, and offers recommendations for improvement relevant not only to our study region but to the many other tropical landscapes currently undergoing non-traditional agricultural export driven agricultural intensification.

TI  - Passive Restoration of Atlantic Forest Following Pinus taeda Harvesting in Southern Brazil
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - The understory of exotic tree plantations can have non-negligible native species richness. Ecological restoration of these sites may include the harvest of trees, depending on the tradeoff between timber income and harvest impacts on biodiversity. This study aimed to investigate how a site can recover from harvest disturbance, by comparing the regeneration of woody species in the understory of two types of 37-year-old Pinus taeda plantation (P1 and P2, high and low relative density of pine seedlings in the understory, respectively), with stands that were similar to P2 but subjected to harvest and then abandoned for 15years (R sites). Secondary forests (SF) were used as references. We sampled three different sites for each stand condition; soil chemical properties, estimations of litter mass, and canopy cover were measured. P1 had low species diversity, and P2 and R had 50 and 46% of SF richness, respectively. The R site contained few pine saplings and was floristically similar to P2; this indicated that 15years was sufficient for the recovery of plant diversity to near pre-harvesting levels. Soil fertility was highest in SF and lowest in P1. Thus old plantations of P. taeda with low relative density of pine juveniles can be cost-effective starting points for restoration. Despite the destructive effects of pine harvest, recovery of native species can occur rapidly. In situations in which clearcutting of pine stands is not planned or possible, modest thinning of P. taeda adults and/or intensive thinning of juveniles could expedite restoration.

TI  - Harnessing the synergy of Urochloa brizantha and Amazonian Dark Earth microbiomes for enhanced pasture recovery
T2  - BMC MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Amazonian Dark Earths (ADEs) are fertile soils from the Amazon rainforest that harbor microorganisms with biotechnological potential. This study aimed to investigate the individual and potential synergistic effects of a 2% portion of ADEs and Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu roots (Brazil's most common grass species used for pastures) on soil prokaryotic communities and overall soil attributes in degraded soil. We conducted a comprehensive plant succession experiment in the greenhouse, utilizing vase soil samples for next-generation sequencing of 16 S rDNA, enzymatic activity assays, and soil chemical properties analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to understand better the prokaryotic interactions within soil environments influenced by ADEs and U. brizantha roots, including differential abundance, diversity, and network analyses. Our findings reveal a complementary relationship between U. brizantha and ADEs, each contributing to distinct positive aspects of soil bacterial communities and quality. The combined influence of U. brizantha roots and ADEs exhibited synergies that enhanced prokaryotic diversity and enzyme activity. This balance supported plant growth and increased the general availability of beneficial bacteria in the soil, such as Chujaibacter and Curtobacterium while reducing the presence of potentially pathogenic taxa. This research provided valuable insights into the intricate dynamics of plant-soil feedback, emphasizing the potential for complementary interactions between specific plant species and unique soil environments like ADEs. The findings highlight the potential for pasture ecological rehabilitation and underscore the benefits of integrating plant and soil management strategies to optimize soil characteristics.

TI  - Participatory construction in agroforestry systems in family farming: ways for the agroecological transition in Brazil
T2  - AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - This article aims to analyze the implementation of Agroforestry Systems (AFS) by family farmers, assessing their contribution to agroecological transition and understanding the process of knowledge construction. The study was carried out in family farming farms in the Sumare Rural Settlement, and in the area of Family Farming and Agroecological Cooperative (Cooperacra), respectively located in the municipalities of Sumare and Americana, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The methodology was based on a case study, using Focal Groups and Field Notes as research instruments. On the basis of our analysis, there were social changes in the farmers' organization and in the decision-making process, as well as in the landscape in the areas of AFS and surroundings, where agroecological principles were also applied to production. In Sumare, the four farmers participating in the project organized themselves to obtain organic certification. Cooperacra, which works with a group of 10 farmers advanced in the process of agroecological transition, starting from an intensive organic horticulture production system to a biodiverse agroforestry system. Despite the short time of the project, the construction of knowledge in relation to agroforestry systems was perceived through management techniques incorporated by the farmers in their agroecosystems. The arboreal component, which thus far the farmers had seen as something to be eliminated to realize agriculture, was introduced and became a relevant part of the process. The results demonstrate the feasibility and potential of AFS in the process of agroecological transition toward a more sustainable agriculture.

TI  - Shannon tree diversity is a surrogate for mineland rehabilitation status
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Mineland rehabilitation is performed to reduce the overall impacts of mining operations. Thus, statistically validated and easily measurable indicators are necessary to monitor the environmental status along time, enhance the rehabilitation process, and increase institutional tractability. The objective of this study is to derive an effective indicator to assess the environmental quality of iron mining waste piles undergoing rehabilitation in the Caraj acute accent as National Forest, eastern Amazon, Brazil, from a curated set of field-surveyed environmental variables related to vegetation structure, invertebrate and vegetation compositions, diversity, and ecological processes. Data were collected from a chronosequence that included non-revegetated areas, areas in different rehabilitation stages and natural reference sites. All variables were integrated to produce a single estimate of rehabilitation status using a multivariate approach. Individual variables largely differed in their response ratios; nevertheless, the data integration showed that more than 50% of the predisturbance ecosystem structure, diversity and functioning were restituted after only seven years, which highlights the potential of rehabilitation activities to effectively reduce mining impacts. Among all 27 variables, the Shannon index of tree diversity had the highest predictive power for overall rehabilitation status, qualifying this metric as the most effective indicator for the use in future comprehensive monitoring activities in waste piles undergoing rehabilitation in the Caraj acute accent as National Forest. The positive relationship between tree diversity and mineland rehabilitation status in the examined areas emphasizes the importance of diverse tree communities in increasing rehabilitation success and ecosystem and soil functioning over short time periods.

TI  - Impact of exotic tree species on the natural regeneration of an urban restinga forest
T2  - TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB  - Key message Exotic tree species Syzygium cumini and Taliparti tiliaceum affect restinga forest regeneration growing under them, in comparison to native species, mainly because they reduce saplings' abundance.Biological plant invasions are a considerable threat to native vegetation biodiversity, mainly when the invaded site consists in suppressed fragmented remnants surrounded by urbanization. Although this is the case of Brazilian restinga forests, knowledge on potential invasion events in these environments remains scarce. We herein identified differences between these communities by comparing natural regeneration on plots planted with exotic tree species Syzygium cumini and Talipariti tiliaceum to those planted with native trees on an urban restinga forest park in Rio de Janeiro city. We observed that natural regeneration communities were impacted by exotic trees, resulting in alterations to both their structure and floristic composition. Furthermore, the magnitude of this impact depended on the identity of the exotic tree in question. Somehow, plant community regeneration based on species T. tiliaceum was significantly different from that in native plots, at all parameters: species richness, mean abundance of individuals, mean plant height, total basal area, absolute density and abundance of seedlings. S. cumini, in its turn, seemed to have only significantly changed regeneration's abundance parameters. Therefore, based on our findings, S. cumini and T. tiliaceum presented potential invasive impact to native flora. These species should be monitored and likely managed in other restinga forests, since prevention is the key action to preserve our native environments from biological invasions.

TI  - Comparing direct land use impacts on biodiversity of conventional and organic milk-based on a Swedish case study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT
AB  - Halting the loss of biodiversity while providing food security for a growing and prospering world population is a challenge. One possible solution to this dilemma is organic agriculture, which is expected to enhance biodiversity on the farmland. However, organic products often require larger areas. This study demonstrates how we can quantify and compare the direct land use impacts on biodiversity of organic and conventional food products such as milk.
   This study assessed direct land use impacts of 1 l of milk leaving the farm gate. Inventory data on land occupation were extracted from a life cycle assessment study of 15 farms in southern Sweden. Direct land use change data were derived from the FAO statistical database. Spatially differentiated characterization factors of occupation (CFOcc) and transformation (CFTrans) were calculated based on the relative difference of plant species richness on agricultural land compared to a (semi) natural regional reference. Data on plant species richness and regeneration times of ecosystems (for calculating transformation impacts) were derived from a literature review. To account for differences in biodiversity value between regions, a weighting system based on absolute species richness, vulnerability and irreplaceability was applied.
   Organic milk had a lower direct land use impact than conventional milk, although it required about double the area. Occupation impacts dominated the results and were much smaller for organic than conventional milk, as CFOcc of organic land uses were considerably smaller. For transformation impacts, differences between the two farming practices were even more pronounced. The highest impacts were caused by soymeal in concentrate feeds (conventional milk) due to large-scale deforestation in its country of cultivation (i.e. Brazil and Argentina). However, lack of reliable data posed a challenge in the assessment of transformation impacts. Overall, results were highly sensitive to differences in land occupation area between farms, the CFOcc and assumptions concerning transformed area. Sensitivity and robustness of results were tested and are discussed.
   Although organic milk required about twice as much land as conventional, it still had lower direct land use impacts on biodiversity. This highlights the importance of assessing land use impacts not only based on area but also considering the actual impacts on biodiversity. The presented approach allows to quantify and compare hot- and coldspots in the agricultural stage of milk production and could potentially also be applied to other agricultural products. However, more research is needed to allow quantification of indirect land use impacts.

TI  - Carbon stock estimate using indirect methods in a forest restoration area in Minas Gerais State
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
AB  - This study aimed to estimate and compare the carbon stock obtained from three indirect methods in a reforested area of 21 years in southern Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Forest inventory data (diameter and height) from permanent plots, measured between 2010 and 2013, were used to estimate the biomass (dry weight) using an allometric equation. Basic wood density (BWD) and carbon content were only determined for species with high ecological importance. Carbon stock was obtained by three indirect methods: multiplying dry biomass (DB) by the carbon content (M1) obtained through laboratory analysis; multiplying the DB by the factor 0.5 (M2); and use of an allometric equation (M3). The species with the lowest and highest carbon content were Lafoensia vandelliana (43.70%) and Anadenanthera peregrina (46.60%). As for the BWD, the species that showed the lowest and highest value were Cecropia pachystachya (0.31 g cm(-3)) and Anadenanthera peregrina (0.72 g cm(-3)). Carbon stocks obtained by methods 1, 2, and 3 were 49.73 t ha(-1); 55.65 t ha(-1) and 54.70 t ha(-1), respectively. The using an allometric equation and generic carbon content overestimated the carbon stock in the studied area. Thus, the use of carbon content determined in laboratory improved the accuracy estimation of the carbon stock.

TI  - Strong climate mitigation potential of rewetting oil palm plantations on tropical peatlands
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - For decades, tropical peatlands in Indonesia have been deforested and converted to other land uses, mainly oil palm plantations which now cover one-fourth of the degraded peatland area. Given that the capacity for peatland ecosystems to store carbon depends largely on hydrology, there is a growing interest in rewetting degraded peatlands to shift them back to a carbon sink. Recent estimates suggest that peatland rewetting may contribute up to 13 % of Indonesia's total mitigation potential from natural climate solutions. In this study, we measured CO2 2 and CH4 4 fluxes, soil temperature, and water table level (WTL) for drained oil palm plantations, rewetted oil palm plantations, and secondary forests located in the Mempawah and Kubu Raya Regencies of West Kalimantan, Indonesia. We found that peatland rewetting significantly reduced peat CO2 2 emissions, though CH4 4 uptake was not significantly different in rewetted peatland compared to drained peatland. Rewetting drained peatlands on oil palm plantations reduced heterotrophic respiration by 34 % and total respiration by 20 %. Our results suggest that rewetting drained oil palm plantations will not achieve low CO2 2 emissions as observed in secondary forests due to differences in vegetation or land management. However, extrapolating our results to the areas of degraded oil palm plantations in West Kalimantan suggests that successful peatland rewetting could still reduce emissions by 3.9 MtCO2 2 yr-- 1 . This result confirms that rewetting oil palm plantations in tropical peatlands is an effective natural climate solution for achieving national emission reduction targets.

TI  - Nitrogen Pools in Tropical Plantations of N2-Fixing and Non-N2-Fixing Legume Trees under Different Tree Stand Densities
T2  - NITROGEN
AB  - We investigated the nitrogen pools in monocultures of legume species widely used in reforestation in Brazil that have contrasting growth and nitrogen acquisition strategies. The plantations were established with the slow-growing and N-2-fixing tree Anadenanthera peregrina var. peregrina, and the fast-growing and non-fixing tree Schizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum. The measurements of N pools in the tree biomass and the soil followed standard methods and were carried out on 54 experimental plots. The N-2 fixation pools were evaluated by abundance natural of N-15 and the N accretion methods. The soil N content was of similar magnitude between species and stand densities. The species showed similar amounts of N in the biomass, but divergent patterns of N accumulation, as well as the N-15 signature on the leaves. S. parahyba accumulated most N in the stem, while A. peregrina accumulated N in the roots and leaves. However, the N accumulation in biomass of A. peregrina stand was less constrained by environment than in S. parahyba stands. The percentage of N derived from N-2 fixation in A. peregrina stands decreased with the increase of stand density. The biological N-2 fixation estimates depended on the method and the response of tree species to environment.

TI  - Short-term modifications of mycorrhizal fungi, glomalin and soil attributes in a tropical agroforestry
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) community and the Glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) they produce plays important roles in maintaining soil ecosystem functions, promoting ecological restoration, and are important for monitoring changes in soil health from land use change. This research addressed the subtle modifications of AMF and GRSP in different land use types and their association with soil properties. Our objectives were: 1) to assess land use effects on AMF spore density, diversity, and composition besides glomalin fractions (EEG, easily extracted GRSP; TG, total GRSP), and 2) to quantify the relationships between glomalin, AMF community metrics, soil organic carbon (SOC), and key soil quality parameters. Soils were collected in the dry and rainy seasons of 2018 under five land uses, including: three types of agroforestry systems (AS1, A52 and A53), an unmanaged pasture and a secondary forest in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Linear mixed-effects model and multivariate analyses showed that land uses had influenced the AMF community, meanly at the family level. On the other hand, seasonality has not proved to be an essential factor that modulates the changes of the AMF community and glomalin production. The management practices had influenced AMF sporulation and the number of total species in agroforestry systems. Glomalin is a potential contributor for SOC, mainly in agroforestry systems and pasture plots. Moreover, we found a correlation between the AMF community and key soil parameters. For example, most of the AMF families and spore density were positively correlated with the stability of soil aggregates and SOC. Our findings shed light on that land-use change can shift the AMF community, glomalin and their relationship to key soil quality parameters. Moreover, the adoption of agroforestry systems indicates maintenance of biodiversity and other soil quality parameters with future implications for their use to recover degraded areas.

AB  - Patterns of plant and animal diversity were studied in a 10-year-old native species reforestation area at a bauxite-mined site at Porto Trombetas in western Para State, Brazil. Understorey and overstorey floristic composition and structure, understorey light conditions, forest floor development and soil properties were evaluated in a total of 3878.5-m(2) plots located in the reforestation area at varying distances up to 640 m from the boundary with the surrounding primary forest. Wildlife surveys focusing primarily on birds and bats were also conducted to assess the role of seed-dispersing animals in regeneration of woody forest species within the plantations and colonization by primary forest species not included in the original reforestation. Regeneration density, species richness and species diversity (Shannon-Wiener index) for woody perennial species, vines, herbs and grasses were strongly correlated with the diversity of planted tree species and structural development parameters, degree of forest floor development and soil pH. The better developed closed-canopy plots (>40% crown closure) were characterized by relatively well-developed litter (O1) and humus (O2) layers, more acidic soils being typical of the surrounding primary forests, and a more diverse herb, vine and woody perennial flora with a greater representation of primary forest species being characteristic of late secondary forests. In closed-canopy plots' a total of 125 tree, palm and shrub species were censused (versus 34 in the more open-canopy plots), of which 75 species are known to have been introduced by natural means from the surrounding primary forest (versus 11 species in the open-canopy plots). Among the plantation plots, there was significant colonization by primary forest woody species up to 640 m away from the primary forest edge, although both the abundance and the diversity of colonizing species declined with increasing distance into the plantations. Smaller-seeded primary forest woody species dispersed by mammals and birds represented a higher proportion of the colonizing species compared with the larger-seeded species. These data are consistent with the results of the wildlife surveys, which indicated that most animal seed dispersal is provided by bats, that the most common frugivorous bat and bird species in the plantations feed on small-seeded plant species and that birds and mammals that typically disperse larger-seeded tree species (such as toucans, trogons, tapirs, deer and primates) are still rare in the reforestation area. These results suggest that while the reforestation program has been successful in creating a favorable environment for regeneration of a native primary forest species, further management interventions, such as enrichment plantings, may be required to accelerate regeneration of large-seeded primary forest species.

TI  - Accounting for seedling performance from nursery to outplanting when reforesting degraded tropical peatlands
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Reforestation is promoted to address the dual global climate and biodiversity crises. This is particularly relevant for carbon-rich, biodiverse tropical peatlands, for which active reforestation typically involves two post-germination stages: nursery rearing of seedlings, then outplanting. Yet, linkages between these stages and cumulative seedling performance are rarely quantified during tropical peatland reforestation. By monitoring tree seedling survival and growth, we investigate factors influencing seedling performance (species identity, seedling source, treatments, and climate), whether nursery performance predicts outplanting performance, and calculate cumulative survival (nursery plus outplanting) in Sebangau National Park, Indonesian Borneo. Standardized survival at 2 years was higher in the nursery (mean 67% across 40 species) than outplanting (44% across 24 species). For nursery and outplanting, species identity was the main source of variation in survival and height growth. Seedling source, treatments, site condition, and precipitation had no significant impact on survival but did influence growth in some cases. Nursery survival did not predict outplanting survival, but nursery height did predict outplanting height. Across species, around a quarter of seedlings survived from nursery to outplanting over 4 years. Cumulative survival represents a more realistic basis for assessing the genetic and other resource costs of tropical peatland reforestation. Our two-phase approach identified outplanting as the greater bottleneck to cumulative seedling survivability. We argue that the nursery stage may be used to harden seedlings for degraded peatland conditions by selecting more relevant treatments (e.g. flooding) and screening for resilience to common disturbances (e.g. fire) to enhance outplanted, and thus cumulative, seedling survival.

TI  - Peat moisture dataset of Sumatra peatlands
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
AB  - Peatland is a unique ecosystem that is key in regulating global carbon cycle, climate, hydrology, and biodiversity. Peat moisture content is a key variable in ecohydrological and biogeochemical cycles known to control peatland's greenhouse gas emissions and fire vulnerability. Peat moisture is also an indicator of the success of peat restoration projects. Here we present datasets of peat moisture dynamic and retention capacity of degraded tropical peatlands. The data were collected from automatic daily monitoring and field campaigns. The peat moisture content data consists of daily data from 21 stations across three peatland provinces in Sumatra Island, Indonesia, from 2018 to 2019. In addition, peat water retention data were collected from field campaigns in Riau province. This dataset represents human modified peatlands which can be used as a benchmark for hydrological and biogeochemical models.(c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Mangroves, fauna compositions and carbon sequestration after ten years restoration on Flores Island, Indonesia
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Indonesia has extensively reforested mangroves to stabilize coastal ecosystems and mitigate climate change. Reforestation's long-term effects on recovering mangroves are not extensively established because most projects are only observed for two years. It raises the question of whether mangrove replanting aids biodiversity conservation and ecological recovery. This study will characterize Flores Island mangrove ecosystems after ten years of regeneration. The ecological survey took place at Bangkoor, Kolisia, and Talibura reforestation areas. Floristic composition, wildlife diversity, carbon sequestration, and energy storage were measured at each location. Field observations revealed 10 mangrove species and 11 species, which is varying by site. Flora diversity was highest in Kolisia and fauna diversity was highest in Talibura. Talibura and Kolisia have similar vegetation and wildlife than Bangkoor. Restored mangrove stands sequestered 28.69 - 70.02 Mg CO2 ha- 1 and stored 30.54 x 104 - 54.07 x 104 MJ ha- 1 of energy. Rhizophora apiculata (47.37 +/- 5.68 kg CO2) had the most carbon sequestration, while Bruguiera gymnorhiza (645.22 +/- 21.65 MJ) had the highest energy storage. Reforestation-induced mangrove ecosystems have biodiversity, carbon storage, and energy stock features.

TI  - Recovery quality index as a tool for monitoring the mined land reclamation
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Many ecosystems are being severely degraded, leading the United Nations to deem 2021-2030 as the Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. To be successful, this effort requires robust monitoring tools to assess land reclamation practices. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of recovery efforts in mined areas by developing a Recovery Quality Index (RQI) based on soil and vegetation indicators. Using the heavily mined Iron Quadrangle region of Brazil as an example, four undisturbed reference areas were selected: Atlantic Forest; ferruginous rupestrian grassland with dense vegetation; ferruginous rupestrian grassland with sparse vegetation; and quartzite rupestrian grassland. Four areas directly or indirectly affected by mining were selected, including an environmental compensation area set aside 5 years prior to the study, two sterile piles that had undergone recovery for 15 and 20 years, and a cave area with 15 years of recovery. Two vegetation parameters and 34 soil attributes were used in a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to select indicators and scores. Vegetative parameters had the lowest RQI weights. Soil physical indicators tended to be the most important. RQI values were lowest when Atlantic Forest was used as the reference, showing that the forest was a unique ecosystem, and the cave site had lower RQI scores than the other restored sites, indicating the high degree of disturbance that occurred in that low-lying area. The oldest sterile pile tended to have higher RQI values than the newest and similar values to the less disturbed compensation areas. The recovery quality index values were similar in all areas, with 5 to 20 years in the recovery process, showing that the rehabilitation process is slow in this environment.

TI  - Edible and medicinal native plants: non-timber forest products and sustainable exploitation potential
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
AB  - The objective of this work was to identify native species that produce non-timber forest resources, aiming at their management and exploration in different productive systems, possibly contributing to income generation for small landowners as well as the maintenance of forest areas. The research was developed in the Environmental Protection Area -APA Tejupa, Corumbatai and Botucatu (SP, Brazil), where Mata Atlantica and Cerrado biomes occur. Based on the list of native species in the APA management plan, we identified those cited in the literature for their use as medicinal and food. To evaluate these species, those of interest for the public policies of the Brazilian government were selected, since they have already commercial potential. Finally, these species of interest were evaluated based on the parameters of sustainable use, to evaluate if their sustainable management is possible. Of the total of 735 species identified, 329 are edible plant and have medicinal uses. 219 of them are medicinal and 110 can be used as food. In addition, 68% of these species are trees, demonstrating the high diversity of species that could be used in forest restoration projects and agroforestry systems. However, of the total number of plant species detected, only 22 are included in public policies, and only 6 species have sufficient studies for sustainable exploitation in the studied region. Research and Public policies aimed at the management and use of native species should be reinforced, aiming to increase the set of species that can be used and provide benefits to the owners, in addition to ecological sustainability.

TI  - Soil properties under different supplementary organic fertilizers in a restoration site after kaolin mining in the Eastern Amazon
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Mining is one of the economic activities that most degrade ecosystems, and the rehabilitation of such environments in the Brazilian Amazon is still a challenge. The first step is to recover the soil quality for plant reestablishment. In this study was evaluated the effect of different organic fertilizers, supplementary to chemical fertilizers, on the physical and chemical attributes of a minesoil after kaolin mining in the Eastern Amazon, Brazil. Nine trenches measuring 1 m x 40 m and 1 m in depth were opened in a reconstructed area after kaolin mining. They were 6 m apart from each other and filled with topsoil from areas destined for new mine pits. Then 40 cm x 40 cm x 40 cm pits were opened along the trenches. They were 1.5 m apart from each other within each trench, and 400 g pit-1 of simple superphosphate, 130 g pit-1 of urea and 130 g pit-1 of potassium chloride were applied in five treatments: three treatments along the trenches, in the planting rows with; i) addition of topsoil; ii) sawdust; iii) cattle manure, and two treatments between the planting rows; iv) sawdust; and v) without sawdust. Two hundred and fifty seedlings of six heliophilous tree species were planted, being randomly distributed. One hundred and forty-four disturbed (original structure altered) and 144 undisturbed (structure equal to the original soil) samples were collected for evaluation of the physical and chemical attributes of minesoil. Besides soil, other variables were assessed: plants abundance, height, diameter at breast height as well as litter stock. The treatments did not differ significantly in relation to the effects on abundance, height, diameter and litter stock, either in the planting rows or between them. The organic matter was higher in the Manure treatment at depths of 0.0-0.1 and 0.2-0.4 m. The sawdust coverage between trenches increased Ca and base saturation, but decreased N due to the high Carbon/Nitrogen ratio. Planting using trenches, topsoil, chemical and organic fertilization and sawdust coverage resulted in good physical and chemical properties of the soil and enabled greater efficiency in restoring the area mined for kaolin in the Amazon.

TI  - Restoration Ecology of Lowland Tropical Peatlands in Southeast Asia: Current Knowledge and Future Research Directions
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Studies of restoration ecology are well established for northern peatlands, but at an early stage for tropical peatlands. Extensive peatland areas in Southeast Asia have been degraded through deforestation, drainage and fire, leading to on- and off-site environmental and socio-economic impacts of local to global significance. To address these problems, landscape-scale restoration measures are urgently required. This paper reviews and illustrates, using information from on- going trials in Kalimantan, Indonesia, the current state of knowledge pertaining to (i) land-cover dynamics of degraded peatlands, (ii) vegetation rehabilitation, (iii) restoration of hydrology, (iv) rehabilitation of carbon sequestration and storage, and (v) promotion of sustainable livelihoods for local communities. For a 4500 km(2) study site in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, we show a 78% reduction in forest cover between 1973 and 2003 and demonstrate that fire, exacerbated by drainage, is the principal driver of land-use change. Progressive vegetation succession follows infrequent, low-intensity fires, but repeated and high-intensity fires result in retrogressive succession towards non-forest communities. Re-wetting the peat is an important key to vegetation restoration and protection of remaining peat carbon stocks. The effectiveness of hydrological restoration is discussed and likely impacts on greenhouse gas emissions evaluated. Initial results indicate that raised water levels have limited short-term impact on reducing CO2 emissions, but could be critical in reducing fire risk. We conclude that successful restoration of degraded peatlands must be grounded in scientific knowledge, relevant to socio-economic circumstances, and should not proceed without the consent and co-operation of local communities.

TI  - Beyond Climatic Variation: Human Disturbances Alter the Effectiveness of a Protected Area to Reduce Fires in a Tropical Peatland
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Fire is considered a major threat to biodiversity in many habitats and the occurrence of fire has frequently been used to investigate the effectiveness of protected areas. Yet, despite the known importance of tropical peatlands for biodiversity conservation and serious threat that anthropogenically induced fires pose to this ecosystem, the influence of protected area designation on fire occurrence in tropical peatland has been poorly assessed thus far. Our study addresses this knowledge gap through providing a novel assessment of fire patterns from a tropical peatland protected area and surrounding landscape. We investigated the importance of both climatic factors (top-down mechanism) and human interventions (bottom-up mechanism) on fire occurrence through analyzing 20-years (2001-2020) of LANDSAT and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) images of the Padang Sugihan Wildlife Reserve and a 10-km buffer area surrounding this in Sumatra, Indonesia. Fire density was assessed in relation to road and canal construction. Monthly and annual precipitation was compared between wet and dry years. The reserve was effective in limiting fire compared to surrounding landscapes only in wet years. We revealed that peat fire occurrence in the protected area and buffer zone was not due to climatic factors alone, with distance from canals and roads also contributing toward fire occurrence. Our results suggest that it is essential to address tropical peatland fire processes at a landscape level, particularly at the surroundings of protected areas, in order to increase the effectiveness of fire protection, improve fire risk classification maps, and conserve threatened tropical peatland wildlife such as the Sumatran elephant.

TI  - Influence of environmental factors on the tropical peatlands diazotrophic communities from the Southern Brazilian Atlantic Rain Forest
T2  - LETTERS IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - The tropical peatlands of southern Brazil are essential for the maintenance of the Atlantic Rain Forest, one of the 25 hotspots of biodiversity in the world. Although diazotrophic micro-organisms are essential for the maintenance of this nitrogen limited ecosystem, so far studies have focused only on micro-organisms involved in the carbon cycle. In this work, peat samples were collected from three tropical peatland regions during dry and rainy seasons and their chemical and microbial characteristics were evaluated. Our results showed that the structure of the diazotrophic communities in the Brazilian tropical peatlands differs in the evaluated seasons. The abundance of the genus Bradyrhizobium showed to be affected by rainfall and peat pH. Despite the shifts of the nitrogen-fixing population in the tropical peatland caused by seasonality it showed to be constantly dominated by alpha-Proteobacteria followed by Cyanobacteria. In addition, more than 50% of nifH gene sequences have not been classified, indicating the necessity for more studies in tropical peatland, since the reduction of N supply in the peatlands stimulates the recalcitrant organic matter decomposition performed by peatland micro-organisms, influencing the C stock.

TI  - Smoke radiocarbon measurements from Indonesian fires provide evidence for burning of millennia-aged peat
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - In response to a strong El Nino, fires in Indonesia during September and October 2015 released a large amount of carbon dioxide and created a massive regional smoke cloud that severely degraded air quality in many urban centers across Southeast Asia. Although several lines of evidence indicate that peat burning was a dominant contributor to emissions in the region, El Nino-induced drought is also known to increase deforestation fires and agricultural waste burning in plantations. As a result, uncertainties remain with respect to partitioning emissions among different ecosystem and fire types. Here we measured the radiocarbon content (C-14) of carbonaceous aerosol samples collected in Singapore from September 2014 through October 2015, with the aim of identifying the age and origin of fire-emitted fine particulate matter (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 mu m). The Delta C-14 of fire-emitted aerosol was -76 +/- 51 parts per thousand, corresponding to a carbon pool of combusted organic matter with a mean turnover time of 800 +/- 420 y. Our observations indicated that smoke plumes reaching Singapore originated primarily from peat burning (similar to 85%), and not from deforestation fires or waste burning. Atmospheric transport modeling confirmed that fires in Sumatra and Borneo were dominant contributors to elevated PM2.5 in Singapore during the fire season. The mean age of the carbonaceous aerosol, which predates the Industrial Revolution, highlights the importance of improving peatland fire management during future El Nino events for meeting climate mitigation and air quality commitments.

TI  - The AFOLU sector's role in national decarbonization: a comparative analysis of low-GHG development pathways in Brazil, India and Indonesia
T2  - CLIMATE POLICY
AB  - This paper analyses the role that AFOLU (agriculture, forest and other land use) plays in national deep decarbonization scenarios in Brazil, India and Indonesia between 2020 and 2050. It finds that the LULUCF (land use, land use change and forestry) subsector is important for medium-term mitigation (2020-2030) while continuing to contribute to mitigation over the long-term (2030-2050) in the three countries. Mitigation actions in LULUCF include drastically reducing deforestation (Brazil, Indonesia) and peat degradation (Indonesia), re-/afforestation (all), increased sequestration in standing forests (Brazil, Indonesia) and increasing soil carbon in agricultural lands (India). AFOLU further contributes to mitigation in Brazil and Indonesia by producing biomass feedstock for bioenergy. No country significantly reduces N2O and CH4 emissions from either agriculture or via demand-side actions on diets, due to trade-offs with food security, rural livelihoods and economic growth (although all countries reduce the GHG intensity of agricultural products). Furthermore, the paper analyses national policies to manoeuvre co-benefits and trade-offs between mitigation and other sustainable development goals (SDGs), including no poverty (1); zero hunger (2); decent work and economic growth (8); climate action, including both adaptation and mitigation (13); and life on land (15). Common policy areas were identified, including incentives to land managers for conservation or more environmental agricultural practices; changing regulations of land use to protect ecosystems and/or encourage shifts in agricultural practices; and strengthening enforcement capacity of land protection.

TI  - Modelling Deforestation and Land Cover Transitions of Tropical Peatlands in Sumatra, Indonesia Using Remote Sensed Land Cover Data Sets
T2  - LAND
AB  - In Southeast Asia land use change associated with forest loss and degradation is a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This is of particular concern where deforestation occurs on peat soils. A business-as-usual (BAU) land change model was developed using Dinamica EGO (c) for a REDD+ Demonstration Activity area in south-east Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia containing Berbak National Park (NP). The model output will be used as baseline land change predictions for comparison with alternative land cover management scenarios as part of a REDD+ feasibility study. The study area is approximately 376,000 ha with approximately 50% on peat soils. The model uses published 2000 and 2010 land cover maps as input and projects land cover change for thirty years until 2040. The model predicted that under a BAU scenario the forest area, 185,000 ha in 2010, will decline by 37% by 2040. In protected forest areas, approximately 50% of the study area, forest cover will reduce by 25%. Peat swamp forest will reduce by almost 37%. The greatest land cover category increases are plantation/regrowth areas (which includes oil palm) and open areas which each increase by 30,000 ha. These results indicate that the site has great potential as an Indonesian REDD+ Demonstration Activity.

TI  - Sustainable development of carbon sinks? Lessons from three types of peatland partnerships in Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Peatland conversion for agriculture is the leading cause of Indonesia's terrestrial carbon emissions that contribute substantially to global warming. Indonesia's peatlands contain 55-57 billion tonnes of carbon, the equivalent of almost 2 years of global carbon emissions at existing rates. This paper examines initiatives to retain soil-based carbon in Indonesia's province of Riau, where over half the surface area is composed of agriculturally productive peatlands. We qualitatively evaluate three types of partnership programmes (bilateral, co-governed and internationally funded local initiatives) in Riau aimed at the sustainable development of peatlands. The article finds that carbon loss is likely to persist in all case studies. Public, private and civil society actors in each partnership have exploited funding and political opportunities to advance agendas not directly related to the environment. The administrative category of the peatland hydrological unit as an ecologically meaningful scale of peatland governance is also under-utilised by the partnerships studied.

TI  - Evaluating the Impact of REDD+ Interventions on Household Forest Revenue in Peru
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - REDD+ was conceived as a system of incentives for reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation. While this could include many different types of interventions to reduce deforestation and degradation, a consensus has emerged that they should safeguard and "do no harm" to the forest-based livelihoods of local people. Many REDD+ projects have been designed to incentivize forest conservation and support local livelihoods by promoting sustainable use of the forest, hence increasing the revenues earned by local households from forest products. We examine two such projects in the Peruvian Amazon, using panel survey data from over 400 households gathered in 2011 and 2014. In the 3 years between surveys, we observed a severe decline in forest revenue. However, by using a BACI study design and matching, we show that this decrease was not caused by the REDD+ interventions. Thus, REDD+ "did no harm" to local people, at least in terms of forest revenues in the early phases of these two projects in the Peruvian Amazon.

TI  - Who should be governed to reduce deforestation and how? Multiple governmentalities at the REDD plus negotiations
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-POLITICS AND SPACE
AB  - Drawing on recent multiple governmentality literature, this article analyses the REDD+ negotiations to interrogate who the scheme is likely to govern and how. Two arguments are advanced. First, REDD+ is likely to target local forest users at the expense of both corporate and international drivers of deforestation. This will reduce the effectiveness of the scheme and invite leakage issues. In elucidating the ultimately rejected strategies for addressing international drivers now hidden in neat negotiation outcomes, this article opens a space for considering how the scheme could move beyond a predominant focus on local forest users. Second, targeted forest users are likely to be governed by a combination of neoliberal and disciplinary technologies. REDD+ will seek to 'improve' their conduct through a three-staged process involving education, self-reflection and rewards for carbon sequestration. An alternative governmentality associated with local forest users' claims to decide on REDD+ implementation and governance, on the other hand, met with resistance and ultimately received no protection in the adopted REDD+ safeguards. Moreover, the formulation of the safeguards could undermine legitimacy and forest stewardship in REDD+ projects. By linking the possibility of such issues to the negotiation outcomes, this article demonstrates necessary changes to the scheme.

TI  - Refining greenhouse gas emission factors for Indonesian peatlands and mangroves to meet ambitious climate targets
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - For countries' emission - reduction efforts under the Paris Agreement to be effective, baseline emission/removals levels and reporting must be as transparent and accurate as possible. For Indonesia, which holds among the largest area of tropical peatlands and mangrove forest in the world, it is particularly important for these high - carbon ecosystems to produce high - accuracy greenhouse gas inventory and to improve national forest reference emissions level/forest reference level. Here, we highlight the opportunity for refining greenhouse gas emission factors (EF) of peatlands and mangroves and describe scientific challenges to support climate policy processes in Indonesia, where 55 to 59% of national emission reduction targets by 2030 depend on mitigation in Forestry and Other Land Use. Based on the stock - difference and flux change approaches, we examine higher - tier EF for drained and rewetted peatland, peatland fires, mangrove conversions, and mangrove on peatland to improve future greenhouse gas flux reporting in Indonesia. We suggest that these refinements will be essential to support Indonesia in achieving Forest and Other Land Use net sink by 2030 and net zero emissions targets by 2060 or earlier.

TI  - Monitoring deforestation in Malaysia between 1985 and 2013: Insight from South-Western Sabah and its protected peat swamp area
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Monitoring land cover changes provides an effective and accurate evaluation of deforestation rates that shed light on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) implementation. Located in Klias Peninsula, southwestern Sabah, Malaysia there lies a pristine peat swamp forest area. This type of ecosystem plays a significant role in global climate regulation. Despite its importance, the peat swamp forest is threatened and highly degraded, due to the increasing demand for agricultural expansion. This is where we monitored deforestation and land cover change between 1985 and 2013. Temporal changes were determined by means of supervised classification, using the maximum likelihood classification rule to observe changes in the area. Post-classification change detection techniques were applied in order to understand the change in forest coverage in the Klias Peninsula and inside the protected area boundaries. The overall accuracy for the Klias Peninsula and the protected area were more than 88% (+/- 4% margin of error) and 95% (+/- 2% margin of error), respectively. Based on these findings, it appears that more than half of the forest area in Klias Peninsula disappeared from 142,713 ha (+/- 6818 margin of error) to 73,403 ha (+/- 6796 margin of error) between 1985 and 2013. The annual rate of change in the protected area was 10.94% (+/- 0.85% margin of error) per year for deforestation and 0.86% (+/- 5.19% margin of error) per year for forest area. The result revealed that most of the peat swamp forest was converted to other stable non-forest areas, including agriculture which can be a threat to the already disturbed protected area. Therefore, we also conducted an accurate monitoring of the forest cover change and deforestation data in the protected area and its surrounding environs in order to promote sound political decision-making regarding the future protection and sustainability of the remaining peat swamp area.

TI  - Carbon emissions from oil palm development on deep peat soil in Central Kalimantan Indonesia
T2  - ANTHROPOCENE
AB  - Of the 44 million hectares of peatland in the tropics, Indonesia has proportionately the largest area (45%) and carbon content (64%). These carbon-rich peat ecosystems play an important role in regional climate stabilization and biodiversity conservation. The Indonesian Government has enacted numerous regulatory measures since the 1990s aimed at boosting protection of the remaining intact peatland, with a threshold that peat deeper than 3 m must be conserved and cannot be cultivated. Despite these regulatory measures, extensive conversion of peatland to other land uses has occurred, especially largescale palm oil plantation. This study shows that over 40% of palm oil plantations located in the former ExMega Rice Project area (of some 1.04 million hectares) in Central Kalimantan in Indonesia are situated in deep peat areas. We estimate that continuing the present palm oil development practices on deep peat in the Ex-Mega Rice Project area will result in the release of between 93 and 217 megaton carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) over the next 25 years.

TI  - What is the Long-Term Effect of Bamboo Dominance on Adult Trees in the Araucaria Forest? A Comparative Analysis between Two Successional Stages in Southern Brazil
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
AB  - Bamboos are opportunistic species that rapidly colonize open areas following forest disturbance, forming dense clusters that alter the regenerative processes and maintain lower levels of tree diversity. Widespread forest degradation, especially in Latin America and Asia, and human-induced introduction have allowed native and non-native bamboo species to thrive, hindering successional pathways that would otherwise lead to more diverse forests; such a large-scale phenomenon is a key concern in the conservation of forest resources around the globe. Despite previous research on this phenomenon, little is known about the long-term effects of bamboo dominance on forest structure and composition and the corresponding interaction with natural regeneration. As such, we sought to evaluate the long-term effects of bamboo dominance on the dynamics of adult forest populations considering two forest types (Bamboo Forest-BF and Araucaria Forest-AF) over an 11-year period in the Embrapa Research Station in Cacador, Brazil. We monitored 20 plots (15 x 15 m) in each forest type where we tagged, identified, and measured the height and diameter of all the trees taller than 1.5 m (H) and diameter at breast height (DBH) greater than 3.18 cm. Comparisons were based on forest species diversity and structure parameters. In BF, diversity of species increased after the bamboo die-off that occurred in 2006 with a subsequent reduction in the number of pioneer species overtime. However, secondary species remained stagnant demonstrating that recruitment and transition into higher size classes is restricted to the immediate die-off aftermath. On the other hand, plant diversity and structure in the relatively bamboo-free AF were stable with secondary species accounting for the most richness. Our results confirm that BF maintains significantly lower levels of diversity that are restricted to pioneer species; AF structure and diversity are not significantly affected by bamboo die-off and recolonization; and BF tree species are caught in a closed cycle of arrested successional development. The widespread presence of bamboos as dominant species in the region should become a part of the conversation pertaining to forest management and conservation in Brazil and other countries in south America and Asia.

TI  - Contrasting communications of sustainability science in the media coverage of palm oil agriculture on tropical peatlands in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB  - This article analyses the denialist narratives of the negative environmental impact of oil palm plantations on tropical peat by the media of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Specifically, we focus on media coverage of the 2016 International Peat Congress, where scientifically misleading claims that it is sustainable to develop oil palm plantations on tropical peatlands were made. We found that media reporting of the denialist narrative is more prevalent than that of the peer-reviewed science consensus-view that plantations on tropical peat could cause excessive greenhouse gas emissions and enhance the risk of fires. Four mutually complementary narratives were used by Indonesian and Malaysian media to construe denialism, which closely resemble the four climate denialist narratives identified by Elsasser And Dunlap (2!)13). These denialist narratives draw heavily upon information advocated by divergent knowledge communities (Gokkiein 2(16) and appeal to a nationalist sentiment of 'us' - palm oil-producing developing countries - and 'them' - western developed countries producing research critical of the industry. The Malaysian press has most extensively deployed this nationalistic sentiment, whereas the Singaporean media has not actively endorsed or rejected any of the denialist narratives. Our findings suggests that media representation of the issue is a reflection of an amalgamation of economic, diplomatic and nationalistic concerns, determined by political, socio-cultural nuances specific to each country. Importantly, our article alerts to the continuation of unsustainable practices as justified by the media to the public, and that the prevalence of these denialist narratives constitute a significant obstacle in resolving pressing issues such as transboundary haze, biodiversity loss, and land-use change related greenhouse gas emissions in Southeast Asia.

TI  - Investigating biodiversity trends in different mitigation scenarios with a national integrated assessment model
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB  - The inclusion of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in climate mitigation pathways is critical and can be reached by assessing their consequences through the deployment of appropriate indicators to that end. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are important tools for understanding possible impacts caused by adopting new policies. We investigate terrestrial biodiversity trends (life on land: SDG 15) for three different climate mitigation scenarios for Brazil: (1) A scenario compatible with a world that maintains its current policies with current deforestation rates in the Amazon and the Cerrado biomes; (2) A scenario in which Brazil fulfils its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC); and (3) A scenario compatible with a world that limits warming to 1.5 & DEG;C. We use the Brazilian Land-Use and Energy System model (BLUES), a national IAM, to show the implications of the transitions involved in the above-mentioned scenarios for the country up to 2050. We conduct a post-processing analysis using consolidated biodiversity indicators to emphasize how different IAM greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mitigation solutions present distinct positive and negative potential impacts on biodiversity in Brazil. However, our analysis does not consider the impacts associated with climate change, but only the risks imposed by mitigation policies. Our results indicate that biodiversity loss decreases in the scenarios from (1) to (3), implying that stronger climate change mitigation actions could result in smaller biodiversity losses. We conclude that Brazil has the opportunity to align its biodiversity and climate goals through nature-based solutions (NBS), such as forest conservation, restoration, pasture recovery, and the use of crop-pasture and agroforestry systems.

TI  - Bayesian state-space synthetic control method for deforestation baseline estimation for forest carbon credits
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL DATA SCIENCE
AB  - Carbon credits from the reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD+) projects have been criticized for issuing junk carbon credits due to invalid ex-ante baselines. Recently, the concept of ex-post baseline has been discussed to overcome the criticism, while ex-ante baseline is still necessary for project financing and risk assessment. To address this issue, we propose a Bayesian state-space model that integrates ex-ante baseline projection and ex-post dynamic baseline updating in a unified manner. Our approach provides a tool for appropriate risk assessment and performance evaluation of REDD+ projects. We apply the proposed model to a REDD+ project in Brazil and show that it may have had a small, positive effect but has been overcredited. We also demonstrate that the 90% predictive interval of the ex-ante baseline includes the ex-post baseline, implying that our ex-ante estimation can work effectively.
   Impact Statement
   Our novel approach estimates deforestation baselines for forest carbon credits, addressing criticisms of junk carbon credit issued from REDD+ projects and problems of early financing simultaneously. By integrating ex-ante baseline projection and ex-post dynamic updating, we evaluate ex-ante risks and ex-post project performance in a unified manner. Our approach can contribute to sound allocation of funds for forest conservation projects with significant positive impacts on climate change action.

TI  - Environmental and Socioeconomic Impacts of Utilizing Waste for Biochar in Rural Areas in Indonesia-A Systems Perspective
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Biochar is the product of incomplete combustion (pyrolysis) of organic material. In rural areas, it can be used as a soil amendment to increase soil fertility. Fuel-constrained villagers may however prefer to use biochar briquettes as a higher-value fuel for cooking over applying it to soils. A systems-oriented analysis using life cycle assessment (LCA) and cost benefit analysis (CBA) was conducted to analyze these two alternative uses of biochar, applying the study to a rural village system in Indonesia. The results showed soil amendment for enhanced agricultural production to be the preferential choice with a positive benefit to the baseline scenario of -26 ecopoints (LCA) and -173 USD (CBA) annually pr. household. In this case, the positive effects of carbon sequestration to the soil and the economic value of the increased agricultural production outweighed the negative environmental impacts from biochar production and the related production costs. Use of biochar in briquettes for cooking fuel yielded negative net effects in both the LCA and CBA (85 ecopoints and 176 USD), even when positive health effects from reduced indoor air pollution were included. The main reasons for this are that emissions during biochar production are not compensated by carbon sequestration and that briquette making is labor-intensive. The results emphasize the importance of investigating and documenting the carbon storage effect and the agricultural benefit in biochar production-utilization systems for a sustainable use. Further research focus on efficient production is necessary due to the large environmental impact of biochar production. In addition, biochar should continue to be used in those soils where the agricultural effect is most beneficial.

TI  - Promising native tree species for reforestation of degraded tropical peatlands
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Tropical peat swamp forests (PSF) of South East Asia are biodiversity hotspots and carbon-rich ecosystems under severe degradation and threat of extinction. Almost yearly recurring fires progressively devastate clear-cut PSFs. The need for both conservation and active restoration together with the appropriate information on the techniques and species is urgent. The aim of this study was to find native PSF species that are suitable for reforestation in the open degraded peatlands. We established two planting experiments in degraded peat areas with 21 tree species to study the survival and growth in relation to environmental factors for 2 years. The study sites were located in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia in the degraded peatland of the Ex-Mega Rice area and along the degraded margins of the river Sabangau. Seed material collected from local forests was grown in a field nursery and planted 6-11 months later in the field. Growth and mortality of the seedlings and environmental variables (water table, temperature) were monitored frequently for two years. The effects of the environmental variables on growth were tested with mixed-effects models and on mortality with Cox regression. As a result, we could derive species-specific information of the seedlings' early stage ecology and suitability for restoration. The most promising species based on the analysis were Shorea balangeran, Adenanthera pavonina, Dacryodes rostrata and Lithocarpus dasystachys. The comparison of the two differing areas revealed contrasting challenges: the main obstacle for reforestation in the Ex-Mega Rice area was fire, whereas in the river margin extreme water table fluctuation limited the success of the seedlings.

TI  - REDD plus in Indonesia: An assessment of the international environmental program
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This paper provides a comprehensive review of the literature and assesses the progress on the effects of Indonesia's REDD+ program. Due to the significance of Indonesia in terms of global rainforests and the comprehensive implementation practice of REDD+ programs since 2009, focusing on the case study of Indonesia enables interesting insights regarding the challenges and opportunities of REDD+. Indonesia faced challenges during the project's implementation, but there were also reductions. This success is attributed to the set program design of REDD+. In this paper, we show that without international development cooperation in the field of climate change mitigation, the countries in the Global South lack locally driven forest conservation or restoration incentives. These incentives emanate exogenously from international development cooperation programs in the field of climate change mitigation. The review of the program also shows that despite the rigorous institutional design of REDD+ in Indonesia, not all the stakeholders could benefit from the program appropriately. Because of the de facto weakness of the smallholder farmers, indigenous population groups, and other vulnerable categories in the political process of Indonesia, these groups' interests have not come fully to their own in Indonesia. Hence, we conclude that international programs that target environmental protection, while addressing inferior institutional quality, bad governance and operate through more accountable NGOs than government agencies would perform better in terms of global environmental targets and the sustainability of local livelihoods.

TI  - Benefits of tropical peatland rewetting for subsidence reduction and forest regrowth: results from a large-scale restoration trial
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Drainage and deforestation of tropical peat swamp forests (PSF) in Southeast Asia cause carbon emissions and biodiversity loss of global concern. Restoration efforts to mitigate these impacts usually involve peatland rewetting by blocking canals. However, there have been no studies to date of the optimal rewetting approach that will reduce carbon emission whilst also promoting PSF regeneration. Here we present results of a large-scale restoration trial in Sumatra (Indonesia), monitored for 7.5 years. Water levels in a former plantation were raised over an area of 4800 ha by constructing 257 compacted peat dams in canals. We find peat surface subsidence rates in the rewetted restoration area and adjoining PSF to be halved where water tables were raised from similar to - 0.6 m to similar to - 0.3 m, demonstrating the success of rewetting in reducing carbon emission. A total of 57 native PSF tree species were found to spontaneously grow in the most rewetted conditions and in high densities, indicating that forest regrowth is underway. Based on our findings we propose that an effective PSF restoration strategy should follow stepwise rewetting to achieve substantial carbon emission reduction alongside unassisted regrowth of PSF, thereby enabling the peat, forest and canal vegetation to establish a new nature-based ecosystem balance.

TI  - A reality check on the landscape approach to REDD plus : Lessons from Latin America
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Developing and institutionalizing cross-sectoral approaches to sustainable land use remains a crucial, yet politically contested, objective in global sustainability governance. There is a widely acknowledged need for more integrated approaches to sustainable land use that reconcile multiple landscape functions, sectors and stakeholders. However, this faces a number of challenges in practice, including the lack of policy coherence and institutional conflicts across agricultural and forest sectors. In this context, the global climate change mitigation mechanism of "reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation" (REDD+) has been flagged as a unique opportunity to stimulate the development and institutionalization of more integrated, "landscape" approaches to sustainable land use. In this article, we provide a reality check for the prospects of REDD+ to deliver on this promise, through analyzing three pioneer cases of REDD+ development and implementation in Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico. We analyze how REDD+ has operated in each of these three contexts, based on field work, key-informant interviews, and analysis of primary and secondary documents. Our findings suggest that REDD+ has stimulated development of "niche" sustainable land-use investments in each case, which aim to integrate forest conservation and agricultural development goals, but has done so while competing with business as-usual incentives. We conclude that national and international political commitment to more integrated and sustainable land-use approaches is a precondition for, rather than a result of, transformative REDD+ interventions.

TI  - Global reforestation and biodiversity conservation
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - The loss of forest is a leading cause of species extinction, and reforestation is 1 of 2 established interventions for reversing this loss. However, the role of reforestation for biodiversity conservation remains debated, and lacking is an assessment of the potential contribution that reforestation could make to biodiversity conservation globally. We conducted a spatial analysis of overlap between 1,550 forest-obligate threatened species' ranges and land that could be reforested after accounting for socioeconomic and ecological constraints. Reforestation on at least 43% (similar to 369 million ha) of reforestable area was predicted to potentially benefit threatened vertebrates. This is approximately 15% of the total area where threatened vertebrates occur. The greatest opportunities for conserving threatened vertebrate species are in the tropics, particularly Brazil and Indonesia. Although reforestation is not a substitute for forest conservation, and most of the area containing threatened vertebrates remains forested, our results highlight the need for global conservation strategies to recognize the potentially significant contribution that reforestation could make to biodiversity conservation. If implemented, reforestation of similar to 369 million ha would also contribute substantially to climate-change mitigation, offering a way to achieve multiple sustainability commitments at once. Countries must now work to overcome key barriers (e.g., unclear revenue streams, high transaction costs) to investment in reforestation.

TI  - Sustainable intensification of livestock as a means to achieve forest conservation and food production in the Brazilian Southern Atlantic forest
T2  - AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Brazil's Atlantic Forest is a biodiversity hotspot. Efforts to restore the forest must address the tradeoffs facing family farmers. In this paper, we combine literature review and empirical analysis to evaluate the ways in which an agroecological practice - Management Intensive Grazing (MIG) - can contribute to sustainable intensification in southern Brazil. Our results show that farmers adopting MIG obtained, in general, better economic and environmental performance, but did not completely renounce the use of external inputs. Forest cover appears to have increased since the promotion of MIG and agroecology in the region and pasture area decreased, therefore, benefiting forest conservation.

TI  - Mapping peat thickness and carbon stock of a degraded peatland in West Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Tropical peatlands store a large amount of carbon and act as carbon sinks, thus have crucial roles in regulating climate by preventing CO2 emission and enhancing carbon sequestration. However, the conversion of these peatlands for agricultural purposes, such as oil palm plantations, leads to carbon loss and increased CO2 emissions. To effectively protect and manage vulnerable areas, accurate mapping of peatland thickness and carbon stocks is essential, aligning with Indonesia's National Determined Contribution to climate action. This research article aims to assess the status of peatland in Agam-West Pasaman, Western Sumatra, which was cleared between 1990 and 2000 for oil palm cultivation. Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) approaches were employed to map peat thickness, carbon stock and estimate carbon loss resulting from land use change. The study area, spanning 54,000 hectares, was covered by peat-swamp forest in 1989. A grid of 2 km was used for a soil survey, resulting in 134 observation points of peat thickness, water level and subsidence. Various spatial prediction methods, including geostatistics, machine learning (ML) and their combination, were tested to map peat thickness, carbon stocks, subsidence rate and carbon loss. The covariates considered in the analysis were elevation, nearest distance from rivers and Sentinel 1a radar images. The results obtained through 10-fold cross-validations revealed that ordinary kriging exhibited the best performance, with an R-2 of 0.44 for peat thickness and 0.39 for carbon stocks. The superior performance of ordinary kriging can be attributed to the severe impact of human activities in the area, which disrupted the clear relationship between peat parameters and environmental covariates. The estimated carbon stock of the area was 107 Mt C (std. dev. 0.143 Mt), while the carbon loss since the establishment of oil palm plantations was estimated to be 19.50 Mt C (std. dev. 0.017 Mt C) based on subsidence data. These findings provide insights into the degradation of the peatland and the magnitude of carbon loss over the past three decades. This information supports informed decision-making and contributes to efforts aimed at preserving and restoring peatlands.

TI  - Mapping deep peat carbon stock from a LiDAR based DTM and field measurements, with application to eastern Sumatra
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Background Reduction of carbon emissions from peatlands is recognized as an important factor in global climate change mitigation. Within the SE Asia region, areas of deeper peat present the greatest carbon stocks, and therefore the greatest potential for future carbon emissions from degradation and fire. They also support most of the remaining lowland swamp forest and its associated biodiversity. Accurate maps of deep peat are central to providing correct estimates of peat carbon stocks and to facilitating appropriate management interventions. We present a rapid and cost-effective approach to peat thickness mapping in raised peat bogs that applies a model of peat bottom elevation based on field measurements subtracted from a surface elevation model created from airborne LiDAR data. Results In two raised peat bog test areas in Indonesia, we find that field peat thickness measurements correlate well with surface elevation derived from airborne LiDAR based DTMs (R-2 0.83-0.88), confirming that the peat bottom is often relatively flat. On this basis, we created a map of extent and depth of deep peat (> 3 m) from a new DTM that covers two-thirds of Sumatran peatlands, applying a flat peat bottom of 0.61 m +MSL determined from the average of 2446 field measurements. A deep peat area coverage of 2.6 Mha or 60.1% of the total peat area in eastern Sumatra is mapped, suggesting that deep peat in this region is more common than shallow peat and its extent was underestimated in earlier maps. The associated deep peat carbon stock range is 9.0-11.5 Pg C in eastern Sumatra alone. Conclusion We discuss how the deep peat map may be used to identify priority areas for peat and forest conservation and thereby help prevent major potential future carbon emissions and support the safeguarding of the remaining forest and biodiversity. We propose rapid application of this method to other coastal raised bog peatland areas in SE Asia in support of improved peatland zoning and management. We demonstrate that the upcoming global ICESat-2 and GEDI satellite LiDAR coverage will likely result in a global DTM that, within a few years, will be sufficiently accurate for this application.

TI  - Geographic Setting and Groundwater Table Control Carbon Emission from Indonesian Peatland: A Meta-Analysis
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Peat restoration is a key climate mitigation action for achieving Indonesia's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) emission reduction target. The level of carbon reduction resulting from peat restoration is uncertain, owing in part to diverse methodologies and land covers. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted to assess the impact of rewetting on reduction of total CO2 in soil and heterotrophic emissions at the country level. The tier 2 emission factor associated with the land cover category in Indonesia was also calculated. The analysis included a total of 32 studies with 112 observations (data points) for total CO2 emissions and 31 observations for heterotrophic emissions in Indonesia. The results show that the land cover category is not a significant predictor of heterotrophic and total soil emissions, but the highest observed soil emissions were found in the plantation forest. Using the random-effects model, our results suggest that an increase in the water table depth of 10 cm would result in an increase in total CO2 emissions of 2.7 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) and an increase in heterotrophic emissions of 2.3 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1). Our findings show that managing water table depth in degraded peatlands in various land cover types is important to achieve Indonesia's emission reduction target by 2030.

TI  - Synergy potential between climate change mitigation and forest conservation policies in the Indonesian forest sector: implications for achieving multiple sustainable development objectives
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
AB  - There has been growing interest in achieving multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by identifying effective interactions or synergy potential among measures/policies on sustainable development. The simultaneous implementation of climate change mitigation (SDG 13) and forest protection (SDG 15) is an example of an interaction where the measures/policies that contribute to both goals can be identified and the overlaps eliminated. However, there are limited studies that quantitatively evaluate the synergy potential in the forest sector. This study is the first attempt to examine the synergy potential in the forest sector in Indonesia focusing on climate change mitigation and forest protection. We evaluated four scenarios that differentiated climate and forest policy options and assessed the effectiveness of implementing these two policies simultaneously by 2030, using a computable general equilibrium model and a land-use model. We found that the additional efforts needed for emission reduction were larger for the scenario not considering forest protection than for that considering forest protection. This caused differences in the mitigation measures introduced and the resulting land use that depended on the scenario. Consequently, mitigation costs would be reduced by implementing mitigation and forest protection policies simultaneously, suggesting that the synergy effect in the forest sector in Indonesia does exist. This also implies simultaneous contributions to SDGs 13 and 15 (Targets 13.2 and 15.2). To realize such synergies, which have not yet been considered, it is necessary for policymakers to fill the institutional gaps between the policies/strategies of mitigation and forest conservation and enforce the policies for SDGs.

TI  - Assessing the Impacts of Selective Logging on the Forest Understory in the Amazon Using Airborne LiDAR
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Reduced-impact logging (RIL) has been recognized as a promising strategy for biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration within sustainable forest management (SFM) areas. However, monitoring the forest understory-a critical area for assessing logging impacts-remains challenging due to limitations in conventional methods such as field inventories and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) surveys, which are time-consuming, costly, and often lack accuracy in complex environments. Additionally, aerial and satellite imagery frequently underestimate the full extent of disturbances as the forest canopy obscures understory impacts. This study examines the effectiveness of the relative density model (RDM), derived from airborne LiDAR data, for mapping and monitoring understory disturbances. A field-based validation of LiDAR-derived RDM was conducted across 25 sites, totaling 5504.5 hectares within the Jamari National Forest, Rond & ocirc;nia, Brazil. The results indicate that the RDM accurately delineates disturbances caused by logging infrastructure, with over 90% agreement with GNSS field data. However, the model showed the greatest discrepancy for skid trails, which, despite their lower accuracy in modeling, accounted for the largest proportion of the total impacted area among infrastructure. The findings include the mapping of 35.1 km of primary roads, 117.4 km of secondary roads, 595.6 km of skid trails, and 323 log landings, with skid trails comprising the largest proportion of area occupied by logging infrastructure. It is recommended that airborne LiDAR assessments be conducted up to two years post-logging, as impacts become less detectable over time. This study highlights LiDAR data as a reliable alternative to traditional monitoring approaches, with the ability to detect understory impacts more comprehensively for monitoring selective logging in SFM areas of the Amazon, providing a valuable tool for both conservation and climate mitigation efforts.

TI  - Forestry projects under the clean development mechanism? Modelling of the uncertainties in carbon mitigation and related costs of plantation forestry projects
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB  - Afforestation is considered an important option for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. Recently, plantation projects have been suggested for inclusion under the Clean Development Mechanism. While considered a cheap option, significant uncertainties make it difficult to determine the (net) carbon benefits and profitability of forestry projects. The current uncertainties about the regulatory framework of the CDM and the environmental and economic performance of plantation forestry could create uncertainties with respect to the additionality of such projects and thus their acceptance under the mechanism. Six plantation forestry projects that were proposed in Brazil have been used as cases to study sources of uncertainty for carbon benefits and economics for such projects. These cases vary widely in terms of productivity and products delivered. A quantitative model for calculating greenhouse gas balances and financial benefits and costs, taking a broad range of variables into account, was developed. Data from the developers of the proposed projects was used as main source material. Subsequently, scenario's were evaluated, containing different and realistic options for baseline vegetation, carbon crediting systems and CDM modalities, fluctuations in product prices, discount rates and carbon prices. The real cost of combined carbon sequestration and substitution for the case projects was below $3 per ton of carbon avoided, when based exclusively on data supplied by project developers. However, potential variations in carbon impact and costs based on scenario options were very large. Different baseline vegetation or adopting a different discount rate cause carbon credits to vary by as much as an order of magnitude. Different carbon crediting systems or fluctuations in (commodity) product prices cause variations up to 200% in carbon credits and NPV. This makes the additionality of such projects difficult to determine. Five of the six case projects seem uneligible for development under the CDM. A critical attitude towards the use of plantation projects under the CDM seems justified.

TI  - Intensity Analysis to Study the Dynamics of Reforestation in the Rio Doce Water Basin, Brazil
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Conservationists routinely require methods to analyze the effects of conservation interventions such as reforestation. Although methods to measure the effects of reforestation abound, these methods often fail to track and communicate the complexities of reforestation interventions. This paper uses intensity analysis to analyze the effects of reforestation intervention in Brazil's Rio Doce water basin. In particular, this paper uses intensity analysis to study the effects of reforestation on three land cover categories in Brazil's Rio Doce water basin. The illustrative approach analyzes the temporal difference of forest in three land cover maps at time points 1998, 2008, and 2015 from the Rio Doce water basin, Brazil, where each map has four land cover categories: forest formation, pasture, mosaic of agriculture and pasture, and urban infrastructure. Interval level intensity indicates that change is faster during the second time interval (1998-2008). The results from the categorical level intensity show that the forest formation and the mosaic of agriculture and pasture are active gainers during both time intervals, while pasture is an active loser. Forest formation targets the mosaic of agriculture and pasture more intensively at the interval level during the first time interval. Forest formation gains the most from a mosaic of agriculture and pasture while at the same time targeting the mosaic of agriculture and pasture during the second time interval. The mosaic of agriculture and pasture gains the most from both forest formation and pasture during both time intervals but targets pasture. The results for the second time interval show that the reforestation process in the Rio Doce water basin, Brazil, only forced the farmers to move to other forest covers in the vicinity. This process constitutes exchange, which accounts for more than half of the change during the second time interval, and thus contributes 0 to the net change of forest.

TI  - Information exchange in swidden communities of West Kalimantan: lessons for designing REDD
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
AB  - Forested areas of Kalimantan, Indonesia, are often inhabited by swiddeners, and are also targeted by a range of interventions related to development and forest conservation, including REDD+. Whether these interventions are adopted, adapted or rejected by the local people is linked to the varying degrees of access to information that different types of households have, which also leads to unequal sharing of the associated benefits. This paper analyses factors influencing household access to agriculture and forestry-related information using quantitative and qualitative methods in three communities in West-Kalimantan, and draws lessons for designing REDD+. Household socio-economic characteristics (origin, status, migration patterns) and the divide between sub-groups in the communities (caused by origin, opinions, residential location, and relationships) were found to influence household access to information. Suggestions for improved REDD+ information exchange include: having more targeted and incentivised REDD+ activities; encouraging more equitable information sharing; and taking better account of local realities while designing REDD+.

TI  - A Chronicle of Indonesia's Forest Management: A Long Step towards Environmental Sustainability and Community Welfare
T2  - LAND
AB  - Indonesia is the largest archipelagic country in the world, with 17,000 islands of varying sizes and elevations, from lowlands to very high mountains, stretching more than 5000 km eastward from Sabang in Aceh to Merauke in Papua. Although occupying only 1.3% of the world's land area, Indonesia possesses the third-largest rainforest and the second-highest level of biodiversity, with very high species diversity and endemism. However, during the last two decades, Indonesia has been known as a country with a high level of deforestation, a producer of smoke from burning forests and land, and a producer of carbon emissions. The aim of this paper is to review the environmental history and the long process of Indonesian forest management towards achieving environmental sustainability and community welfare. To do this, we analyze the milestones of Indonesian forest management history, present and future challenges, and provide strategic recommendations toward a viable Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) system. Our review showed that the history of forestry management in Indonesia has evolved through a long process, especially related to contestation over the control of natural resources and supporting policies and regulations. During the process, many efforts have been applied to reduce the deforestation rate, such as a moratorium on permitting primary natural forest and peat land, land rehabilitation and soil conservation, environmental protection, and other significant regulations. Therefore, these efforts should be maintained and improved continuously in the future due to their significant positive impacts on a variety of forest areas toward the achievement of viable SFM. Finally, we conclude that the Indonesian government has struggled to formulate sustainable forest management policies that balance economic, ecological, and social needs, among others, through developing and implementing social forestry instruments, developing and implementing human resource capacity, increasing community literacy, strengthening forest governance by eliminating ambiguity and overlapping regulations, simplification of bureaucracy, revitalization of traditional wisdom, and fair law enforcement.

TI  - Economic benefits of forest conservation: assessing the potential rents from Brazil nut concessions in Madre de Dios, Peru, to channel REDD+ investments
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Brazil nut collection is key to reconciling sustainable economic development with forest conservation in the Amazon. Whether the activity is profitable, however, remains uncertain due to the paucity of information on spatial distribution and productivity of trees as well as the costs of collection and processing. To fill this gap, this study developed and used a spatially-explicit rent model of Brazil nut production to assess yields and potential profits (rents) from the Brazil nut concessions in Madre de Dios (Peru), under three scenarios of processing and management (unshelled, shelled and shelled-certified nuts). Potential annual production in the region was estimated to be 14.1 +/- 2.4 thousand tonnes of unshelled nuts; at 2008 regional sale prices this corresponded to profits of between US$ 3.1 +/- 0.5 ha(-1) yr(-1) for unshelled nuts to US$ 8.4 +/- 1.4 ha(-1) yr(-1) for shelled-certified nuts. Investment of c. US$ 14-17 ha(-1) is required to develop certified production in Madre de Dios concessions; this would approximately triple rents in these areas. Such investment could be channelled through REDD+ projects; sustainable management of Brazil nut concessions may contribute to a 42-43% reduction in deforestation in Madre de Dios by 2050.

TI  - Prioritization of peatland restoration and conservation interventions in Sumatra, Kalimantan and Papua
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
AB  - Peatlands in Indonesia are of global significance for biodiversity conservation and climate regulation, as well as of national and local significance for water management and livelihood support. Despite their importance, in tropics these ecosystems remain among the least investigated and monitored and are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic activities. To support the ongoing formulation, refinement and implementation of peatland restoration and conservation activities in Indonesia, we developed a methodology based on land cover and land productivity analysis, which will help prioritize interventions in Sumatra, Kalimantan and Papua. Results showed that of the analysed peatland area, approximately 45.5% should be conserved, 28.7% should be restored and 16.2% should be subjected to sustainable agricultural practices. Furthermore, the analysis showed that only 15.6% of the peatlands in need of conservation measures are currently protected, resulting in a necessary expansion of protected areas of about 84%. This study is intended as a tool for policy makers to guide future action, emphasising that conservation and restoration efforts in Indonesian peatlands should be increased, and providing spatial guidance for their implementation.

TI  - Non-conformities to the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) standards: Empirical evidence and implications for policy-making in Brazil
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) standards are becoming increasingly important in sustainable forest governance. In 2016, FSC certified a total forest area of 195 Mha across 80 countries. While there is considerable room for expanding FSC's reach, there has been a lack of incentives for producers to seek certification, particularly in tropical countries. Information about existing barriers and challenges to comply with FSC standards are fundamental to promote such incentives. The objective of this study was to explore the main challenges faced by firms in the FSC certification process and discuss their policy implications. This was carried out by analyzing the quantity, spatial distribution, non-compliant principles, potential triggers and thematic areas of non-conformities (NCs) to FSC certification disclosed in the Public Summary Reports of third-party audits in Brazil. More specifically it tried to understand the specific issues to which the NCs were potentially associated to. This study generated descriptive and inferential statistics of a sample of 1086 NCs to FSC standards disclosed in the 110 Public Summary Reports, from which the overall majority were related to the certification of plantation forests that had gone through maintenance audits. The occurrence of NCs was found to be most frequently associated with FSC Principles 4 (26,07%), 6 (21,82%) and 8 (13,72%), which are related to the themes "Community Relations and Worker's rights", "Environmental Impact" and "Monitoring and Assessment", respectively. Many NCs were triggered by aspects of forest planning, operation and monitoring, which altogether accounted for 42.91% of all NCs. Problems related to occupational health and safety were also a relevant theme, accounting for almost 20% of the total non-conformities. Findings from the Kruskal-Wallis tests suggest that auditors tended to identify similar NCs, regardless of the geographical region, of the type of forest and of the type of audit (certification or maintenance). Spearman Correlation tests indicated significant relationships between certified forest area and non-conformities with FSC Principles 4 and 7 (Community Relations and Worker's Rights, and Management Plans, respectively). The meaning of this relationship is unclear. Overall, findings corroborate previous studies that found FSC Principles 4 and 6 among the most challenging of the global FSC system. There seems to exist an opportunity for the development of stronger technical guidance and capacity building policies related to community relations, worker's rights, and environmental impacts. If such issues are already challenging in the context of large forest plantations, Brazilian policy-makers should expect small-scale firms to face even higher levels of difficulty, given their lack of financial and human resources. The study concludes by discussing its limitations and suggesting future research avenues.

TI  - A scoping review of the health co-benefits of climate mitigation strategies in South America
T2  - LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-AMERICAS
AB  - The accelerated production of greenhouse gases (GHG) due to human activity has led to unprecedented global warming, making climate mitigation strategies crucial for minimizing its impacts. South America, a region highly vulnerable to climate change, stands to benefit from implementing such strategies to reduce future risks and generate health co-benefits. This scoping review, aimed to assess the existing evidence on the health benefits of climate mitigation strategies in South American countries. PubMed, Web of Science, and LILACS databases were searched until June 15, 2023. Nine studies published between 2001 and 2021 were analyzed, focusing on Brazil, Chile, and Bolivia. All the studies identified in this review used scenario modeling. They evaluated various GHG emission mitigation strategies, including land management, reducing livestock production, biofuel production, increased active transportation, renewable energy, and waste reduction. Only one study looked at GHG capture and sequestration through afforestation. Given the limited information available, there is a pressing need for more research on the region's potential health, environmental, and economic co-benefits. This review serves as a starting point and suggests that climate mitigation can offer a range of positive co-benefits, such as improved air quality and increased resilience to climate impacts, thereby advancing public health initiatives.

TI  - Changes in Carbon Cycling during Development of Successional Agroforestry
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Successional agroforestry systems (SAFS) mimic the structure of natural forests while providing economical outputs. This study clarifies how carbon cycling and carbon sequestration change during successional development of SAFS. In Brazil, three successional stages of SAFS, 6, 12, and 34 years old, were compared in terms of carbon balance. Aboveground biomass, fruit harvest, litterfall, soil respiration, and soil organic carbon were measured for two years and analyzed. Carbon sequestration expressed by net primary productivity increased with age of SAFS from 9.8 MgCha(-1)year(-1) in 6-year-old system to 13.5 MgCha(-1)year(-1) in 34-year-old system. Accumulation of plant biomass and increased internal carbon cycling in SAFS led to an intensive sequestration of carbon. SAFS can be a sustainable way of agricultural production on vulnerable tropical soils.

TI  - Redesigning Indonesian forest fiscal policy to support forest conservation
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - The formulation of fiscal policy in the forestry sector was designed as a green incentive for local governments to conserve forest area in Indonesia. However, evidence demonstrates an increasing rate of deforestation occurred during the implementation of fiscal policy reforms. Thus, problems persist in the implementation of fiscal policies in the forestry sector. This study evaluates the gap between the rule and the implementation of forest fiscal policy, focusing on regulatory, economic, administrative, and informational instruments. There are four main findings of this study. First, there are several inappropriate and even conflicting regulations concerning local government authorities and forest conservation; second, the lack of coordination among agencies is one of the most important factors causing sub-optimal collection of "non-tax state revenues" from the forestry sector; third, forest fiscal policies in Indonesia mostly focus on collecting financial benefits from timber rather than preserving ecosystem functions, and; fourth, there is a weak management information system concerning forest fiscal policy. To address the gaps identified in this study, the implementation of green fiscal policy in the forestry sector must provide a comprehensive regulatory framework and improve the capacity of human resources.

TI  - Regulating the Sustainability of Forest Management in the Americas: Cross-Country Comparisons of Forest Legislation
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Based on theoretical underpinnings and an empirical review of forest laws and regulations of selected countries throughout the Americas, we examine key components of natural forest management and how they are addressed in the legal frameworks of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Uruguay, and the U.S. We consider forest policy directives in terms of legislative, planning, operational, environmental/ecological, social, and economic aspects and classify them by the type of policy obligation: (1) non-discretionary laws or rules; or (2) discretionary, voluntary directives; and, further, by the type of policy approach: (1) a specific technology or practice required or recommended; (2) a process or system requirement or recommendation; or (3) a performance or outcome based requirement or recommendation. Protection of at-risk species and riparian buffers are required in all countries and include specific prescriptions in most; forest management planning and secure, legal land title or tenancy are commonly required; and mandatory processes to protect soil and water quality are customary. Less common requirements include forest monitoring and social and economic aspects, and, when in place, they are usually voluntary. Implications for improved policies to achieve sustainable forest management (SFM) are discussed.

TI  - Degradation and conservation of Brazilian mangroves, status and perspectives
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Mangroves are one of the most human-affected coastal ecosystems, despite their important social and ecological roles, and after decades of devastation these forests continue facing different processes of conversion, threatening their global future. Brazilian mangroves are not an exception, despite the existence of severe protection legislation. Conversions to aquaculture, industrial and urban development among others, have destroyed more than 50,000 ha (about 4% of the total mangrove area in the country) over the past three decades. Restoration efforts have somewhat minimized losses, but has recuperated only a 5% of the total degraded area. Despite criticized, monospecific plantings have demonstrated return of some ecosystem structure and functioning, and seems to be a starting point in mangrove restoration. Around 70% of Brazilian mangroves are today inside preserved areas, but the effectiveness of these advances continues impaired by bureaucracy, lack of conservation policies and economic interests. We estimate the status of Brazilian mangroves and review some restoration and conservation efforts, suggesting some management measures like restoration and community-based ecosystem management. Based in a reforested stand in Northeastern Brazil, we assess the environmental cost of mangrove clearing and reforestation results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Can conservation funding be left to carbon finance? Evidence from participatory future land use scenarios in Peru, Indonesia, Tanzania, and Mexico
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Revenues derived from carbon have been seen as an important tool for supporting forest conservation over the past decade. At the same time, there is high uncertainty about how much revenue can reasonably be expected from land use emissions reductions initiatives. Despite this uncertainty, REDD+ projects and conservation initiatives that aim to take advantage of available or, more commonly, future funding from carbon markets have proliferated. This study used participatory multi-stakeholder workshops to develop divergent future scenarios of land use in eight landscapes in four countries around the world: Peru, Indonesia, Tanzania, and Mexico. The results of these future scenario building exercises were analyzed using a new tool, CarboScen, for calculating the landscape carbon storage implications of different future land use scenarios. The findings suggest that potential revenues from carbon storage or emissions reductions are significant in some landscapes (most notably the peat forests of Indonesia), and much less significant in others (such as the low-carbon forests of Zanzibar and the interior of Tanzania). The findings call into question the practicality of many conservation programs that hinge on expectations of future revenue from carbon finance. The future scenarios-based approach is useful to policy-makers and conservation program developers in distinguishing between landscapes where carbon finance can substantially support conservation, and landscapes where other strategies for conservation and land use should be prioritized.

TI  - Challenges in the conservation and management of legal reserve areas in Brazilian grassland and savanna ecosystems in the face of global climate change
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
AB  - Legal reserve areas (ARLs) are a fundamental part of Brazil's conservation strategy, along with permanent preservation areas. ARLs are designed to maintain biodiversity and can be managed sustainably. When these areas are home to fire- and grazing-dependent ecosystems, such as native grasslands and savannas, appropriate management practices must be adopted to conserve them and cope with the effects of global climate change. However, this subject is still little discussed in Brazil, and public policies are unclear in this regard. This review article describes the grassland and savannah ecosystems in Brazil, the legal aspects related to the management of ARLs, current and future climate scenarios, and the relationship between climate and fire risk. It also presents a review of the use of fire and grazing in grassland and savannah ecosystems, the legal challenges related to their application in ARLs and the use of geotechnologies in monitoring these practices. It concludes that grazing and fire, as management tools, are appropriate for the functions of ARLs, provided that they are practiced according to legal and scientifically based standards to avoid the negative effects of their misuse.

TI  - Sundaland Peat Carbon Dynamics and Its Contribution to the Holocene Atmospheric CO2 Concentration
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
AB  - The Sunda Shelf is a large submerged extension of the continental shelf of mainland Asia, joining the islands of Borneo, Java, and Sumatra and forming the shallow seabed of the South China Sea. Recent studies identified present-day peatlands in Southeast Asia as a globally important carbon reservoir. However, little is known about Sundaland paleopeatlands and their role in the global carbon cycle since the Last Glacial Maximum. Using a topography-based, sea level-driven model, we estimate the potential spatial extent of peatlands during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene across the low-lying Sundaland plains. We then use the estimated peatland area together with data on carbon accumulation rates to calculate the total peat carbon pool on the Sunda Shelf. Finally, using a global biogeochemical model, we analyze the relative influence of the predicted Sundaland peat dynamics and other carbon change mechanisms, specifically high-latitude forest growth and peat formation, shallow sea carbonate deposition, ocean warming, and combinations of them, on the global carbon cycle of the Holocene. We identify a feedback mechanism between sea level and peatland carbon sequestration in Sundaland that reduced atmospheric CO2 concentration by about 4-5 ppm and increased C-13 by 0.05 during the Holocene. We also show that a concurrence of mechanisms that includes Sundaland peat dynamics produces model results that are consistent with proxy records, especially with respect to C-13.

TI  - INFLUENCE OF INDIGENOUS SAGO-BASED AGRICULTURE ON LOCAL FOREST LANDSCAPES IN MALUKU, EAST INDONESIA
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - This study assessed the influence of sago-based vegeculture (cultivation of sago and vegetatively propagated crops) in Seram, Maluku province, east Indonesia, on the local forest landscape. The land productivity of sago groves, dependence of local people on sago and size of shifting cultivation field were analysed. Field research was conducted intermittently between 2003 and 2010 in an upland community in Seram. The study found that (1) the land productivity of sago groves in the village was higher than that of upland rice fields throughout South-East Asia, (2) sago was the most important staple food in terms of energy intake and was highly valued by the local people and (3) shifting cultivation fields were very small compared with upland rice fields throughout South and South-East Asia. This type of small-scale shifting cultivation creates relatively little pressure for forest clearance, suggesting that sago-based vegeculture contributes, to some extent, to supporting the rich natural forest-dominated rural landscape in Seram.

TI  - BIOCHAR: PYROGENIC CARBON FOR AGRICULTURAL USE - A CRITICAL REVIEW
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
AB  - Biochar (carbonized biomass for agricultural use) has been used worldwide as soil amendment and is a technology of particular interest for Brazil, since its "inspiration" is from the historical Terra Preta de Indios (Amazon Dark Earth), and also because Brazil is the world's largest charcoal producer, generating enormous residue quantities in form of fine charcoal and due to the availability of different residual biomasses, mainly from agroindustry (e.g., sugar-cane bagasse; wood and paper-mill wastes; residues from biofuel industries; sewage sludge etc), that can be used for biochar production, making Brazil a key actor in the international scenario in terms of biochar research and utilization). In the last decade, numerous studies on biochar have been carried out and now a vast literature, and excellent reviews, are available. The objective of this paper is therefore to deliver a critical review with some highlights on biochar research, rather than an exhaustive bibliographic review. To this end, some key points considered critical and relevant were selected and the pertinent literature "condensed", with a view to guide future research, rather than analyze trends of the past.

TI  - Litterfall and Associated Macrozoobenthic of Restored Mangrove Forests in Abandoned Aquaculture Ponds
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Mangrove restoration projects are now widely established, aiming to regain the carbon benefit of the mangrove ecosystem that is essential for climate change mitigation. This study aimed to investigate mangrove litter as the source of carbon in restored mangrove forests in Perancak Estuary, Bali, Indonesia, which previously experienced substantial mangrove loss due to shrimp aquaculture development. We assessed the production and decomposition of mangrove litter and associated macrozoobenthic biodiversity in restored forests with plantation age >= 14 years and intact mangrove forests as the reference. The monthly production of three groups of mangrove litter (leaf, reproductive, and wood) was assessed over 12 months. A leaf litter decomposition experiment was performed to inspect the interspecific and disturbance history variation in organic matter formation among four major mangrove species: Rhizophora apiculata, Bruguiera gymnorhiza, Avicennia marina, and Sonneratia alba. Our results showed that annual litterfall production from restored and intact mangroves in Perancak Estuary were 13.96 and 10.18 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), which is equivalent to approximately 6282 and 4581 kg C ha(-1) year(-1) of annual litterfall carbon sink, respectively. Although restored mangroves had significantly higher plant litterfall production than intact mangroves, no significant difference was detected in leaf litter decomposition and macrozoobenthic biodiversity between these forest types.

TI  - A novel energy systems model to explore the role of land use and reforestation in achieving carbon mitigation targets: A Brazil case study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Due to its low global share of direct energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions (1-2%), the implications of technological transitions in the agricultural and forestry sector on the energy system have been overlooked. This paper introduces the Agriculture and Land Use Sector module part of the ModUlar energy System Environment (MUSE), a novel energy system simulation model. The study presents a generalisable method that enables energy modellers to characterise agricultural technologies within an energy system modelling framework. Different mechanisation processes were characterised to simulate intensification/extensification transitions in the sector and its wider implications in the energy and land use system aiming at providing reliable non-energy outputs similarly to those found in dedicated land use models. Additionally, a forest growth model has been integrated to explore the role of reforestation alongside decarbonisation measures in the energy system in achieving carbon mitigation pathways. To illustrate the model's capabilities, Brazil is used as case study. Outputs suggest that by 2030 under a 2 degrees C mitigation scenario, most of Brazil agricultural production would move from 'transitional' to 'modern' practices, improving productivity and reducing deforestation rates, at the expense of higher energy and fertiliser demand. By mid-century Brazil has the potential to liberate around 24.4 Mha of agricultural land, where large-scale reforestation could have the capacity to sequester around 5.6 GtCO(2), alleviating mitigation efforts in the energy system, especially reducing carbon capture and storage technology investments in the industry and power sector.

TI  - Climate change mitigation strategies in agriculture and land use in Indonesia
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - We quantitatively evaluated mitigation potentials of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and land use sectors in Indonesia. We also determined for the land use sector 1) how much time is needed to plan the mitigation strategy, and 2) how much time is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures? We used a bottom-up type model on emission mitigation named Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use Bottom-up model (AFOLU-B model) to consider a characteristics time sequence of actions, effects and costs of mitigation countermeasures. To input to the model, we developed future scenarios on human activities in these sectors based on data from Indonesian government. We found that i) evaluation on effects and costs of mitigation measures from a long-term viewpoint and their continuing implementation are required to increase future mitigation potentials under a limited budget. ii) a long-term reduction target will also play an important role for cost-effective countermeasure selection. iii) reforestation of slow glowing species and enhanced natural regeneration will cause great increase in mitigation potential in the country.

TI  - Modelling the potential for soil carbon sequestration using biochar from sugarcane residues in Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) cultivation leaves behind around 20 t ha(-1) of biomass residue after harvest and processing. We investigated the potential for sequestering carbon (C) in soil with these residues by partially converting them into biochar (recalcitrant carbon-rich material). First, we modified the RothC model to allow changes in soil C arising from additions of sugarcane-derived biochar. Second, we evaluated the modified model against published field data, and found satisfactory agreement between observed and predicted soil C accumulation. Third, we used the model to explore the potential for soil C sequestration with sugarcane biochar in SAo Paulo State, Brazil. The results show a potential increase in soil C stocks by 2.35 +/- 0.4 t C ha(-1) year(-1) in sugarcane fields across the State at application rates of 4.2 t biochar ha(-1) year(-1). Scaling to the total sugarcane area of the State, this would be 50 Mt of CO2 equivalent year(-1), which is 31% of the CO2 equivalent emissions attributed to the State in 2016. Future research should (a) further validate the model with field experiments; (b) make a full life cycle assessment of the potential for greenhouse gas mitigation, including additional effects of biochar applications on greenhouse gas balances.

TI  - Sustainable aviation fuels must control induced land use change: an integrated assessment modelling exercise for Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Bio-sustainable aviation fuels (bio-SAFs) are an important pillar of the aviation sector decarbonisation strategy in the mid-term. Here we assess the induced Land-Use Change (LUC) implications of producing bio-SAFs in Brazil under different assumptions of forest conservation governance. We evaluate four bio-SAF routes via two main pathways: the Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) and the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) syntheses. We chose the most promising agriculture-based feedstocks to produce bio-SAFs in all five macro-regions of Brazil, including sugarcane and maize ethanol to jet and palm and macaw HEFA routes. To this end, we calculated future projections of air transport demand in Brazil and used the Brazilian Land Use and Energy Systems integrated assessment model to estimate LUC greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within five different levels of bio-SAF blends (10% to 50% of total aviation fuel demand) for each bio-SAFs evaluated. Estimated cumulated emissions vary widely, ranging from a carbon sequestration of -286.8 gCO(2)e.MJ(-1) for a 10% blend of maize ATJ under a controlled deforestation scenario to a release of 15.0 gCO(2)e.MJ(-1) for a 40% blend of high productivity macaw oil HEFA considering historical deforestation rates in the country. Results are highly sensitive to deforestation rate parameters, volume of bio-SAFs produced, the type of feedstock used, and methodological assumptions. Negative LUC GHG emissions were found under controlled deforestation assumptions and in low blends of bio-SAFs for maize and sugarcane ATJ routes. Under historical deforestation rates, the LUC GHG emissions are higher. Bio-SAF can be beneficial to reduce GHG emissions if effective land conservation policies are implemented. Therefore, large-scale bio-SAF production from sugar crops in Brazil may play an important role in the decarbonisation of the aviation sector if coupled with successful strategies to control deforestation. Additionally, when imposing bio-SAF demand, other biofuels demand reduces under the model optimal solution due to land restrictions.

TI  - Land use changes, green house gas emissions, and rehabilitation model of native tree species towards sustainable management
T2  - GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Tropical peatlands play a crucial role in the global ecosystem. These distinctive ecosystems are frequently regarded as peripheral areas that are not suitable for agricultural purposes. Peatlands serve as efficient carbon storage systems in a consistent climate, however, they are vulnerable to alterations. This study focuses on analyzing the dynamic of peatland use land cover changes, its driver and impact on green house gas emission, and rehabilitating degraded peatlands in Jambi province, Indonesia, specifically in the Bram Itam and Londerang peat forest reserves. This study was depicted into 3 objectives consisted of 1) Utilize spatial analysis to examine the dynamics of peatland use change and the trajectory of peatland use, as well as to identify the drivers behind these changes; 2) describe the effects of altering peatland utilization; and 3) describe seedling performance planted on the peatland forest of Jambi province, as Tanjung Jabung Barat and Tanjung Jabung Timur. METHODS: Land-use and land-cover change analysis was carried out utilizing various map resources. Cellular Automata-Markov is employed to forecast forthcoming land cover alterations by evaluating the likelihood of land cover transitions throughout a given period. Planting trials using native peatland tree species were conducted at 2 locations with 2 different rehabilitation models following social typology of the sites. FINDINGS: Key findings indicate that peatland conversion to non forest use significantly increases greenhouse gas emissions, while rehabilitation with native tree species shows promising results in carbon sequestration. Peatland use land cover alteration in anthropogenically disturbed peat areas significantly contributes to emissions through peat decomposition and fires. Biophysical analysis reveals variations in peat depth, water table levels, and precipitation between these sites. The two locations exhibit notable disparities in terms of peat soil attributes, such as potential of hydrogen, nutrient composition, and exchangeable cations. This study examines the growth performance of several native tree species that were planted on degraded peatlands. Native peatland tree species like Shorea balangeran, Ilex cymosa, and Fagraea crenulata show promising survival and growth rates. Areca nut (Areca catechu), a non native peatland species, was planted for non-timber forest product purposes. This study delivers significant insights for policymakers looking to strike a balance between economic priorities and environmental conservation. CONCLUSION: Land use change that results in the degradation of peatlands must be avoided because it will be a source of greenhouse gas emissionsThe selection of suitable indigenous tree species holds significant importance in the restoration of peatlands, taking into account ecological, social, and economic considerations. The findings support potential for wet agroforestry and paludiculture to restore peatlands, mitigate carb & oacute;n dioxide emissions, and enhance livelihoods while emphasizing the need for inclusive governance and technical capacity.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration and Environmental Service Assessment in the Special Purpose Forest Area of Mount Bromo, Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the carbon and environmental service potential in the natural tourism zone of special purpose forest areas Mount Bromo. The study focused on understanding how this area, with its specific tree compositions and sizes, contributes to carbon absorption and environmental benefits, which can also translate into carbon credits, a form of state revenue. The methodology involved purposive sampling to create observational sample plots (OSP) of varying sizes based on tree diameter. These plots were designed to measure the biomass, carbon potential, and environmental service potential of the trees in a given area. The collected data included the composition of tree species, the number of each type of tree, their diameters, and heights. The study applied specific formulas to determine the potential of biomass, carbon, and environmental services in the area. Key findings revealed a dominance of mahogany trees (83 trees per hectare) among ten identified plant species, indicating a specific but lower biodiversity in this zone. The significant results of the study include the quantification of biomass potential, which was found to be 787.84 tons/ha above -ground and 228.47 tons/ha below -ground, totaling 1016.31 tons/hectare. The study also evaluated the environmental service potential, including CO2 absorption and O2 production. The CO2 absorption capacity of the area was estimated at 1753.04 tons/ha, with a corresponding high O2 production of 1279.72 tons/ha. Additionally, the potential for carbon credits in the area was calculated at approximately 70.12 US$/ha. This research is crucial in understanding how specific forest areas, like special purpose forest areas Mount Bromo, can play a significant role in global environmental sustainability efforts.

TI  - Local stakeholders' assessment of community-based forest management and the implications for REDD Plus implementation in the Philippines
T2  - ASIA LIFE SCIENCES
AB  - The Philippines is one of the pioneers to adopt participatory approach in forest management, as embodied in. its national strategy for sustainable forest management and social justice in the uplands, called Community-Based Forest Management (CBFM). The program's almost three decades of implementation saw positive impacts on the livelihood assets of local communities. CBFM has evolved to tackle global concerns as well, such as climate change and biodiversity conservation. Meanwhile, international climate change negotiations have drawn a means to provide financial incentives to reduce deforestation and forest degradation through Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in developing countries (REDD Plus). This mechanism hopes to bring "triple benefits", namely: emission reduction, biodiversity conservation and poverty alleviation. Given their parallel goals, CBFM sites are promising candidates for implementing REDD Plus, and the latter is expected to have important implications on the process and potential outcomes of CBFM. This paper looks into the local stakeholders' assessment of the impacts of CBFM on the livelihood assets of local communities and the potentials of REDD Plus implementation in the future. The literature is replete with examples emphasizing the importance of local stakeholder's participation in REDD Plus, yet their perception particularly on the added value it gives remained unclear. Results of the study revealed that CBFM implementation contributed largely to building the capital assets of people organization (PO) members, especially the human, social, natural and physical capitals. Full positive effects have yet to be realized though for the financial capital. PO members and the local institutions (DENR, LGU, NGO) expressed optimism, though with varied levels, on REDD Plus further enhancing the above capital assets. This optimism, however, does not translate to confidence in achieving the triple-benefits, as risks are also perceived by PO members posed by the likely creation of forest enclosures that could limit areas for livelihood activities. If realized, improved economic conditions could also encourage in-migration that would increase pressure to the forests. Caution should therefore be exercised in implementing REDD Plus to ensure that the intended goals are achieved in the context of views and aspirations of local stakeholders.

TI  - International and Domestic Sustainable Forest Management Policies: Distributive Effects on Power among State Agencies in Bangladesh
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The last two decades of forest policy discussions have been dominated by calls for sustainable management of forest resources. Consequently, multiple international and domestic policies, supporting sustainable forest management (SFM), have evolved in numerous jurisdictions. Policies in developing countries often rely on foreign donors' projects, which supplement domestic SFM policy. These policies assign various policy tasks to specific public bureaucracies, who then compete for these very tasks, as well as the related staff and budgets. Therefore, project and policy task assignment greatly influences bureaucratic power. This article analyzes the distributive effects of SFM policy on power (in terms of coercion, incentives and dominant information) among relevant domestic and foreign donor bureaucracies in Bangladesh. Concepts from power theory, bureaucratic politics theory, and concepts of policy and policy process were combined to analyze 121 Bangladeshi SFM policies from 1992-2013, which assign a total of 1012 policy tasks to specific public bureaucracies. Using qualitative content analysis, inferences about power were assigned to specific competing bureaucracies by the totality of SFM policies made. Results identify domestic and foreign bureaucracies whose power distribution benefit most from the SFM policies viz. their competitors. It is concluded that bureaucracies gaining the most power set the limits and directions in designing, implementing and evaluating various elements of any national SFM policies.

TI  - Optimal rotations on Eucalyptus plantations including carbon sequestration -: A comparison of results in Brazil and Spain
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
CP  - IUFRO International Meeting on Economics and Management of High Productivity Plantations
AB  - Economically optimal rotations are not frequently employed in Eucalyptus plantations management despite eucalypts' economic importance to the pulp industry. The coppice regeneration method used to manage eucalypts leads to a simultaneous optimization problem. In such cases, the manager has to simultaneously define the optimal age in each coppice rotation and the optimal number of coppice rotations for each plantation full cycle. The dynamic nature of the problem of looking for the optimal set of coppice rotations for Eucalyptus plantations obliges managers to use the dynamic programming technique. In order to evaluate the economic loss occasioned when optimal rotations are not considered, two plantations are shown, one with Eucalyptus urophylla S.T. Blake in Brazil and another with Eucalyptus globulus Labill in Spain. Different clearcut ages are established in each country, 5-9 years in Brazil, and 13-18 years in Spain. A multiple products context (wood and carbon) is considered in this paper. The results show different rotations and optimal number of coppice rotations for each site index and case considered. To repeat tfhe seedling rotation in the following coppice rotations usually is not the best option. Besides, the optimal cycle and the land expectation value vary when carbon sequestration is evaluated for the two plantations considered. Finally, on some occasions the results are very sensitive to changes in parameters like the carbon price and discount rate. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Charcoal Fine Residues Effects on Soil Organic Matter Humic Substances, Composition, and Biodegradability
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Biochar has been shown as a potential mean to enhance carbon sequestration in the soil. In Brazil, approximately 15% of the produced charcoal is discarded as charcoal fines, which are chemically similar to biochar. Therefore, we aimed to test charcoal fines as a strategy to increase soil carbon sequestration. Charcoal fines of hardwood Mimosa scabrella were incorporated into a Cambisol down to 10 cm (T1 = 0 and T4 = 40 Mg ha(-1)) in Southern Brazil. Soil samples were collected (0-30 cm) 20 months after charcoal amendment. Soil organic matter (SOM) acid extract, humic acid, fulvic acid, and humin fractions were separated. Solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra from charcoal and SOM in T1 and T4 were obtained before and after 165 days of incubation under controlled conditions. Charcoal increased soil carbon as fulvic (10-20 cm) and humic acids (10-30 cm) and, especially, as humin (0-5 cm), which probably occurred due to the hydrophobic character of the charcoal. The C-13 NMR spectra and mean residence times (MRT) measured from incubation essays indicated that the charred material decomposed relatively fast and MRT of T1 and T4 samples were similar. It follows that the charcoal fines underwent similar decomposition as SOM, despite the high charcoal dose applied to the soil and the high aryl C contribution (78%) to the total C-13 intensity of the charcoal NMR spectra.

TI  - Reducing climate impacts of beef production: A synthesis of life cycle assessments across management systems and global regions
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - The global demand for beef is rapidly increasing (FAO, 2019), raising concern about climate change impacts (Clark et al., 2020; Leip et al., 2015; Springmann et al., 2018). Beef and dairy contribute over 70% of livestock greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), which collectively contribute similar to 6.3 Gt CO2-eq/year (Gerber et al., 2013; Herrero et al., 2016) and account for 14%-18% of human GHG emissions (Friedlingstein et al., 2019; Gerber et al., 2013). The utility of beef GHG mitigation strategies, such as land-based carbon (C) sequestration and increased production efficiency, are actively debated (Garnett et al., 2017). We compiled 292 local comparisons of "improved" versus "conventional" beef production systems across global regions, assessing net GHG emission data from Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies. Our results indicate that net beef GHG emissions could be reduced substantially via changes in management. Overall, a 46 % reduction in net GHG emissions per unit of beef was achieved at sites using carbon (C) sequestration management strategies on grazed lands, and an 8% reduction in net GHGs was achieved at sites using growth efficiency strategies. However, net-zero emissions were only achieved in 2% of studies. Among regions, studies from Brazil had the greatest improvement, with management strategies for C sequestration and efficiency reducing beef GHG emissions by 57%. In the United States, C sequestration strategies reduced beef GHG emissions by over 100% (net-zero emissions) in a few grazing systems, whereas efficiency strategies were not successful at reducing GHGs, possibly because of high baseline efficiency in the region. This meta-analysis offers insight into pathways to substantially reduce beef production's global GHG emissions. Nonetheless, even if these improved land-based and efficiency management strategies could be fully applied globally, the trajectory of growth in beef demand will likely more than offset GHG emissions reductions and lead to further warming unless there is also reduced beef consumption.

TI  - Influence of Carbon Sequestration in an Optimal Set of Coppice Rotations for Eucalyptus Plantations
T2  - MANAGING FOREST ECOSYSTEMS: THE CHALLENGE OF CLIMATE CHANGE, 2ND EDITION
AB  - The coppice regeneration method used to manage eucalypts leads to a simultaneous optimization problem: the manager has to simultaneously define the optimal age in each coppice rotation and the optimal number of coppice rotations for each plantation full cycle. The dynamic nature of the problem justifies the use of methods like dynamic programming in order to achieve optimal solutions. Expected land value and the duration of the optimal rotation may change significantly when payments for carbon sequestration are added as revenues in the cash flow analysis of the project. In this chapter, we analyze the effects of considering carbon sequestration as a subsidized complementary product when defining the optimal set of coppice rotations. A Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to model the inherent risk of some variables and parameters like pulpwood price, carbon price, and discount rate. The variation in the land expectation value and in the optimal rotation length is reported when these stochastic variables are computed. Two study cases are shown, one with Eucalyptus urophylla S.T. Blake in Brazil, and another with Eucalyptus globulus Labill in Galicia, Spain.

CP  - 11th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)
AB  - Dantas, S.T.P.L., Amaro, V.E. and Costa, B.C.P., 2011. Mangrove reforestation as a mesotidial coastal protection and clean develepment mechanism on Macau-Serra oil field, Potiguar Basin, Northeast Brazil. Journal of Coastal Research, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 1268 - 1271. Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208
   Mangrove ecosystem changes are commonly mentioned among a variety of coastal effects caused by climate change and human intervention. On the Rio Grande do Norte northern coast of Brazil intense sediment transport, is controlled by a high dynamic energy factors. This causes widespread erosion and shoreline morphological instability. Through the observation of wetland natural deposits, it was possible to make a physicochemical characterization which indicated over an area of approximately 0.89 km(2) appropriated to reforestation with local mangrove. To assess the amount of atmospheric carbon sequestration by the mangrove ecosystem, following the principles of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), an inventory was conducted based on geoprocessing and ground accuracy techniques, especially regarding the structural characterization of the mangrove areas. With this approach a mangrove planting project is planned to stabilize a tidal channel northwest of Ponta do Tubarao Island. This is expected to reduce the energy of the channel which is responsible for the currently intense erosion and migration of the channel over the oil field infrastructure. Remote sensing, GIS and DGPS were used to compare the current and past mangrove cover, allowing plausible projections for the future impacts and changes in that region. Currently 7.1% of the mangrove forests of the studied area is dead or suffering ongoing breakdown.

TI  - Managing grazing intensity to reduce the global warming potential in integrated crop-livestock systems under no-till agriculture
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - Agricultural intensification has been associated with increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Using integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLs) under no-till agriculture can increase soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation, thereby helping mitigate such emissions. The aim of this study was to assess the net global warming potential (net GWP) of no-till ICLs at variable grazing intensities of winter black oat pasture in a subtropical ecosystem. A 3.5-year field experiment involving three different grazing intensities (i.e., intensive, moderate and light as defined by a pasture height of 10, 20 and 30 cm, respectively) and grazing exclusion in winter and no-till soybean cropping in summer was conducted on a Ferralsol in southern Brazil. Net GWP, in Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) year(-1), was assessed in terms of SOC sequestration relative to intensive grazing as a reference, including methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and energy costs of farming operations and inputs. Moderate grazing reduced net GWP relative to intensive grazing (from 0.09 to 4.92 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) year(-1)), the latter leading to the highest GWP levels. The decrease in net GWP was mainly the result of SOC accumulation, which offset 34-98% of all GHG emissions. Light grazing and grazing exclusion proved to be less efficient than moderate grazing in decreasing net GWP (1.84 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) year(-1) on average), mainly as a result of decreased SOC accumulation. Based on our findings, moderate grazing (20 cm high pasture) of winter black oat pasture is an effective strategy to reduce the C-footprint of ICLs in subtropical no-till agriculture. Highlights
   On-farm assessment of net GWP in subtropical no-till ICLs Conversion from intensive to moderate grazing reduced net GWP SOC accumulation is the main driver of net GWP reduction under no-till ICLs.

TI  - Oil palm deserves government attention in Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Englund et al (2015 Environ. Res. Lett. 10 044002) have recently analyzed biodiesel production from oil palm plantations as one possible way to mitigate climate change while providing cost effective results. They show that data for detailed quantification of biological carbon sequestration is available allowing a high confidence evaluation of positive impacts when oil palm plantation for food and biodiesel production is carried out in degraded, cultivated soil, and also with some varieties of natural vegetation in the Amazon. Nevertheless, economic risk associated with the future price of fossil fuels and uncertainties related with carbon subsidy are barriers. Here we discuss the assumptions under which such controversial proposal is based and suggest further analysis for Brazilian decision makers.

TI  - Measurement and mitigation of methane emissions from beef cattle in tropical grazing systems: a perspective from Australia and Brazil
T2  - ANIMAL
CP  - 5th Greenhouse Gases and Animal Agriculture (GGAA) Conference
AB  - The growing global demand for food of animal origin will be the incentive for countries such as Australia and Brazil to increase their beef production and international exports. This increased supply of beef is expected to occur primarily through on-farm productivity increases. The strategies for reducing resultant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions should be evaluated in the context of the production system and should encompass a broader analysis, which would include the emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon sequestration. This paper provides an insight into CH4 measurement techniques applicable to grazing environments and proposed mitigation strategies, with relevance to the production systems that are predominant in grazing systems of Australia and Brazil. Research and technology investment in both Australia and Brazil is aimed at developing measurement techniques and increasing the efficiency of cattle production by improving herd genetics, utilization of the seasonal feed-base and reducing the proportion of metabolizable energy lost as CH4. Concerted efforts in these areas can be expected to reduce the number of unproductive animals, reduce age at slaughter and inevitably reduce emission intensity (EI) from beef production systems. Improving efficiency of livestock production systems in tropical grazing systems for Australia and Brazil will be based on cultivated and existing native pastures and the use of additives and by-products from other agricultural sectors. This approach spares grain-based feed reserves typically used for human consumption, but potentially incurs a heavier EI than current intensive feeding systems. The determination of GHG emissions and the value of mitigation outcomes for entire beef production systems in the extensive grazing systems is complex and require a multidisciplinary approach. It is fortunate that governments in both Australia and Brazil are supporting ongoing research activities. Nevertheless, to achieve an outcome that feeds a growing population while reducing emissions on a global scale continues to be a monumental challenge for ruminant nutritionists.

TI  - Are national commitments to reducing emissions from forests effective? Lessons from Indonesia
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - For Indonesia to achieve its greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments, it will have to reduce emissions from deforestation, forest degradation and peatland degradation. The National Action Plan for Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reductions was Indonesia's first comprehensive plan. It reflected Indonesia's emission reduction commitments to 2020, and the first phase ran from 2010 to 2014. This research evaluates its design and implementation. It assesses seven out of thirteen actions that were implemented to reduce emissions from forestry and peatland degradation. It is shown that only two actions had a direct, evidence-based link to emission sources. Three actions had some evidence of a link, albeit dependent on many factors. For the remaining two actions, focused on emissions from agriculture in peatland, there was no information to demonstrate clear and targeted implementation of the actions. The analysis also shows that the indicators listed in the National Action Plan were insufficient to demonstrate meaningful reductions of emissions. Part of the explanation for the problematic design of the actions is that many of them were pre-existing policies, aimed at achieving a variety of different objectives that were just rebadged as climate change actions.

TI  - BIOCHAR AS SOIL CONDITIONER IN THE SUCCESSION OF UPLAND RICE AND COWPEA FERTILIZED WITH NITROGEN
T2  - REVISTA CAATINGA
AB  - The effects of biochar and nitrogen application on yields of upland rice and cowpea and on soil fertility were determined in a greenhouse in Macaiba, RN, Brazil. The trial consisted of the succession of two crops in a completely randomized design and a factorial scheme, with four replicates. Initially, four doses of biochar and four doses of nitrogen were tested for cultivation of rice. Subsequently, four doses of biochar and two doses of nitrogen were tested in half of the pots maintained for planting cowpea. Soil was sampled after rice harvest for half of the pots and at end of the trial for the remaining pots. We evaluated the following parameters: mass of hundred grains of rice, dry shoot mass, panicle number, number of filled spikelets and of empty spikelets, and grain production. Determinations for cowpea were: pod number per pot, grain number per pod, and grain production per pot. Measured soil parameters were: pH, contents of organic carbon, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, cation exchange capacity, and exchangeable sodium percentage. Biochar addition did not influence yield components of upland rice and cowpea, but resulted in increased soil N retention, which influenced rice dry shoot mass, spikelets sterility, panicle number, and grain mass. Biochar also promoted increased soil pH, potassium content, and exchangeable sodium percentage and decreased calcium and magnesium concentrations.

TI  - Development of agroforestry oil palm for peatland restoration in Jambi Province: establishing process and initial results
T2  - 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN AGROFORESTRY (ICAF): ADOPTING MODERN AGROFORESTRY TOWARD SMART SOCIAL FORESTRY PROGRAM
CP  - 3rd International Conference in Agroforestry (ICAF SEANAFE) - Adopting Modern Agroforestry Toward Smart Social Forestry Program
AB  - Rapid degradation of peatland forest in Indonesia is caused by conversion into plantation forest and agriculture land, including oil palm plantation by farmers. Restoration of peatland is then needed with involvement of local farmers as main stakeholder. This paper presents establishment process and initial result from an action research on peatland restoration using biodiversity enrichment experiment in existing oil palm smallholder plantation to develop oil palm agroforestry. The experiment was established in Sinar Wajo Village, Tanjung Jabung Timur Regency, Jambi Province in which 30 plots in sizes of 25m(2), 100 m(2), and 400 m(2) placed systematically over about 21 ha oil palm plantation belong to a group of farmers. There were 1,180 trees of 6 species, i.e. blangeran (Shorea blangeran), pinang (Areca pinanga), petai (Parkia speciosa), durian (Durio zibethinus), jengkol (Archidendron pauciflorum), and kopi liberika (Coffea liberica) with 0, 3, and 6 diversity levels, created tree island on the sea of oil palms. Approach to local leaders was very important for the initiation of the action research. Focus group discussion with farmer group, provision of seedlings and labour wages were conducted to ensure farmer willingness of participation. Capacity building, such as training on tree cultivation, bio-fertilizer production and study tour was conducted as incentive for farmers. The initial result of plant growth measurement from experiment plots showed 21 months after planting many planted trees grew well. Blangeran as native species of peatland forest showed the best growth performance. Pinang, Kopi Liberika and Durian were also showed relatively good growth performance. Only Petai and Jengkol showed less growth performance. High farmer participation on the establishment of oil palm agroforestry as peatland restoration model was mostly driven by provision of incentives. Oil palm agroforestry is a promising model for restoration of already planted by oil palm peatland area, and involving farmers is important factor for the success of peatland restoration through appropriate social approaches.

TI  - An Assessment of the Site-Specific Nutrient Management (SSNM) Strategy for Irrigated Rice in Asia
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - The site-specific nutrient management (SSNM) strategy provides guidelines for effective nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium management to help farmers make better decisions on fertilizer input and output levels in rice (Oryza sativa) production. The SSNM fertilizer recommendations are based on the yield goal approach, which has been frequently cited in empirical studies. This study evaluates the assumptions underlying the SSNM strategy for rice in the top rice-producing countries around the world, including India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. Using a generalized quadratic production function, I explore whether major nutrients are substitutes as inputs and if there are complementarities between inorganic fertilizer and soil organic matter (SOM). The results suggest the relationships among major nutrients vary across sites-some inputs are complements, some are substitutes, and some are independent. The SOM also significantly affects the nitrogen fertilizer uptake. I conclude by suggesting that the SSNM strategy can be made to be more adaptive to farmer's fields if these relationships are accounted for in the fertilizer recommendation algorithm.

TI  - Shifts in composition of avian communities related to temperate-grassland afforestation in southeastern South America
T2  - IHERINGIA SERIE ZOOLOGIA
AB  - Afforestation of temperate grasslands with fast-growing trees for industrial pulpwood production is spreading in South America. Despite high afforestation rates resulting from governmental policies that stimulate pulpwood production in grasslands of southern Brazil and Uruguay, the impact of this activity on biodiversity remains to be properly assessed. We used an Impact-Reference study design to evaluate how grassland afforestation affects the composition of grassland bird assemblages. We sampled eucalyptus plantations and neighboring natural grasslands in southern Brazil from 2006-2009, and relied on nested sampling and analysis to separate the effects of afforestation from the natural variability of grasslands. We recorded a significant difference in composition between assemblages from grasslands and tree plantations. Species adapted to open, treeless areas tended to be negatively affected in relation to edge or forest birds in eucalyptus plantations. Afforestation is systematically replacing the bird assemblage of hilltop grasslands by a collection of common edge and forest species that occur in nearby riverine and hillside forests. Although most grassland birds negatively affected by tree plantations are common and widespread, observed and predicted afforestation rates in southeastern South America may result in regional population reductions in the near future.

TI  - Short term effects in soil quality under different cover crops of no tillage vegetables organic production in fragile soils in Southeastern Brazil
T2  - ORGANIC AGRICULTURE
AB  - Regenerative agriculture practices, including crop rotation, cover crops, reduced tillage, and no-tillage, have gained recognition for mitigating soil erosion and enhancing soil quality. This study focuses on organic vegetable production in the Baixada Fluminense region of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where soils are sandy and nutrient-poor. The research aims to evaluate the impact of no-tillage systems combined with various cover crops on soil quality, particularly physical-chemical properties, soil fertility, and carbon sequestration. The experimental design included conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems, with six types of cover crops. Soil samples were collected over three years at multiple time points: before cover crop implementation, after cabbage harvest, and after scarlet eggplant harvest. Chemical analyses measured soil pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil organic carbon (SOC), and nutrient levels. Results indicated that in the short term, CT had higher averages for calcium (Ca), potassium (K), base saturation (BS), and pH, while NT showed higher values for potential acidity (H + Al) and CEC. Over time, pH, H + Al, and SOC increased significantly, suggesting improved soil conditions. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed distinct separation between CT and NT systems, with CT associated with higher pH, K, magnesium (Mg), and BS, and NT showing stronger associations with H + Al and CEC. The PCA also highlighted a positive gradient in SOC and K from year one to year three. The study underscores the benefits of no-tillage systems in enhancing soil quality and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. Despite short-term advantages in CT due to cover crop incorporation, long-term sustainability of soil quality, particularly SOC, may be better maintained in NT systems due to less soil disturbance. This research highlights the potential of no-tillage systems combined with cover crops to improve soil fertility, enhance carbon sequestration, and support sustainable agriculture.

TI  - Three Generations of Forest Peoples' Empowerment in Indonesia: Process Towards Sustainable and Equitable Forest Management
T2  - JURNAL MANAJEMEN HUTAN TROPIKA
AB  - Human activities that alter land cover have destroyed natural ecosystems and caused conflict. In Indonesia, community-based forest management (CBFM) policies implemented by the government seek to empower communities, ameliorate forest conversion, and reduce environmental conflict. This article critically assesses contemporary CBFM policy in Indonesia by analyzing its history and outcomes through policy analysis. To systematically review previous literature on CBFM, this research uses the PRISMA method. It finds that communities are often able to manage forest areas sustainably through sociocultural systems that combine management customs and culture. Empowerment through CBFM policy therefore promises to promote community subsistence, equity, and security regarding forest management. However, granting total resource rights to communities can result in land conversion unless managerial safeguards are in place. Many studies find that the clarity of land boundaries, the consistency of regulation, and the partiality of land governance drive CBFM program success. To facilitate land governance for the successful implementation of Indonesian social forestry, communities need access rights, authority to manage forests, and sufficient knowledge transfer to participate in formal forest management. In contrast to previous iterations of CBFM in Indonesia, current social forestry policy acknowledges these governance needs and seeks to implement them.

TI  - Using a Delphi approach to identify the most efficacious interventions to improve Indonesia's forest and land governance
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Improvements to forest and land governance are key to addressing deforestation and degradation of peatlands in Indonesia. While this is a priority area, the steps to achieving good forest and land governance have been under researched. There is a need for better links between theoretically informed academic analysis and work in the field. This study drew together a panel of experts on forest and land governance using a Delphi method to discuss the underlying drivers of deforestation and peatland degradation, and correspondingly, to identify interventions to improve land and forest governance in Indonesia. Seventeen panelists with an average of more than 12 years' experience reached agreement over four governance interventions: increasing the capacity of local communities to manage and monitor forests and natural resources (65% of panelist's votes); identify strengths and weaknesses of community organisations and institutions, and develop strategies to improve their performance (65% of panelist's votes); gazetting forests to clarify land boundaries and determine which areas should be village, community and state forest zone (59% of panelist's votes); and, integrating participatory community maps into spatial plans to protect local communities and indigenous peoples' development needs (53% of panelist's votes). They also supported action research involving the government, private sector and communities, and political economy approaches to researching forest and land governance issues. Panelists indicated that community level approaches such as securing community forest tenure through clarifying land claims and integrating local land tenure into spatial planning had an important role in sustainable forest management.

TI  - Building local institutions for national conservation programs: lessons for developing Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD plus ) programs
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - For programs that aim to promote forest conservation and poverty alleviation, such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), the participation of indigenous communities is essential to meet program goals. Using Ostrom's theory of collective action for common pool resource management, we evaluated the institutions governing indigenous participation in the Programa Socio Bosque incentive-based conservation program in Ecuador. We conducted structured interviews with 94 members in 4 communities to assess community institutions for 6 of Ostrom's principles, using 12 measures we developed for the principles. We found substantial variation between communities in terms of their institutional performance. The best-performing community performed well (>50% of interviewees reported successfully meeting the measure) on 8 of the 12 measures. The weakest performed well on only 2 out of 12 measures. Overall, our results indicate that there is stronger performance for constitutional-level institutions, which determine who gets to make the rules, and some collective-choice institutions, which determine how local rules are made. We identified specific challenges with the day-to-day operational institutions that arise from participation in nation state-community conservation programs, such as restricted resource appropriation, monitoring and compliance, and conflict resolution. We found that top-down policy making has an important role to play in supporting communities to establish constitutional-level and some collective-choice institutions. However, developing operational institutions may take more time and depend on local families' day-to-day use of resources, and thus may require a more nuanced policy approach. As some countries and donors find a jurisdictional REDD+ approach increasingly attractive, complementing top-down policy measures with bottom-up institutional development could provide a stronger platform to achieve the shift from current land use driving deforestation to a lower-carbon-emissions land management trajectory.

TI  - From science to practice: The AGSUS protocol for monitoring and certification of sustainable soil management and carbon sequestration
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB  - Sustainable soil management is indispensable for achieving the UN Sustainable Development goals and soil carbon sequestration for climate change mitigation has gained importance in recent years, yet there are few examples of projects carried out to this purpose, and protocols that facilitate this task. Here we present a monitoring system that relies on sampling soils in the field, as opposed to a modeling approach. The high spatial variability of SOC was addressed by requiring that the participating farms divide their land according to management zones, based on soil type, slope position and land use history, and the sampling density was established as one sampling point per one hundred hectares, while for environments smaller than 500 ha minimum of five points must be used. These points are georeferenced and will be revisited for annual monitoring of sustainable soil management, and every five years for soil sampling for SOC, texture, bulk density, pH, electric conductivity (if indicated), and available phosphorus determinations. The monitoring of sustainable soil management will be carried out through a visual evaluation of 12 soil quality parameters, as described in the handbook published by the AGSUS group. The data obtained from the visual evaluation and the soil analyses (bulk density, particle size fractions, C content, and pH) in the baseline monitoring of Argentinean and Brazilian farms during 2022 were analyzed for the relation between visual evaluation score and the means of these soil parameters. The organic matter indicator (OMI)was calculated by the formula OMI = OM/clay plus silt*100. The data base contained visual soil evaluation scores at 80 georeferenced sampling points, representing 12 farms located in different agroecological zones of the Argentinean Pampas, and 47 sampling points on two farms in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Our results showed a relationship between the VE (Visual Evaluation) score and SOC contents of the soils, especially when these were expressed in relation to their fine mineral particles as with the OMI for the soils of the Argentinean Pampa and the Brazilian Mato Grosso. The OMI showed differences between the three VE scores ranging from 4.7 to 6.7 and from 3.1 to 5.1 in the 0-0.1 m and 0.1-0.2 m depths, respectively. Relationships between the VE score and SOC, OMI, Sand, Silt and Clay plus Silt were only found for the 39 cases of VE "moderate" score in Pampas soils, whereas for the 39 cases of "good" scores no significant relations were encountered. These soils had high SOC and OMI, indicating that they are healthy soils, near saturation level, with low C sequestration potential.

TI  - Agricultural practices to improve near-surface soil health and crop yield in subtropical soils
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB  - Integrated crop and livestock systems (ICLS) have the potential to minimize soil degradation, improve soil health, and maximize food production. Our goal was to evaluate the impact of no-till (NT) in association with ICLS on soil health and soybean yield in Inceptisol and Oxisol soils in Southern Brazil. The response of physical, chemical, and biological soil health indicators to soil and crop management systems was measured over the short- (<5 years) and long-term (>10 years) under ICLS with soybean in spring/summer and forage grazed by cattle in the autumn/winter. A soil management index was calculated for each soil based on ICLS management. Independent of soil type, ICLS in association with NT for 10(+) years improved chemical and biological properties in the near soil surface (0-6 cm depth). The Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) scores for soil organic carbon (SOC), phosphorus (P), and bulk density were close to 1.0 in the Inceptisol, independent of management or soil depth, while the pH scores were lower in the ICLS topsoil. For the Oxisol, the SMAF scores for SOC and P were approximately 1.0 in the 0-6 cm depth under long-term ICLS. The SMAF overall soil quality index was high (approximately 0.9) for both soils and there were no significant differences between management practices. Overall, the adoption of ICLS in association with NT (i) improved or maintained soil health, (ii) promoted soil carbon sequestration, and (iii) increased soybean yield in the studied soils. This study confirmed the potential for conservation practices (ICLS combined with NT) to improve soil quality with environmental sustainability.

TI  - Land allocation to meet sectoral goals in Indonesia An analysis of policy coherence
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Land is a scarce resource affecting the implementation of many sectoral policies. In Indonesia, the expansion of palm oil plantations has led to non-sustainable land use practices in past years, particularly deforestation. More recently, the government has set ambitious targets for the adoption of biodiesel which will require expansion of oil palm plantations, thus putting further pressure on land. Meanwhile, the need to guarantee.food supply, forest conservation and climate change mitigation also imply challenges when it comes to land allocation and use. This paper examines the role that land plays in the implementation of sectoral policies in Indonesia, exploring the availability of land to satisfy the multiple goals defined in national policies. We explore land competition resulting from allocations made in official policy documents starting with biofuel policy. The analysis of policy goals and coherence when it comes to land allocation is made in relation to agriculture, climate and forestry policies. We conclude that adjustments need to be made in the policies to avoid overlappings and misinterpretations when it comes to land allocation. The area made available for meeting each sectoral policy goal when taking into account cross sectoral interactions is: 14.2 Mha for agriculture, 43 Mha for climate mitigation measures, 9.2 Mha for forestry, and 20.9 Mha for biofuels. A more uniform land classification and development of a common reference database will increase transparency on land allocation and use, and help to monitor land use change, ultimately supporting the achievement of multiple national goals.

TI  - Sustainability Assessment of Araucaria Forest Remnants in Southern Brazil: Insights from Traditional Forest Inventory Surveys
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Precise estimates of dendrometric and morphometric variables are indispensable for effective forest resource conservation and sustainable utilization. This study focuses on modeling the relationships between shape (morphometric), dimension (dendrometric) and density (N) to assess the sustainability of forest resources. It sheds light on the current state of site characteristics, reproduction, and the structure of Araucaria angustifolia trees at selected forest remnants across multiple sites in Santa Catarina, Southern Brazil. Individual trees and their dendrometric variables, such as the diameter at breast height (d), height (h), crown base height (cbh), annual periodic increment (API) in growth rings, and morphometric variables, including four radii of the crown in cardinal directions, were evaluated. These measurements allowed us to calculate various morphometric indices and crown efficiency, enabling the assessment of both vertical and horizontal structural conditions. Statistical analysis confirmed a positive relationship of the crown volume (cv) and crown surface area (csa) with the crown length (cl). Conversely, the crown efficiency, density, increment rate, and reproductive structure production declined. These morphometric relationships emphasize the complex dynamics within these forest ecosystems, irrespective of the chosen site, indicating that horizontal and vertical forest structures have stagnated and have been characterized by limited change in the last ten years. Such results raise concerns about sustainability, highlighting the need for proper conservation measures and sustainable forest management practices. Our findings underscore the need for substantial adjustments in the structure and dynamics of the forest, particularly on selected rural properties where this tree species is abundant, to ensure long-term sustainability.

TI  - Conservation of species-rich subtropical grasslands: traditional management vs. legal conservation requirements in primary and secondary grasslands
T2  - ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA
AB  - Land-use change is the main cause of biodiversity losses, and for grasslands includes changes in management. The last 10 years has seen afforestation of traditionally grazed grasslands increase considerably in the understudied Serra do Sudeste region of the Brazilian Pampa, turning the region into a mosaic of tree plantations, natural ecosystems (partly in conservation areas without grazing management) and other land uses. We evaluated grassland plant community structure and composition in conservation areas considering two distinct types of land-use history and compared them to grasslands under traditional management. The study was carried out at 58 sites. Per site, three plots were established to sample the plant composition of the herbaceous and shrub layers. We used ordination techniques and indicator species analysis to describe patterns of community composition. We recorded a total of 516 species, thus confirming the high biodiversity of the region. We detected differences in vegetation structure and composition between primary and secondary grasslands. Our study emphasizes the need to increase conservation efforts in the region and points out that current conservation approaches should be evaluated critically regarding their effects for biodiversity conservation and that adequate grazing management is key for grassland biodiversity conservation.

TI  - IMPACT OF CONVERTING AREAS CULTIVATED WITH SUGARCANE TO EUCALYPT PLANTATIONS ON SOIL QUALITY IN NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
AB  - Reforestation is considered an effective method to improve soil quality and drain atmospheric CO2 by sequestering carbon, in both soil and vegetation. In this regard, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of converting areas cultivated with sugarcane to eucalypt plantations (Eucalyptus spp.) on soil quality and carbon sequestration in a Latossolo (Ferralsol) in the Atlantic Forest region of the Alagoas state, Brazil, through multivariate analysis. The systems under evaluation consisted of four areas: one area cultivated with sugarcane for approximately 20 years, taken as the reference area of this study, and the other three adjacent areas cultivated with eucalypt at 1 (E1), 3 (E3) and 6 (E6) years of age, previously cultivated with sugarcane. Physical (bulk density - BD, Mean weight-diameter - MWD, geometric mean diameter - GMD and aggregate stability index - ASI), chemical (soil organic carbon - SOC, total nitrogen - TN, labile carbon - LC and recalcitrant carbon - RC) and biological (Microbial biomass carbon - MBC, soil carbon respiration - C-CO2 and metabolic quotient - qCO(2)) properties of soil were evaluated. Data were collected, standardized and submitted to exploratory analysis with principal components. The results show that SOC, LC, TN, GMD, MWD and ASI increased, while BD showed a reduction in E3 and E6 systems. The conversion of sugarcane cultivation with burning of straw and manual harvest into eucalypt plantations was efficient at promoting SOC sequestration and improving physical, chemical and biological properties of soil.

TI  - LOCAL ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE AND IT'S BENEFIT TO CONSERVATION PROGRAMS IN INDONESIA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - Conservation efforts in Indonesia in the last decade have been using many strategies to integrate Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK). Recognition of the role of local communities and indigenous peoples is part of efforts to mitigate climate change and the current biodiversity crisis. The mapping of the contribution of local ecological knowledge in forest management approaches for biodiversity conservation is very important. This study aims to describes the contribution of local ecological knowledge (LEK) adaptation in conservation programs in Indonesia. This research method uses a qualitative approach with an ethnoecological strategy. The research locations were in three local communities in Indonesia, namely: the Nusa Lembongan community in Bali, the Tobelo community in ecological knowledge contributes to resilience in the face of climate change, and how indigenous peoples ensure harmony between social capital, the forest environment, and forest use can be of particular concern to face the challenge of achieving zero hunger. This is related to forest ecosystems managed by indigenous peoples showing better results in sustainability based on environmental and social sustainability principles. This study shows that forest management processes based on local ecological knowledge (LEK) can be an alternative approach to biodiversity conservation. Local ecological knowledge shows an emphasis on the ongoing process of experience-based knowledge in communities that utilize the environment. The contribution of studies on LEK adaptation as dynamic knowledge can be used as a more flexible conservation approach and evaluation of forest conservation programs in Indonesia in relating to ecosystem adaptation. The finding of this study was important to LEK integration into the conservation program so it will become more adaptive and flexible to the changes. Understanding the dynamic characterization of LEK has benefit to conservation program that is based on community and participatory.

TI  - Characterization of microstructural stability of biochar-amended Planosol under conventional tillage for irrigated lowland rice ecosystem
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB  - Soil structural degradation through compression from machine and animal traffic affects soil functioning and threatens environmental sustainability. However, the structural stability of the soil against the external stresses can be enhanced through the addition of organic substances. The study aimed to investigate the efficacy of biochar addition on the microstructural stability of a Gleyic Luvic Planosol under yearly conventional tillage of rice-fallow-rice lowland ecosystem in southern Brazil. Organic amendment consisted of four levels of rice husk biochar rates namely 0 % (Bio0), 2 % (Bio2), 5 % (Bio5) and 10 % (Bio10) by dry mass, corresponding to 0, 20, 50, and 100 g biochar/kg soil. As organic matter is known to closely interact with density, we decided further to investigate the impact of varying density, namely 1.15, 1.33, 1.45, 1.60, and 1.75 g/cm3. Biochar-incubated soil samples were subjected to four levels of matric potentials (0, -3, -6, and -10 kPa). The microstructural stability parameters of strain (gamma), shear resistance (tau), storage and loss moduli (G', G"), and coefficient of structural rigidity (Iz) of the amended soil samples were evaluated using the amplitude sweep test in a rheometer. Increasing biochar rate significantly (p < 0.05) increased the soil organic matter and, consequently, the water retention capacity of the biochar-amended Planosol. The stabilizing effect of biochar addition was reflected in higher microstructural stability of the amended soil compared to the control (no biochar). Increasing density in the biochar-amended Planosol increased the shear resistance, reduced the strain at linear viscoelasticity and yield point, and decreased the stiffness degradation. Increased strength and quantity of the menisci are the driving forces for the improved microstructural stability of the Planosol and at the nucleus of environmentally sustainable application. This is important when considering potential carbon sequestration and storage effects of biochars.

TI  - Soil organic carbon in an integrated crop-livestock system under different grazing intensities
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS AGRARIAS-AGRARIA
AB  - An integrated crop-livestock system (ICLS) under no-till may be an effective tool to promote soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation. However, it is not yet clear how pasture management affects SOC accumulation. In this study, we assessed the effect of grazing intensity (10, 20, 30, and 40 cm of sward height and no grazing) on SOC and coefficients of soil organic matter dynamics and used them in a simulation of SOC sequestration in a 0-20 cm soil layer. The overall study was conducted on a subtropical rhodic hapludox from southern Brazil managed as a no-till integrated soybean-beef cattle system for 13 yr. SOC sequestration rates ranged from 0.097 Mg ha(-1 )yr(-1) with a pasture sward height of 10 cm to 0.308 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) with one of 40 cm. Simulations revealed a higher potential of the soil for C sequestration with a moderate (30 cm) or low (40 cm) grazing intensity. Although the ICLS under no-till led to a positive carbon balance irrespective of grazing intensity, the simulation of temporal evolution of SOC stocks over time revealed a higher potential for SOC accumulation with the less intensive grazing treatments than with the more intensive ones.

TI  - Impact of Community Forest Management on Biomass Carbon Stocks in the Uatuma Sustainable Development Reserve, Amazonas, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
AB  - Forest management can result in net losses of carbon stock. To quantify the impact of the management it is important to assess losses or gains of carbon, as well as the sustainability of the management system. This study quantified the impact management under a Small-Scale Sustainable Forest Management Plan, which is a recently created category of authorized management for small managers in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. Impact was quantified on the number of individuals, the biomass of natural regeneration, and the damage to the remaining trees 2 months after logging. The impact of these changes on carbon stock was estimated. The study was carried out in the Uatuma Sustainable Development Reserve, Amazonas, Brazil, where two areas of small-scale forest management and one control were evaluated. Average total carbon stock previous to logging was estimated at 161.25 +/- 9.66 MgC ha(-1). Two months after logging, reductions were found of 3% in one managed area (MA1) and 8.3% in the other (MA3), including the carbon stock from the harvested timber. For each harvested tree, the logging caused damage to 12 trees in MA1 and four trees in MA3. The reductions in carbon stock and number of trees damaged per harvested tree were less than the reductions found for higher impact forest management and other experiences in community forest management. No significant alteration was found in the carbon stock of natural regeneration. However, there was an increase in the number of individuals, both in the logged areas and in their respective control areas.

TI  - Impacts of rattan cane harvesting on vegetation structure and tree diversity of Conservation Forest in Buton, Indonesia
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Lambusango Forest, Buton, Indonesia, is an example of the potential for conflict between forest conservation and long standing local extraction of Non-timber Forest Products (NTFPs), in this case rattan cane harvesting. This paper investigates the impacts of rattan harvesting on tree and understorey vegetation structure, species richness and diversity. Tree and understorey vegetation characteristics and soil and topographic variables were recorded in forest plots. Interviews with rattan harvesters recorded information on harvesting techniques and locations. The relationships between tree and understorey vegetation characteristics and soils, topography and rattan harvesting techniques were assessed with the multivariate ordination technique of Redundancy Analysis (RDA). Analysis of the relationships with rattan harvesting proximity and forest designation zone used Multivariate Analyses of Covariance (MANCOVA). Tree species richness and diversity are primarily affected by slope gradient and altitude, while tree size is affected mainly by soil chemical factors. Only a small part of the variation in tree structure measures can be attributed to the impacts of rattan cane harvesting. Stronger adverse effects on understorey vegetation density, including tree saplings and seedlings, were found. This is thought to be a case of rattan harvesting exacerbating the effects of competition between rattan plants and other understorey vegetation. Longer term monitoring of forest characteristics could provide stronger understanding of the impacts. However, rattan harvesting appears to have little effect on forest structure and diversity in Lambusango Forest, suggesting that relatively small scale NTFP extraction does not necessarily conflict with forest conservation.

TI  - Linking physical quality and CO2 emissions under long-term no-till and conventional-till in a subtropical soil in Brazil
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - The decomposition rate of soil organic matter (SOM) is affected by soil management practices and particularly by the physical and hydraulic attributes of the soil. Previous studies have indicated that the SOM decomposition is influenced by the Least Limiting Water Range (LLWR). Therefore, the objective of this study was to relate the C-CO2 emissions to the LLWR of the surficial layer of soil under two management systems: no-tillage (NT), conducted for 20 years, and conventional tillage (CT). Soil in NT presented greater soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks than in CT. Emissions of C-CO2 were greater in the NT than in the CT, because of the greater carbon stocks in the soil surface layer and the greater biological activity (due to the improvement of the soil structure) in NT as compared to CT. The use of LLWR associated with the measurement of C-CO2 emissions from the soil could help to predict the efficacy of the adopted management system for trapping carbon in the soil.

TI  - Multi-year double cropping biochar field trials in Nepal: Finding the optimal biochar dose through agronomic trials and cost-benefit analysis
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Poor water and nutrient retention are the major soil fertility limitations in the low productivity agricultural soils of Nepal. The addition of biochar to these soils is one way these hindrances can be overcome. In the present study, six different biochar doses (control, 5 t ha(-1), 10 t ha(-1), 15 t ha(-1), 25 t ha(-1) and 40 t ha(-1)) were applied to amoderately acidic silty loam soil from Rasuwa, Nepal and the effects on soil physicochemical properties and maize and mustard yield over three years (i.e., six cropping seasons), were investigated. Biochar addition did not show significant effects on maize and mustard grain yield in the first year, however significant positive effects (p < 0.01) were observed during the second and third years. During the second year, maize grain yield significantly increased by 50%, 47% and 93% and mustard grain yield by 96%, 128% and 134% at 15 t ha(-1), 25 t ha(-1) and 40 t ha-1 of biochar respectively. A similar significant increase in yield of both crops was observed in the third year. Yields for both maize and mustard correlated significantly (p < 0.001) with plant available P, K+, pH, total OC%, CEC, base saturation, and increased as a function of biochar addition.
   On the basis of the measured crop yields for the various biochar doses, a cost-benefit analysis was carried out, and gross margin was calculated to optimize biochar dose for local farming practice. Total costs included financial cost (farm input, labor and biochar production cost), health cost and methane emission cost during biochar production. Health costs were a minor factor (< 2% of total biochar preparation cost), whereas methane emission costs were significant (up to 30% of biochar cost, depending on the C price). Total income comprised sale of crops and carbon sequestration credits. The cost-benefit analysis showed that the optimal biochar application dose was 15 t ha(-1) for all C price scenarios, increasing gross margin by 21% and 53%, respectively, for 0 and 42 US$ per ton CO2 price scenarios. In the current situation, only the 0 US$ price scenario is realistic for rural farmers in Nepal, but this still gives benefits of biochar amendment, which are capped at a 15 t ha(-1) biochar addition.

TI  - Climate mitigation by dairy intensification depends on intensive use of spared grassland
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Milk and beef production cause 9% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Previous life cycle assessment (LCA) studies have shown that dairy intensification reduces the carbon footprint of milk by increasing animal productivity and feed conversion efficiency. None of these studies simultaneously evaluated indirect GHG effects incurred via teleconnections with expansion of feed crop production and replacement suckler-beef production. We applied consequential LCA to incorporate these effects into GHG mitigation calculations for intensification scenarios among grazing-based dairy farms in an industrialized country (UK), in which milk production shifts from average to intensive farm typologies, involving higher milk yields per cow and more maize and concentrate feed in cattle diets. Attributional LCA indicated a reduction of up to 0.10 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) milk following intensification, reflecting improved feed conversion efficiency. However, consequential LCA indicated that land use change associated with increased demand for maize and concentrate feed, plus additional suckler-beef production to replace reduced dairy-beef output, significantly increased GHG emissions following intensification. International displacement of replacement suckler-beef production to the "global beef frontier" in Brazil resulted in small GHG savings for the UK GHG inventory, but contributed to a net increase in international GHG emissions equivalent to 0.63 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) milk. Use of spared dairy grassland for intensive beef production can lead to net GHG mitigation by replacing extensive beef production, enabling afforestation on larger areas of lower quality grassland, or by avoiding expansion of international (Brazilian) beef production. We recommend that LCA boundaries are expanded when evaluating livestock intensification pathways, to avoid potentially misleading conclusions being drawn from "snapshot" carbon footprints. We conclude that dairy intensification in industrialized countries can lead to significant international carbon leakage, and only achieves GHG mitigation when spared dairy grassland is used to intensify beef production, freeing up larger areas for afforestation.

TI  - Effects of grazing regimes on the temporal dynamics of grassland communities
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
AB  - Questions Grazing management influences grassland community dynamics, but few studies exist on the effects of specific management regimes in subtropical grasslands. Here, we ask how rotational and continuous grazing influences the composition, diversity, and biomass production of natural grasslands in southern Brazil. Location The study was conducted at four cattle farms within the south Brazilian grassland region (Campos Sulinos), in the upper area of the Camaqua river basin of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Methods On each farm, grassland that had previously been subjected to continuous grazing (freely grazed by cattle) was divided into two experimental units; one managed by rotational grazing and the other maintained under continuous grazing. In each experimental unit, 14 permanent plots were monitored over six years for species composition and species biomass. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models to evaluate the effects of grazing management strategies on composition dissimilarity, diversity indices, and plant biomass. Results Grasslands under a rotational grazing regime changed steadily over the period of evaluation. Total biomass and species distribution patterns greatly differed from those in plots subjected to continuous grazing, leading to changes in species richness, dominance, and composition, as well as to an increase in overall plant biomass. Conclusions Community changes during the six-year study period as a consequence of the distinct grazing treatments were evident. Grasslands under rotational grazing management benefitted from less selective grazing, enabling a more uniform growth of species within the communities, which in turn were richer at the end of the six-year experiment. In contrast, the proportion of grazing-resistant species or less-consumed species was higher under continuous grazing, where foraging by cattle appears to be more selective. Rotational grazing thus not only leads to higher species richness and diversity, but also to higher primary and, in consequence, secondary productivity.

TI  - New perspectives in fire management in South American savannas: The importance of intercultural governance
T2  - AMBIO
AB  - Wildfires continue to cause damage to property, livelihoods and environments around the world. Acknowledging that dealing with wildfires has to go beyond fire-fighting, governments in countries with fire-prone ecosystems have begun to recognize the multiple perspectives of landscape burning and the need to engage with local communities and their practices. In this perspective, we outline the experiences of Brazil and Venezuela, two countries where fire management has been highly contested, but where there have been recent advances in fire management approaches. Success of these new initiatives have been measured by the reduction in wildfire extent through prescribed burning, and the opening of a dialogue on fire management between government agencies and local communities. Yet, it is clear that further developments in community participation need to take place in order to avoid the appropriation of local knowledge systems by institutions, and to better reflect more equitable fire governance.

TI  - In the Shadow of Trees: Does Eucalyptus Afforestation Reduce Herpetofaunal Diversity in Southern Brazil?
T2  - SOUTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY
AB  - Tree cultivation is widely stimulated due to the provision of environmental services by sequestering atmospheric carbon, but forestry is a potential danger to biodiversity, mainly when cultivation replaces originally non-forested landscapes. Due to the rapid expansion of afforestation in grassland ecosystems, we used environmental descriptors and structure of amphibian and reptile communities as a tool to assess the possible effects of forestry on wildlife. We used pitfall traps with drift fences in Eucalyptus afforestation and native grasslands of the Pampa biome from southern Brazil. Amphibians and reptile species richness was lower in afforestation than in native grasslands. Furthermore, the reptile community found in afforestation was a poor subset of the community recorded in native grasslands. Indeed, the structure of communities for both amphibians and reptiles in afforestation was highly dissimilar from the native grasslands, with major environmental descriptors that influenced this difference being related to the structure of undergrowth vegetation, incident light, and sodium concentration in soil. Amphibians and reptiles proved to be an efficient tool to assess the potential impacts effects of afforestation/forestation since the replacement of natural grassland ecosystems by eucalypt afforestation caused detectable negative effects on the diversity of herpetofauna. Biodiversity conservation strategies in non-forest ecosystems are urgently needed and should encompass policies to restrict the expansion of forestry on the remaining native grasslands.

TI  - Combined effect of intercropping and minimum tillage on soil carbon sequestration and organic matter pools in the semiarid region of Brazil
T2  - SOIL RESEARCH
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effect of two intercropping systems and minimum soil tillage in the semiarid region of Brazil on soil organic carbon (SOC) and pools of soil organic matter (SOM), compared with the native vegetation (NV). The first intercropping was cultivated with beans, sesame and pigeon pea, whereas the second was cultivated with cotton, maize, beans, sesame and pigeon pea. Two areas under NV, adjacent to the crop areas, were also sampled. Soil sampling were collected from 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30 and 30-50 cm layers in three plots per area to characterise the SOM (SOC, soil nitrogen, humic substances, microbial biomass, and mineralisable carbon). Our results demonstrated that, when compared with the NV, intercropping systems conducted with minimum soil tillage were effective in maintaining and sometimes increasing the levels and stocks of SOC and some SOM fractions such as microbial C and humic substances, and therefore, these systems can be an alternative form of sustainable soil management in the semiarid region of Brazil.

TI  - Identifying relevant international forest regimes for South Korea based on their issues
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
AB  - South Korea has focused on bilateral agreements to supply timber since the 1990s which requires cooperation with forest-related international organisations. This study analysed the relationship between South Korean and international forest regimes by identifying the issues these regimes face and analysing South Korea's contribution to these regimes. The study used data from an in-depth content analysis of key policy documents between South Korea and each of the regimes. The results confirm six forest-related international issues: Sustainable Forest Management, Sustainable Development Goals, forest land degradation and desertification, climate change, illegal logging, forest biodiversity, and species conservation. South Korea contributed to these regimes through cooperative initiatives and projects. This contribution, furthermore, directs other countries' participation to confront the issues. Most of the international forest-related issues in South Korea are derived from external elements such as international agreements or governances. South Korea also uses international regimes to encourage national goals.

TI  - Industry-driven mitigation measures can reduce GHG emissions of palm oil
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Tropical peatland stores a large amount of carbon. In the last 20 years, drainage of Asian peat soil has increased to satisfy the demand of land for plantation agricultures. Industrial oil palm plantations occupy large areas of peatland in Indonesia and Malaysia, with associated GHG emissions and biodiversity loss, here referred to as nature occupation impact. This study performs a detailed Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of 1 kg of palm oil for two case studies: PT SMART's Hanau and Sungai Rungau facilities in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. The objective is to quantify the reduction in GHG emissions and nature occupation that has been achieved by implementing the following industry-driven measures: reducing the area of cultivated peat soil, reducing the peat drainage depth, and setting aside part of the land-bank for nature conservation. The results show that 1 kg of palm oil causes 2.72 and 2.25 kg CO2-eq./kg palm oil from Hanau and Sungai Rungau facilities respectively. These are 20%-34% lower than average RSPO certified palm oil and 49%-58% lower than average non-certified palm oil. Sungai Rungau achieves the reduction mainly due to a completely peat soil-free supply base. Hanau's peat emissions are instead 0.28 kg, compared to the 0.77 and 2.36 kg CO2-eq for RSPO certified and non-certified palm oil respectively, due to a very low drainage depth (18-25 cm compared to 57-73 cm in average of RSPO certified and non-certified respectively) and an overall lower share of oil palms on peat land. The impact on nature occupation is 24%-43% lower in Hanau and Sungai Rungau compared to non-certified oil and 4%-29% lower compared to RPSO certified respectively. About 8% of the total land bank of the Hanau supply-base has been set aside for nature conservation, reducing GHG emissions by 2% and nature occupation by 9%. Both Hanau and Sungai Rungau could also significantly reduce GHG emissions in the palm oil milling stage, by implementing biogas capture in palm oil mill effluent (POME) treatment.

TI  - COST ESTIMATES FOR MITIGATION OF CO2 EMISSIONS OF TRANSPORTATION OF PARAIBA THROUGH REFORESTATION
T2  - NATIVA
AB  - Scientific evidences indicate that the atmospheric CO(2)concentrations are approximately 16% above of the levels entered in 1990. Ambient questions associates to the emissions of the pollutants proceeding from fossil fuels present global problems, such as, toxicity of air and the gases of effect greenhouse (GHG). To lessen its effects were created mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through carbon markets. The carbon sequestration with plantation of forests promotes the absorption of great amounts of carbonic gas (CO2) presents in the atmosphere. This natural process helps considerably to diminish the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and each hectare of forest in development is capable to absorb of 150 the 200 tons of carbon. Scientific research has proven that great part of the global heating is of anthropogenic origin and; therefore, the proper action human being can and must intervene in the direction to reduce the emissions and to mitigate the emissions not prevented. The present work has for objectives to esteem the areas of necessary reforestations for the effective mitigation of the carbonic gas emissions (CO2) of the sector of road transport of the Paraiba State, Brazil, as well as to evaluate the costs for ton of CO2 sequestered in function of the forest essences and the costs to reforest one hectare. The best ones resulted had been gotten with commercial hybrid Eucalyptus urograndis, the results for the average of the experimental hybrids in the Chapada do Araripe, Pernambuco State, Brazil had been a little inferior, but both had been very superior to the gotten ones with Mimosa tenuiflora planted in the Chapada do Apodi, Ceara State. Such commentaries if apply for the estimates of areas and costs for ton of CO2 sequestered (mitigated).

TI  - Promoting Sustainable Agriculture, Boosting Productivity, and Enhancing Climate Mitigation and Adaptation Through the RIO RURAL Program, Brazil
T2  - STRATEGIES AND TOOLS FOR A SUSTAINABLE RURAL RIO DE JANEIRO
AB  - The Brazilian agricultural sector is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, but climate-smart practices combined with degraded land restoration can result in a more resilient landscape contributing to integrated climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. The Sustainable Rural Development Program of Rio de Janeiro (RIO RURAL) has been supporting the transition of degraded rural areas to sustainable productive systems by providing technical assistance and incentives to small-scale family farmers. RIO RURAL promotes reforestation and sustainable agriculture practices, which can boost productivity as well as carbon stocks in the agricultural landscape. Using estimates of carbon mitigation potential for such practices, we identified methodologies eligible for certification in the voluntary markets. We estimated transaction, implementation, and certification costs and calculated potential revenues associated with RIO RURAL's activities. This did not only allow us to discuss the constraints and identify opportunities and co-benefits from RIO RURAL's contribution to climate mitigation, adaptation, and environmental integrity but also to food security as it targets family farms. We propose a bundling approach to carbon, where multiple benefits are measured and certified including water, food systems, as well as social and cultural benefits. This would allow accessing resources from both mitigation and adaptation programs in addition to markets that value ecosystem integrity as well as water and food security.

TI  - Contribution of tillage systems and crop succession to soil structuring
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB  - The use of conservational systems of soil cultivation has gained importance due to the need for soil preservation and carbon sequestration from the atmosphere. With the objective of evaluating soil structuring, this study determined the physical attributes and organic carbon contents of a clayey Oxisol in an area of 10 years under four different land uses: i.e., afforestation (AF), no-tillage system with grass-grass succession (corn/corn), no tillage systems with grass-legume succession (corn/Crotalaria juncea L.) and conventional soil tillage system (corn/fallow). The evaluated areas are located in the Cerrado biome of southeastern Brazil. Each area was sampled at 20 points and undisturbed and disturbed samples were collected in the layers of 0.00-0.10 m, 0.10-0.20 m and 0.20-0.30 m. The attributes evaluated were related to soil aggregation and porosity and, due to the structure of dependence of the variables, the data were subjected to multivariate factor analysis. We observed that, after a long period, the no-tillage system promoted soil aggregation and porosity similar to those of the planted forest and superior to those of the conventional tillage system. The type of crop succession in the no-tillage system caused differences in soil structure, and grass-grass succession (corn/corn) promoted better soil structure compared to grass-legume succession (corn/Crotalaria juncea L.). The greater soil porosity generated by the conventional tillage system was limited to the most superficial layer (0.00-0.10 m) and this effect can be considered ephemeral, due to the presence of a large amount of smaller aggregates that, after the operation, can occupy the generated pores.

TI  - POTENTIAL OF SOIL CARBON SEQUESTRATION IN DIFFERENT BIOMES OF BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
AB  - Soil is an important pool for C stocks and plays a fundamental role in greenhouse gas emissions and consequently in climatic changes. Land use change can cause either a negative or a positive effect in terms of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. However, the intensification of global warming has been confirmed, related mainly to the increase of greenhouse gas emissions from burning of fossil fuel, deforestation, and adoption of inadequate agricultural land management practices. An inadequate soil use does not only contribute to intensified greenhouse effects but also creates problems related to soil sustainability due to the degradation of soil organic matter, which negatively reflects on soil physical and chemical attributes, as well as on. its biodiversity. On the other hand, best management practices that maintain or even increase soil organic matter contents can minimize the effects of global warming. Examples of such management practices are no-tillage, rehabilitation of degraded pasture, reforestation of marginal lands and elimination of the burning activity among others. The aim of this review was to evaluate some of the main greenhouse gas sources related to agriculture and land use change, to present strategies to mitigate these emissions and to increase C sequestration in the soil-plant system, in. three of the main biomes of Brazil.

TI  - A paradigm shift to CO2 sequestration to manage global warming - With the emphasis on developing countries
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Global land use changes that tend to satisfy the food needs of augmenting population is provoking agricultural soils to act as a carbon (C) source rather than sink. Agricultural management practices are crucial to offset the anthropogenic C emission; hence, Carbon sequestration (CS) in agriculture is a viable option for reversing this cycle, but it is based on hypotheses that must be questioned in order to contribute to the development of new agricultural techniques. This review summarizes a global perspective focusing on 5 developing countries (DC) (Bangladesh, Brazil, Argentina, Nigeria and Mexico) because of their importance on global C budget and on the agricultural sector as well as the impact produced by several global practices such as tillage, agroforestry systems, silvopasture, 4p1000 on CO2 sequestration. We also discussed about global policies regarding CS and tools available to measure CS. We found that among all practices agroforestry deemed to be the most promising approach and conversion from pasture to agroforestry will be favorable to both farmers and in changing climate, (e.g., agroforestry systems can generate 725 Euroeq C credit in EU) while some strategies (e.g. no-tillage) supposed to be less promising and over-hyped. In terms of conservative tillage (no-, reduced-, and minimal tillage systems), global and DCs land use increased. However, the impact of no-tillage is ambiguous since the beneficial impact is only limited to top soil (0-10 cm) as opposed to conventional mechanisms. Grasses, cereals and cover crops have higher potential of CS in their soils. While the 4p1000 initiative appears to be successful in certain areas, further research is needed to validate this possible mode of CS. Furthermore, for effective policy design and implementation to obtain more SOC stock, we strongly emphasize to include farmers globally as they are the one and only sustainable driver, hence, government and associated authorities should take initiatives (e.g., stimulus incentives, C credits) to form C market and promote C plantings. Otherwise, policy failure may occur. Moreover, to determine the true effect of these activities or regulations on CS, we must concurrently analyze SOC stock adjustments using models or direct measurements. Above all, SOC is the founding block of sustainable agriculture and inextricably linked with food security. Climate-smart managing of agriculture is very crucial for a massive SOC stock globally especially in DCs. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Past fire practices and new steps towards an effective fire management approach in the Brazilian savannas
T2  - ADVANCES IN FOREST FIRE RESEARCH 2018
CP  - 8th International Conference on Forest Fire Research
AB  - Every year, widespread and severe fires cause loss of biodiversity and changes in the structure and functioning of savanna ecosystems. Currently, the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) is threatened by the absence of a consistent fire policy. Most protected areas in Brazil still apply total fire suppression policies, instead of a more integrated fire management approach. Faced with the challenge of reconciling biodiversity conservation goals with rural livelihoods, scientists, policymakers and managers around the world have discussed potential solutions for managing fire in protected areas aimed at the sustainability of these ecosystems. Based on international experiences, an Integrated Fire Management Pilot Program was recently implemented in three Brazilian protected areas, while an adaptive and integrated approach has progressively raised the interest of other park managers. Initially, goals and actions have focused on protecting fire-sensitive vegetation and reducing the extent of areas burned, particularly at the end of the dry season. To achieve this, managers are making use of patch mosaic burning techniques to create mosaics of burnt and unburnt areas that purportedly decrease the probability of large wildfires and hence increase fire interval in fire-sensitive areas. However, despite advances in fire management policies in Brazilian savannas, an adaptive approach requires a continuous assessment of managed ecosystems, through which managers and ecologists can obtain knowledge about the responses of species and natural communities. Without a clear definition of appropriate ecological parameters, it is not possible to be sure if management actions or fire regime thresholds are actually delivering benefits for sustainable long-term biodiversity conservation. In this study, we use the example of the Canastra National Park (CNP) - Southeastern Brazil, to illustrate how widely employed suppression policies can result in inappropriate fire regimes and how these results have encouraged current changes in fire management perspectives.

TI  - Land cover distribution in the peatlands of Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo in 2015 with changes since 1990
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Insular Southeast Asian peatlands have experienced rapid land cover changes over the past decades inducing a variety of environmental effects ranging from regional consequences on peatland ecology, biodiversity and hydrology to globally significant carbon emissions. In this paper we present the land cover and industrial plantation distribution in the peatlands of Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo in 2015 and analyse their changes since 1990. We create the 2015 maps by visual interpretation of 30 m resolution Landsat data and combine them with fully comparable and completed land cover maps of 1990 and 2007 (Miettinen and Liew, 2010). Our results reveal continued peatland deforestation and conversion into managed land cover types. In 2015, 29% (4.6 Mha) of the peatlands in the study area remain covered by peat swamp forest (vs. 41% or 6.4 Mha in 2007 and 76% or 11.9 Mha in 1990). Managed land cover types (industrial plantations and smallholder dominated areas) cover 50% (7.8 Mha) of all peatlands (vs. 33% 5.2 Mha in 2007 and 11% 1.7 Mha in 1990). Industrial plantations have nearly doubled their extent since 2007 (2.3 Mha; 15%) and cover 4.3 Mha (27%) of peatlands in 2015. The majority of these are oil palm plantations (73%; 3.1 Mha) while nearly all of the rest (26%; 1.1 Mha) are pulp wood plantations. We hope that the maps presented in this paper will enable improved evaluation of the magnitude of various regional to global level environmental effects of peatland conversion and that they will help decision makers to define sustainable peatland management policies for insular Southeast Asian peatlands.

TI  - Fuel load mapping in the Brazilian Cerrado in support of integrated fire management
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The Brazilian Cerrado is considered to be the most species-rich savannah region in the world, covering 2 million km(2). Uncontrolled late season fires promote deforestation, produce greenhouse gases (similar to 25% of Brazil's land-use related CO2 emissions between 2003 and 2005) and are a major threat to the conservation of biodiversity in protected areas. Governmental institutions therefore implemented early dry season (EDS) prescribed burnings as part of integrated fire management (IFM) in protected areas of the Cerrado, with the aim to reduce the area and severity of late dry season (LDS) fires. The planning and implementation of EDS prescribed burning is supported by satellite-based geo-information on fuel conditions, derived from Landsat 8 and Sentinel -2 data. The Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering algorithm was used to analyse the data, and the relationship between the resulting matched fractions (dry vegetation, green vegetation and soil) and in situ surface fuel samples was assessed. The linear regression of in situ data versus matched filter scores (MF scores) of dry vegetation showed an r(2) of 0.81 (RMSE = 0.15) and in situ data versus MF scores of soil showed an r(2) of 0.65 (RMSE = 0.38). To predict quantitative fuel load, a multiple linear regression analysis was carried out with MF scores of NPV and soil as predictors (adjusted r(2) = 0.86; p < 0.001; standard error = 0.075). The fuel load maps were additionally evaluated by fire managers while planning EDS prescribed burning campaigns. The fuel load mapping approach has proven to be an effective tool for integrated fire management by improving the planning and implementation of prescribed burning, promoting pyrodiversity, prioritising fire suppression and evaluating fire management efforts to meet overall conservations goals. National and state level authorities have successfully institutionalized the approach and it was incorporated into IFM policies in Brazil.

TI  - Machine Learning Model Reveals Land Use and Climate's Role in Caatinga Wildfires: Present and Future Scenarios
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
AB  - Wildfires significantly impact ecosystems, economies, and biodiversity, particularly in fire-prone regions like the Caatinga biome in Northeastern Brazil. This study integrates machine learning with climate and land use data to model current and future fire dynamics in the Caatinga. Using MaxEnt, fire probability maps were generated based on historical fire scars from Landsat imagery and environmental predictors, including bioclimatic variables and human influences. Future projections under SSP1-2.6 (low-emission) and SSP5-8.5 (high-emission) scenarios were also analyzed. The baseline model achieved an AUC of 0.825, indicating a strong predictive performance. Key drivers of fire risk included the mean temperature of the driest quarter (with an importance of 14.1%) and isothermality (12.5%). Temperature-related factors were more influential than precipitation, which played a secondary role in shaping fire dynamics. Anthropogenic factors, such as proximity to farming and urban areas, also contributed to fire susceptibility. Under the optimistic scenario, low-fire-probability areas expanded to 29.129 Mha, suggesting a reduced fire risk with climate mitigation. However, high-risk zones persisted in the Western Caatinga. The pessimistic scenario projected an alarming expansion of very-high-risk areas to 12.448 Mha, emphasizing the vulnerability of the region under severe climate conditions. These findings underline the importance of temperature dynamics and human activities in shaping fire regimes. Future research should incorporate additional variables, such as vegetation recovery and socio-economic factors, to refine predictions. This study provides critical insights for targeted fire management and land use planning, promoting the sustainable conservation of the Caatinga under changing climatic conditions.

TI  - Biochars Originating from Different Biomass and Pyrolysis Process Reveal to Have Different Microbial Characterization: Implications for Practice
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Sustainable technologies are increasingly promoted in various production areas. Protection of natural resources, as well as rational waste management, may lead to better optimization of technologies. Biochar, a product of pyrolysis of organic residues has found wide applications in waste management, agriculture, energy and construction industry. In the present study biochar samples produced in Poland and in Brazil were analysed for microbial content using three substrates: Plate Count Agar, Malt Agar, and Potato Agar. Both qualitative and quantitative measurements were done. Microscopic analysis of the biochar structure was also performed. We found that microbial cultures in both biochars represented a wide range of biodiversity of microorganisms genera and species. We demonstrate that the biochar samples differ depending on the botanical origin as well as on the production technology. Structure of the tested samples also varied depending on the botanical origin. Sample 1-PL (pine) was characterised by a compact and regular structure, while sample 2-PL (oak) showed porous and irregular structure. Sample from Brazil (1-BR) showed a more delicate structure than Polish biochars. Obtained properties may suggest a range of implications for practice.

TI  - Let the Women Harvest the Mangrove. Carbon Policy, and Environmental Injustice
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Carbon policy is a fascinating topic in geography and political ecology, because carbon is a new exchangeable good, which links the local to the international arenas through a complex set of instruments, norms, and institutions. In this paper, after explaining my theoretical and conceptual framework rooted in Africanist geography and currents of political ecology, I analyze the responses of local actors (knowledge, practices, logic, and strategies) to environmental policies and consider the effects of new mechanisms, upon local dynamics in Africa. I focus my attention on the impacts of mangrove reforestation policies on women, who harvest shellfish. My research, conducted over 35 years on coastal mangroves in Africa and Madagascar, provides me with examples. Through a long-term approach to the perception of mangroves and the changing modes of policies, I highlight the weight of imperialism and neo-liberalism and analyze types of environmental injustice against mangrove harvesters, particularly the women, who are the most directly concerned by the preservation of their heritage and are rarely recognized as stakeholders in environmental policies that are defined internationally and implemented at national and local levels. They are not informed (or are deliberately kept unware) of new devices such as REDD+. They have lost their rights of access to the reforested mangrove areas. Carbon policy requires comparative and empirical research, giving voice to local actors, especially women, about their perceptions of policies and actions. The approaches in terms of political ecology must be combined with analysis of the bio-ecological and socio-cultural dynamics of the mangrove.

TI  - An evaluation of contemporary savanna fire regimes in the Canastra National Park, Brazil: Outcomes of fire suppression policies
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Fire has shaped plant evolution and biogeochemical cycles for millions of years in savanna ecosystems, but changes in natural fire regimes promoted by human land use threaten contemporary conservation efforts. In protected areas in the Brazilian savannas (Cerrado), the predominant management policy is fire suppression, reflecting a cultural heritage which considers that fire always has a negative impact on biodiversity. Here we compare resultant fire-regimes in Canastra National Park (CNP), southeast Brazil, associated with areas under and without fire suppression management, based on a 16-year Landsat imagery record. In open grasslands of the Canastra plateau (CP), firefighting is undertaken under government-sanctioned regulation, whereas in the Babilonia sector, non-sanctioned fire management is undertaken by small farmers to promote cattle grazing and cropping. Fire regimes in the Canastra sector are characterized by few, very large, late dry season wildfires recurring at intervals of two years. Fire regimes in lowlands of the Babilonia sector are characterized by many small-scale, starting at the beginning of the dry season (EDS). In Babilonia uplands fire regimes are characterized by higher frequencies of large fires. The study illustrates major challenges for managing fire-prone areas in conflict-of interest regions. We suggest that management planning in CNP needs to effectively address: i) managing conflicts between CNP managers and local communities; and ii) fire management practices in order to achieve more ecologically sustainable fire regimes. The study has broader implications for conservation management in fire-prone savannas in South America generally. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - CO2 exchanges and evapotranspiration of a grazed pasture under tropical climate conditions
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - Studies concerning the role of livestock farming on the regional budget of CO2 in Northeast of Brazil are scarce. Thus, our main objective was to evaluate the variability of CO2 exchange and evapotranspiration (ET) of a cultivated tropical forage C4 grass (Brachiaria brizantha) grazed by sheep for meat production. The experiment was conducted during the period from 2015-oct-01 to 2017-sep-30 using an eddy covariance flux tower. The pasture acted as a moderate CO2 sink, with mean annual net ecosystem exchange of -215 +/- 22 g C m(-2)y(-1), while the average uncertainty associated with the calculation procedure was 15 g C m(-2) +/- 7.20% of NEP. The mean annual ET was 967 +/- 245 mm. Carbon use efficiency at the ecosystem level was 0.20 +/- 0.03, which is more efficient compared to similar experiments in grazed environments around the world. Water use efficiency at the ecosystem level was 1.14 +/- 0.01 g C (kg H2O)(-1).

TI  - A Quantitative Baseline of Ants and Orchid Bees in Human-Modified Amazonian Landscapes in Paragominas, Para, Brazil
T2  - SOCIOBIOLOGY
AB  - The lack of effective biodiversity baselines is a major impairment to implement conservation plans. Hence, constructing and updating species lists provides vital information about species distribution records. The Sustainable Amazon Network (in Portuguese Rede Amazonia Sustentavel; RAS) is an interdisciplinary research initiative that aims to evaluate land-cover changes effects in eastern Brazilian Amazonia. Within the scope of this project, we sampled ants and orchid bees and herein present a list of species collected in Paragominas, PA, Brazil; the most complete lists of species published to date of these groups for the eastern Amazon. We sampled these insects across several land-cover types, from undisturbed forested habitats, through varyingly disturbed forested habitats and secondary forests to production areas (silviculture, pastures and arable fields). In total we recorded 285 species of ants and 36 species of orchid bees. Species richness was higher in primary forests for both groups, followed by production areas. Orchid bees reached their highest richness in secondary forests. For orchid bees, production areas were dominated by a few hyper-dominant species, such as Eulaema nigrita. For future assessments if the aim is to make a complete inventory, we recommend the use of additional sampling methods. Finally, we expect this study can be used as a baseline for understanding the effectiveness of ongoing changes in forest conservation and land management practices and in determining conservation status for several taxa described here.

TI  - Large-scale pasture restoration may not be the best option to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Cattle ranching accounts for 44% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the land use sector in Brazil. In response, Brazil has proposed a massive pasture restoration program that aspires to make ranching more competitive while at the same time reducing associated GHG emissions. Pasture restoration, however, is only one of several intensification options that could be employed to achieve these goals. Here we analyze potential production, economic return and GHG emissions from an intensification strategy based mainly on pasture restoration and compare its productive, economic and GHG emissions performances with intensification options more focused on supplemental feeding (grain-feed supplementation of grazing animals and animal finishing in feedlots). To this end, we developed a multi-sectoral, deterministic simulation model of the ranching system and applied it to Mato Grosso state, the largest producer and earliest adopter of intensive production. To account for GHG emissions, we performed a life cycle analysis of a complete beef production cycle. Our results show that an intensification strategy focused more heavily on pasture restoration does reduce GHG emissions but produces the least favorable economic and GHG emissions outcomes when compared with a range of supplemental feeding alternatives. In view of these results, Brazil should seek a more diversified strategies for cattle intensification in its climate mitigation policy.

TI  - Long-term ecological research in southern Brazil grasslands: Effects of grazing exclusion and deferred grazing on plant and arthropod communities
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Grazing exclusion may lead to biodiversity loss and homogenization of naturally heterogeneous and species-rich grassland ecosystems, and these effects may cascade to higher trophic levels and ecosystem properties. Although grazing exclusion has been studied elsewhere, the consequences of alleviating the disturbance regime in grassland ecosystems remain unclear. In this paper, we present results of the first five years of an experiment in native grasslands of southern Brazil. Using a randomized block experimental design, we examined the effects of three grazing treatments on plant and arthropod communities: (i) deferred grazing (i.e., intermittent grazing), (ii) grazing exclusion and (iii) a control under traditional continuous grazing, which were applied to 70 x 70 m experimental plots, in six regionally distributed blocks. We evaluated plant community responses regarding taxonomic and functional diversity (life-forms) in separate spatial components: alpha (1 x 1 m subplots), beta, and gamma (70 x 70 m plots), as well as the cascading effects on arthropod high-taxa. By estimating effect sizes (treatments vs. control) by bootstrap resampling, both deferred grazing and grazing exclusion mostly increased vegetation height, plant biomass and standing dead biomass. The effect of grazing exclusion on plant taxonomic diversity was negative. Conversely, deferred grazing increased plant taxonomic diversity, but both treatments reduced plant functional diversity. Reduced grazing pressure in both treatments promoted the break of dominance by prostrate species, followed by fast homogenization of vegetation structure towards dominance of ligneous and erect species. These changes in the plant community led to increases in high-taxa richness and abundance of vegetation-dwelling arthropod groups under both treatments, but had no detectable effects on epigeic arthropods. Our results indicate that decision-making regarding the conservation of southern Brazil grasslands should include both intensive and alleviated levels of grazing management, but not complete grazing exclusion, to maximize conservation results when considering plant and arthropod communities.

TI  - Mapping aboveground biomass in Indonesian lowland forests using GEDI and hierarchical models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Spaceborne lidar (light detection and ranging) instruments such as the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) provide a unique opportunity for global forest inventory by generating broad-scale measurements sensitive to the vertical arrangement of plant matter as a supplement to in situ measurements. Lidar measurables are not directly relatable to most physical attributes of interest, including biomass, and therefore must be related through statistical models. Further, GEDI observations are not spatially complete, necessitating methods to convert the incomplete samples to predictions of area averages/totals. Such methods can face challenges in equatorial and persistently cloudy areas, such as Indonesia, where the density of quality observations is diminished. We developed and implemented a hierarchical model to produce gap-free maps of aboveground biomass density (AGBD) at various resolutions within the lowlands of Jambi province, Indonesia. A biomass model was trained between local field plots and a metric from GEDI waveforms simulated with coincident airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. After selecting a locally suitable ground-finding algorithm setting, we trained an error model depicting the discrepancies between the simulated and GEDI-observed waveforms. Finally, a geostatistical model was used to model the spatial distribution of the on-orbit GEDI observations. These three models were nested into a single hierarchical model, relating the spatial distribution of GEDI observations to field-measured AGBD. The model allows spatially complete predictions at arbitrary resolutions while accounting for uncertainties at each stage of the relationship. The model uncertainties were low relative to the predicted biomass, with a median relative standard deviation of 8% at the 1 km resolution and 26% at the 100 m resolution. The spatially consistent information on AGBD provided by our model is beneficial in support of sustainable forest management, carbon sequestration initiatives and the mitigation of climate change. This is particularly relevant in a dynamic tropical landscape like Jambi, Indonesia in order to understand the impacts of land-use transformations from forests to cash crops like oil palm and rubber. More generally, we advocate for the use of hierarchical models as a framework to account for multiple stages of relationships between field and sensor data and to provide reliable uncertainty audits for final predictions.

TI  - Carbon dioxide emissions from forestry and peat land using land-use/land-cover changes in North Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - FRIENDLY CITY 4 FROM RESEARCH TO IMPLEMENTATION FOR BETTER SUSTAINABILITY
CP  - 4th International Conference on Friendly City - From Research to Implementation For Better Sustainability
AB  - Forestry and peat land including land-based is one of the critical sectors in the inventory of CO2 emissions and mitigation efforts of climate change. The present study analyzed the land-use and land-cover changes between 2006 and 2012 in North Sumatra, Indonesia with emphasis to CO2 emissions. The land-use/land-cover consists of twenty-one classes. Redd Abacus software version 1.1.7 was used to measure carbon emission source as well as the predicted (2)carbon dioxide emissions from 2006-2024. Results showed that historical emission (2006-2012) in this province, significant increases in the intensive land use namely dry land agriculture (109.65%), paddy field (16.23%) and estate plantation (15.11%). On the other hand, land-cover for forest decreased significantly: secondary dry land forest (7.60%), secondary mangrove forest (9.03%), secondary swamp forest (33.98%), and the largest one in the mixed dry land agriculture (79.96%). The results indicated that North Sumatra province is still a CO2 emitter, and the most important driver of emissions mostly derived from agricultural lands that contributed (2)carbon dioxide emissions by 48.8%, changing from forest areas into degraded lands (classified as barren land and shrub) shared 30.6% and estate plantation of 22.4%. Mitigation actions to reduce carbon emissions was proposed such as strengthening the forest land, rehabilitation of degraded area, development and plantation forest, forest protection and forest fire control, and reforestation and conservation activity. These mitigation actions have been simulated to reduce 15% for forestry and 18% for peat land, respectively. This data is likely to contribute to the low emission development in North Sumatra.

TI  - Long-term effects of tillage systems on liming efficiency, soil chemical properties and wheat yield in Southern Brazil
T2  - SOIL RESEARCH
AB  - Context Sustainable management of the soil is one of the pillars of conservation agriculture (CA). Aims The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term effects of soil management systems (SMS) on liming efficiency, soil chemical properties and wheat yield. Methods This study was part of a long-term experiment established in 1986 in Passo Fundo, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, but using data from 2008 to 2015 to explore the effects of agricultural lime applied in 2008. The experiment was laid out in a split-plot design where the main plot (SMS) were arranged in randomised blocks and the cropping systems (sub-plot treatments) were randomised within the main plots. This study assessed the effects of the SMS; i.e. two CA systems [no-tillage (NT) and reduced tillage] and two conventional tillage (CT) systems (disk ploughing + disk harrowing annually, and mouldboard ploughing + disk harrowing annually). Key results The NT system was the most sustainable due to improvements in soil organic carbon concentration. After liming, CT systems were more effective than CA systems in decreasing Al3+ toxicity and increasing soil pH and Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations at deeper soil layers. The NT system had a considerable advantage over other SMS, due to a greater average wheat yield (18%). Conclusions The SMS evaluated in this study modified chemical properties when compared with the native forest area. The NT system was the least detrimental to soil organic carbon, an important indicator of soil quality. Implications The NT system provided greater average wheat yield (18%), and thus was the most viable SMS for subtropical spring wheat production.

TI  - Stocks and fractions of organic carbon in an Oxisol under different management systems
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
AB  - The objective of this work was to determine the effects of soil management systems on the stocks and fractions of organic carbon of an Oxisol (Xantic Ferralsol), in the cerrado of the state of Piaui, Brazil. The following systems were evaluated: a three-year-old conventional tillage; a three- and a five-year-old no-tillage system, using millet as cover crop; and a nine-year-old no-tillage, using millet as cover crop for seven and forage (Urochloa brizantha) for two years. A native cerrado area was used as a reference. Soil samples were collected in the wet and dry seasons from 0.00-0.05, 0.05-0.10, 0.10-0.20, and 0.20-0.40 m depths for determining: total organic carbon and nitrogen contents and stocks; humic substances content; and humification index. The highest carbon contents were observed in the soil under cerrado, at 0.00-0.05 m depth, in both seasons. However, the highest stocks of carbon and nitrogen as well as the highest contents of humic substances were verified in the soil with no-tillage system for five and nine years, in both seasons, at all evaluated depths. The highest humification index was also observed in these soils, in the dry season. No-tillage associated with cover crops decreases soil organic matter mineralization, increases soil carbon stocks in depth, and favors carbon sequestration in cerrado areas of Piaui state.

TI  - Savannas after afforestation: Assessment of herbaceous community responses to wildfire versus native tree planting
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Afforestation and fire exclusion are pervasive threats to tropical savannas. In Brazil, laws limiting prescribed burning hinder the study of fire in the restoration of Cerrado plant communities. We took advantage of a 2017 wildfire to evaluate the potential for tree cutting and fire to promote the passive restoration of savanna herbaceous plant communities after destruction by exotic tree plantations. We sampled a burned pine plantation (Burned Plantation); a former plantation that was harvested and burned (Harvested & Burned); an unburned former plantation that was harvested, planted with native trees, and treated with herbicide to control invasive grasses (Native Tree Planting); and two old-growth savannas which served as reference communities. Our results confirm that herbaceous plant communities on post-afforestation sites are very different from old-growth savannas. Among post-afforestation sites, Harvested & Burned herbaceous communities were modestly more similar in composition to old-growth savannas, had slightly higher richness of savanna plants (3.8 species per 50-m(2)), and supported the greatest cover of native herbaceous plants (56%). These positive trends in herbaceous community recovery would be missed in assessments of tree cover: whereas canopy cover in the Harvested & Burned site was 6% (less than typical of savannas of the Cerrado), the Burned Plantation and Native Tree Planting supported 34% and 19% cover, respectively. By focusing on savanna herbaceous plants, these results highlight that tree cutting and fire, not simply tree planting and fire exclusion, should receive greater attention in efforts to restore savannas of the Cerrado.

TI  - CO2 REMOVAL ASSOCIATED TO THE DYNAMICS OF LAND COVER IN THE IGUASSU RIVER WATERSHED, BRAZIL, DURING 2000-2010
T2  - INTERCIENCIA
AB  - This work was conducted in the Iguassu River watershed, within the limits of the state of Parana, Brazil, in order to assess the dynamics of the forest cover and carbon stocks in that basin, between the years 2000 and 2010, estimating the variation of the quantity of carbon stored in forest vegetation in this period. The cover mapping was carried out by means of Landsat 5 satellite images from a TM sensor. Processes of segmentation were used for the generation of vectors with homogeneous characteristics and classification was made through visual interpretation. Two classes of successional stage of secondary vegetation: initial and intermediate/advanced were considered, as well as a reforestation class. The quantification of carbon stocks was made by the indirect method, applying reference values from the literature. There was an increase around 22.93% of forest cover in the basin throughout the period of 10 years. Similary, there was an increase in biomass production and carbon sequestration, of 135.58 Tg of biomass (32.81% of the, original), thus accomplishing the fixation of 206.81 Tg of carbon equivalent. It is concluded that the native forest is mostly responsible for carbon storage in the basin, with similar to 93.53% of the total carbon stored in 2010. Thus, the vegetation of the basin is contributing positively to the reduction of CO2 concentration of in the atmosphere, and consequently of the negative effects from the greenhouse effect.

TI  - Transaction and abatement costs of carbon-sink projects in developing countries
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - Projects in the forestry sector, and land-use change and forestry projects more generally, have the potential to help mitigate global warming by acting as sinks for greenhouse gasses, particularly CO(2). However, concerns have been expressed that participation in carbon-sink projects may be constrained by high costs. This problem may be particularly severe for projects involving smallholders in developing countries. Of particular concern are the transaction costs incurred in developing projects, measuring, certifying, and selling the carbon-sequestration services generated by such projects. This paper addresses these issues by reviewing the implications of transaction and abatement costs in carbon-sequestration projects. An approach to estimating abatement costs is demonstrated through four case studies of agroforestry systems located in Sumatra, Indonesia. A typology of transaction costs is presented and related to existing pilot projects. The paper concludes with recommendations to reduce the disadvantages that smallholders may face in capturing the opportunities offered by carbon markets.

TI  - Methane and nitrous oxide fluxes from clonal eucalyptus forests in different spacing arrangements
T2  - FORESTRY
AB  - Although Eucalyptus is the most commonly cultivated genus in Brazil, more information is needed on how these forests can act as a sink for greenhouse gases. This study assessed the potential greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation of eucalyptus forests by quantifying both the seasonal rates of exchange of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases at the soil-atmosphere interface and their relationships with soil variables (moisture, temperature and physicochemical attributes). Soil organic carbon sequestration rate was used together with soil GHG emission to estimate net global warming potential. This study was conducted at an experimental forestry station in the south-central region of the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. No differences were found between treatments in the seasonal fluxes of N2O and CH4, which may have resulted from similar soil properties, particularly bulk density and nitrate (NO3-) contents. CH4 flux dynamics were mainly controlled by the concentrations of ammonium (NH4+) in the soil. In all treatments, the soil acted as a continuous sink for CH4, absorbing it at an average rate of -65 mu g C m(-2) h(-1), which was higher than the results of other studies conducted in native areas of the Cerrado biome and planted forests. However, although CH4 removal helped offset greenhouse gas emissions, net emissions were seen in most treatments due to N2O emissions in greater magnitude and soil carbon losses.

TI  - APSIM-Tropical Pasture: A model for simulating perennial tropical grass growth and its parameterisation for palisade grass (Brachiaria brizantha)
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Tropical grasses are used as forage, to produce energy from biomass, for land restoration and carbon sequestration, among other applications. Many modelling approaches have been employed to simulate tropical grasses growth, but these have several limitations that must be solved by adapting them or creating new models. This study aimed to develop a tropical pasture model in the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) modelling framework, and to parameterise it to simulate Brachiaria brizantha 'BRS Piata' growth, under grazing and cut-and-carry management. For this, three field experiments were conducted in the South-east of Brazil where pasture growth was measured in a cut-and-carry system, with irrigated and rainfed treatments, and in a rainfed grazing system. Model evaluation was performed through precision and accuracy indices and simulation errors. Under cut-and-carry management, forage productivity was estimated with R-2 values from 0.89 to 0.94, Willmott agreement indices between 0.97 and 0.98, and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values of 0.88 to up to 0.92. This demonstrates the capacity of the APSIM-Tropical Pasture model to simulate tropical pastures. Simulation of phenology, early growth after sowing, partitioning and senescence during flowering, and reallocation and retranslocation of plant dry matter and nitrogen were important aspects for this capacity. Then, APSIM-Tropical Pasture can be used to simulate tropical pastures, but several requirements for further improvements have been identified, such as to improve the simulations of flowering for palisade grass, N effects on pasture yield, reallocation and retranslocation processes. Under grazing management, forage productivity was estimated with R-2 = 0.80, Willmott agreement index of 0.91, and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency value of 0.62. Despite these reasonable results, simulations presented problems, since does not take into account the effect of grazing animals on pastures. This indicates that, in its current form, APSIM-Tropical Pasture is not able to simulate pastures under grazing effectively. However, this simulation of grazed system was important to identify main modelling constraints and direct future research to improve knowledge of processes and interactions needed for pasture model development.

TI  - Fine root production and decomposition of integrated plants under intensified farming systems in Brazil
T2  - RHIZOSPHERE
AB  - To ensure food security, foster agri-environmental sustainability, and prevent agricultural expansion into preserved areas, it is imperative to intensify plus diversify agriculture within integrated farming systems in the coming decades. Maximizing productivity and carbon sequestration through such systems demands understanding below-ground interactions and further research into plant root dynamics, which have often been neglected or overlooked. This study examined the effects of integrated farming systems, specifically crop-livestock and crop-livestock-forestry, on fine-root dynamics of crops and pastures (i.e., herbaceous plants). Using an extensive grazing pasture as a control, and intensification through crop-livestock and crop-livestock-forestry, we aimed to evaluate if integrated systems (i) enhance herbaceous root growth and necromass addition, and (ii) accelerate root turnover. We also investigated whether multiple linear regression modeling could predict root production and decomposition using the edaphoclimatic variables monitored in the areas. Herbaceous fine-root dynamics were observed over two years using the minirhizotron technique. Installation involved five 70 cm-deep acrylic tubes in extensive grazing and crop-livestock and fifteen in crop-livestock-forestry (1.9, 4.3, and 7.5m tree inter-row distances). In integrated systems, annual corn cropping was succeeded by grazing on a palisadegrass pasture. The trial measured eight additional soil and climatic parameters for a regression model using a stepwise selection procedure, including average soil temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, available soil water, soil bulk density, soil pH, available soil phosphorus, the sum of soil bases, and cation exchange capacity. Extensive grazing accumulated 124.8 m m(-2) of roots, constituting 48% of crop-livestock (259.7 m m(-2)) and 66% of crop-livestock-forestry (189.5 m m(-2)). Root growth near Eucalyptus trees was reduced by 51% compared to crop-livestock. Root turnover followed the order of extensive grazing < crop-livestock < crop-livestock-forestry. The peak daily root productivity was from 31 to 80 days of the crop cycle when corn was intercropped with palisade grass in the integrated systems. Multiple regression models were superior for predicting root decomposition, reaching adjusted R-2 values of 0.81 and 0.71 for crop and pasture cycles, but were ineffective for root growth (R-2 < 0.25). Therefore, additional parameters are needed to fit the root growth accurately. We conclude that integrated farming enhances fine-root production and root necromass accrual, accelerating root cycling compared to extensive pasture. However, as introducing Eucalyptus in crop-livestock impairs herbaceous root development near trees, we recommend adjusting tree density and inter-row spaces to alleviate these adverse effects, especially for annual crop cultivations.

TI  - The pitfalls and potential of debt-for-nature swaps: A US-Indonesian case study
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - The vital role of forests in limiting the likelihood of dangerous climate change has precipitated renewed interest in debt-for-nature swaps. This article uses evidence on past debt-for-nature deals and similar debt mechanisms to assess a recent second wave of such swaps. It outlines five typical shortcomings of this form of financial transaction: that they often fail to deliver additional resources to the debtor country and/or debtor government budget; often fail to deliver more resources for conservation/climate purposes; often have a negligible effect on overall debt burdens (and, as such, do not generate more 'indirect' benefits); and are often in conflict with principles of alignment with government policy and alignment with government systems (these two last shortcomings being important elements within the new aid delivery paradigm). Our analysis is applied to a recent debt-for-nature swap between the United States and Indonesia. We show that this case, which we consider a litmus test for current swap practice, performs unevenly across the five shortcomings. First, although the US-Indonesian swap does increase available resources to Indonesia at the country level, it does not generate extra budgetary room for the Indonesian government. Second, the extent to which the resources provided by the swap are additional to other donor support and reserved domestic budget lines for conservation goals is unclear. Third, the swap is too insignificant to create indirect (positive) economic effects. Regarding alignment issues, fourth, the swap is very much in line with current national policy, but, fifth, appears at odds with the new aid delivery paradigm's insistence on system alignment. We argue that if a second generation of debt-for-nature swaps is to be pursued then they need to avoid the common pitfalls associated with this form of finance. Moreover, there is a need to debate broader ways of linking debt service repayments to climate mitigation and adaptation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sustainable Harvesting of Cinnamomum burmannii (Nees & T. Nees) Blume in Kerinci Regency, Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Cinnamomum burmannii (Nees & T. Nees) Blume is an endemic tree of up to 20 meters tall that grows in the surrounding forest in the Kerinci regency. Cinnamon is one of the most valuable non-timber forest products (NTFP) harvested from Kerinci. The tree is classified as an NTFP based on criteria set out by a regulation of the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry in 2007. As a result, it must be harvested sustainably. Its massive cultivation has caused deforestation in several areas in Kerinci. The objective of this paper is to assess the environmental impacts of continuous C. burmannii harvesting of the bark by clearcutting the whole tree. Intensive clearcutting, slash, and burn posed a significant threat for (wildlife) biodiversity in the habitat of C. burmannii. The study was performed in collaboration with the Institute for Agricultural Technology of Jambi (BPTP) from October 2018-January 2019. A harvester group in Lempur Mudik village was surveyed through a semi-structured questionnaire, focus group discussions, interviews and direct observations on C. burmannii production methods and their impact on forest conservation. We discuss how young farmers can contribute to forest conservation through sustainable harvesting of cinnamon. We conclude by suggesting leverages for forest conservation and by proposing actions from the local and national governments that should be urgently taken to safeguard wildlife biodiversity in the surrounding forest.

TI  - Soil organic carbon sequestration under Araucaria angustifolia plantations but not under exotic tree species on a mountain range
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
AB  - Plantation forests can be efficient C sinks in biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC), but the latter depends on many factors, including climate. Tropical humid, mountain areas have cooler temperatures, slowing microbial decomposition, and thus can store considerable SOC. However, the effects of forest plantations on SOC of these montane areas are still poorly studied. Here, we aimed to assess changes in SOC, and related soil properties, after conversion of native rainforest to plantations of five tree species, with rotation cycles varying from 7 to 30 years, on the Mantiqueira Range, Minas Gerais, Brazil. We measured SOC contents and stocks (0.00-0.40 m layer) under a native montane rainforest (control) and plantations of Eucalyptus, Pinus, Cunninghamia, Cupressus and Araucaria, all planted in 3 x 3 m spacing, at an altitude of ca. 1,300 m, marked by humid and cool climate, where SOC contents are naturally high. Soil organic carbon varied from 55 g kg(-1) under Eucalyptus to 105 g kg(-1) under Araucaria (0.00-0.05 m layer), decreasing in depth (0.20-0.40 m) to the still high values of 20-40 g kg(-1). Soil organic carbon stocks for the top 0.20 m were also high, reaching ca. 140 Mg ha(-1) under Araucaria, significantly higher value than the native forest (ca. 90 Mg ha(-1), p<0.05), which did not differ from the other species. Soil organic carbon stocks were not affected in the 0.20-0.40 m soil layer, whereas soil structure patterns changed under some species, without however resulting in bulk density changes, and pH decreased under Araucaria. Such data showed large SOC stocks under montane native forests can not only be preserved upon conversion to forest plantations, but considerable SOC sequestration can be achieved in 30-years rotation cycles plantations of indigenous Araucaria angustifolia, marked by more open canopies and greater understory biomass.

TI  - Do subtropical grasslands recover spontaneously after afforestation?
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY
AB  - Aims South American Pampa grasslands are habitats of great conservation interest, with a distinct and rich flora, but have been intensely converted to other land uses, including tree plantations. While necessity for restoration grows, no information on restoration potential of grasslands after afforestation exists. Here, we aim at analyzing composition and structure of grassland vegetation with a history of eucalyptus plantations in order to assess recovery potential of these areas. We hypothesized that areas with history of eucalyptus would differ from reference grasslands with no history of land-use change in terms of floristic and functional composition and would present lower species richness.
   Methods Our study region comprised four sites in the southeastern part of the Pampa biome, in the coastal plain in the extreme south of Brazil, always with sites with long (50 years) history of eucalyptus plantation and reference grassland. We sampled vegetation at post-eucalyptus sites (with and without resprouting) 10 years after clearclutting and in natural grasslands. We analyzed data by analysis of variance and ordination techniques, considering compositional parameters and life forms, and indicator species analysis.
   Important Findings Species richness and vegetation cover were higher in reference grassland than in resprout areas but did not differ from post-eucalyptus areas. Exotic species cover was significantly higher in areas with afforestation history. In terms of total composition, natural grasslands differed significantly from areas with past plantation use. Indicator species analyses revealed considerable differences between grassland types. In conclusion, vegetation development led to grassland communities that are still quite distinct from reference sites. Likely, the specificity of grassland management has a high importance in defining vegetation trajectories in time and importance for grassland recovery, and restoration needs to be addressed in more studies.

TI  - CARBON AND NITROGEN STOCK IN SOIL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IN THE COASTAL TABLELANDS OF PARAIBA STATE, BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA CAATINGA
AB  - The replacement of the natural systems by sugar cane leads to fundamental alterations in soil carbon and nitrogen stocks and consequently in the global cycle of these elements. This study was conducted in the municipality of Capim, Paraiba State, and the objective was to evaluate carbon and nitrogen stocks in soils of a natural forest in comparison to sugar cane with and without vinasse. The studied soil was a Dystrophic Gray Argisol. The soil samplings were performed in five replicates (five profiles) at the depths of 0-5, 5-10, 10-20 e 20-40 cm. The systems were selected namely, native forest; sugar cane with vinasse and cane sugar without vinasse. The carbon and nitrogen contents and stocks decrease after the change of native forest to plant sugar cane. In general, there is not significant difference in the carbon and nitrogen contents and stocks between the environments of cane sugar. The systems of cane sugar with and without vinasse are functioning as C -CO2 emitter when compared with the native forest.

TI  - Effects of defoliation frequencies on above- and belowground biodiversity and ecosystem processes in subtropical grasslands of southern Brazil
T2  - PEDOBIOLOGIA
AB  - The links between vegetation and soil biota are responsible for a variety of ecosystem processes and services that can be affected by grazing. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of grazing frequency in natural grasslands' biodiversity (plant and collembola communities) and on ecosystem processes (decomposition and biomass accumulation). For so, we carried out a clipping experiment over a natural area of subtropical grassland in southern Brazil. The plots were submitted during three years to three different clipping frequencies (high, intermediate, and low) to simulate defoliation caused by grazing. We found the highest aboveground biomass accumulation and detritivore activity in the low defoliation frequency, which also promoted the dominance of tussocks. The synergies between higher vegetation height and biomass tend to provide microclimatic conditions that favors decomposition, which releases nutrients to plants, promoting their growth. The defoliation frequencies applied in this study were not sufficient to provide effects on plant community, since its co-evolutionary history with grazing. The Collembola community was not affected by defoliation. It seems to be more influenced by other factors associated with grazing.

TI  - Water budget fluxes in catchments under grassland and Eucalyptus plantations of different ages
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB  - Planted forests are increasing in area worldwide in recent decades and play an important role in carbon sequestration programs. However, the effects of plantations on water resources are largely unknown. Here, we investigate the effects of Eucalyptus sp. plantations on water budget fluxes in the southern Brazilian grasslands biome. We evaluated green (canopy interception and evapotranspiration) and blue (discharge) water flows in three watersheds: two watersheds predominantly covered with eucalyptus, either in the first years after planting or at the end of the rotation, and one watershed with livestock-grazing grassland. We used field measurements of rainfall, streamflow, and throughfall and estimated canopy interception and evapotranspiration by water balance. Water flows in the monitored watersheds with eucalyptus plantations were influenced by forest developmental stage. Annual canopy interception and transpiration were always higher in the watersheds with eucalyptus than in the one with grassland, except for the transpiration in the first year after plantation in the watershed with young eucalyptus. An increase in evapotranspiration (green water flow) and the consequent decrease in streamflow (blue water flow) should be considered in local water resource management. Studies of catchment hydrology and forest management for improved water use efficiency and streamflow regulation are needed, particularly in understudied regions.

TI  - Different-aged Pinus afforestation does not support typical Atlantic Forest fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The Atlantic Forest of the southern Brazilian highlands is a biocultural mosaic of Araucaria Forest and grasslands. Despite adverse impacts on biodiversity, extensive areas are being afforested with non-native pine (Pinus spp.), triggering forest succession on areas that were previously native grasslands. The long-term effects of afforestation with these non-native trees for biodiversity conservation are still unknown. Here, we assess this issue by comparing the fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages in young (20 year) and old (70 year) pine plots with nearby native Araucaria Forest. Abundance and richness of butterflies were positively correlated with temperature and mean humidity only in the native forest. Abiotic conditions differed between vegetation types: there was more sunlight, and was warmer and drier in the pine afforestation plots than in the Araucaria Forest. Butterfly species composition was similar between young and old pine plots, but distinct from the native Araucaria Forest. Butterfly species abundances in native forests were more evenly distributed than in afforestation sites. In these pine sites, assemblages were dominated by small, grass-feeding satyrines, whereas old pine sites had more liana feeding biblidines, and the Araucaria Forest had more large-sized bamboo-feeding species. Our results indicate that even after 70 years of succession a non-native pine afforestation cannot support a butterfly assemblage as that found in the neighboring preserved forest. Moreover, threatened grassland specialist species have been locally extinct after only 20 years of pine afforestation. The evidence gathered here points against the use of silviculture with non-native trees in these biocultural mosaic landscapes.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration Potential of Agroforestry Systems in Degraded Landscapes in West Java, Indonesia
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - When restoring degraded landscapes, approaches capable of striking a balance between improving environmental services and enhancing human wellbeing need to be considered. Agroforestry is an important option for restoring degraded land and associated ecosystem functions. Using survey, key informant interview and rapid carbon stock appraisal (RaCSA) methods, this study was conducted in five districts in West Java province to examine potential carbon stock in agroforestry systems practiced by smallholder farmers on degraded landscapes. Six agroforestry systems with differing carbon stocks were identified: gmelina (Gmelina arborea Roxb.) + cardamom (Amomum compactum); manglid (Magnolia champaca (L.) Baill. ex Pierre) + cardamom; caddam (Neolamarckiacadamba (Roxb.) Bosser) + cardamom; caddam + elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach.); mixed-tree + fishpond; and mixed-tree lots. Compared to other systems, mixed-tree lots had the highest carbon stock at 108.9 Mg ha(-1). Carbon stock variations related to species density and diversity. Farmers from research sites said these systems also prevent soil erosion and help to restore degraded land. Farmers' adoption of agroforestry can be enhanced by the implementation of supportive policies and measures, backed by scientific research.

TI  - Striking the balance: Fiqh Bi'ah and Productive Waqf Forests (PWFs) for sustainable forest management in Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - PurposeThis study aims to address the challenge of balancing economic development with environmental protection in the context of productive waqf forests (PWFs). The inherent tension between forest productivity and protection necessitates a model that ensures sustainable utilization. This research proposes a novel framework by integrating fiqh bi'ah (Islamic environmental jurisprudence) with a model for PWFs development. Design/methodology/approachUsing a qualitative approach, the analytical network process (ANP) analyzes data gathered through a literature review of Islamic environmental jurisprudence (fiqh bi'ah) on environment and waqf, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with academics, practitioners and regulators in fiqh bi'ah and waqf forest management. FindingsThree potential PWFs development models emerge from the fiqh bi'ah literature; Harim (maintaining the natural forest state for intangible benefits like oxygen and biodiversity), Hima (sustainable utilization of forest products while preserving ecological components) and Ihya' al-mawat (developing unproductive land into a future forest). The ANP analysis reveals that Hima is the most preferred model by all stakeholders, followed by Ihya' al-mawat. The Harim model received lower preference due to limited economic potential. Additionally, experts suggest tourism-based forest management as the most suitable approach for all three PWFs models. Originality/valueThis study offers a novel PWFs development model grounded in fiqh bi'ah principles. By using ANP to integrate diverse stakeholder perspectives, the research provides valuable insights for sustainable and ethical management of PWFs resources, contributing to the literature on Islamic finance and business models.

TI  - An occupational ergonomics in the Indonesian state mandatory sustainable forest management instrument: A review
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Designed as a biodiversity-maintenance concept, Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) considers not only forest for its ecological function, but also forestry workers whom play a significant role in executing the SFM program in the implementation stage. By using occupational ergonomics approach, this paper aims to examine how the Indonesian mandatory SFM certification, the so-called Pengelolaan Hutan Produksi Lestari (PHPL) positioned forestry workers in its SFM scheme. This issue is important since forestry work is a well-known profession with high occupational safety and health (OSH) risk. Content analysis on occupational ergonomics-related national policies and the mandatory PHPL Criteria and Indicators (C&I), and interviews with forest managers, PHPL auditor, and forestry workers indicate the poor performance of the instrument to assess the occupational-ergonomics-related factors at a practical level. This study reveals that PHPL is more of administrative liability obligation fulfillments rather than performance-based fulfillments (meanwhile, OSH status should be seen as an outcome of a good safety culture rather than an artifact/document). This study verifies content-overlap among the verifiers, content mismatch between the verifiers and the actual characteristic of forest operation, and the absence of distinct assessment standard. This study also discovers the existence of "ergonomics holes" in the PHPL C&I: (1) promoting a safe working environment for forestry workers, (2) distinct organization structural linkage on safety responsibility assignments, (3) emergency procedure, (4) distinct qualification for heavy machine operator and chemical technician, (5) sub-contract workers, and (6) the importance of management commitment and workers' participation. Revision on PHPL should seriously consider integrating OSH and wellbeing aspect as mentioned in Indonesia's national policies concerning manpower and occupational safety.

TI  - The long-term effects of intensive grazing and silvopastoral systems on soil physicochemical properties, enzymatic activity, and microbial biomass
T2  - CATENA
AB  - Brazil is the largest exporter and the second-largest beef producer in the world. The country's biggest challenge has been to increase the production capacity of soils in an environmentally sustainable way. In this context, agricultural practices that preserve the environment have demonstrated high productivity and sustainability by emphasizing intensive grazing management and silvopastoral systems. In this study, the effects of the conversion of a native forest (FO) into different pasture-based cattle production systems were assessed in long-term field experiments using microbiological and physicochemical measurements. Five pasture systems were evaluated: i) irrigated high stocking rate pasture (IHS); ii) rainfed high stocking rate pasture (RHS); iii) rainfed moderate stocking rate pasture (RMS); iv) silvopastoral system with moderate stocking rate (SPS); and v) degraded pasture (DP), the latter used as a reference for conventional pasture management, extensively used by farmers. Soil samples (0-10 cm) were analyzed for bulk density (BD), total carbon content (TC), soil organic matter humifi-cation index (HLIFS), activities of soil enzymes beta-glucosidase (BG) and arylsulfatase (ARYL), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and basal respiration (BR). The results showed that all managed pastures presented higher soil carbon content than DP (16.2 +/- 1.7 g kg(-1)), especially the RMS system, which presented the highest carbon content (32.9 +/- 0.9 g kg(-1)). Activities of BG and ARYL were more sensitive to detecting management changes than MBC and BR. Increased activities of BG and ARYL were observed in the RMS system, possibly due to the higher amount of biomass input, while this effect was less expressive in the other management systems. The results indicated that soil enzymatic activities are sensitive to land use and management and could be used as soil quality indicators in pasture-based beef cattle production for different systems in tropical soils.

TI  - Global Tree Cover and Biomass Carbon on Agricultural Land: The contribution of agroforestry to global and national carbon budgets
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Agroforestry systems and tree cover on agricultural land make an important contribution to climate change mitigation, but are not systematically accounted for in either global carbon budgets or national carbon accounting. This paper assesses the role of trees on agricultural land and their significance for carbon sequestration at a global level, along with recent change trends. Remote sensing data show that in 2010, 43% of all agricultural land globally had at least 10% tree cover and that this has increased by 2% over the previous ten years. Combining geographically and bioclimatically stratified Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 1 default estimates of carbon storage with this tree cover analysis, we estimated 45.3 PgC on agricultural land globally, with trees contributing >75%. Between 2000 and 2010 tree cover increased by 3.7%, resulting in an increase of >2 PgC (or 4.6%) of biomass carbon. On average, globally, biomass carbon increased from 20.4 to 21.4 tC ha(-1). Regional and country-level variation in stocks and trends were mapped and tabulated globally, and for all countries. Brazil, Indonesia, China and India had the largest increases in biomass carbon stored on agricultural land, while Argentina, Myanmar, and Sierra Leone had the largest decreases.

TI  - Strategic Analysis of the Forest Carbon Market in Brazil
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The forest carbon market in Brazil presents a complex scenario filled with challenges and opportunities. This study employed SWOT analysis to evaluate the dynamics of this market, based on the perceptions of 77 specialists from various professional fields. The analysis revealed that extensive forest cover and biodiversity preservation are significant strengths that position Brazil as a potential leader in the global carbon credit market. However, weaknesses such as illegal deforestation and fragile public policies undermine the effectiveness of conservation efforts. Opportunities include the growing international demand for carbon credits and the recognition of the importance of local communities in forest conservation. Nevertheless, external threats like land conflicts and political instability pose considerable risks. The study concludes that it is crucial to strengthen public policies and regulatory frameworks, promote technological innovation, and ensure the active inclusion of local and indigenous communities to guarantee the sustainability and growth of Brazil's forest carbon market. The research suggests that despite significant challenges, Brazil can overcome these obstacles with the implementation of effective strategies.

TI  - Functional and taxonomic alpha and beta diversity responses to burning grasslands in southern Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
AB  - Questions Grasslands in subtropical Brazil are known as potentially fire-prone ecosystems. Aiming to better understand the effects of fire on biodiversity, we addressed the following questions: does fire benefit all alpha and beta components of taxonomic and functional diversity in grasslands; which functional groups are affected; does diversity foster recovery of above-ground biomass after fire? Location Campos grassland, southern Brazil Methods The effects of fire were investigated using a before/after control/impact experimental design. A randomized block design with seven replicates was set up, where a fire experiment was established after three years of both grazing and fire exclusion. Each block contained two paired 10 m x 10 m plots. We assessed plant species composition, plant functional trait composition, plant functional groups, and above-ground biomass before and after fire in both burnt and control plots. Results Both taxonomic and functional alpha diversity increased in burnt plots and decreased in unburnt plots across time. Taxonomic species richness considering total species increased more than considering common species only. Functional beta diversity increased in burnt plots while taxonomic beta diversity stayed similar between treatments. Forb total cover increased after fire while graminoids and shrubs remained unchanged. Burnt plots with high initial functional richness presented greater biomass recovery, whereas species richness presented no relation with above-ground biomass. Conclusions Fire increases species and functional richness in plots of subtropical Campos grasslands (alpha diversity component), and while it increases functional beta diversity, taxonomic beta diversity remained unchanged. Functional diversity is important for maintaining grassland biomass recovery after fire.

TI  - Comparative herbaceous phytosociology in agroforestry and Calophyllum brasiliense monoculture on a river terrace
T2  - REVISTA AGROGEOAMBIENTAL
AB  - Invasive forage grasses, especially the Urochloa genus, impact reforestation worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate management influence on phytosociology of the herbaceous layer, defined as the layer of herbs, sub-shrubs, shrubs and vines, in two agroforestry systems (AFS) (Simple and Biodiverse) in succession to a reforestation of guanandi (Calophyllum brasiliense), compared to monoculture of this specie taken as control. The experiment was conducted in Pindamonhanga (SP), Brazil, from 2011 to 2014, in a randomized block design with eight replications and 144.0 m(2) plots. In Simple SAF area, food crops were grown alongside C. brasiliense rows: sweet cassava (Manihot esculenta) in rotation with arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), banana shrub (Musa sp.), and jugara palm (Euterpe edulis). In Biodiverse AFS, fourteen native tree species were also planted alongside the food crops. Altogether 41 herbaceous layer species, 38 genera and 24 botanical families were identified; the most abundant families were: Asteraceae, Poaceae e Cyperaceae. The similarity between the areas diverged after three years of management, with the predominance of Commelina benghalensis and M. arundinacea in the AFS areas and Urochloa decumbens in the monocultive, mainly, due to the shadow gradient established for the three systems.

TI  - Evaluating the feasibility of oil palm agroforestry in Harapan Rainforest, Jambi, Indonesia
T2  - FOREST AND SOCIETY
AB  - About 2.5 million hectares of a total of 15 million hectares of oil palm plantation in Indonesia are planted in, or conflict with, the forest zone. Oil palm plantations face a conflict between socio-economic and ecological issues. This study was conducted in the Harapan Rainforest, Jambi to evaluate the potential of oil palm-based agroforestry to reconcile economic and ecological interests, by considering socio-economic and financial feasibility as well as biodiversity and land cover. The financial feasibility of oil palm agroforestry is compared to oil palm monoculture, employing a discounted cash flow approach using three indicators: net present value (NPV), benefit-cost ratio (BCR), and internal rate of return (IRR). Two ecological indicators-biodiversity and land cover-are evaluated in an experimental plot of oil palm agroforestry in Jambi. This study indicates that the NPV, BCR, and IRR of oil palm monoculture are IDR 62,644,836 (US$ 4,476.84), 1.39, and 20.77%, respectively, while the oil palm agroforestry planted in the experimental plot potentially generates much better values of financial indicators with NPV, BCR, and IRR being IDR 209,221,212 (US$ 14,951.76), 1.79, and 24.42%, respectively. Besides evaluating financial feasibility, we also found that the reviewed current studies indicate that the oil palm agroforestry provides positive ecological impacts, such as increased forest land cover, invertebrate fauna, and bird diversity.

TI  - SOIL ORGANIC CARBON BUDGET UNDER CROP-LIVESTOCK INTEGRATION IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
AB  - In southern Brazil, crop-livestock integration is increasing in areas traditionally used for extensive beef cattle production. The poor winter pasture management associated to the use of soybean monoculture in the summer may be restrictive for the incorporation of plant residues into the soil and reduce soil organic carbon stocks. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the increase of winter pasture grazing frequencies and summer crop systems on the soil organic C stock. The experiment was carried out for four years under no-tillage and the experiment had a randomized block design and a 3 x 3 bifactorial arrangement with four replications. Factor A consisted of three grazing intervals in the winter: No grazing (NG), Grazing every 28 days (G28) and Grazing every 14 days (G14); and factor B consisted of three summer-cropping systems: Soybean monoculture (Mon-S), Corn monoculture (Mon-C) and annual soybean-corn rotation (Rot-SIC). The addition of C to the soil through plant residues and the soil organic C stock were quantified by the methodologies of equivalent soil layer and equivalent soil mass. The increase of the grazing frequencies reduced the C input by winter forages from 5.3 Mg ha(-1) in treatment NG, to 1.7 and 1.3 Mg ha(-1) in the treatments G28 and G14, respectively. Corn as summer crop resulted in the highest C input to the soil with a mean of 6.0 Mg ha(-1), while the soybean input was only 2.2 Mg ha(-1). The soil organic C stock calculated by the equivalent soil layer method was overestimated in the treatments G14 and G28 and underestimated in treatment NG as compared to results obtained by the soil mass equivalent method, which was used to compare the management systems. The organic C stock in the layers 0-0.025, 0.025-0.05 and 0.05-0.10 m had a linear relationship with the annual C supply through plants (winter pastures + summer crops), requiring an additional 4.48 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) to maintain the original organic C stock in the 0-0.10 m layer. The lower C supply through plant residues in the G14 treatment resulted in an estimated net C emission to the atmosphere (0.05 to 0.27 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)), while the soil in treatment NG acted as an atmospheric C sink (0. 19 to 0.30 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)). In treatment G28, the soil performance as source or sink of atmospheric C was dependent on the summer crop type; A soil net C emission was verified under Mon-S (0.04 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) and a net C retention under MonC (0.15 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) and Rot-S/C (0.11 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)). The longest intervals between winter grazing associated to corn in the summer contributed to increases in biomass and soil organic C accumulation.

TI  - Diversity of soil spiders in land use and management systems in Santa Catarina, Brazil
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - The ability of spiders to spread over contiguous areas (Arachnida: Araneae) is directly related to soil management conditions. The objective of this work was to study the effect of land use system (LUS) on the abundance and diversity of soil spider families and their relationship with soil physical and chemical properties. The evaluated LUS were: native forest, eucalyptus reforestation, pasture, crop-livestock integration, and no-tillage crop. Samples were collected in three municipalities of Southern Plateau of Santa Catarina, considered as true replicates, during winter and summer. A total of 270 samples was taken in each area and season. The sampling points were arranged in a grid of 3 x 3 m, spaced by 30 m. We evaluated soil physical, chemical, and microbiological attributes and the abundance and diversity of spider families, collected by soil monolith and soil traps. A total of 448 spiders were captured, 152 in winter and 296 in summer, distributed in 24 families and 52 species/morphospecies. There was a seasonality effect related to the land use systems and the highest Shannon-Wiener diversity index was recorded in the native forest in both sampling periods. Most families of spiders have a direct dependence on soil physical and chemical properties, such as microporosity, exchangeable aluminum, calcium, magnesium, and potassium during the winter. Organic matter, nitrogen, pH in water, weighted average diameter, soil density, and microbial biomass carbon exhibited dependence during the summer. Vegetation type and soil management are the factors that seem to affect most the occurrence of spiders. The families Theridiidae and Nemesiidae are dependent on sites with low human intervention.

TI  - Climate-related land use policies in Brazil: How much has been achieved with economic incentives in agriculture?
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Until 2019, the Brazilian federal government employed a number of policy measures to fulfill the pledge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from land use change and agriculture. While its forest law enforcement strategy was partially successful in combating illegal deforestation, the effectiveness of positive incentive measures in agriculture has been less clear. The reason is that emissions reduction from market-based incentives such as the Brazilian Low-Carbon Agriculture Plan cannot be easily verified with current remote sensing monitoring approaches. Farmers have adopted a large variety of integrated land-use systems of crop, livestock and forestry with highly diverse per-hectare carbon balances. Their responses to policy incentives were largely driven by cost and benefit considerations at the farm level and not necessarily aligned with federal environmental objectives. This article analyzes climate-related land-use policies in the state of Mato Grosso, where highly mechanized soybean-cotton and soybean-maize cropping systems prevail. We employ agent-based bioeconomic simulation together with life-cycle assessment to explicitly capture the heterogeneity of farm-level costs, benefits of adoption, and greenhouse gas emissions. Our analysis confirms previous assessments but suggests a smaller farmer policy response when measured as increase in area of integrated systems. In terms of net carbon balances, our simulation results indicate that mitigation effects at the farm level depended heavily on the exact type of livestock and grazing system. The available data were insufficient to rule out even adverse effects. The Brazilian experience thus offers lessons for other land-rich countries that build their climate mitigation policies on economic incentives in agriculture.

TI  - Oil Palm Plantations, Forest Conservation and Indigenous Peoples in West Papua Province: What Lies Ahead?
T2  - FOREST AND SOCIETY
AB  - Oil palm plantations are currently expanding to the eastern part of Indonesia, especially into West Papua province. Many oil palm permits issued in West Papua occupy intact biodiversity-rich forest areas which have essential value for indigenous Papuans' socio-cultural life. This article discusses expansion of oil palm plantations in West Papua province, and its impacts on forests and indigenous people. It also assesses whether the plantations fit the Special Autonomy Law and Sustainable Development Regulation goals of the province. In general, plantations are being established in forest areas, and further planned expansion threatens intact and biodiversity-rich forests. In addition, plantation development rarely considers the sociocultural issues of indigenous Papuans. As a result, customary rights and institutions are commonly overlooked, undermined, or violated. Oil palm plantations are not necessarily compatible with sustainable development goals, and need to reconcile its overall economic and conservation agenda.

TI  - Carbon stock in rubber tree plantations in Western Ghana and Mato Grosso (Brazil)
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Cultivation of rubber trees on non-forested land could act as a carbon sink by sequestering carbon in biomass and indirectly in soils. International political and economical interests, following the Kyoto Protocol, require estimates of this carbon sequestration.
   The carbon stock of two rubber tree plantations (Hevea brasiliensis (Willd.) Muell.-Arg.) was assessed in two contrasting climatic areas: western region in Ghana (WG; 12-14-year-old) and Mato Grosso (MG; 14-25-year-old) in Brazil.
   Trees (76 in WG and 210 in MG) spanning a range of stand ages, clone types and planting layouts were felled and partitioned into log, live lignified branches of selected diameter (large, medium and fine), dead branches, non-lignified fine branches, leaves, taproot and lateral roots. Allometric relationships (log-transformed power functions) based on trunk circumference at a height of 170 CM (C] 70) were used to predict the tree foliage, aboveground, belowground and total carbon content (kg C tree(-1)) (r(2) = 0.86-0.99). The way in which carbon content varied as a function of C(170) depended both on components and sites.
   Sampling plots (25 in WG and 34 in MG) were established in stands of varying ages, clones and planting layouts, to quantify carbon pools. The tree carbon stocks (t C ha(-1)) estimated from the allometric relationships for total tree were fitted as a function of stand age using a non-linear sigmoid curve of Gompertz (total tree r(2) = 0.841 and 0.854 in WG and MG, respectively). Predicted tree carbon stock for 14-year-old stands was 83% higher in WG (76.3 t C ha(-1)) than in MG (41.7 t C ha(-1)), which was partially explained by a difference in tree height growth between the two locations resulting from the contrasting sites. In addition to tree components, the carbon stocks associated with dead wood on the around, understorey vegetation, litter layer, fine roots (0-60 cm), soil organic carbon (0-60 cm) and charcoal (0-60 cm) were assessed using linear mixed models to evaluate the influence of clone, site, planting layout and age. Only age appeared to have a significant effect for some pools.
   For 14-year-old stands, the contribution of the soil organic carbon pool (0-60 cm) ranged between 39 and 69% of the total carbon stock, which amounted to 135 and 153 t C ha(-1), in WG and MG, respectively. The cumulated contribution of all remaining soil and ground pools (dead wood on the ground, understorey vegetation, litter layer, fine roots and charcoal) was about 5% in both sites.
   In the framework of the Kyoto Protocol, these results could be useful when drafting a Project Design Document (PDD) for Afforestation and Reforestation Clean Development Mechanism (AR-CDM). (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - NATURAL REGENERATION OF TREE SPECIES IN A MOUNTAIN SEASONAL SEMIDECIDUOUS FOREST FRAGMENT IN THE ATLANTIC FOREST DOMAIN, IN VICOSA, MG STATE, SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
AB  - The current study aimed to analyse the tree species natural regeneration floristic composition in a Mountain Seasonal Semideciduous Forest fragment in the domain of the Atlantic Forest, in southeastern Brazil (20 degrees 45'S, 42 degrees 55'W) in order to subsidize secondary natural forest management. Ten sites were selected based on their aspects, slopes and topographic positions. Natural regeneration indexes were estimated for each tree species per size classes to obtain the Total Natural Regeneration Index (TNR) for each species. It was sampled a total of 3,516 individuals of 140 tree species varying from 10 cm to 5 m height with diameter at the height of 1.3 m (DBH) smaller than 5 cm. The largest numbers of individuals were sampled in the families Rubiaceae, Fabaceae Mimosoideae, Monimiaceae, Fabaceae Papilionoideae, and the richest families were Fabaceae Caesalpinoideae, Fabaceae Papilionoideae, Euphorbiaceae, Lauraceae, Myrtaceae and Rubiaceae. Psychotria sessilis, Siparuna guianensis, Anadenanthera peregrina and Piptadenia gonoacantha presented the largest TNR. The comparison of the actual regeneration study with that of prior evaluations suggests a continuous substitution of species from initial to more advanced stages. These results indicate that the protection of the remaining forest fragments is important to maintain or improve the biodiversity in this region.

TI  - Increased grazing intensity in pastures reduces the abundance and richness of ground spiders in an integrated crop-livestock system
T2  - AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Ground spiders can reflect the impacts of land-use intensification. In an integrated annual crop-livestock system, the grazing intensification can negatively influence the abundance and richness of ground spiders. We evaluated the difference in abundance, family and species richness, and species composition of ground spiders in the soybean and pasture environments, and the effect of grazing intensity on the spider community under a soybean-pasture rotation. We hypothesized that pastures would have higher spider species richness and a distinct species composition and that the increase in grazing intensity would reduce spider abundance and species richness. We conducted an experiment in an integrated annual crop-livestock system under a soybean-pasture rotation in southern Brazil that was managed for 14 years by alternating Glycine max for summer grain production and Avena strigosa + Lolium multiflorum for beef cattle grazing during the winter. We sampled four times over 2 years: twice after the grazing cycles and twice after the soybean harvests. Grazing intensification was measured as grazing heights of 10, 20, 30, and 40 cm. Pitfall traps were installed to capture ground spiders. A total of 2589 spiders were collected and classified into 23 families and 43 species. The abundance of spiders was seven times higher, and species richness was 35% higher in the postgrazing compared with the postsoybean environment. Linear mixed effects models showed that spider abundance and richness were strongly influenced by grazing height, particularly postgrazing, but the influence of grazing height on male spider abundance could still be detected in the postsoybean environment. We have shown for the first time that the management of grazing height affects the abundance and richness of spiders in an integrated annual crop-livestock system. To introduce a grazing cycle to a completely crop-centric production system and regulating grazing intensity can help maintain a more diverse spider community.

TI  - Fire regime in the Brazilian Savanna: Recent changes, policy and management
T2  - FLORA
AB  - In 2019 Brazil recorded the highest wildland fire occurrence South America has seen for the last 15 years. Added to the Amazon, the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) faces changes in fire regimes. Climatic changes and the recent weakening of environmental law enforcement are factors, but historic and large-scale trends and drivers of fire regimes must be analyzed. We discuss ecological and policy drivers of recent changes in fire regimes in the Cerrado, in order to highlight management strategies. The Cerrado has evolved with natural fires and anthropogenic fires are also common for millennia. In the past 50 years, wildfires tend to be concentrated in the late dry season and to occur every two / three years, causing serious damage in fire-sensitive vegetation. Apart from climatic variations, the drivers of wildfires are deforestation and fire suppression policies. Nearly half of the original vegetation of the Cerrado biome has disappeared largely due to agribusiness expansion. Fire is associated with deforestation in two ways: vegetation conversion to monocultures, and lack of fire management in the remaining native vegetation. Indeed, the attempts to exclude fires from this fire-prone ecosystem disrupted traditional fire management. Fire suppression policies lead to increased wildfire risks due to fuel load and the multiplication of sources of ignition (conflicts, roads). The recent advances in Integrated Fire Management in protected areas in the Cerrado are evident. However, the recent budget cuts by the Brazilian government in environmental management and research undermine the chances of decreasing occurrences of wildfires in this biodiversity hotspot.

TI  - Simulation of management and soil interactions impacting SOC dynamics in sugarcane using the CENTURY Model
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY
AB  - Newer methods of management and harvesting of sugarcane are being considered to improve soil and water conservation in Brazil. Our aim in this study was to evaluate soil C dynamics under sugarcane cultivation as influenced by the use of conservation management, using measurements from four different management systems and land use histories, i.e. conventional management with preharvest burning, no burning with residue retention and two systems without burning plus additional organic amendments. Field sites also differed in terms of soil texture. We compared field measurements of soil C stocks, C-13 and microbial biomass with simulated results from the Century ecosystem model for each of the sites and management histories. We also did long-term simulations of the management treatments and sites to approximate steady-state SOC levels, to explore potential management-induced differences in SOC stocks and interactions with soil texture. The model accurately represented treatment and site differences for total SOC stocks, in which SOC stocks were strongly affected by both rates of organic matter input to soil and soil clay content. However, the model tended to underestimate the relative contribution of sugarcane-derived C to total SOC for sites with high residue and external organic matter amendments. Measured microbial biomass C across the sites was closely aligned with relative amounts of organic matter input but did not appear to be strongly affected by soil texture, whereas the model predicted that both texture and organic matter input rate would impact microbial biomass C. Long-term simulations of the conservation management alternatives suggested that SOC stocks could be maintained at or above levels in the original native CerradAo vegetation, whereas conventional practices using residue burning would result in a reduction of SOC to ca. 60% of native levels. Our results support the use of the CENTURY model as an aid to assess the impacts of different soil management practices on SOC stocks under sugarcane in Brazil.

TI  - Soil carbon sequestration for sustaining agricultural production and improving the environment with particular reference to Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
CP  - Workshop on Biological Management of Soil Ecosystems
AB  - Agricultural ecosystems generally contain less soil organic carbon (SOC) pool than their potential capacity because of the low return and high rate of mineralization of biosolids, and severe losses due to accelerated erosion and leaching. Conversion of natural to agricultural ecosystems usually causes depletion of 50 to 75 percent of the antecedent SOC pool, thereby creating a potential sink capacity of as much as 35 to 40 Mg C/ha. The depletion of SOC pool leads to decline in soil quality and resilience with attendant reduction in biomass productivity, decreased capacity to degrade and filter pollutants, increased risks of soil degradation by erosion and other processes, and increase in emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs). The magnitude of depletion of SOC pool is greater for soils of the tropics than temperate regions, and for farms which are resource-based and managed with low-input than those managed with science-based and judicious off-farm inputs. The SOC sequestration, increasing SOC pool through conversion to an appropriate land use and adoption of recommended management practices (RMPs), can reverse soil degradation trends, improve soil quality and resilience, increase biomass production and decrease emission of GHGs. A strong link exists between the labile fraction of SOC pool and soil biodiversitythe activity and species diversity of soil fauna (micro, meso and macro) and micro-organisms. Soil biodiversity is usually higher under pastures and planted fallow systems than under crops, and is likely to increase with adoption of conservation tillage and mulch farming, integrated nutrient management and manuring, mixed farming systems and integrated pest management (IPM) techniques. The gross rates of SOC sequestration through adoption of RMPs range from 400 to 800 kg/ha/y for cool and humid regions and 100 to 200 kg/ha/y for dry and warm climates. The potential of soil C sequestration in Brazil is estimated at about 50 Tg C/y. In addition, 60 Tg C/y emitted by erosion-induced mineralization can also be avoided through effective erosion control measures.

TI  - PHYSICAL QUALITY OF AN OXISOL UNDER AN INTEGRATED CROP-LIVESTOCK-FOREST SYSTEM IN THE BRAZILIAN CERRADO
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
AB  - Soil physical quality is an important factor for the sustainability of agricultural systems. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate soil physical properties and soil organic carbon in a Typic Acrudox under an integrated crop-livestock-forest system. The experiment was carried out in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Treatments consisted of seven systems: integrated crop-livestock-forest, with 357 trees ha(-1) and pasture height of 30 cm (CLF357-30); integrated crop-livestock-forest with 357 trees ha(-1) and pasture height of 45 cm (CLF357-45); integrated crop-livestock-forest with 227 trees ha(-1) and pasture height of 30 cm (CLF227-30); integrated crop-livestock-forest with 227 trees ha(-1) and pasture height of 45 cm (CLF227-45); integrated crop-livestock with pasture height of 30 cm (CL30); integrated crop-livestock with pasture height of 45 cm (CL45) and native vegetation (NV). Soil properties were evaluated for the depths of 0-10 and 10-20 cm. All grazing treatments increased bulk density (rho(b)) and penetration resistance (PR), and decreased total porosity (f(t)) and macroporosity (f(ma)), compared to NV. The values of rho(b) (1.18-1.47 Mg m(-3)), f(ma) (0.14-0.17 m(3) m(-3)) and PR (0.62-0.81 MPa) at the 0-10 cm depth were not restrictive to plant growth. The change in land use from NV to CL or CLF decreased soil organic carbon (SOC) and the soil organic carbon pool (SOCpool). All grazing treatments had a similar SOCpool at the 0-10 cm depth and were lower than that for NV (17.58 Mg ha(-1)).

TI  - Seasonal forecasting of fire over Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
AB  - Large-scale fires occur frequently across Indonesia, particularly in the southern region of Kalimantan and eastern Sumatra. They have considerable impacts on carbon emissions, haze production, biodiversity, health, and economic activities.
   In this study, we demonstrate that severe fire and haze events in Indonesia can generally be predicted months in advance using predictions of seasonal rainfall from the ECMWF System 4 coupled ocean-atmosphere model. Based on analyses of long, up-to-date series observations on burnt area, rainfall, and tree cover, we demonstrate that fire activity is negatively correlated with rainfall and is positively associated with deforestation in Indonesia. There is a contrast between the southern region of Kalimantan (high fire activity, high tree cover loss, and strong non-linear correlation between observed rainfall and fire) and the central region of Kalimantan (low fire activity, low tree cover loss, and weak, non-linear correlation between observed rainfall and fire).
   The ECMWF seasonal forecast provides skilled forecasts of burnt and fire-affected area with several months lead time explaining at least 70% of the variance between rainfall and burnt and fire-affected area. Results are strongly influenced by El Nino years which show a consistent positive bias. Overall, our findings point to a high potential for using a more physical-based method for predicting fires with several months lead time in the tropics rather than one based on indexes only. We argue that seasonal precipitation forecasts should be central to Indonesia's evolving fire management policy.

TI  - The influence of fire and livestock grazing on the assemblage of non-flying small mammals in grassland-Araucaria Forest ecotones, southern Brazil
T2  - ZOOLOGIA
AB  - Grazing and fire, used in pasture regeneration practices, are inter-related activities in livestock management. Both activities affect habitat characteristics by changing the structure of the herbaceous and shrubby vegetation, reducing their biomass and litter cover. This study evaluated the effect of fire and livestock grazing on the assemblage of non-flying small mammals in grassland-Araucaria forest ecotones in southern Brazil. We compared four areas frequently affected by livestock management with four protected areas. Surveys were carried out in four sampling periods, one in each season of 2004. We captured a total of 325 individuals from 12 species of rodents - Akodon montensis Thomas, 1913, Akodon paranaensis Christoff, Fagundes, Sbalqueiro, Mattevi e Yonenaga-Yassuda, 2000, Akodon sp. 1, Akodon sp. 2 (2n = 34), Brucepattersonius iheringi (Thomas, 1896), Delomys dorsalis (Hensel, 1872), Oligoryzomys flavescens (Waterhouse, 1837), Oligoryzomys nigripes (Olfers, 1818), Oxymycterus nasutus (Waterhouse, 1837), Scapteromys sp. (2n = 34), Sooretamys angouya (Fischer, 1814) and Thaptomys nigrita (Lichtenstein, 1829) - and two species of marsupials - Monodelphis dimidiata (Wagner, 1847) and Philander frenatus (Olfers, 1818) - , in a total effective effort of 5254 traps.day(-1). The abundance, biomass and diversity of non-flying small mammals were significantly higher in the protected areas than in those affected by fire and livestock grazing. Species strictly associated with grassland habitats were not found in the impacted area. These results indicate that the presence of herds of domestic ungulates negatively affect the assemblage of non-flying small mammals in grassland and Araucaria forest areas in southern Brazil.

TI  - Database of bird species composition in natural habitats and forest plantations
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
AB  - In southeastern South America, the afforestation over grasslands imposes a severe threat to the grassy landscapes and associated biodiversity. To analyze the effect of forest plantations on grassland birds, we present a new database that considers the composition of bird communities in natural habitats, as well as in eucalyptus plantations from the southeastern South American grasslands. Data were previously used to investigate the effectiveness of legally protected grasslands in private lands to protect birds in "Bird-grassland associations in protected and non-protected areas in the southern Brazil" [1] and also the effects of afforestation of grasslands on different dimensions of bird diversity in "The effects of grassland ecosystem afforestation on avian phylogenetic diversity, taxonomic diversity and evolutionary distinctiveness" [2]. Data were collected during the breeding period of bird species (spring/austral summer), covering three breeding seasons during the years 2014-2016. Species presence and number of individuals were recorded, totaling 107 species and 1175 individuals. The dataset will be useful for researchers interested in conservation studies as it includes data from globally threatened bird species. (c) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Functional redundancy and stability in plant communities
T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
AB  - Questions Functional redundancy in assemblages may insure ecosystem processes after perturbation, potentially causing temporary or permanent local species extinctions. Yet, functional redundancy has only been inferred by indirect evidence or measured by methods that may not be the most appropriate. Here, we apply an existing method to measure functional redundancy, which is the fraction of species diversity not expressed by functional diversity, to assess whether functional redundancy affects community resilience after disturbance.
   Location Subtropical grassland, south Brazil (30 degrees 0546S, 51 degrees 4037W).
   Method: Species traits and community composition were assessed in quadrats before grazing and after community recovery. Grazing intensity (G) was measured in each quadrat. We used traits linked to grazing intensity to define functional redundancy (FR) as the difference of Gini-Simpson index of species diversity (D) and Rao's quadratic entropy (Q). Also, with the same traits, we defined community functional stability (S) as the similarity between trait-based community composition before grazing and 47 and 180 d after grazing ending. Using path analysis we assessed different postulated causal models linking functional diversity (Q), functional redundancy (FR), grazing intensity (G) and community-weightedmean traits to community stability (S) under grazing.
   Results: Path analysis revealed the most valid causal model FR -> S <- G, with a significant positive path coefficient for FR -> S and a marginally significant negative one for S <- G. Since FR and G were independent in their covariation and in their effects on S, the model discriminated community resistance to grazing (the effect of G on S) from community resilience after grazing caused by functional redundancy (indicated by the effect of FR on S).
   Conclusion: We show that expressing functional redundancymathematically is a useful tool for testing causal models linking diversity to community stability. The results support the conclusion that functional redundancy enhanced community resilience, therefore corroborating the insurance hypothesis.

TI  - Territorial expansion of eucalyptus monoculture in the Eastern Amazon
T2  - NOVOS CADERNOS NAEA
AB  - The article analyzes the expansion of eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp.) species in the eastern Amazon, specifically in the municipalities of Paragominas, Dom Eliseu, Rondon do Para and Ulianopolis in the State of Para, applying the Monoculture Index (MI) as a territorial management indicator. The IM was adapted for the amazon region and the limits were established based on the area available for use in rural properties located in the Amazon region. The monoculture indexes for 2018 and 2021 varied greatly among the municipalities and the highest indexes were found for the municipalities of Dom Elizeu and Ulianopolis, Such municipalities were considered to have an area restriction index for eucalyptus expansion. It is considered that this index can be used in the planning of forestry projects, helping in the management of the territory and in the definition of policies that guide enterprises and municipalities in the use of forest species in reforestation projects in the Amazon region.

TI  - Regional variation in responses of a vulnerable bird species to land-use and climate change
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Climate and land-use changes are expected to negatively affect many species and ecological processes, leading to biodiversity loss. However, some species can adapt to these changes. Wide-ranging species are expected to be less impacted by such changes, but they can occur in different domains with contrasting environmental conditions, resulting in different conservation statuses along their range. To understand whether a species will overall benefit or lose with global change, we evaluated the responses of a wide-ranging but a vulnerable bird (Crax fasciolata) to separate and combined effects of climate and land-use changes under different environmental policies in Brazil. Using ecological niche modeling and a land-use model within the Brazilian political context, we quantified climatic, habitat, and environmental suitability for Crax fasciolata under historical (2000) and future (2050) scenarios. Our findings showed that environmental suitability can increase for Crax fasciolata in Brazil in future, but these effects vary according to the domain and the specific future scenario considered. Climatically suitable areas will increase in all scenarios, and those environmental scenarios that include better habitat conditions will provide more environmentally suitable areas for Crax fasciolata. However, this increase comes from newly suitable areas in the Atlantic Forest and the Amazon, while the Pantanal, the Caatinga, and the Cerrado will lose environmental suitability due to native vegetation loss. Despite the availability of these new areas, reduced landscape permeability may hinder Crax fasciolata from reaching them. This reinforces the urgent call for public policies for native vegetation protection, reforestation, and effective deforestation control. Abstract in Portuguese is available with online material

TI  - Leakage and boosting effects in environmental governance: a framework for analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - In an increasingly interconnected world, leakage-broadly understood as unintended displacement of impacts caused by an environmental policy intervention-has become a major governance concern. Yet, leakage remains both loosely conceptualized and poorly understood as a phenomenon in policy making. To fill this gap and broaden the leakage research agenda, we conduct a state-of-the-art review of scientific assessments on leakage (particularly on land use) and combine it with conceptual and analytical frameworks from the environmental governance literature. We then propose a rigorous definition of leakage, discuss frequently overlooked political dimensions, and develop a typology of leakage pathways. Our analysis of leakage through a governance lens yields five core insights: (1) Leakage is not simply a mechanistic phenomenon, but a complex governance issue involving questions of institutional fit, interactions, and political agency. (2) Although the land use literature traditionally focuses on leakage through markets or activity displacement, a governance lens shows that it also occurs through information, motivation, or institutional channels. (3) As policy-makers may act strategically, the unintentionally of leakage should not be assumed but rather become an object of research. (4) A phenomenon not initially regarded as leakage can come to be framed as such through the action of 'problem brokers' and changes in policy fields. (5) Policy-makers and researchers should broaden their focus from only avoiding leakage to seeking positive spillovers and institutional synergies. These insights are illustrated with examples from two cases relating to land use policy in Brazil and Southeast Asia.

TI  - Bird beta-diversity of tree plantations and natural forests immersed within a grassy landscape in southern Brazil
T2  - ORNITHOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - The conversion of natural grasslands into tree plantations has reduced the extent of natural habitats in southern Brazil, altering bird composition due to local species extinction and colonization. Tree plantations represent a new land use in the region and are within a mosaic of altered and native vegetation. We investigated whether bird composition of tree plantations immersed within a grassy landscape consists of a nested subset of species from adjacent riparian forests. We sampled birds in riparian forests and in eucalyptus plantations at two stages of development using the point count method. We partitioned beta-diversity into nestedness and turnover components to detect the strength of local extinction and colonization processes, respectively, in determining variation in composition among native forests and intermediate and old-aged plantations considering all birds together and only forest-specialist birds. We then used linear models to test the effect of land use on the pairwise turnover and nestedness that each plantation presents relative to native forests. We recorded 72 bird species, of which 62, 25, and 22 species were found in riparian forests, intermediate, and old-aged plantations, respectively. Turnover predominated in beta-diversity partitioning-whether all birds or just forest-specialist birds were analyzed-showing that the bird composition of tree plantations might not depend on adjacent forests, but instead on sparse resource availability within tree plantations. Finally, we found lower bird turnover for plantations relative to native forests with increasing cover of tree plantations in the landscape. Large extents of tree plantations in the landscape, therefore, homogenize bird composition across sites.

TI  - Storage and forms of organic carbon in a no-tillage under cover crops system on clayey Oxisol in dryland rice production (Cerrados, Brazil)
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB  - The management and enhancement of soil organic carbon (SOC) is very important for agriculture (fertility) as well as for the environment (carbon (C) sequestration). Consequently, changes in soil management may alter SOC content. No-tillage (NT) practices are potential ways to increase SOC. We studied the SOC from agricultural soils in the Cerrados in Central Brazil. We compared two different tillage systems: conservation agriculture with no-tillage under cover crops (NT) and disc tillage (DT) for 5 years in a context of rainfed rice production. The soil is a dark red Oxisol with high clay content (about 40%). The objectives of the study were: (i) to evaluate the short-term (5 years) impact of tillage systems on SOC stocks in an Oxisol and (ii) to better understand the dynamics of SOC in different fractions of this soil. We first studied the initial situation in 1998, and compared it to the 2003 situation. NT with cover crop (Crotalaria) was found to increase the storage of C in the topsoil layer (0-10 cm) compared to DT. The difference observed for the 0-10 cm layer under NT in comparison with DT represented C enrichment under no-tillage amounting to 0.35 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) and corresponding to less than 10% of cover crops residues returned to the soil. A particle-size fractionation of soil organic matter (SOM) showed that differences in total SOC between NT and DT mainly affected the 0-2 mu m fraction and, to a smaller extent the 2-20 mu m fraction.
   This specific enrichment of SOC in the silt and clay fraction was attributed to (i) the storage of a water soluble C in the field and (ii) the effect of soil biota and especially fauna activity. The mean residence time of carbon associated with the fine fractions being rather long, it might be assumed that the preferential storage in fine fractions resulted in a long-term carbon storage. This study suggests a positive short-term effect of a no-tillage system on C sequestration in an Oxisol. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Modeling soil organic carbon dynamics in Oxisols of Ibiruba (Brazil) with the Century Model
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB  - introduction of conservation practices in degraded agricultural land will generally recuperate soil quality, especially by increasing soil organic matter. This aspect of soil organic C (SOC) dynamics under distinct cropping and management systems can be conveniently analyzed with ecosystem models such as the Century Model. In this study, Century was used to simulate SOC stocks in farm fields of the Ibiruba region of north central Rio Grande do Sul state in Southern Brazil. The region, where soils are predominantly Oxisols, was originally covered with subtropical woodlands and grasslands. SOC dynamics was simulated with a general scenario developed with historical data on soil management and cropping systems beginning with the onset of agriculture in 1900. From 1993 to 2050, two contrasting scenarios based on no-tillage soil management were established: the "status quo" scenario, with crops and agricultural inputs as currently practiced in the region and the "high biomass" scenario with increased frequency of corn in the cropping system, resulting in about 80% higher biomass addition to soils. Century simulations were in close agreement with SOC stocks measured in 2005 in the Oxisols with finer texture surface horizon originally under woodlands. However, simulations in the Oxisols with loamy surface horizon under woodlands and in the grassland soils were not as accurate. SOC stock decreased from 44% to 50% in fields originally under woodland and from 20% to 27% in fields under grasslands with the introduction of intensive annual grain crops with intensive tillage and harrowing operations. The adoption of conservation practices in the 1980s led to a stabilization of SOC stocks followed by a partial recovery of native stocks. Simulations to 2050 indicate that maintaining "status quo" would allow SOC stocks to recover from 81% to 86% of the native stocks under woodland and from 80% to 91 % of the native stocks under grasslands. Adoption of a "high biomass" scenario would result in stocks from 75% to 95% of the original stocks under woodlands and from 89% to 102% in the grasslands by 2050. These simulations outcomes underline the importance of cropping system yielding higher biomass to further increase SOC content in these Oxisols. This application of the Century Model could reproduce general trends of SOC loss and recovery in the Oxisols of the Ibiruba region. Additional calibration and validation should be conducted before extensive usage of Century as a support tool for soil carbon sequestration projects in this and other regions can be recommended.

TI  - SOIL CARBON AND NITROGEN STOCKS IN TRADITIONAL AGRICULTURAL AND AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS IN THE SEMIARID REGION OF BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
AB  - In the semiarid region of Brazil, inadequate management of cropping systems and low plant biomass production can contribute to reduce soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks; therefore, management systems that preserve C and N must be adopted. This study aimed to evaluate the changes in soil C and N stocks that were promoted by agroforestry (agrosilvopastoral and silvopastoral) and traditional agricultural systems (slash-and-burn clearing and cultivation for two and three years) and to compare these systems with the natural Caatinga vegetation after 13 years of cultivation. The experiment was carried out on a typical Ortic Chromic Luvisol in the municipality of Sobral, Ceara, Brazil. Soil samples were collected (layers 0-6, 6-12, 12-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm) with four replications. The plain, convex and concave landforms in each study situation were analyzed, and the total organic C, total N and densities of the soil samples were assessed. The silvopastoral system promoted the greatest long-term reductions in C and N stocks, while the agrosilvopastoral system promoted the smallest losses and therefore represents a sustainable alternative for soil C and N sequestration in these semiarid conditions. The traditional agricultural system produced reductions of 58.87 and 9.57 Mg ha(-1) in the organic C and total N stocks, respectively, which suggests that this system is inadequate for these semiarid conditions. The organic C stocks were largest in the concave landform in the agrosilvopastoral system and in the plain landform in the silvopastoral system, while the total N values were highest in the concave landform in the native, agrosilvopastoral and silvopastoral systems.

TI  - CARBON SEQUESTRATION AND NUTRIENT RESERVES UNDER DIFFERENT LAND USE SYSTEMS
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
AB  - This study evaluated the contribution of agroforestry (AFS) and traditional systems to carbon sequestration and nutrient reserves in plants, litter and soil. The study was carried out in the semiarid region of Brazil in a long-term experiment on an experimental farm of the goat and sheep section of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa). Two agroforestry systems were investigated: agrosilvopastoral (ASP) and forest-pasture areas (SP) as well as traditional agriculture management (TM), two areas left fallow after TM (six fallow years - F6 and nine fallow years - F9) and one area of preserved Caatinga vegetation (CAT). Soil, litter and plants were sampled from all areas and the contents of C, N, P, K, Ca and Mg per compartment determined. The AFS (ASP and SP) had higher nutrient stocks than the traditional and intermediate stocks compared to the preserved Caatinga. In the ASP, a relevant part of the nutrients extracted by crops is returned to the system by constant inputs of litter, weeding of herbaceous vegetation and cutting of the legume crops. After fallow periods of six and nine years, carbon and nutrient stocks in the compartments soil, litter and herbaceous plants were similar to those of the preserved Caatinga (CAT), but still lower than under natural conditions in the woody vegetation.

TI  - Current biodiversity status, distribution, and prospects of seaweed in Indonesia: A systematic review
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Seaweeds are a valuable component of marine biodiversity that play multiple essential roles in Indonesia's coastal ecology and economy. This systematic review (1993-2023) aimed to provide an updated overview of seaweed distribution, biodiversity, cultivation, and industry in Indonesia. The literature search derived from major databases, Scopus, Web of Science (WoS) and ResearchGate (RG), and Google Scholar (GS) retrieved 794 studies, after removing 80 duplicates, identified 646 studies passed title and abstract screening that satisfied all criteria: Indonesia, seaweed, seaweed biodiversity and composition, which consisted of 80 exclusion studies. Full text screening decided 194 studies were selected based on the specific inclusion criteria (at least two criteria passed: seaweed distribution site, species, cultivation, and habitat). After additional filtering, 137 studies were included for extraction and analysis. We found that Indonesia is rich in seaweed biodiversity, with at least 325 identified species consisting of 103 Chlorophyceae (green algae), 167 Rhodophyceae (red algae), and 55 Phaeophyceae (brown algae), respectively. Seaweed distribution and abundance in Indonesia are influenced by environmental factors, including nutrients, grazing, competition, physical tolerance, light intensity, and degree of water circulation. Seaweed species are predominantly found in mangrove forests and coral reefs on the islands of Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan, and Sulawesi. This review provides an up-to-date and comprehensive overview of the distribution and biodiversity of seaweeds in Indonesia, highlighting the ecological, economic, and cultivation of marine resources.

TI  - Palm density and grazing effects on plant communities: implications for livestock management in a Butia palm grove
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
AB  - Some grasslands in ecotones with forests tend to be encroached by woody species, because of changes in climate and land use. Such structural changes in vegetation can be facilitated when the grassland community presents an autochthonous arboreal component, like Butia palms. We aim to identify the responses of taxonomic and functional diversity on grassland community with the occurrence of arborescent/ arboreal species (autochthonous and encroaching) to palm density and grazing intensity. The study was conducted in a Butia odorata palm grove under cattle management, in Southern Brazil. To assess the taxonomic and functional composition we performed ordinations analysis with the vegetational data and using path analysis we assessed the causal relationships between variables of interest. Density of Butia odorata and woody plants were strongly positive related, suggesting a facilitation process in the establishment of arborescent plants on the grassland matrix. The abundance of less palatable plants and grazing pressure were inversely related, indicating a selection process induced by higher grazing intensity. We suggest that the grazing intensity management must be based on the autochthonous tree density, applying higher grazing intensity in areas with higher density of encroaching plants, in addition to maintaining other regions conducive to Butia palm regeneration through fallows.

TI  - Soil carbon stock changes in a crop-livestock-forestry integration in Southern Goiás State, Brazil
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Crop-livestock-forestry (CLF) has been recommended as a strategy for soil carbon sequestration, compensating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of livestock as well as for sustainable soil management for improving soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil health. In this study we quantified SOC accruals in a very clayey (662 g kg-1) Rhodic Ferralsol during the evolution of a 11-year-old crop-livestock-forestry system in the municipality of Cachoeira Dourada, Central-West region of Brazil. CLF was implemented in 2009 in a conventional non-managed Pasture area, and soil samples were collected in 2012 and 2020 under two land uses, CLF, and the Pasture as time-zero reference. The soil in CLF was evaluated within the tree lines (CLF-Tree) and in the alley pasture between the tree lines (CLF-Alley) having palisade grass. SOC dynamics was different in the upper 30 cm and in the underlying 70 cm layer. In the 0.0-0.3 m layer, after an initial decline in SOC stocks due to soil preparation for the implementation of CLF, SOC accumulation rates were positive in CLF (0.23-0.56 Mg ha-1 yr-1), but negative in the Pasture (-0.05). At 0.3-1.0 m SOC stocks were higher both in 2012 and 2020 in CLF-Tree (86.70 and 83.74 Mg ha-1) than in the reference Pasture (71.81 and 74.96 Mg ha-1), however, CLF SOC was declining. Total soil N under CLF, compared to the reference Pasture, was lower and declining. These findings confirm that in general CLF is a valid strategy to increase SOC stocks compared to conventional non-managed Pasture, but adequate soil fertility management is necessary to potentialise SOC.

TI  - Synergies among climate change and biodiversity conservation measures and policies in the forest sector: A case study of Southeast Asian countries
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Forest conservation contributes to climate change mitigation, adaptation, and biodiversity/ecosystem conservation. To enhance the co-benefits of forest conservation, it is important to promote synergies among the three measures mitigation, adaptation, and biodiversity/ecosystem conservation in the forest sector and eliminate the overlaps among the three measures. However, limited research exists on the analysis of their synergies. This study explores the potential for synergy among the three forest sector measures, utilizing: 1) indicators that assess enabling conditions for synergies among the three measures at the different institutional levels of policies and strategies, institutional arrangements, and financing and programs/projects; and 2) case studies of five countries in Southeast Asia: Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Lao PDR, and Cambodia.
   This analysis shows that the five countries all require various changes at different institutional levels in order to enhance their synergy potentials. The findings indicate the importance of national actors, financial mechanisms, programs, and projects in addressing the three measures. In terms of national actors, Thailand has the highest synergy potential due to its national-level committees and a single ministry that addresses all three measures. To enhance their synergy potentials, the other countries need to create national-level committees that address the three measures, and/or they need to enhance collaboration between the various ministries that represent the environment and forestry issues. At the financing and program/project aspects, Vietnam has the highest synergy potential. The other four countries need to develop common national funds that finance the three measures and/or develop joint programs and projects that address the three measures simultaneously.

TI  - Long-term loblolly pine land use reduces methane and net greenhouse gas emissions in a subtropical Cambisol, despite increasing nitrous oxide
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - circle Key message In loblolly pine land use of 17-32 years following forest clearing, CH(4)consumption and N2O emission diminished by 17 years, due to high soil moisture (similar to 80% WFPS, N2O into N-2), but increased by 32 years, where medium moisture favoured methanotrophy and denitrification into N2O. Soil greenhouse gases (GHG) emission was positive by 17 years, but negative by 32, when soil sequestered carbon. circle Context Much of the role of planted forests in the gaseous soil-atmosphere exchanges in the subtropics remains to be evaluated. circle Aims To assess the impacts of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) on soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes in a subtropical Cambisol. circle Methods Fluxes were monitored over 1 year with static chambers, in forest stands under natural forest (NF) and pine plantation for 17 (P17) and 32 years (P32). circle Results The NF soil showed the lowest N2O emission and the highest CH4 consumption, because of the lowest water-filled pore space (WFPS, < 40%) and highest soil macroporosity. In P17, N2O emission was still low, but CH4 consumption diminished sixfold, possibly because of the predominance of methanotrophy, favoured by the highest WFPS (similar to 80%) and lowest macroporosity that together with low mineral N concentration also did not favour the formation of N2O. In P32, the improved soil mineral N, macroporosity and intermediate WFPS ( similar to 60%) increased CH4 consumption and also N2O emission, in an environment supposedly favourable to methanotrophy and also to N2O production. Considering soil organic carbon (SOC) from a concurrent study, the net GHG emission (Mg C-eq ha(-1) year(-1)) was 2.8 in P17 and - 1.1 in P32. circle Conclusion Soil under pine plantation is the source of GHG in the first rotation (17 years), because of the low CH4 consumption and SOC losses, but soil becomes C sink in the second rotation (32 years), by sequestering SOC and consuming more CH4, despite emitting more N2O.

TI  - Agroforestry transitions: The good, the bad and the ugly
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - This article canvasses the current definitions and framings of ?agroforestry? in different academic literature and policies. Three key framings of ?agroforestry? are identified in the scholarship and explored for their differences. The findings suggest that the distinct schools of research on ?agroforestry? focus on distinct points of departure, and these baseline situations from which transitions to what is called ?agroforestry? occur vary in distinct ways from monoculture plantations to primary forests. Political-economic analysis is used to scrutinize three key ?agroforestry? transition categories: agroecological, agribusiness, and forest degradation, which the article identifies as agroecoforestry (the good), agrobizforestry (the bad), and agrodeforestry (the ugly) transitions, respectively. Examples of each type are provided based on field research in Brazil, and the results are put into a global perspective. The categories are helpful in identifying the ?agroforestry? transitions that are currently marketed as good solutions but might also have negative impacts and in highlighting the agroecological agroforestry transitions that would help simultaneously increase global food production, adapt to and mitigate the climate crisis, and achieve equity and social justice.

TI  - Prioritization of target areas for rehabilitation: A case study from West Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - To rehabilitate degraded forestlands and conserve the remaining forests in Kalimantan, effective measures are needed that accommodate various land uses in the landscape. We present a pragmatic model for prioritizing target areas for rehabilitation and discuss a potential approach, combining traditional reforestation and the forest management methods of local Dayak tribes with the operations of a commercial tree plantation venture, to promote the rehabilitation of elements of the tropical lowland rainforest. We characterized the vegetation and land use in the study area and assume that rehabilitation and conservation value will be maximized by concentrating rehabilitation efforts around forest patches with high cultural and economic value to the local Dayaks. We simulated potential enlargement of these culturally important forests and built a model to calculate a rehabilitation value for each forest fragment and fragment group with easily measurable criteria of vegetation and area. The model gives priority to areas where large continuous areas of culturally important forests already exist and/or will be created. The individual culturally important forest patches and their total area in the landscape are small, but even a small potential enlargement may be enough to establish relatively large concentrations. The potential matrix area for rehabilitation is dominated by young successional woody vegetation. Forested areas, although heavily degraded, connect several culturally important forest concentrations and are the most desirable target for rehabilitation. A well-managed commercial tree plantation can enhance conditions for the protection and rehabilitation of degraded forestlands through traditional reforestation and forest management methods.

TI  - Short-term changes in an ombrophilous atlantic forest
T2  - NATIVA
AB  - Characterizing and monitoring the Brazilian Atlantic Domain provide important direction for the conservation of its remnants. Short-term variations in forest composition and structure are usually lost in larger intervals between inventories and could better elucidate forest dynamics. This study aimed to analyze temporal changes in the structure, floristic composition and diversity of a tree community of an Ombrophilous Dense Forest remnant in Bocaina de Minas, Minas Gerais state, Brazil, in two short intervals. The study was conducted based on circumference at breast height (1.3 m) (CBH) data from three forest inventories (2009, 2011, and 2012) in twelve 400 m (2) permanent plots randomly distributed in the area. The results point out to a forest characterized by the increase in plant density and basal area, mainly due to the continuous local anthropogenic disturbances observed in the area, such as the presence of cattle and trails. These disturbances start early successional processes in various sectors of the forest. The altitudinal gradient leads to great environmental heterogeneity, resulting in a high species turnover, as well as high values of diversity which remained unchanged in the intervals considered.

TI  - Characterization and carbon storage of agroforestry systems in brazilian savannas of Minas Gerais, Brazil
T2  - CIENCIA RURAL
AB  - Agroforestry systems (SAFs) as well as income generation and biodiversity conservation can be an alternative to carbon stocks. The study aimed to characterize and estimate the soil and plant carbon stocks of SAFs in Brazilian savannas of Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Three agroforestry systems and their adjacent native vegetation were evaluated. In addition, the forest inventory, the diameter distribution and vertical stratification of tree species were measured. The SAFs deployed from the management of native vegetation had a plant biodiversity and carbon stock in biomass, litter and soil similar to that of the adjacent area of native vegetation. On the other hand, carbon stocks. in SAF deployed in the area cultivated with annual crops had lower species diversity and carbon stocks in biomass, litter and soil in relation to native vegetation adjacent. Agroforestry systems well managed have carbon stocks and biodiversity of natural resources like native vegetation.

TI  - CARBON STOCK AND ITS COMPARTMENTS IN A SUBTROPICAL OXISOL UNDER LONG-TERM TILLAGE AND CROP ROTATION SYSTEMS
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) plays a crucial role in soil quality and can act as an atmospheric C-CO2 sink under conservationist management systems. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term effects (19 years) of tillage (CT-conventional tillage and NT-no tillage) and crop rotations (R0-monoculture system, R1-winter crop rotation, and R2- intensive crop rotation) on total, particulate and mineral-associated organic carbon (C) stocks of an originally degraded Red Oxisol in Cruz Alta, RS, Southern Brazil. The climate is humid subtropical Cfa 2a (Koppen classification), the mean annual precipitation 1,774 mm and mean annual temperature 19.2 degrees C. The plots were divided into four segments, of which each was sampled in the layers 0-0.05, 0.05-0.10, 0.10-0.20, and 0.20-0.30 m. Sampling was performed manually by opening small trenches. The SOM pools were determined by physical fractionation. Soil C stocks had a linear relationship with annual crop C inputs, regardless of the tillage systems. Thus, soil disturbance had a minor effect on SOM turnover. In the 0-0.30 m layer, soil C sequestration ranged from 0 to 0.51 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), using the CT R0 treatment as base-line; crop rotation systems had more influence on soil stock C than tillage systems. The mean C sequestration rate of the cropping systems was 0.13 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) higher in NT than CT. This result was associated to the higher C input by crops due to the improvement in soil quality under long-term no-tillage. The particulate C fraction was a sensitive indicator of soil management quality, while mineral-associated organic C was the main pool of atmospheric C fixed in this clayey Oxisol. The C retention in this stable SOM fraction accounts for 81 and 89% of total C sequestration in the treatments NT R1 and NT R2, respectively, in relation to the same cropping systems under CT. The highest C management index was observed in NT R2, confirming the capacity of this soil management practice to improve the soil C stock qualitatively in relation to CT R0. The results highlighted the diversification of crop rotation with cover crops as a crucial strategy for atmospheric C-CO2 sequestration and SOM quality improvement in highly weathered subtropical Oxisols.

TI  - Long-term nitrogen fertilization in native pasture with Italian ryegrass introduction - Effects on soil health attribute indicators
T2  - CIENCIA RURAL
AB  - Native pastures are of great importance for cattle and sheep nutrition in the Pampa biome. However, due to its low productivity, the Italian ryegrass introduction and the nitrogen (N) fertilization are alternatives proposed to intensify livestock production in a sustainable manner. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of long-term N application on soil health indicators in a native pasture with Italian ryegrass introduction in southern Brazil. The experiment consists of a secondary native pasture under continuous grazing and constant herbage allowance. In 1996 experimental area was broadcast limed and the experiment was initiated, testing three N topdressing rates (0, 100 and 200kg N ha(-1) year(-1)). In 2010 soil of experimental and reference area of non grazed native grassland was sampled in the soil layers of 0-20 and 20-40cm. Total, particulate and mineral associated carbon (C) and N stocks were evaluated. Soil microbiological attributes were evaluated in 0-5 and 5-10cm soil layers. The long-term N fertilization in soils with native pasture and Italian ryegrass introduction did not affect total C and N stocks. However, increases in N particulate fraction were seen with 100kg ha(-1) year(-1) of N rate of fertilization. Furthermore, the increase in N rates increased N microbial biomass and respiration.

TI  - Market-mediated responses confound policies to limit deforestation from oil palm expansion in Malaysia and Indonesia
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - The global demand for palm oil has grown rapidly over the past several decades. Much of the output expansion has occurred in carbon- and biodiversity-rich forest lands of Malaysia and Indonesia (M&I), contributing to record levels of terrestrial carbon emissions and biodiversity loss. This has led to a variety of voluntary and mandatory regulatory actions, as well as calls for limits on palm oil imports from M&I. This paper offers a comprehensive, global assessment of the economic and environmental consequences of alternative policies aimed at limiting deforestation from oil palm expansion in M&I. It highlights the challenges of limiting forest and biodiversity loss in the presence of market-mediated spillovers into related oilseed and agricultural commodity and factor markets, both in M&I and overseas. Indeed, limiting palm oil production or consumption is unlikely to halt deforestation in M&I in the absence of active forest conservation incentives. Policies aimed at restricting palm oil production in M&I also have broader consequences for the economy, including significant impacts on consumer prices, real wages, and welfare, that vary among different global regions. A crucial distinction is whether the initiative is undertaken domestically, in which case the M&I region could benefit, or by major palm oil importers, in which case M&I loses income. Nonetheless, all policies considered here pass the social welfare test of global carbon dioxide mitigation benefits exceeding their costs.

TI  - Mapping the World's Intact Forest Landscapes by Remote Sensing
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - Protection of large natural forest landscapes is a highly important task to help fulfill different international strategic initiatives to protect forest biodiversity, to reduce carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and to stimulate sustainable forest management practices. This paper introduces a new approach for mapping large intact forest landscapes (IFL), defined as an unbroken expanse of natural ecosystems within areas of current forest extent, without signs of significant human activity, and having an area of at least 500 km(2). We have created a global IFL map using existing fine-scale maps and a global coverage of high spatial resolution satellite imagery. We estimate the global area of IFL within the current extent of forest ecosystems ( forest zone) to be 13.1 million km(2) or 23.5% of the forest zone. The vast majority of IFL are found in two biomes: Dense Tropical and Subtropical Forests (45.3%) and Boreal Forests (43.8%). The lowest proportion of IFL is found in Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests. The IFL exist in 66 of the 149 countries that together make up the forest zone. Three of them-Canada, Russia, and Brazil-contain 63.8% of the total IFL area. Of the world's IFL area, 18.9% has some form of protection, but only 9.7% is strictly protected, i.e., belongs to IUCN protected areas categories I-III. The world IFL map presented here is intended to underpin the development of a general strategy for nature conservation at the global and regional scales. It also defines a baseline for monitoring deforestation and forest degradation that is well suited for use with operational and cost-effective satellite data. All project results and IFL maps are available on a dedicated web site (http://www.intactforests.org).

TI  - Gendered Species Preferences Link Tree Diversity and Carbon Stocks in Cacao Agroforest in Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - LAND
AB  - The degree to which the maintenance of carbon (C) stocks and tree diversity can be jointly achieved in production landscapes is debated. C stocks in forests are decreased by logging before tree diversity is affected, while C stocks in monoculture tree plantations increase, but diversity does not. Agroforestry can break this hysteresis pattern, relevant for policies in search of synergy. We compared total C stocks and tree diversity among degraded forest, complex cacao/fruit tree agroforests, simple shade-tree cacao agroforestry, monoculture cacao, and annual crops in the Konawe District, Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. We evaluated farmer tree preferences and the utility value of the system for 40 farmers (male and female). The highest tree diversity (Shannon-Wiener H index 2.36) and C stocks (282 Mg C ha(-1)) were found in degraded forest, followed by cacao-based agroforestry systems (H index ranged from 0.58-0.93 with C stocks of 75-89 Mg ha(-1)). Male farmers selected timber and fruit tree species with economic benefits as shade trees, while female farmers preferred production for household needs (fruit trees and vegetables). Carbon stocks and tree diversity were positively related (R-2 = 0.72). Adding data from across Indonesia (n = 102), agroforestry systems had an intermediate position between forest decline and reforestation responses. Maintaining agroforestry in the landscape allows aboveground C stocks up to 50 Mg ha(-1) and reduces biodiversity loss. Agroforestry facilitates climate change mitigation and biodiversity goals to be addressed simultaneously in sustainable production landscapes.

TI  - Tree-crop interactions and their environmental and economic implications in the presence of carbon-sequestration payments
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
AB  - The growing emphasis on market-based solutions to environmental problems, both under and outside of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, means that carbon sequestered in the biomass and soils of agroforestry systems is likely to acquire a direct market value. If the incentive provided by carbon markets is large enough, this may alter the economics of growing trees, which is often not an attractive land-use alternative due to high establishment costs and delayed revenues. In this paper, the effect of carbon payments on the economic attractiveness of growing trees is investigated for a tree-crop agroforest in Indonesia using a simulation-modelling approach. An economic model is developed to analyze the economic implications of carbon payments from the standpoint of the individual landholder. The simulation is implemented in WaNuLCAS, a model that accounts for water, nutrients, light and carbon in agroforestry systems. The value of switching from a continuous-cropping system to an agroforestry system participating in carbon trading was estimated at $109 ha(-1) in present value terms. Although these results vary depending on assumptions regarding carbon prices and costs of carbon monitoring, they essentially show that the benefits of participating in markets for carbon sequestration can exceed the costs. The optimal management regime, both with and without carbon payments, was to plant 15% of the area to trees and to adopt a low firewood-harvest regime, with 75% of tree prunings being returned to the soil to restore carbon and nutrients. Approximately 22% of the economic benefits obtained by switching land use were attributed to carbon trading and the remaining 78% were attributed to improvements in land productivity. The paper ends with a brief discussion of the implications of the findings for policy and management. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Collembola community structure under different land management in subtropical Brazil
T2  - ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY
AB  - Tillage systems in conservation agriculture such as no-tillage (NT) and crop-livestock integration (CLI) have been proposed to limit the negative impacts of intensive agriculture. Soil organisms such as Collembola are good indicators because they respond to a variety of environmental and ecological factors and their community structure indicates a change in land management. In this study, we propose to assess the relationships between springtail biodiversity in management systems with a history of NT and CLI. For both management systems, nine points were sampled, distributed in a 30x30m sampling grid, in three municipalities on the Southern Santa Catarina Plateau, Brazil. Springtails were collected using a metal cylinder (5 cm diameterx5 cm deep) and identified at the species level. At the same point, samples were collected to evaluate soil properties (chemical, physical and microbiological). In total, 538 individuals were collected, distributed in 24 species, 293 individuals (18 species) in NT and 245 individuals (17 species) in the CLI system. Soil management systems studied did not affect the total number of individuals and richness. The NT system had a greater association with epigeic species, while the CLI system was more associated with hemiedaphic and edaphic species, which is related to the site-specific differences in soil conditions. In both soil management systems, the species were influenced by a range of soil properties. The species Isotomurus sp. 1 and Lepidocyrtus sp. 1 were more influenced by soil properties in the NT system, while the species Proisotoma sp. 1, Sminthurinus sp. 1 and Tullbergia antarctica were more influenced by soil properties in the CLI system, compared to the others. Collembola community structure and species diversity were modified by the soil management systems. Our results suggest that the Collembola community may indicate changes across land management systems in conservation agriculture.

TI  - Utility of landscape mosaics and boundaries in forest conservation decision making in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB  - We evaluated changes in the Atlantic Forest landscape over the last 40 years based on changes in boundaries and mosaics, including the hypothetical landscape resulting from the application of Brazilian laws for forest protection. Mosaics were identified as sets of land-use patches with a similar pattern of boundaries. Landscapes of different years, therefore, can be distinguished by differences in mosaics. We developed a technique to identify boundaries between patches from land-use maps using ArcGis(A (R)) and to build the patch x boundary matrix required for mosaic identification by means of a factorial and cluster analysis. The mosaics were characterized by some key uses as well as by their boundaries with other land uses. The mosaics were scored for forest conservation according to five issues: landscape permeability, cover, availability, quality, and fragmentation of forest. The values were based on land use and boundary patterns. Although Brazilian laws regarding forest protection have promoted conservation and the hypothetical legal landscape has presented the highest forest habitat availability, this expansion perpetuates a boundary pattern that complicates conservation and management, thus increasing the pressure on forest patches and favoring the further fragmentation of protected forest patches. These conclusions cannot be reached by simply recording changes in land uses.

TI  - Soil Organic Carbon in Forest and Other Land Use Types at Bengkulu City, Indonesia
T2  - JURNAL MANAJEMEN HUTAN TROPIKA
AB  - Conversion of natural forest into agricultural land uses has decreased soil organic carbon (SOC) and increased carbon emission into the atmosphere, but proper management of agricultural land can sequester carbon from the atmosphere and increase the SOC This study was conducted to estimate the SOC content and storage in a forest, agroforestry land, oil palm plantation, and agricultural experimental field and to analyze the correlation between the SOC and other soil characteristics at Bengkulu City, Indonesia. Soil were sampled from the . following depths: 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm, and 20-30 cm. The biomass of litter and ground cover was also sampled. This study found that the forest had the highest average SOC content from the three depths, and 0-30 cm depth SOC storage, while the agroforestry system had the lowest of both SOC content and storage. The 0-10 cm depth had the highest SOC content and storage, while the 20-30 cm depth had the lowest of both variables. The SOC was positively correlated with litter biomass, field capacity, exchangeable potassium, cation exchange capacity, and negatively correlated with bulk density and exchangeable calcium, but not correlated with total nitrogen and available phosphorus. High litter biomass input is the key to the maintenance of high SOC.

TI  - Spatial analyses of the phylogenetic diversity of Minaria (Apocynaceae): assessing priority areas for conservation in the Espinhaco Range, Brazil
T2  - SYSTEMATICS AND BIODIVERSITY
AB  - The protection of areas that shelter high evolutionary diversity represented by geographically and phylogenetically isolated lineages is becoming an important conservation strategy. Nevertheless, the spatial distribution of this component of biodiversity is still unknown for most groups, which limits its application for selecting priority areas to conserve. In the present study, we reconstructed the phylogeny of Minaria (Apocynaceae) based on plastid (trnH-psbA, rps16, trnS-trnG and trnD-trnT) and nuclear (ITS and ETS) DNA markers and 34 morphological characters, and analysed the geographic distribution of the phylogenetic diversity (PD) and endemism (PE) in this genus. Minaria includes 21 species that are highly concentrated in the Espinhaco Range, in eastern Brazil, most of which (similar to 75%) are narrowly distributed. The spatial analyses of PD and PE of Minaria indicate four evolutionary relevant areas in this region. The Serra do Cipo and the Diamantina Plateau contain 10 endemic species and present the highest levels of PD. However, the two other areas also deserve special attention. Rio de Contas has high levels of PE, because of two endemic sister species that represent a phylogenetically isolated lineage and the Southern Espinhaco Range houses the most critically endangered species of the genus. Most endemic species of Minaria occur in vegetation islands on rocky outcrops (campos rupestres). These low-fuel areas are less susceptible to fire, suggesting that the Espinhaco Range has served as a historical refuge for fire-sensitive lineages. Our results suggest that conservation units in the Espinhaco Range cover a great proportion of the evolutionary diversity of Minaria and that fire management is probably an important strategy to preserve this endemic biodiversity.

TI  - Quantifying responses of dung beetle assemblages to cattle grazing removal over a short-term in introduced Brazilian pastures
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Pasture management techniques may affect the biodiversity of insects beneficial to pastures, such as dung beetles. Cattle grazing removal over a short-term is widely used in introduced Brazilian pastures. However, the impact of this management on dung beetles is still unknown. This study evaluated the taxonomic (species richness, abundance, biomass, species composition, Shannon, and Simpson indexes) and functional (functional richness FRic, functional dispersion FDis, functional evenness FEve, and community-weighted means of trait values CWMs) dung beetle assemblages response to cattle grazing removal over a short-in introduced pastures. We sampled dung beetles, with pitfall traps baited with cattle dung and carrion, simultaneously in pastures with constant cattle grazing (control), and one, three, and five months after cattle grazing removal in Aquidauana, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Taxonomic metrics and FRic, FDis, and FEve did not differ among control and pasture treatments. We found that pastures with one month of cattle removal maintain the same CWM coprophagous diet from the control, and higher CWM biomass in relation to control. Although cattle grazing removal, at least over the short-term, does not cause a negative impact on dung beetle taxonomic metrics and functional diversity indexes, two important traits associated to dung removal are negatively affected after three months of cattle removal. Thus, we suggest that one month of cattle removal to grazing rotational management in introduced Brazilian pastures can be a useful strategy to, besides conserving the grass, also conserving dung beetle diversity, and consequently the ecological functions performed by them.

TI  - Mite fauna associated with different environments in the Southern Pampa, Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACAROLOGY
AB  - The Brazilian Pampa is predominantly composed of native grasslands with riparian forest formations. It preserves a rich biodiversity and provides vast biological resources for economic uses. The objectives of this study were to compare the mite fauna composition on plants in three environments i.e. grassland, grazing exclusions, and riparian forest; to relate mites with microclimatic factors, and to evaluate interactions between mites and vascular plants. Data analysis was based mainly on the relationship between mite and plant species. A total of 117 mite species were collected, most of which were phytophagous (57%). Our studies revealed that mite communities from riparian forest differ from grazing exclusions and grasslands. Grassland and grazing exclusions were dominated by two species i.e. Brevipalpus sp2 and Tydeus californicus (Banks). In the riparian forest, the most abundant species was Lorryia formosa (Cooreman). In conclusion, mites represent environmental indicators of microclimatic factors and landscape. All the sampling sites had high interaction between mites and plants.

TI  - Reemergence of Yellow Fever in Brazil: The Role of Distinct Landscape Fragmentation Thresholds
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Yellow Fever Virus (YFV) reemergence in Brazil was followed by human suffering and the loss of biodiversity of neotropical simians on the Atlantic coast. The underlying mechanisms were investigated with special focus on distinct landscape fragmentation thresholds in the affected municipalities. An ecological study in epidemiology is employed to assess the statistical relationship between events of YFV and forest fragmentation in municipal landscapes. Negative binomial regression model showed that highly fragmented forest cover was associated with an 85% increase of events of YFV in humans and simians (RR = 1.85, CI 95% = 1.24-2.75, p=0.003) adjusted by vaccine coverage, population size, and municipality area. Intermediate levels of forest cover combined with higher levels of forest edge densities contribute to the YFV dispersion and the exponential growth of YF cases. Strategies for forest conservation are necessary for the control and prevention of YF and other zoonotic diseases that can spillover from the fragmented forest remains to populated cities of the Brazilian Atlantic coast.

TI  - Assessing the Most Irreplaceable Protected Areas for the Conservation of Mammals in the Atlantic Forest: Lessons for the Governance of Mosaics
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - We have gathered 21,353 records of 40 different medium- and large-sized species of mammals existing in the Atlantic Forest conservation units of Brazil, including full protection and sustainable use types of management. We have classified the conservation units by their irreplaceability in terms of their role in the protection of mammalian species. Most irreplaceable conservation units are concentrated in the southern and southeastern regions of Brazil, mainly in the states of Rio de Janeiro, SAo Paulo and Parana. Our data show that over and above the area of the conservation unit or its type of use, protection of its surroundings appears to be of most consequence. Therefore, it is essential to develop effective mosaic governance mechanisms that include protected areas and different types of land use. However, it is also necessary to establish common ground that allows the coexistence of human economic demands and wildlife preservation.

TI  - Human activities and forest fires in Indonesia: An analysis of the Bromo incident and implications for conservation tourism
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
AB  - This study delves into the Bromo magnitude of the fire incident in Indonesia, a notable tourism destination, uncovering significant gaps in knowledge regarding tourist-induced forest fires. We comprehensively analyze the incident's environmental, economic, social, and tourism impacts. Environmentally, the fire caused severe damage to the region's ecosystems, upsetting ecological balances and diminishing air quality. This has farreaching effects on flora, fauna, and the sustainability of natural resources. Forest fires release a significant amount of pollutants into the air, including carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, and other harmful compounds. These pollutants can significantly degrade air quality, leading to health issues for humans and animals. The forest fire in the Bromo region of Indonesia had a profound impact, both economically and environmentally. The closure of the Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park drastically reduced tourism, leading to an 80 % drop in hotel occupancy and severe losses for local businesses like jeep rentals, eateries, and souvenir shops. Economically, this resulted in a significant decrease in Non-Tax State Revenue. Environmentally, the fire destroyed over 50 hectares of land, severely damaging the national park's ecosystems and affecting biodiversity. The smoke and heat from the fire also led to poor air quality and potential health risks for local residents, as well as adverse effects on nearby agriculture, increasing stress and anxiety in the community.. The study emphasizes the urgent need for stringent regulations, effective community engagement, and educational initiatives in forest conservation areas, particularly those attracting tourists. Our findings offer critical insights for policymakers, local authorities, and stakeholders in the tourism sector, highlighting the necessity of balancing environmental protection with the growth of the global travel industry.

TI  - Soil organic carbon dynamics following afforestation of degraded pastures with eucalyptus in southeastern Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Afforestation of degraded pastures can potentially enhance carbon sequestration, but little is known about the effects of eucalyptus plantations on soil organic matter (SOM) fractions. We used density and particle size SOM fractionations to evaluate changes in SOM for a chronosequence of eucalyptus plantations established on degraded pastures in two contrasting regions in southeastern Brazil. Declines in the content of soil C derived from the pasture (C4 photosynthetic pathway) and the accumulation of that derived from the eucalyptus (C3 photosynthetic pathway) were followed through 13 C natural abundance of the SOM. The two study areas were in the Rio Doce River Valley, Minas Gerais State, namely: 1, Belo Oriente (BO, a region with lower elevation, higher mean annual temperature, lower forest productivities and dominated by clayey Typic Haplustoxs); 2, Virginopolis (VG, a region of higher elevation, higher forest productivities and dominated by clayey Rhodic Ustoxs). In the BO region the chronosequence included 0, 4.2, 13.2, 22.2, 32.0 and 34.2 years of eucalyptus cultivation and in the VG region soils were cultivated with eucalyptus for 0, 8.2, 19.2, 29.2 and 33.2 years. The accumulated cultivation time corresponds to about five rotations. In both regions the initial soil condition was represented by a site that was still under pasture. Soil samples collected at 0-10 and 10-20 cm depths were analyzed for: total organic carbon (TOC); C in the fulvic (FAF), humic (HAF) and humin (HF) fractions; C in the free (FLF) and occluded (OLF) light fractions; C associated with the heavy fractions, namely, the sand (SF), silt plus clay (S + CF) and clay (CF) fractions; and C in the microbial biomass (MB). Carbon stocks of virtually all SOM fractions were about twice as high in the VG region than in the BO region. Eucalyptus cultivation in the BO region increased C stocks in all SOM fractions, except for the MB fraction that was not altered and the SF fraction that declined with time of eucalyptus cultivation. Increases in TOC, FAF and HF organic C fractions were observed in the VG region. Mean annual accumulations across the entire cultivation period in the 0-10 cm soil layer showed virtually no difference averaging 0.22 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) for the BO region and 0.23 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) for the VG region. However, gains of TOC peaked by the end of the third rotation in the BO region and the second rotation in the VG region, so the TOC accumulation rate during the respective aggrading periods would correspond to 0.35 and 0.57 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). There was no clear evidence that the more labile, fast cycling SOM fractions were more sensitive indicators of the impact of eucalyptus cultivation in the BO region, whereas in the VG region the FLF and OLF were more sensitive to the land use change than TOC.

TI  - Carbon neutral? No change in mineral soil carbon stock under oil palm plantations derived from forest or non-forest in Indonesia
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Sustainability criteria for palm oil production guide new planting toward non-forest land cover on mineral soil, avoiding carbon debts caused by forest and peat conversion. Effects on soil carbon stock (soil C-stock) of land use change trajectories from forest and non-forest to oil palm on mineral soils include initial decline and subsequent recovery, however modeling efforts and life-cycle accounting are constrained by lack of comprehensive data sets; only few case studies underpin current debate. We analyzed soil C-stock (Mg ha(-1)), soil bulk density (BD, g cm(-3)) and soil organic carbon concentration (C-org, %) from 155 plots in 20 oil palm plantations across the major production areas of Indonesia, identifying trends during a production cycle on 6 plantations with sufficient spread in plot age. Plots were sampled in four management zones: weeded circle (WC), interrow (IR), frond stacks (FS), and harvest paths (HP); three depth intervals 0-5, 5-15 and 15-30 cm were sampled in each zone. Compared to the initial condition, increases in Core (16.2%) and reduction in BD (8.9%) in the FS zone, was compensated by decrease in C-org (21.4%) and increase in BD (6.6%) in the HP zone, with intermediate results elsewhere. For a weighted average of the four management zones and after correction for equal mineral soil basis, the net temporal trend in soil C-stock in the top 30 cm of soil across all data was not significantly different from zero in both forest- and non-forest-derived oil palm plantations. Individual plantations experienced net decline, net increase or U-shaped trajectories. The 2% difference in mean soil C-stock in forest and non-forest derived oil palm plantations was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Unless soil management changes strongly from current practice, it is appropriate for C footprint calculations to assume soil C-stock neutrality on mineral soils used for oil palm cultivation.

TI  - RICHNESS AND FLORISTIC COMPOSITION OF THE FERN COMMUNITY IN RIPARIAN FOREST OF THE RIVER 'CADEIA', IN RIO GRANDE DO SUL STATE, BRAZIL
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
AB  - The present study analyzed richness and specific composition of the fern community in fragments from the riparian forest of river 'Cadeia', under different levels of human impact, in Santa Maria do Herval, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. An amount of 120 sample units were delimited, equitably distributed in three fragments (FI, II and III) in which all species were surveyed and the richness was recorded. The floristic composition among fragments was compared using Jaccard's index and spatial distribution of units was evaluated through multidimensional scaling. Richness data were presented in the form of rarefaction curves based on samples and non-parametric diversity estimators. A total of 40 species were found, belonging to 13 families. The greater floristic similarity was between FI and FII. Sample units from FI formed the most defined grouping and they had more exclusive species than the others. The rarefaction curve for the total sampling almost reached the asymptote and estimators indicated a maximum of 45 species, which means that the majority of species was surveyed at the study site. A decreasing gradient of mean richness per unit was observed as the urbanization increased in the matrix habitat of the fragments. These results form a data base to be used in management, conservation and reforestation measures in degraded riparian forests. They can be directly compared to results from other studies that used rarefaction and richness estimators, which is not possible to do with many of the surveys accomplished in Brazil so far.

TI  - Spatially explicit simulations of soil C dynamics in Southern Brazil: Integrating century and GIS with i_Century
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in agricultural soils requires appropriate cropping systems and conservation practices that increase crop biomass production. No tillage agriculture provides several advantages to establish "carbon friendly" production systems. Conservation agriculture has greatly expanded over the past three decades in the North Central region of Rio Grande de Sul, the southernmost state of Brazil, with about 6 million ha of land under dryland grain crop agriculture. A shift from intensive conventional tillage to mulch tillage and then no tillage has resulted in increased SOC levels across much of the region as verified in field measurements. In this study a modeling system was constructed by coupling the interactive Century (i_Century) software running Century 4.0 and ArcGIS data layers to simulate the long-term SOC trends in the Ibiruba region, which occupies a land area of 83,500 ha. This system was capable of accounting for cropping system and management practices trends from 1900 to the present times, as well as simulating projections out to the year 2050, capturing periods of decreasing or increasing SOC trends. Simulations performed with the modeling system show that SOC stocks in lbiruba, estimated at 5.05 Tg C before human activity, decreased to 3.71 Tg C (31%) by 1985. An estimated recovery to 3.97 Tg C by 2005 in response to adoption of SOC-enhancing practices such as conservation tillage and no tillage was observed. Simulations to 2050 with maintenance of these cropping systems and soil management showed that total C stocks could reach 4.21 Tg C, which would still be 21% less than originally present in those soils. The integration of Century with GIS was greatly expedited with the use of the i_Century interface and its readily-accessible database format. Data transfer between the modeling and geoprocessing environment was facilitated for quick visualization and further processing. This approach can be applied for carbon monitoring and accounting schemes at several scales, from the field to the national level. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Timber plantations, international markets, and forest conservation
T2  - PORTLAND'99: PIONEERING NEW TRAILS, PROCEEDINGS
CP  - 1999 Society-of-American-Foresters National Convention on Pioneering New Trails
AB  - This paper explores the impact of timber plantations on major forest products markets and forest conservation through 2010. Already producing an estimated 27% of the world's industrial roundwood, timber plantations have the potential to produce much more over the coming decades (Brown 1998). They have affected the global pattern of timber production and trade, as is evident from the emergence in the 1980s of Brazil, Chile, and New Zealand as major timber exporters. In addition to supplying wood, timber plantations pose important social and environmental questions. Critics of plantations cite their negative impacts on indigenous people, biodiversity, and hydrologic conditions. Others argue in defense of plantations that they can diminish harvest pressure on native forests and mitigate global warming by storing carbon.
   Given the poor quality of available information on the world's timber plantation resource, analysis of their future impact is necessarily tentative. This research explores this impact in two ways. First, results from a market simulation model are used to gauge the impact of increasing plantation growth rates due to increased management effort. Comparing model simulation results under two scenarios, one with plantation yields continuing at current levels and one with yields increasing at 3% per year, provides an estimate of plantations' potential impact on global timber production and trade through 2010. Results suggest that Global production of industrial roundwood rises a modest 1%, as an average timber price drop of 3% encourages more use of industrial roundwood. More abundant raw material supplies in the High Growth scenario reduce the price of manufactured goods an average of 1%. The higher growth rate on plantations is more than enough to offset increased timber harvest, resulting in a global increase in timber inventory of 1%. At the world level, higher plantation yields have little impact on total trade, the most significant difference being a 2% increase in pulpwood trade. Large increases in New Zealand's coniferous sawlog exports are offset by reductions in exports from Canada, Chile, and Western Europe. Forest products manufacturing in 2010 is slightly higher amid generally lower commodity prices, reflecting more abundant raw material supplies. In every country, timber inventory in 2010 is at least as high under the High Growth scenario as. under the Base Case. In sum, results of the High Growth scenario for 2010 project modest increases (relative to the Base Case) in timber production, lower prices of both raw wood and of manufactured products, and higher levels of timber inventory in 2010.
   Another means of assessing the impact of plantation production in the near future is to compare model projections of industrial roundwood production with an independent estimate of timber plantation yield in 2010. The difference between total projected industrial roundwood production and estimated plantation yield provides an estimate of harvest on native forests. At the world level, projected increases in plantation yields are insufficient to prevent progressively greater harvest of native timber. Only Indonesia, Malaysia, and Chile produce less timber from native forests in 2010 than in 1995. China, Brazil, and the United States all produce substantially more native forest timber in 2010. This simple comparison suggests that plantation timber is likely to gain a larger share of the timber market in several important Asian and Latin American countries, but the increase will be enough to reduce native forest harvest in few.
   Many have argued that by providing an alternative source of fiber, plantations support forest conservation. However, the distribution of conditions favorable to plantation forestry is very unequal across countries. Wood properties and log size are two important obstacles to the substitution of plantation wood for native timber. To some extent, technological change and plantation growth are working against these limitations.
   Environmental objections to plantation wood may also limit its substitution for wood from native forests. Sometimes plantation establishment is itself the cause of native forest clearing, though there is dispute about the extent of this practice. Even if plantations are established by forest conversion, their high productivity may obviate the need for some harvest on remaining native forests. But reducing the need for timber production on native forests does not necessarily protect those forests. The role of logging in forest degradation and conversion is complicated, but the main causes of forest destruction are agriculture and human settlements (Kaimowitz and Angelsen 1998). By reducing the timber value of native forests, plantations may make forestry less attractive relative to other land uses, adding to the incentive for conversion. The contribution of plantations to forest conservation is therefore likely to be largely a function of public policy.

TI  - Evaluating the impacts and conservation value of exotic and native tree afforestation in Cerrado grasslands using dung beetles
T2  - INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY
AB  - . 1. Although plantation forests are being established at an increasing rate, their effects on biodiversity are still debated. 2. Native candeias [Eremanthus erythropappus (DC.) Mac Leish] and exotic eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp.) have recently been planted on Cerrado grasslands. The Cerrado is the second largest biome of Brazil and one of the most threatened savanna ecosystems. 3. Here, we use dung beetles (Scarabaeinae) to investigate the effects of the land-use changes associated to afforestation on Cerrado insect biodiversity. We sampled dung beetles in candeia (4- and 6-year-old) and eucalyptus plantations (1- and 4-year-old), natural candeia formations (candeiais), native grasslands and natural forests. 4. Dung beetle diversity in plantations was lower than in grasslands and forests, but was not different from diversity in natural candeiais. Candeia and 1-year-old eucalyptus plantations, grasslands and natural candeiais all had similar community composition, distinct from natural forests. Four-year-old eucalyptus plantations were intermediate between those two groups. Overall, afforestation was detrimental for dung beetles. 5. Differences between exotic and native plantations were only apparent in older plantations, and seemed to be due to differences associated to canopy openness rather than to the origin of the planted species. Candeia plantations were of better conservation value for open-area species (62% species shared between grasslands and candeia plantation) whereas eucalyptus plantations were so for forest species (26% species shared between forests and eucalyptus plantations). We recommend considering this result before deciding where to plant which species.

TI  - EFFECTS OF URBAN SPRAWL ON FOREST CONSERVATION IN A METROPOLITAN WATER SOURCE AREA
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
AB  - The clearing of native vegetation in water source areas and its effects on water supply availability have become a major concern in large metropolises. This study examined the spatial and temporal changes in land use and cover and their effects on the conservation of Atlantic Forest in a water source area in the Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo that is the second most densely populated territory in Brazil, the municipality of Diadema. Historical maps and trend scenarios were developed by applying the Markov chain in association with cellular automata. Forest conservation was assessed based on a set of landscape metrics of resource availability, fragment isolation, and trends of forest fragmentation. Our findings revealed an increase in urban growth of 37% in the last five decades directly associated to the clearing of 50% of forests in intermediate/advanced stages and 40% in early stages. The main drivers of landscape change were human-modified fields (41%) and net roads (54%). Optimal resource availability was drastically reduced (75%) while isolation increased (361.5%) among existing forest fragments. Therefore, future trends indicate that, without changes in the management of the area, deforestation may occur rapidly and continuously until 10% of forest remains, leading to potential adverse effects on water availability and quality of the Billings Reservoir and the local biodiversity.

TI  - Assessing fire risk and safeguarding Brazil's biomes: a Multifactorial Approach
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
AB  - Forests in Brazil play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance and the environment, but this has been threatened by deforestation, forest fires, and the effects of climate change. Among these, forest fire has happened frequently in areas where there have been changes in land use for activities of agriculture and livestock farming, that motivate the destruction of forests particularly in biomes like the Amazon and Cerrado. In those biomes, the forest fires initiated to clear land for pasture are the most worrying because promote ecological and socioeconomic consequences, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and impacts the regional flora and biogeochemical cycles. As a strategy to understand and identify areas at risk of forest fires, this study aimed to develop a risk zoning framework for fire hotspots in the biomes of Brazilians. This framework combines multiple variables, incorporating factors like physical terrain, land use, and climatic data, to assess the potential fire risk. The areas with greater fire risk are located in the Caatinga, Cerrado, and Pantanal biomes, in which the physical and climate variables influence directly in incidence and propagation of fire. In the Amazon biome there is a fire risk, some possibly intentional, but can be regulated by elevated precipitation in the region. The identification of areas at high fire risk allows the implementation of proactive strategies for fire prevention for safeguarding Brazil's biomes and ecosystems, which are integral to the environment and biodiversity.

TI  - Large trees as key elements of carbon storage and dynamics after selective logging in the Eastern Amazon
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The long term effect of Reduced-Impact Logging (RIL) on above-ground live biomass (AGB) dynamics was investigated in 18 1-ha logged over permanent sample plots set up in a ten-afirme rain forest in the Eastern Amazon (Brazil, Paragominas). Both tree survival and growth were investigated among three Diameter at Breath Height (DBH) classes (20-40,40-60, >= 60 cm) to assess the contribution of each DBH class to the post-logging AGB recovery. Before logging, mean tree density and AGB per plot (dbh >= 20 cm) were 187 +/- 14 trees ha(-1) and 377.6 +/- 62.8 Mg ha(-1) respectively. Although big trees (dbh >= 60 cm) only represented 93% of the total tree density, they gathered almost half of total AGB. During the post-logging period (8 years), the mortality of large trees was found to drive the annual net changes and largely overcame the AGB gain in the smaller DBH classes. Indeed, plots with high post-logging mortality of large trees showed negative carbon balance t over the study period (8 years). The over mortality of large trees injured by logging contributed significantly to the annual AGB losses (up to 40%) in the first years after logging. Due to the overwhelming importance of this size class in carbon stocks and dynamic, reducing logging damages and intensity might have great impact in the post-logging biomass dynamics. We estimated that reducing logging intensity from 6 to 3 stems ha(-1) would save 27.7 Mg C ha(-1) for a 35 years rotation cycle. To compensate this loss of profits, compensatory payments of avoided CO2 emission should worth US $ 6.5/Mg of CO2. This price falls into the range of prices of the international carbon market. Sustainable forest management aiming at enhancing carbon stocks could therefore promote the preservation of the large trees. At our study site, we recommend the adoption of a maximum diameter cutting limit of 110 cm. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Animal production from tree-pasture association systems in Brazil
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE XIX INTERNATIONAL GRASSLAND CONGRESS: GRASSLAND ECOSYSTEMS: AN OUTLOOK INTO THE 21ST CENTURY
CP  - 19th International Grassland Congress
AB  - Agroforestry systems (AFS) in general and silvipastoral systems (SPS) in particular, have been studied intensively in Brazil since the 1980's. The majority of the research work has been conducted in the wet tropical Amazon region, in the semi-arid conditions of the Northeast, and under subtropical soil and climatic conditions in the Southeast or in the South. Research emphasis has been placed on interactions between the main components of AFS: tree, pasture, soil and microclimatic elements. Evaluation of animal performance in SPS generally has not been the main objective of experiments. A recent survey of research on SPS using Eucalyptus spp. in Brazil, showed that only 6.5% of the references in such articles pertained to the productive performance of sheep and beef cattle under grazing (Couto et al., 1998). In the Tropics, the native rain forest is the most important arboreal substrate, because it has to be preserved for environmental and biodiversity maintenance. Accordingly, research has focused on identification of either native or exotic timber tree/palm tree species to be used in SPS. At the present time, SPS using species of Pinus, rubber tree, mango tree, brazilian chestnut tree and coconut tree are common in this region. Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu, B. humidicola, Paspalum atratum BRA-009610, Desmodium ovalifolium CIAT-350, Pueraria phaseoloides BRA-0612 and Centrosema macrocarpum CIAT-5065 are some of the shade tolerant forage species showing promise for SPS in the Amazon region. In the Caatinga ecosystem, in the Northeast, research has shown that browsing of native shrubs associated with the utilization of Leucaena leucocephala protein bank and/or buffelgrass pasture allows substantial increases of liveweight gain or milk production by sheep, goats and dairy cows. In the Southeast region, in Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo states, SPS consist mainly in the association of Eucalyptus spp and Panicum maximum. Studies involving two-year-old eucalypt plantations showed that sheep or beef calves grazing P maximum cv. Coloniao allowed from 52 to 93% reduction of forest establishment and maintenance costs, as a result of selling animal products and reduction of grass competition by grazing. In the South, the most important exotic arboreal materials are Eucalyptus, Pinus and Acacia species, while Mimosa scabrella and Araucaria angustifolia are potential useful native trees. Species of Trifolium and annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) mixtures have been used as cool-season pastures while P. maximum cultivars and B. brizantha cv. Marandu are used as warm-season pasture grasses. Beef calf liveweight gains on SPS consistently outyielded those obtained by grazing the native pasture in full sunlight, at two locations in Rio Grande do Sul state.
   Although there is a reasonable amount of information on the establishment and management of SPS within each ecoclimatic brazilian region, the level of adoption of this new technology at the farm level is still considered very low. The benefits and possible eventual adverse consequences of the tree x pasture association on animal production, along with a discussion of the future prospects of research and potential adoption of SPS in Brazil are addressed in this paper.

TI  - Do we need intervention after pine tree removal? The use of different management techniques to enhance Cerrado natural regeneration
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Some Cerrado areas are suppressed by pine tree cultivation. These monoculture processes can exclude the fire presence and inhibit native species development. In Southeastern Brazil, thousands of hectares were planted with these exotic trees 44 years ago, and nowadays, efforts to remove these plantations and restore the native vegetation are being implemented. However, little is known about the regeneration of Cerrado after pine removal. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the native plant community of Cerrado, using some techniques to enhance species natural regeneration three years after pine trees removal in areas where plantations existed since 1966. Before treatments application, surveys of the herbaceous and woody community were conducted, followed by the treatment application (fire and the removal of needles) as a management intervention. Moreover, we established control plots, with no intervention. Four and 30 months after treatment application, the herbaceous and woody vegetation, as well as the dead biomass and bare soil components were monitored to observe their regeneration. The pine removal contributed to species development and both techniques contributed to soil exposition, opening space for colonization and species to resprout. The woody and herbaceous group increased in cover, mostly in fire plots, due to the soil exposition increasing light and contributing to species development.

TI  - Landscape and farm-level management for conservation of potential pollinators in Indonesian cocoa agroforests
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.), a major commodity globally, depends on insects for pollination. However, the cocoa pollinator identity is largely unknown and there are important knowledge gaps regarding landscape and farmlevel management driving pollinators. Here we analyzed flower visitation with two approaches to quantify how landscape and farm-level factors affect potential pollinators (flower visitors) of cocoa in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. In the first approach (landscape and farm-level) we selected 18 farms and focused on the relative importance of distance to forest (m), potential-pollinator habitats surrounding the farm (i.e. secondary forests and cocoa agroforests [%]), canopy cover (%), leaf-litter amount (kg/m2), and cocoa flower abundance for flower visitors. In the second approach (experimental farm management) we manipulated leaf-litter in 24 farms, because high leaf-litter is suggested to enhance flower visitors. We found that ants and Diptera were the most common flower visitors, and although previous studies suggest ceratopogonids as main cocoa pollinators, none were captured in this study. In the landscape and farm-level approach, potential-pollinator habitats surrounding the farm, and increased canopy cover enhanced ant and Diptera abundance, whereas distance to forest had no effect. In the experimental farm management approach, potential-pollinator habitats surrounding the farm rather than leaf-litter manipulation increased Diptera and ant abundance. In summary conservation of forests and agroforests surrounding the farm, maintaining canopy cover and minimum leaf-litter enhance cocoa flower visitors. Thus, farms with shade trees embedded in a biodiversity-friendly landscape are important for conservation of potential pollinators and pollination services and, thereby, promotion of sustainable cocoa.

TI  - Difficult times for amphibians: Effects of land-use change at the local and landscape scales in the Ibera Wetlands
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Land-use change and management practices have led to habitat loss, one of the greatest factors in biodiversity decline. Particularly, amphibians comprise the highest number of threatened vertebrate species at the global scale. In this work, amphibian communities were analysed in three differing landscapes: a protected wetland, a livestock-impaired rangeland and a pine afforestation. In each landscape, amphibian species were sampled. Land cover type and composition, as well as primary vegetation types were characterised at the landscape and local scale, respectively. The relationship between these environmental variables and the amphibian communities was analysed. Twenty-one amphibian species were identified; the protected and afforested landscapes were the richest, whereas the rangeland showed the lowest species richness and diversity estimates. At the local scale, vegetation, water coverage and land-use category explained the higher presence of amphibian species and their abundance. These results show how different land-uses, especially livestock farming, modify the composition of amphibian communities. This work constitutes a foundation for the development of sustainable management practices for conserving amphibians in landscape-level altered habitats.

TI  - Examining the Adequacy of Legal and Institutional Frameworks of Land and Forest Fire Management from National to Community Levels in Indonesia
T2  - DISASTER RISK REDUCTION IN INDONESIA: PROGRESS, CHALLENGES, AND ISSUES
AB  - Land and forest fires are increasingly becoming annual disasters in Indonesia and have a significant impact on biodiversity, health, the economy and carbon dioxide emissions. Human activities such as the clearing of forests and land for plantations and agriculture have been attributed as the major causes of these fires. They have also been associated with the impacts of El-Nino.
   This chapter aims to examine the adequacy of current legal and institutional frameworks for land and forest fire risk management (LFFRM) in Indonesia, from the national to local level, through utilizing a disaster risk management approach, and thereby assess progress and challenges in managing land and forest fires during the prevention and mitigation, emergency response and post-fires rehabilitation and recovery phases. This study involves a literature review of related government regulations and academic publications, as well as interviews with government officials, the community and NGOs at the local level, conducted in two provinces: South Sumatra and Central Kalimantan.
   The study has three major findings. First, the institutional and regulatory framework for managing land/peatland fires is not integrated with that of forest fires. Second, a lack of law enforcement hinders prevention and mitigation. Third, current institutional and regulatory frameworks are still very much focused on emergency response. Moreover, progress is slower at lower levels of governance and community livelihood has failed to be integrated into the process. We recommend that governments, from the national to sub-national and local levels, develop a more comprehensive and multi-sectoral approach with community-based livelihood activities at its core, and commit to stricter law enforcement, especially for those private sector companies responsible for large-scale fires.

TI  - Managing forest plantation landscapes for water conservation
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Forest ecosystems play an important role in water conservation yet forest plantations are considered detrimental because of their high water use. The current worldwide trends of reduction in natural forest and expansion of forest plantations increases the need for forest managers to contribute to water conservation, implementing management plans that integrate economic (productivity and growth), social (equity of access to water and land-use conflicts) and environmental (climate change and biodiversity impacts) factors. In this paper, we show examples of forest management alternatives at macro- and meso-scales that could contribute to improve water conservation in forest plantation landscapes. At the macroscale, we assess water use in different forest plantation areas in Brazil by analyzing the theoretical thresholds for the management of evapotranspiration. Then, using data from an experimental catchment, we modeled water yield reduction by a forest plantation over multiple years and assessed how different meso-scale forest plantation management alternatives affected water flow regulation. Results show that at a macroscale it is important to consider the natural climatic constraints of water availability. Evidence shows that forest plantations in the tropics use water according to its availability, and the appropriate choice of species/varieties and associated forest management options are crucial for water conservation. At the meso-scale we found that the proportion of native forest plays an important role in the reduction and regulation of water use, and therefore a system of mosaic management may be able to stabilize water flow across plantation landscapes.

TI  - Distribution of oxidizable organic C fractions in soils under cacao agroforestry systems in Southern Bahia, Brazil
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Agroforestry systems can play a major role in the sequestration of carbon (C) because of their higher input of organic material to the soil. The importance of organic carbon to the physical, chemical, and biological aspects of soil quality is well recognized. However, total organic carbon measurements might not be sensitive indicators of changes in soil quality. Adoption of procedures that can extract the more labile fraction preferentially might be a more useful approach for the characterization of soil organic carbon resulting from different soils. This study aimed to evaluate organic carbon (C) fractions distribution in different soil layers up to 50 cm depth in two soil orders under cacao (Theobroma cacao) agroforestry systems (AFS) in Bahia, Brazil. Soil samples were collected from four depth classes (0-5, 5-10, 10-30 and 30-50 cm) under two cacao agroforestry systems (30-year-old stands of cacao with Erythrina glauca, as shade trees) in Latosol and Cambisol, in Bahia, Brazil. The determination of oxidizable carbon by a modified Walkley-Black method was done to obtain four C fractions with different labile forms of C (fraction 1: labile fraction; fraction 2: moderate labile fraction; fraction 3: low labile fraction and fraction 4: recalcitrant fraction). Overall, at two cacao AFS, the C fractions generally declined with increase in soil depth. The C fractions 1 and 2 were 50% higher on upper layers (0-5 and 5-10 cm). More than 50% of organic C was found in more labile fraction (fraction 1) in all depths for both soils. High value of C fraction 1 (more labile C)-to-total organic C ratio was obtained (around 54-59%, on Latosol and Cambisol, respectively), indicating large input of organic matter in these soils.

TI  - Conservation of Forest Remnants in Brazil: Considerations on the Main Instruments for Environmental Management
T2  - DESENVOLVIMENTO E MEIO AMBIENTE
AB  - Biodiversity loss is a problem that affects several natural ecosystems in the world, occurring in alarming and crescent rates. The reduction of these rates consists in the main commitment agreed among countries that participate in the Biological Diversity Convention. This article aims at examining some of the existing legal and economic instruments in Brazil to achieve this commitment, specially regarding the conservation of forest remnants. The main command and control instruments employed and established through the Brazilian Forest Code (1934; 1965; 2012a) and the National System of Conservation Areas (2000), among other regulatory devices, are presented. Some economic instruments also considered are the Ecological Goods and Services Tax and the Private Reserve of Natural Heritage. These instruments are analyzed in light of their efficacy in maintaining the forest cover in public and private areas. Their limitations and potentialities are discussed while the predominance of command and control instruments over the economic ones is observed. Finally, it is concluded that the needed improvement of the governmental strategy towards the conservation of forest remnants could be achieved by strengthening the performance of the available command and control instruments, complementing those with new economic instruments.

TI  - Environmental equity and urban afforestation in the extreme northeastern Brazilian Amazon
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Urban areas with low tree cover in Brazil are found mainly in the Amazon, highlighting the disparities in access to benefits of urban greening. The goal of this study was to analyze how urban afforestation is associated with sociodemographic factors to understand the distribution of trees (and their benefits) among different social segments in the city of Macap & aacute;, in the extreme Northeastern Amazon. We conducted a floristic inventory in 217 blocks belonging to 32 neighborhoods, and classified species according to origin (exotic or native) and fruit use (fruit-bearing or non-fruit-bearing). Additionally, we selected 12 variables to represent sociodemographic gradients among neighborhoods. We reduced the dimensionality of floristic and sociodemographic data using ordination techniques, and used their first axes to represent gradients of species composition and sociodemographic factors. The effect of sociodemographic gradients on tree abundance, species richness and composition was tested using generalized linear models. The results indicate that most urban trees are exotic, non-fruit-bearing, and of medium size (10-30 cm in diameter). Older neighborhoods with higher human population age and income showed higher tree abundance and higher species richness. The species composition was related to the gradient of human population density, proportion of old people, income, and household occupancy. Large non-fruit trees were more frequent in neighborhoods with low population density. Exotic trees were more frequent in older neighborhoods with older people and high income, and large fruit trees showed higher abundance in neighborhoods with low household occupancy rates. Ensuring that low-income neighborhoods and historically marginalized communities have equal access to green spaces and adequate tree coverage is a key element to promote environmental justice and to develop healthier and more sustainable cities.

TI  - Response of a dung beetle assemblage along a reforestation gradient in Restinga forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
AB  - Scarabaeinae dung beetles are indicator insects used in the evaluation of the ecological effects caused by changes in habitat structure and ecosystem integrity resulting from environmental degradation. We compared dung beetle diversity in conserved restinga forests (coastal tropical moist broadleaf forest) and in reforested areas of various ages during the rainy and dry seasons, on the coast of Paraiba State, Brazil. A total of 3,634 individuals comprising 14 species were collected. In the reforested areas there was a gradual increase in species abundance relative to the area's age, but in the conserved restinga the abundance of individuals was 10-20 times higher than that recorded in areas of recent reforestation. The highest species richness was found in the conserved restinga and in the oldest reforested area (16 years old) during the rainy season. During the dry season, when environmental conditions do not seem to favor adult survival, most of the species were found in the conserved restinga forest. The dung beetle community structure was related to the increases in habitat heterogeneity in the successional processes of the reforested areas. Our results suggest that reforested areas act as a source of and refuge for dung beetle species.

TI  - NATURAL REGENERATION IN FOREST REMAINDERS AND REFORESTED AREAS OF "MOGI-GUACU" RIVER FLOODPLAIN IN LUIZ ANTONIO COUNTY, SAO PAULO, BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
AB  - The phytosociology of the woody stratum of both young regenerating individuals and seed banks are quality indicators of heterogeneous reforestations. The objetive of this research was to evaluate the structure of regeneration of the arboreal species in two natural remainders, in three areas reforested with native species and in a Eucalyptus robusta settlement located in a floodplain of Mogi-Guacu river in Luiz Antonio County (21 degrees 31 'S and 47 degrees 55 'W), Sao Paulo, Brazil. Sampling was collected in 40 subplots of 2 m(2) in of each natural remainder and each eucalyptus sub-forest, as well as 60 subplots of 3.5 m(2) in each area reforested. All individuals with height 3 10 cm and diameter at breast height (DBH) < 5.0 cm were measured and analyzed separately in four height classes according to floristic diversity, similarity, density, frequency, dominance, importance value and natural regeneration. A total of 2,010 individuals were identified, belonging to 24 families, 46 genera and 51 species. The species with greater importance values were Cabralea canjerana, Psidium cattleyanum, Nectandra megapotamica, Acacia polyphylla and Syzygium cumini, well represented in the four height classes. Reforestation with native species in a degraded Mogi-Guacu River floodplain promoted natural regeneration with more biodiversity than in natural remainders submitted to border effect, and contributed to the forest ecosystem restoration process. The 20-year-old Eucalyptus robusta plantation promoted the regeneration of climax and secondary species.

TI  - Sorption-desorption and biodegradation of sulfometuron-methyl and its effects on the bacterial communities in Amazonian soils amended with aged biochar
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Sulfometuron-methyl is a broad-spectrum herbicide, used throughout Brazil; however, its environmental impacts in biochar (BC) amended soils is not fully understood. Biochar is known to enhance soil quality but can also have undesired effects such as altering the bioavailability and behavior of herbicides. Microbial communities can degrade herbicides such as sulfometuron-methyl in soils; however, they are known to be affected by BC. Therefore, it is important to understand the tripartite interaction between these factors. This research aimed to evaluate the sorption-desorption and biodegradation of sulfometuron-methyl in Amazonian soils amended with BC, and to assess the effects of the interactions between BC and sulfometuron-methyl on soil bacterial com-munities. Soil samples were collected from field plots amended with BC at three doses (0, 40 and 80 t ha(-1)) applied ten years ago. The herbicide sorption and desorption were evaluated using a batch equilibrium method. Mineralization and biodegradation studies were conducted in microcosms incubated with C-14-sulfometuronmethyl for 80 days. Systematic soil sampling, followed by DNA extraction, quantification (qPCR) and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing were performed. The presence of BC increased the sorption of the herbicide to the soil by 11% (BC40) and 16% (BC80) compared to unamended soil. The presence of BC also affected the degradation of C-14-sulfometuron-methyl, reducing the mineralization rate and increasing the degradation half-life times (DT50) from 36.67 days in unamended soil to 52.11 and 55.45 days in BC40 and BC80 soils, respectively. The herbicide application altered the bacterial communities, affecting abundance and richness, and changing the taxonomic diversity (i.e., some taxa were promoted and other inhibited). A tripartite interaction was found between BC, the herbicide and soil bacterial communities, suggesting that it is important to consider the environmental impact of soil applied herbicides in biochar amended soils.

TI  - Growing Coffea canephora in agroforestry systems with Brazilian firetree, Brazil nut, and teak
T2  - SEMINA-CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
AB  - Planting coffee in agroforestry systems (AFSs) provides diverse advantages to farmers interested in producing environmental services, such as increased local biodiversity, reduction in soil erosion, improvement in water infiltration into the soil, and regulation of climate extremes. It can also be economically attractive due to the possibility of serving alternative markets that have higher and more stable prices for coffees integrated into alternative systems and the generation of products complementary to coffee. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different planting densities of three forest species on the composition of AFSs with coffee plants under the conditions of the southwestern Amazon region. The study was conducted from November 2014 to June 2021 in the experimental field of Embrapa in Ouro Preto do Oeste, RO, Brazil. The coffee plants were intercropped with three forest species: i) Brazilian firetree ( Schizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum ), ii) Brazil nut ( Bertholletia excelsa ), and iii) teak ( Tectona grandis ). The treatments used in each experiment were four plant densities of plants: zero (coffee plants only, in full sun), 111 plants ha -1 (10 x 9 m), 222 plants ha -1 (10 x 4.5 m), and 444 plants ha -1 (5 x 4.5 m). The experiments were conducted in a split -plot arrangement, with plots consisting of plant densities and subplots consisting of harvest periods (crop seasons). The experimental design was completely randomized, with nine replications. The part of the plot used for data collection consisted of one planted row with 12 coffee plants. The average and accumulated productivities of coffe plants were evaluated over five harvests (2017-2021). Afforestation of the coffee field with Brazilian firetree plants reduces the mean yield and cumulative yield of C. canephora 'Conilon' in the first five commercial crop years. Brazil nut and teak planted at densities of up to 222 trees per hectare did not lead to a reduction in the mean and cumulative yield of coffee plants.

TI  - The ecological value of Eryngium horridum in maintaining biodiversity in subtropical grasslands
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
AB  - The role of facilitation in the structuring of plant communities has been often demonstrated in environments under high abiotic stress, especially in semi-arid and arid ecosystems and high elevations. Few studies, however, analysed facilitation in systems that are highly productive and rich in species, which are thought to be theoretically unlikely to demonstrate strong effects of facilitation. Here, we investigate the importance of Eryngium horridum, a rosette species, on the maintenance of plant diversity in subtropical grasslands in southern Brazil. We evaluated facilitation in areas under two different types of management: abandonment and grazing. Plots were established in areas with and without individuals of E. horridum and all species were identified and had their cover estimated. The Relative Neighbour Effect index was calculated in order to verify the presence of competition or facilitation. Our results indicated facilitation in both abandoned and in grazed grasslands, but apparently through different mechanisms. In the first case, the plant's architecture opens the canopy and allows more light to reach small forbs in the grass matrix. In the second case, E. horridum appears to protect more palatable species from herbivores. Otherwise considered an obnoxious species, E. horridum plays an important ecological role in subtropical grasslands in southern Brazil by facilitating other species and consequently, increasing local richness. Areas with this rosette species are important sources of diaspores, which are able to colonize new open sites and thus, maintain biodiversity.

TI  - THE EFFECTS OF LAND USE AND SOIL MANAGEMENT ON THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF AN OXISOL IN SOUTHEAST BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
AB  - Soils of the tropics are prone to a decrease in quality after conversion from native forest (FO) to a conventional tillage system (CT). However, the adoption of no-tillage (NT) and complex crop rotations may improve soil structural quality. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the physical properties of an Oxisol under FO, CT, and three summer crop sequences in NT: continuous corn (NTcc), continuous soybean (NTcs), and a soybean/corn rotation (NTscr). Both NT and CT decreased soil organic carbon (SOC) content, SOC stock, water stable aggregates (WSA), geometric mean diameter (GMD), soil total porosity (TP), macroporosity (MA), and the least limiting water range (LLWR). However they increased soil bulk density (BD) and tensile strength (TS) of the aggregates when compared to soil under FO. Soil under NT had higher WSA, GMD, BD, TS and microporosty, but lower TP and MA than soil under CT. Soil under FO did not attain critical values for the LLWR, but the lower limit of the LLWR in soils under CT and NT was resistance to penetration (RP) for all values of BD, while the upper limit of field capacity was air-filled porosity for BD values greater than 1.46 (CT), 1.40 (NTscr), 1.42 (NTcc), and 1.41 (NTcs) kg dm(-3). Soil under NTcc and NTcs decreased RP even with the increase in BD because of the formation of biopores. Furthermore, higher critical BD was verified under NTcc (1.62 kg dm(-3)) and NTcs (1.57 kg dm(-3)) compared to NTscr and CT (1.53 kg dm(-3)).

TI  - Distribution and Quality of the Organic Matter in Light and Heavy Fractions of a Red Latosol under Different Uses and Management Practices
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in distribution and quality of organic matter in light and heavy fractions of a medium-texture Red Latosol under different uses and management practices in Capinopolis, Brazil. Soil samples were collected from different layers in the profile (0-5, 5-10, and 10-20 cm). The following treatments were evaluated: NTs, no till (no tillage) for 4 years with maize (silage) / soybean in succession; NTg, no till for 4 years with maize/maize/maize/soybean in succession; NTtf, no till for 3 years with tifton (hay) and soybeans in the last year; CS, about 30 years with conventional cultivation system (maize/soybean) with only soybean in the past 4 years; and NF, native forest. The heavy fraction contributed 75-98% of total carbon and 94-99% of total nitrogen, indicating that most carbon and nitrogen in the soil are associated with the mineral fraction, which is fundamental for the maintenance of their stocks. Tifton grass in no tillage was efficient in increasing the amounts of light fraction (free and occluded). Increases of occluded light fraction in no-till systems were greater than in conventional cultivation system. The light fraction was shown to be sensitive to soil cultivation and can be considered indicative of soil degradation. Light-fraction analysis by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) allowed the study of changes in the chemical structure of these fractions under different uses and management practices. Occluded light fraction was shown to be more recalcitrant and condensed than the free light fraction. The surface layer in the conventional cultivation system has a more aromatic and condensed free light fraction than in no-tillage system. In general, the upper layers were less aromatic than the deepest ones.

TI  - Intensification of cattle ranching production systems: socioeconomic and environmental synergies and risks in Brazil
T2  - ANIMAL
AB  - Intensification of Brazilian cattle ranching systems has attracted both national and international attention due to its direct relation with Amazon deforestation on the one hand and increasing demand of the global population for meat on the other. Since Brazilian cattle ranching is predominantly pasture-based, we particularly focus on pasture management. We summarize the most recurrent opportunities and risks associated with pasture intensification that are brought up within scientific and political dialogues, and discuss them within the Brazilian context. We argue that sustainable intensification of pasturelands in Brazil is a viable way to increase agricultural output while simultaneously sparing land for nature. Since environmental degradation is often associated with low-yield extensive systems in Brazil, it is possible to obtain higher yields, while reversing degradation, by adopting practices like rotational grazing, incorporation of legumes and integrated crop-livestock-forestry systems. Technical assistance is however essential, particularly for small-and medium-scale farmers. Sound complementary policies and good governance must accompany these measures so that a 'rebound effect' does not lead to increased deforestation and other adverse social and environmental impacts. It is also important that animal welfare is not compromised. Although the discussion is presented with respect to Brazil, some aspects are relevant to other developing countries.

TI  - Future trends for biodiversity in urban afforestation of São Paulo, Brazil: insights for the restoration decade
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
AB  - Sao Paulo city has three municipal nurseries for the distribution of urban tree specimens that meet the demand for its public landscape projects and increase in tree covering. One of them (Manequinho Lopes) receives tree seedlings from the environmental compensation processes contracted with the Municipal Secretariat for Green and Environment (MSGE). This paper aimed to evaluate the scenario of tree biodiversity received between July 2013 and July 2018 by the Manequinho Lopes nursery, as a measure of environmental compensation. The results indicated that 144,727 tree seedlings were received by the nursery, with approximately 80% of the total belonging to only 30 species, half of them belonging to only 10 different groups. We found just two predominated families: Myrtaceae and Bignoniaceae, , highlighting a biotic homogenization risk. Regarding ecological attributes, it was found that 33% of the species were zoochoric, 16% autochorous and 22% anemochoric. Most of them were non-endangered specimens.

TI  - Fertilizer effects on the sustainability and profitability of agroforestry in the presence of carbon payments
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
AB  - Agroforests, where trees are planted with crops, are promoted as an appropriate and sustainable alternative to traditional agriculture as they meet landholder demands for food, income and wood products. This is essential in countries such as Indonesia where much of the landmass is not suitable for intensive cropping (either too steep or the soils are acidic and nutrient poor), yet population pressure and increasing food demand force many farmers to implement such practices on marginal land. These practices, combined with the lack of credit, quality seed and fertilizer have contributed to decreased soil fertility and increased deforestation and soil erosion. Previous research on agroforests suggests, however, that sustainability and profitability are not guaranteed and that the addition of fertilizer to the production system may be required. This is investigated for a hedgerow-intercropping system in the presence of carbon-sequestration payments using a bioeconomic modelling framework that incorporates the SCUAF simulation model. For the assumptions used in this study it was found that fertilizer improves the productivity and sustainability of the system; it is either optimal to grow crops (Zea mays) alone provided 225 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) of fertilizer is applied, or to completely convert to growing trees (Gliricidia sepium) if fertilizer is not used. This decision depends on the relative prices for crops and carbon. It was also found that there is an incentive for landholders to participate in a carbon-sink project when the previous land use has a continuously decreasing carbon stock, which is the baseline used to determine eligible carbon. Finally, compared with a more complex process model such as WaNuLCAS and data reported in the literature, the process model SCUAF consistently and reliably predicted biophysical interactions for various management regimes of tree/crop systems for use in complex economic analyses.

TI  - Grassland community structure in Permanent Preservation Areas associated with forestry and livestock in the Pampa biome, Southern Brazil
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - The Pampa biome comprises a high species richness, but has been transformed by various human activities, threatening its inherent diversity. One of the mechanisms that contributes to conservation is the Permanent Preservation Areas (PPA); however, studies related to the vegetation of these areas are scarce, especially regarding the herbaceous stratum, creating a gap in the evaluation of the conservation of the Pampa biome's grassland formations. The objective of this study was to characterize the structure of fragments of grasslands in PPA, with and without cattle grazing, inserted in a plantation of Eucalyptus saligna Sm. in the Pampa biome. The survey was conducted on 40 systematically distributed sample units in six grassland areas, three of which were occasionally exposed to grazing and three fenced off with no grazing. Cover and frequency val-ues (absolute and relative) and importance value index (IVI) were estimated for species, exposed soil and dry plant material. The difference between the areas was evaluated by the Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) and ANOSIM, complemented by SIMPER. Richness, dry plant material and exposed soil were evaluated using the Kruskall-Wallis test. A total of 210 species were registered, with the Poaceae family being the most numerous, followed by Asteraceae (41), Cyperaceae (19), Fabaceae (12) and Rubiaceae (9). The areas differed in relation to richness, with grazing showing more diversity. Enclosure Area 3 did not differ from open areas 2 and 3, possibly due to the greater proximity and low cattle interference. The exposed soil did not vary according to the enclosure; however, the dry plant material was higher in the enclosed areas. The distribu-tion of species, as well as their cover and frequency were regulated according to grazing. The presence of ani-mals in PPA has modified the dynamics and botanical composition of the areas, in which richness was promoted.

TI  - Can short-term pasture management increase C balance in the Atlantic Rainforest?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB  - Few studies have shown the importance of different pasture management practices on C storage and the reduction of CO2-C emissions in tropical conditions. The objective of the present study was to determine short-term changes in C pools and C balance from different pasture management practices established in the Atlantic Rainforest. A field study was carried out in Alegre, ES, Brazil from September 2013 to August 2014 to investigate the first-year effect of pasture management practices on a Udult clayey soil. The different pasture management practices studied included the following: control (CON), chiseled (CHI), fertilized (FER), burned (BUR), integrated with crop-livestock (iCL) systems, and plowed and harrowed (PH). Monthly disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were taken at two different layers (0.00-0.05 and 0.05-0.20 m) for chemical, physical, and organic matter characterization. C inputs monitored in aboveground pools included plant aerial parts and litter, and belowground pools included roots and soil C stocks. C outputs monitored were CO2-C emissions, erosion water, and sediment. C balance was considered the difference between inputs and outputs in each treatment during four seasons. The spring and summer seasons had a strong influence on C inputs and outputs where there is significant difference between spring and summer, while the autumn and winter seasons had less influence. All pasture management practices exhibited positive C balance after 1 year. High values of C balance were verified in pastures fertilized (FER) (53.04 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). Intermediate C balance was found in the burned (BUR) (40.84 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)), traditional control (CON) (40.31 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)), and in the plowing and harrowing (PH) (40.02 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) management practices. The practices of chiseled (40.00 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) and integrated crop-livestock systems (iCL) (59.06 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) resulted in low C balance.

TI  - Bibliometric Analysis on Wildfires and Protected Areas
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Wildfire are increasingly frequent events on a planet undergoing climate change. With more favourable climate conditions for their occurrence, like prolonged periods of drought, the frequency and intensity of these catastrophes continue to increase. Protected areas are important territories for conserving ecosystems and biodiversity around the world and serve as a key management tool in national environmental policies. Many studies have been developed around the world to assess the conditions, frequency, and intensity of fires, and, on the other hand, protected areas are intensively studied to understand whether conservation actions are effective in keeping the ecosystem balanced. However, there are few studies that contemplate these two themes together. Consequently, this study offers a bibliometric analysis of the wildfires and its occurrence in protected areas, aiming to understand the spatial and temporal relation between them, characteristics of the research studies, and trending issues to be worked on. We used the Bibliometrix package in R language, which provides the option of different methods for analysing bibliometric data to understand the temporal evolution of the published documents about wildfires and protected areas. In total, 1116 publications were analysed, ranging from 1970 to 2022. The findings show that the terms "fires" (185 occurrences), "fire" (117), "wildfire" (101), and "forest fire" (92) are more frequently used and associated with studies on topics including biodiversity (304), conservation (221), environmental protection (188), deforestation (148), ecosystems (138), forestry (133), and climate change (126) as well as protected areas (399). The highest growth of research has been registered since 2002. The majority of the publications were published by authors from universities in the USA (77), South Africa (72), the United Kingdom (22), and Brazil (19). The USA leads all other countries with 7 of the top 10 international collaborations, followed by Brazil, Australia, and South Africa. However, only the United Kingdom continues to maintain an increased number of external (inter-country) collaborations, whereas the other nine continue to maintain an increased number of internal (intra-country). Considering the top 10 authors in terms of production, only 1 was active from 1999 to 2019, and the other 9 only have been active since 2009. The topics that stand out were subjected to a coupling analysis, which revealed that environmental protection is a motor theme, endangered species, Australia, and savannah are niche themes, and protected area, biodiversity, and fire management are basic themes.

TI  - Historical survey of research related to fire management and fauna conservation in the world and in Brazil
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - Fire is a key ecological factor affecting biodiversity structure and composition. Fires' effects on biodiversity can be beneficial or harmful depending on how, where, when, and why they occur. The impacts of fire on fauna vary according to species ecology and the fire regime. To understand the research effort relating fire, fauna, and mammals, we surveyed papers published in World and in Brazil. Only 5% of the publications between 1970 and 2019 with fire subject dealt with fauna and 0.5% with mammal. For Brazil, we obtained 7% of papers for fauna and 3% for mammal. The Brazilian Biome with more papers was Cerrado, followed by Atlantic Forest, Amazon, Pampas, Caatinga and Pantanal. The United States of America and Australia stand out as protagonists in their continents with the largest papers number. The volume of research is related to investment in Research and Development and to occurrence of fires. The slope of temporal trend shows the terms related to wildfire have more papers than prescribed burn and there is less interest in fauna and mammal research. It is necessary to form research groups with these themes as research lines and intensify research relating fire ecology and mammals. There is yet no unified understanding of how fire may influence animal diversity and how it influences the vegetative structure and subsequently the resources which wildlife rely on. We consider this information is essential to establish efficient conservation policies.

TI  - Reduced-impact logging and temporal activity of understorey bats in lowland Amazonia
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Because global timber demands continue to threaten tropical rain forests, identification of sustainable-use forest management protocols that meet human needs while preserving biodiversity is critical. Reduced-impact logging (RIL) protocols are increasingly common in the tropics and may be a viable option for sustainable forest use; however, few studies have documented faunal responses to RIL. Moreover, evaluations of abundance or diversity may not be sufficient for a comprehensive understanding of faunal responses to human activities, especially in the short-term. We assessed the effects of RIL on the temporal activity patterns of abundant bats in lowland Amazonian rain forest. More specifically, we characterized temporal patterns of activity, overlap of temporal activity, and dispersion of activity modes for seven abundant bat species and for four common bat guilds in RIL forest and in undisturbed forest in Tapajos National Forest, Para, Brazil. Temporal activity of aerial insectivores, nectarivores, and gleaning animalivores did not change in response to RIL. In contrast, three of five species of frugivores and frugivores as a group changed their patterns of temporal activity in response to RIL. RIL had a greater effect on temporal activity of frugivores that foraged in the understorey than on frugivores that foraged in multiple forest strata. Overlap of temporal activity of frugivores was greater than expected by chance in undisturbed forest, but was random in RIL forest. Changes in activity may be a response to a combination of increased predation risk and reduced distances of early evening flights between day roosts and feeding areas in RIL forest compared to undisturbed forest.

TI  - Indirect Effects of Cattle Trampling on the Structure of Fruit-Feeding Butterfly Assemblages Inhabiting Restinga Forests in Southern Brazil
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
AB  - The impacts of anthropogenic activities are increasing at alarming rates, leading to biodiversity loss and the displacement of native habitats. One of the main contributors to human disturbances is livestock farming, which degrades native habitats through cattle grazing and trampling. To understand these impacts, we investigated the effects of cattle trampling on the structure and diversity of fruit-feeding butterflies in Restinga forests of southern Brazil. We addressed questions regarding the effects of cattle raising on butterfly diversity and composition, identified indicator species, and examined the influence of environmental variables on butterfly richness, dominance, abundance, and species composition. Our dataset comprises the long-term monitoring of fruit-feeding butterflies in Restinga forests from 2014 to 2019, across sites with low, medium, and high levels of disturbance due to cattle trampling. We found that medium and high levels of disturbance increased butterfly richness and abundance, whereas low-level disturbance was associated with lower abundance. Additionally, the species composition of butterflies in medium to highly disturbed sites differed from that in preserved Restinga forests, indicating that any perturbation can markedly alter alpha and beta diversity parameters. These changes simplify the native forest structure, open the canopy, disrupt the understory, and favor butterfly species commonly associated with disturbed forests.

TI  - Spore density and root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in preserved or disturbed Araucaria angustifolia (Bert.) O. Ktze. ecosystems
T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
AB  - Araucaria angustifolia (Bert.) O. Ktze., a native forest tree from Brazil, is under extinction risk. This tree depends on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi for growth and development, especially in tropical low-P soils but, despite being a conifer, Araucaria does not form ectomycorrhiza, but only the arbuscular endomycorrhiza. This study aimed at surveying data on the spore density and root colonization (CR) by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in Araucaria angustifolia forest ecosystems, in order to discriminate natural, implemented, and anthropic action-impacted ecosystems, by means of Canonical Discriminant Analysis (CDA). Three ecosystems representative of the Campos do Jordao (SP, Brazil) region were selected: 1. a native forest (FN); 2. a replanted Araucaria forest (R); and 3. a replanted Araucaria forest, submitted to accidental fire (RF). Rhizosphere soil and roots were sampled in May and October, 2002, for root colonization, AMF identification, and spores counts. Root percent colonization rates at first collection date were relatively low and did not differ amongst ecosystems. At the second period, FN presented higher colonization than the other two areas, with much higher figures than during the first period, for all areas. Spore density was lower in FN than in the other areas. A total of 26 AMF species were identified. The percent root colonization and spore numbers were inversely related to each other in all ecosystems. CDA indicated that there is spatial distinction among the three ecosystems in regard to the evaluated parameters.

TI  - Sources of soil organic carbon under Eucalyptus silvopastures and other land-use systems in Brazilian Oxisols
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
AB  - Silvopastoral systems (SPS) incorporating non-native tree species such as Eucalyptus are increasingly being adopted in the Cerrado region of Brazil. The climate-change mitigation potential of the practice, although hypothesized, has not been assessed vigorously. The objective of this research was to measure the extent of SOC accumulation under SPS involving C3 and C4 plants and other prevalent land-use systems in an Oxisol-dominated location in Minas Gerais, Brazil. We determined the overall delta 13C in three soil fraction-size groups within six land-use systems. These systems consisted of 8-year-old planted forests, native forest, managed pastures, and three variations of 8-year-old SPS with diverse tree-planting layouts. In the SPS and planted forest treatments, the tree species was Eucalyptus hybrid, and Urochloa decumbens was the grass species in the SPS and pasture treatments. For each treatment, soil samples were collected at depths of 0-10, 10-30, 30-60, and 60-100 cm. These samples were fractionated into three size classes (2000-250 mu m, 250-53 mu m, and <53 mu m) and analyzed for delta 13C. The native forest had higher C3 contribution in the topsoil layers. The highest C3 derived SOC stock up to 1 m depth was in the pasture (137 Mg ha(-1)), and the lowest in the forest (74 Mg ha(-1)). The pasture also had the highest C4 derived SOC stock and the forest the lowest, but not significantly. The SPS had intermediate values. We infer that the study site had a mixed vegetation in the past, and after the conversion of the land to planted forest/SPS/pasture, the "native" SOC stock could be maintained better in a well-managed pasture than in a degraded native forest. The higher C3-derived SOC stock in the pasture treatment suggests that managed SPS could help retain more soil C in a stable form than in degraded forests.

TI  - Earthworm populations sampled using collection methods in atlantic forests with Araucaria angustifolia
T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
AB  - Araucaria angustifolia, also known as the Parana Pine is an endangered tree species in Brazil and little is known of the diversity of soil invertebrates inhabiting these forests. Therefore, the present study was set up to evaluate the biomass and diversity of earthworms in natural and reforested Araucaria plots, impacted or not by fire, and to identify the most efficient earthworm collection method. Four study areas included: native forest with Araucaria (NF); Araucaria reforestation (R); Araucaria reforestation submitted to an accidental fire (RF); and native grass pasture with native Araucaria and submitted to an intense accidental fire (NPF). Five soil samples containing the earthworm community were taken in a 0.3 ha area in each of the forest sites, close to five Araucaria trees selected at random. Three collection methods were tested: application of dilute Formol (0.5%) to the soil surface, handsorting of small (25 x 25 cm) or large (40 x 40 cm) monoliths. Five earthworm species were found: the native Glossoscolex sp. 1, Glossoscolex sp. 2, Glossoscolex bondari and Urobenus brasiliensis (Glossoscolecidae), and the exotic Amynthas corticis (Megascolecidae). Formol was more efficient for collecting A. corticis, found in much higher abundance and biomass in NF than in the other areas. Larger handsorted samples were more efficient for capturing Glossoscolex species, mainly present in RF and NPF. For adequate characterization of earthworm abundance and biomass in these Araucaria forests, both the Formol and the larger monolith methods are recommended.

TI  - EFFECTS OF EUCALYPTUS PLANTATIONS ON SOIL ARTHROPOD COMMUNITIES IN A BRAZILIAN ATLANTIC FOREST CONSERVATION UNIT
T2  - BIOSCIENCE JOURNAL
AB  - The Atlantic Forest is a conservation hotspot due to its elevated level of biodiversity and current state of degradation. Some areas of Atlantic Forest have been replaced by eucalyptus monocultures in Brazil. Soil arthropods can be important indicators for assessing the recomposition of native forests after disturbs. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that exist differences in the composition and structure of soil arthropod communities among two plantations of eucalyptus (Corymbia citriodora) in different stages of natural regeneration of Atlantic forest (YP = Young Plantation and MP = Mature Plantation, in less and more advanced stage of regeneration, respectively) and a fragment of Atlantic forest (FOREST), in wet and dry seasons, in Uniao Biological Reserve, Brazil, using pitfalls. Archaeognatha, Diplura, Opilionida, and Thysanura were restricted to the FOREST, while Diptera, Isoptera, and Orthoptera were favored by the microclimatic conditions in eucalyptus plantations. Soil arthropod community in FOREST was more complex than those in eucalyptus plantations. In general, soil arthropod communities showed higher total abundance and richness of groups, while equability decreased, as regeneration of Atlantic forest advanced in eucalyptus plantations, making this community more similar to that observed in the FOREST. The average total abundance, average richness, and total richness of soil arthropods were higher in the wet season in all areas, but the opposite occurred for the equability. Soil arthropod community improved with the regeneration of native forest species under the eucalyptus plantations.

TI  - Effects of crop rotation and sheep grazing management on the seedbank and emerged weed flora under a no-tillage integrated crop-livestock system
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
AB  - Effective integrated weed management in agricultural landscapes depends on the ability to identify and manage processes that drive weed dynamics. The current study reports the effects of grazing management and crop rotation strategies on the seedbank and emerged weed flora in an integrated crop-livestock system (ICLS) experiment during a 12-year period under no-tillage in sub-tropical southern Brazil. During winter, Italian ryegrass cover crops were grazed by sheep: grazing management treatments included two stocking methods (continuous and rotational) and two forage allowances (10 and 20 kg of herbage dry matter available per 100 kg animal live weight). During summer, the crop rotation treatments involved either soybean-maize or soybean-soybean in succession with winter-grazed cover crops. The treatments were part of a factorial randomized complete block design. Treatment effects were evaluated on the weed seedbank and emerged weed flora populations during winter-grazed cover crop and summer crop growth as well as during the harvest phase. The current results demonstrate that crop rotation and grazing management exhibited interactive effects on the determination of weed outcomes in an ICLS. However, overall, compared with moderate forage allowance, high forage allowance during the winter-grazed cover crop caused lower emerged weed flora in subsequent crops (20% reduction during crop growth and 90% reduction at crop harvest) and 48% reduction in seedbank size. High forage allowance promoted more residue from winter-grazed cover crop biomass, which remained during the summer crop phases and probably resulted in a physical barrier to weed emergence.

TI  - Understanding the factors controlling biofilm as an autochthonous resource in shaded oligotrophic neotropical streams
T2  - AQUATIC SCIENCES
AB  - Light and nutrients are bottom-up factors in controlling biofilm in tropical shaded oligotrophic streams. Regardless of the predominant resource source (autochthonous or allochthonous), greater availability of light and nutrients favors the development and, later, grazing (top-down factor) of the biofilm, with reflections on the trophic structure of these ecosystems. The increase in primary productivity in lotic ecosystems may reflect the fractionation of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) by the algal cells contained in the biofilm. A global meta-analysis showed that an increase in primary productivity leads to enrichment of the carbon isotope ratios of biofilm. The objective of this study was to evaluate how top-down (grazing) and bottom-up (light and nutrient) factors act on the biofilm and whether algal biomass determines the isotopic fractionation of delta C-13 in headwaters of Central Brazil. The density of grazing macroinvertebrates was controlled with electric pulses. Electrified (excluding grazers) and non-electrified grids were implemented in open and shaded areas in each stream. The biofilm ash-free dry mass (AFDM) doubled in nutrient-enriched streams. The effect of grazing on the biomass of the biofilm was significant for the nutrient-enriched streams, with a 50% reduction in the AFDM. Additionally, shading influenced chlorophyll-a even in pristine streams, as the concentration increased approximately ten-fold under open canopy conditions. There was a significant negative relationship between chlorophyll-a concentrations and delta C-13 values. Our study provides evidence that biofilm biomass increases as a result of changes in bottom-up controls. Top-down control significantly reduced biofilm in the food web based on autochthonous organic matter.

TI  - Developing conservation priorities based on forest type, condition, and threats in a poorly known ecoregion: Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - The island of Sulawesi is the largest in Indonesian Wallacea, one of the most important ecoregions in SE Asia and globally. Here, we generate a comprehensive and detailed map of forest type, its condition, and some of its threats, which highlights key forest conservation areas, pinpoints frontlines within them, and provides the basis for the development of more specific objectives. We relied upon a variety of techniques to generate five main descriptors of forest quality: condition, its level of endangerment, its landscape setting, its simulated fate given a simple model of forest change, and its overall size. Using the results of this analysis, we assessed the existing protected areas (PA), recognized by the Indonesian government, and a conservation portfolio (CP) generated by a recently completed Ecoregional Conservation Assessment (ECA). Our map of conservation priorities is congruent with previous conservation activities, although several priority areas were identified outside of the current PA system and should be the focus of strategic protected area development. Our ranking system is simple, transparent, and flexible. Its modular construction will allow local managers to choose among available proxy measures and to add their own conservation values according to specific priorities and desired outcomes. We envision this analysis as the foundation upon which more specific conservation strategies, based upon detailed biotic information as it becomes available, can be developed.

TI  - Pre-assessment of the Potential of Dual Polarization of Sentinel 1 Data for Mapping the Mangrove Tree Species Distribution in South Bali, Indonesia
T2  - 2021 7TH ASIA-PACIFIC CONFERENCE ON SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR (APSAR)
CP  - 7th Asia-Pacific Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar (APSAR)
AB  - Behind the needs of the availability for the mangrove trees biodiversity database are important in promoting coastal area protection, including mangrove forest conservation. This initiative started by mapping mangrove trees distribution by utilizing two different modes of ground detected ranged (GRD) and single look complex (SLC) of Sentinel-1 data images. Both are processed to get the backscatter value, dual-polarization radar vegetation index (DpRVI) and polarization decomposition for entropy, alpha, and anisotropy values for each mangrove trees species (MTS) detection that compared with the data field. Besides that, the distribution of each mangrove tree has been conducted based on its genus and species richness that estimated using a random forest (RF) algorithm for nine different combinations, including VV, VH, and VV-VH, entropy, alpha, and anisotropy, DpRVI, and the integration of between backscatter value and polarization decomposition. The result has shown a variation in the level of accuracy ranging from weak to moderate at about 26% to 65%. The combination of VV, VH, VH-VV and DpRVI obtained better accuracy at about 65%. Related to the species of mangrove detected, the Avicennia alba becomes a dominant mangrove tree species grown as much as 60% in the study area.

TI  - Advocacy coalitions and protected areas creation process: Case study in the Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Protected areas are the cornerstones of conservation policies worldwide. However, only few researches are led to analyse the way they emerge, except for criticising top-down governmental choices. Yet, the historical approach and strategic analysis of public policy building over the long term allows a better understanding of the stakes of action capacity of these policies. We therefore mobilize the advocacy coalition framework to show that protected areas creation is always due to coalitions of actors who belong to different professional fields and act at different scales but nevertheless share common stakes. On the basis of a comparative study in French and Brazilian Amazon, we show that if all coalitions for protected areas share a common objective of limited deforestation, they are still very different according to the type of conservation they promote (strict biodiversity conservation, population-based conservation or sustainable forest management). We also show that the ability of the coalitions to build efficient public policies is highly depending on internal factors (i.e. their ability to gather strategic resources) and on external factors (i.e. socio-political context and international pressure). Finally, the comparative analysis of coalitions pleading for the same type of protected areas in two different countries allows us to insist on the importance of qualitative embedded researches when it comes to understand why some protected areas have more chances to reach environmental effectiveness in one socio-political context than in another one.

TI  - Impact of management regime and frequency on the survival and productivity of four native tree species used for fuelwood and charcoal in the caatinga of northeast Brazil
T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
AB  - The seasonally dry deciduous forest (Caatinga) of northeast Brazil is under intense human pressure, and sustainable use of its tree resources for fuelwood is a pressing concern. An experiment was conducted to ascertain which management techniques (coppicing, pollarding or crown-thinning) permit the highest survival of trees and optimal timber production. Four much-utilised tree species: Croton sonderianus, Mimosa ophthalmocentra, Mimosa tenuiflora and Poincianella pyramidalis (syn. Caesalpinia pyramidalis) were studied at two sites in Pernambuco State. The impact of each harvesting regime was evaluated over a six-year period, with additional variables including wet-season versus dry-season harvesting, and three-year versus six-year harvesting cycles. The best performing tree species varied between sites, with M. tenuiflora providing the highest yields with all treatments at Sertania and M. tenuiflora and Poincianella pyramidalis at Serra Talhada. The optimal management regime did not vary between species. Crown-thinned trees produced limited regrowth with the lowest mortality rates, and when ultimately coppiced growth appeared to have been stimulated. Pollarding was intermediate and coppicing was the poorest management strategy. Trees which were harvested twice, in both 2005 and 2008, had much lower overall production than those which had only been harvested once in 2008. The highest yields were obtained from crown-thinned trees which were coppiced in 2005 or 2008. Management decisions must consider local environmental conditions in the selection of the tree species used to produce fuelwood, however, the optimal management strategy for high production and low mortality is consistently low impact, infrequent crown thinning. There was considerable difference in the findings between the study sites (e.g. in the distribution of statistically significant results), and also in the impacts of treatments on mortality between the four species. The results can be used to guide species-level management regimes that minimise tree mortality, contributing to long-term fuelwood productivity.

TI  - Mangrove Biogeography of the Indo-Pacific
T2  - SABKHA ECOSYSTEMS, VOL VI: ASIA/PACIFIC
AB  - Studies on biogeography are useful to understand the present and past distribution patterns of biological diversity and their underlying environmental and historical causes. The mangrove realm, largely confined to sheltered tropical and subtropical coastlines within latitudes of around 32 degrees N and 38 degrees S, is divided longitudinally into an Atlantic realm and an Indo-Pacific realm. Because of the relatively recent closure of the Central American Isthmus, a small incursion of the Atlantic realm species has occurred into the Indo-Pacific realm along the tropical and subtropical American Pacific coast and spread north and south since the last glaciation. Although the biogeography of mangroves has been widely discussed, recent investigations of mangrove floristics and genetic diversity using molecular studies warrant a further comprehensive account of the biogeography of mangroves. Considering these facts, the biogeography of the Indo-West Pacific (IWP) mangroves has been examined in detail, and the Atlantic East Pacific mangrove region (AEP) has only been briefly discussed. The difference in species richness between the IWP and the AEP is evidence of the effectiveness of the African land mass and the East Pacific Ocean barriers. Within the IWP, two trends in relation to mangrove species richness can be identified: first, maximal species richness which occurs along the shorelines of Makassar Strait, between Borneo and Sulawesi in Indonesia, and second, the marked attenuation of species numbers with increasing latitude generally related to limiting temperatures. The contemporary and historical processes leading to these trends are summarized and discussed. Finally, the threats to the mangroves of the various regions within the IWP are subsequently briefly reviewed, and given the ecological and economic values of mangroves, the potential of mangrove restoration/rehabilitation to offset mangrove losses is also evaluated.

TI  - Earthworms in the state of Parana, Brazil: State of the art
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
AB  - Parana State has approximately 74 % of its territory destined for agricultural activities. Several agricultural management practices modify soil quality and biodiversity, including earthworm populations that can contribute to soil health. This study aimed to review the studies carried out in the state of Parana, Brazil, focusing on earthworm populations (abundance, biomass, richness, proportion of native and exotic species) in different land-use systems. In total, 51 publications were compiled, including peer reviewed papers, book chapters, dissertations and theses. We used studies that analyzed chemical and physical soil properties (n = 14) to perform a principal component analysis to explore the relationships between these properties and earthworm populations. In total, 90 earthworm species are known from Parana, of which more than half (n = 46) may be new species that still must be formally described. Of the total, 24 are exotic and 66 are native species, though only 62 (16 %) of the 399 counties have earthworm records. Of the land-use categories sampled, the lowest abundance and biomass were recorded in annual crops under conventional tillage, and the highest populations were found in agroforestry systems. Higher earthworm abundance and species richness were related to higher chemical fertility (soil P and base contents), while biomass was related to higher silt and sand contents.

TI  - Agroforestry systems recover tree carbon stock faster than natural succession in Eastern Amazon, Brazil
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - The potential of agroforestry systems (AFS) for atmospheric carbon sequestration in degraded tropical lands is of key interest for climate change and rural development policies. This study evaluated aboveground and soil (0-20 cm) carbon stocks of AFS, secondary forests (SF), conserved and logged mature forests, on 88 sites in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. Tree carbon stock was higher in young (< 10 years) and advanced (> 30 years) AFS (10.2 +/- 2.0 and 47.2 +/- 8.1 Mg ha(-1), respectively) when compared to the same age SF (5.8 +/- 2.5 and 26.5 +/- 19.5 Mg ha(-1)). However, aboveground and total carbon stocks were statistically similar within the same age categories of AFS and SF, because shrub pool were higher in SF. Conserved mature forests had the highest carbon stocks (190.2 +/- 11.0 Mg ha(-1)), and carbon stocks in logged mature forests (119.4 +/- 5.1 Mg ha(-1)) were similar to the advanced stages of AFS (108.6 +/- 7.5 Mg ha(-1)). Litter and soil organic carbon (SOC) did not differ significantly between land-use systems nor along succession. At 30 years, aboveground carbon recovery was 46% (+/- 16) in AFS and 35% (+/- 21) in SF. Vegetation structural diversity (measured by DBH and height variation) was a good predictor of aboveground carbon stocks. Our results show the potential of AFS for carbon recovery, especially in the tree pool at late stages of development. Structurally more complex AFS provide an alternative to recover degraded lands and to develop synergies between climate change mitigation, adaptation, and goods production in Amazon.

TI  - Monitoring soil quality changes in diversified agricultural cropping systems by the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) in southern Brazil
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Assessment and monitoring impacts of agricultural systems on soil quality are imperative to establish best management practices and sustainable land use for mitigating climate change, conserving biodiversity and achieving food and energy security. The SMAF has successfully been tested as an objective tool to quantify land use and management effects on soil quality, including under some Brazilian soil conditions. Nevertheless, the SMAF potential to properly address soil quality changes under contrasting soil and climate conditions, and integrated farming systems must still must be investigated. Thus, a field study was conducted to apply the SMAF guidelines as a strategy for assessing land use (native vegetation, pasture, sugarcane, no-tillage, and integrated crop-livestock systems) effects on soil quality in southern Brazil. Soil samples were taken in three layers (0.0-0.10, 0.10-0.20, 0.20-0.30 m) of clay Ferralsol (traditional agricultural region), Sandy loam Ferralsol and Arenosol (new agricultural frontiers), in the state of Parana, Brazil. The soil quality indicators investigated were: chemical attributes (pH, phosphorus and potassium), physical (bulk density) and biological (soil organic carbon). Using the SMAF scoring curves, the measured values were transformed (0 to 1 range) and an overall soil quality index (SQI) was calculated. Our findings revealed that long-term conversion from native vegetation to agricultural land uses (i.e., pasture, no-tillage/integrated crop-livestock system, or sugarcane) reduced soil quality assessed by SMAF scores, compromising the soil's capacity to perform its functions. Nevertheless, conservationist systems, e.g. the no-tillage, associated or not with the integrated crop-livestock system are promising alternative to enhances soil quality by increasing C content and soil chemical fertility compared to degraded pasture or conventional sugarcane cultivation. However, soil physical changes should be monitored to alleviate soil compaction in no-tillage cropping systems. In conclusion, this study provided important insights about soil quality changes induced by land use and diversified cropping systems. In that direction, new studies including a large number of sites, soil types and cropping systems are needed for validating our conclusions in a regional scale, enabling to support decision-making towards more sustainable expansion and intensification of agriculture in Brazil.

TI  - Ecophysiology parameters of four Brazilian Atlantic Forest species under shade and drought stress
T2  - ACTA PHYSIOLOGIAE PLANTARUM
AB  - The Brazilian Atlantic Forest has experienced a reduction in its original area since the discovery of Brazil. Over the last 30 years, studies and techniques for forest recovery have advanced. Establishing a self-sustainable reforested area with adequate biodiversity is the main parameter for any reforestation program. Thus, knowledge of the ecophysiological behavior of the species to be used is crucial. Our hypothesis is that certain tools are efficient in determining the ecophysiological characterization of native species within different functional groups. Filling group plants show fast growth, intense gas exchange, present mechanisms of water deficit tolerance and show high efficiency in radiation capture, so they are first planted in a reforestation area. While plants pertaining to the diversity group do not exhibit these characteristics, thus are plants after the establishment of the first group of species. To test this hypothesis, two experiments were installed using young plants of four species native to the Atlantic Forest, grown in 9-L pots. Leaf water potential, gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence and certain biochemical parameters of leaf metabolism were evaluated. In the first experiment, plants were maintained under two forms of light availability for 15 days, full light (control) and shaded (shade). The species Inga sp. and Brosimum guianensis presented the most contrasting responses on day 15, principally in the variables leaf water potential, gas exchange, leaf soluble sugar content, F-v'/F-m' and F-v/F-m. In the second experiment, plants were divided into two groups: a well-hydrated group (control) and one that underwent irrigation suspension for 7 days (drought); measurements were performed on day 8 of drought. Again, Inga sp. and Brosimum guianensis plants showed responses characterizing them as pertaining to distinct functional groups for the experimental parameters previously described. Thus, Inga sp. was classified as pertaining to the filling group and B. guianensis to the diversity group. The performance of the species Cinnamomum zeylancium and Tapirira guianensis under the conditions studied suggests that these are intermediate species with potential for use as filling group species.

AB  - Forest monitoring is essential to maintain the integrity of protected areas, which has become a more pressing issue due to anthropogenic pressures and global climate change. Birds are widely used for this purpose, and as bird diversity is correlated with acoustic indices, it has been suggested that sounds can be used as an ecological indicator of ecosystem complexity and environmental changes. However, previous studies yield controversial results. Thus, we evaluated the effectiveness of six acoustic indices compared with the results obtained from a traditional point-counts survey for forest monitoring in an Atlantic rainforest fragment in Southern Bahia, Brazil. We also determined differences between acoustic indices calculated in the presence and absence of the researcher in the field to quantify the bias caused by human presence during data collection. There was a moderate correlation between the number of bird species just with the acoustic evenness index, from the six acoustic indices evaluated. We also determined that the presence of the researcher in the field at the point-count survey caused bias in acoustic indices. Therefore, more research must be done with autonomous recording units and the acoustic indices before they can be widely adopted for monitoring purposes in complex and diverse habitats such as the Atlantic tropical rainforest.

TI  - The fragmented Atlantic rain forest of Brazil: size, shape and distribution of forest fragments
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - The geographical characteristics of a total of 1839 forest fragments surrounded by sugar cane fields were studied in the Brazilian Atlantic rain forest region of the northeastern state of Pernambuco. The size and shape of the fragments as well as inter-fragment distances and the effects of varying edge width were examined using a geographical information system. The analyses show that the fragments are relatively small and close to each other. Approximately 48% of the rain forest fragments are <10 hectares, while only about 7% are >100 hectares. Forest fragments are close to each other, as fragments located 50 m or less apart formed groups that included ca. 50% of the total forest area. At 350 m inter-fragment distance, 98% of the rain forest area was included in groups of fragments. Due to the small size and irregular shape of the fragments, the total area of edge zone exceeds that of the interior habitat when the edge width is ca. 60 m. At an edge width of 300 m ca. 94% of the total fragment area is edge zone. For conservation purposes, ways of establishing networks of forest fragments connected by corridors and stepping stone fragments are demonstrated using GIS. Simulations using these techniques show that reforestation of sugar cane fields between the forest fragments would considerably increase the area of interior forest habitat and connectivity between fragments.

TI  - Chemical characterization of organic matter in soil aggregates under cacao agroforestry systems assessed by solid-state <SUP>13</SUP>C CPMAS NMR
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Cacao-based agroforestry systems can sequester much soil carbon (C), but information on soil organic matter (SOM) chemical composition within aggregates still needs to be available. This study aimed to evaluate (1) the impact of forest or pasture conversion to cacao AFS by assessing the chemistry of the Cm fraction, considering this as the primary C pool in the studied soils, and (2) which C chemical compounds are associated with the aggregate density fractions. Soil chemical characterization was performed using solid-state C-13 CPMAS NMR. The conversion of pasture into cacao AFS did not impact the chemical composition of C. However, converting natural forest into cacao AFS provided differences in the composition of C compounds, mainly in macroaggregates. Notably, the young rubber tree was more prevalent in promoting changes in the chemical composition of C than cacao. The chemical composition of C in Cm density fractions did not vary across the land-use systems, and it was mostly represented by alkyl-C and O/N-alkyl-C forms. The composition of POM fractions was mainly aryl-C. The knowledge of soil organic matter chemical composition proved to be an adequate tool for application in models to establish management strategies and guide policy toward consolidating low-carbon agriculture in Brazil.

TI  - Controlling trapping, overgrazing and invasive vegetation is key to saving Java's last population of the Black-winged Myna
T2  - ORNITHOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - The Black-winged Myna (Acridotheres melanopterus) is an Endangered passerine endemic to the islands of Java and Bali, Indonesia. Illegal trapping to supply the cage-bird trade has led to its near-total extinction, with the global population estimated to number fewer than 100 individuals. We estimated the current range and population size of the species at Baluran National Park, which supports Java's last known population, and used species distribution modeling to evaluate potential suitability of currently unoccupied areas across the park to identify priorities for management intervention. We estimate that the Black-winged Myna population numbers 179 individuals (95% CI: 111-288; density: 14.3 +/- 3.5 individuals km(2)) and that its current range is 12.3 km'. Our model indicated that some 72 km(2) of the park (30% of total area) has potentially suitable habitat for the species, and we infer that the principal cause for the disparity between its current and potential range is trapping, compounded by savanna loss and degradation due to illegal domestic cattle grazing and the spread of invasive thorny acacia (Vachellia nilotica). The partial clearance of acacia in recent years appears to have assisted a modest population recovery by the myna. Its further population growth and range expansion in Baluran will depend on effective management of illegal poaching, further clearance of acacia, and easing domestic cattle grazing pressure on areas of savanna, particularly through engagement with communities living inside the park. Any actions that increase the size of the Black-winged Myna population are likely to benefit other threatened savanna-dependent wildlife in the park, notably banteng (Bos javanicus) and Green Peafowl (Pavo muticus). While our models and recommendations may be applicable to other protected areas in Java, and indeed other threatened myna species, trapping and habitat change may have site-specific dimensions, especially outside of protected areas, and thus demand local bespoke solutions.

TI  - Spiders (Arachnida: Araneae) in Agricultural Land Use Systems in Subtropical Environments
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
AB  - Changes in land use management in agricultural areas can affect the biodiversity of spider families. This study aimed to evaluate spider diversity in different land use systems with capture by two sampling methods, and to identify soil properties that can modulate the occurrence of spiders. Five land use systems, representative of traditional agricultural areas, were evaluated in the west of Santa Catarina, Brazil, to establish a scale of land use intensity: native forest, eucalyptus reforestation areas, pastures, crop-livestock integration areas, and annual crops under no-tillage. The collection methods were manual from soil monoliths and soil traps. Altogether 479 individuals were captured, which were distributed among 20 families, 40 genera, and 8 species. Principal component analysis separated the land use systems and showed an association of spider families with land use in the two sampling methods. There was reduction in spider diversity as the intensity of land use increased. The manual collection method was more efficient for families of soil spiders, whereas traps were more efficient for epigeic spiders. The Lycosidae family was more resistant to environmental pressures, while Oonopidae and Amaurobiidae were more sensitive to environmental modifications. The differences in the spider communities were explained by the following soil properties: organic matter, mean weight-diameter of soil aggregates, and resistance to penetration, which were associated with the degree of anthropic intervention in the land use systems.

TI  - Cultural landscapes of the Araucaria Forests in the northern plateau of Santa Catarina, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
AB  - Background: The Araucaria Forest is associated with the Atlantic Forest domain and is a typical ecosystem of southern Brazil. The expansion of Araucaria angustifolia had a human influence in southern Brazil, where historically hunter-gatherer communities used the pinhao, araucaria's seed, as a food source. In the north of the state of Santa Catarina, the Araucaria Forest is a mosaic composed of cultivation and pasture inserted between forest fragments, where pinhao and erva-mate are gathered; some local communities denominate these forest ecotopes as caivas. Therefore, the aim of this study is to understand how human populations transform, manage and conserve landscapes using the case study of caivas from the Araucaria Forests of southern Brazil, as well as to evaluate the local ecological knowledge and how these contribute to conservation of the Araucaria Forest.
   Methods: This study was conducted in the northern plateau of the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil in local five communities. To assess ethnoecological perceptions the historical use and management of caivas, semi-structured interviews, checklist interviews and guided tours were conducted with family units.
   Results: In total 28 family units participated in the study that had caivas on their properties. During the course of the study two main perceptions of the ecotope caiva were found, there is no consensus to the exact definition; perception of caivas is considered a gradient. In general caivas are considered to have the presence of cattle feeding on native pasture, with denser forest area that is managed, and the presence of specific species. Eleven management practices within caivas were found, firewood collection, cattle grazing, trimming of the herbaceous layer, and erva-mate extraction were the most common. Caivas are perceived and defined through the management practices and native plant resources. All participants stated that there have been many changes to the management practices within caivas and to the caiva itself.
   Conclusions: These areas still remain today due to cultural tradition, use and management of plant resources. Through this cultural tradition of maintaining caivas the vegetation of the Araucaria Forest has been conserved associated to the use of the Araucaria Forests native plant resources.

TI  - Bird Assemblages in Coffee Agroforestry Systems and Other Human Modified Habitats in Indonesia
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
AB  - Simple Summary Given the high degree of deforestation in the tropics due to shifting agriculture, it is a priority for conservation to find sustainable agriculture systems. We assessed bird communities over 1228 plots from 21 sites in the highly populated island of Java, Indonesia. We found that commercial coffee polycultures (i.e., fields comprised of coffee plants, other crops and/or fruit trees, and diverse shade trees) could sustain similar levels of bird abundance, diversity, and richness than coffee systems under natural forests and community managed forests. Commercial coffee polyculture fields host higher bird abundance, diversity, and richness than sun-exposed coffee fields, fields with other crops or fruit trees, and tree farms. We provide evidence that complex commercial agroforestry systems can host similar levels of biodiversity to agroforestry systems under natural forest. Deforestation in the tropics is mainly driven by the need to expand agriculture and forestry land. Tropical cropland has also undergone a process of intensification, particularly evident in regions that are the main exporters of deforestation-driven commodities. Around 25 million people in the world depend on coffee production, which has a profound contribution to global biodiversity loss through agricultural extensification and intensification. Nevertheless, coffee agroforestry systems have been postulated to serve as an alternative refuge for biodiversity across different regions. We aim to compare bird abundance, diversity, and richness in commercial polyculture coffee systems (i.e., the highest degree of habitat complexity that can be achieved in coffee fields after deforestation) with other coffee agroforestry systems and human modified habitats in Java, Indonesia. We collected data in 21 sites (1228 points) on Java from February to August 2021 using the point sampling method. Via generalised additive models, we tested whether the abundance, diversity, and richness of birds were different between different human modified habitats including other potential predictors such as elevation, distance to protected areas, shade tree richness, and plant diversity. Using the non-metric multidimensional scaling, we tested whether there was a difference in terms of the composition of foraging guilds between habitats. Commercial polyculture coffee fields can sustain levels of bird abundance, diversity, and richness comparable to agroforestry systems under natural forest, and higher than sun coffee and shaded monoculture coffee, and of other human modified habitats such as crop/fruit fields and tree farms. Coffee agroforestry systems have a higher proportion of nectarivores, insectivores, and frugivores than other systems that can sustain high diversity and richness of birds such as paddy fields that mainly have granivores and carnivores. Complex polycultures can represent an avenue for the future of sustainable agriculture in conditions where deforestation rates are high and in crops such as coffee, which maintain high yield in the presence of diverse shade.

TI  - Importance of Protected Areas by Brazilian States to Reduce Deforestation in the Amazon
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
AB  - Protected areas (PAs) help in strategies for maintaining biodiversity and inhibiting deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. However, there are few studies that evaluate the effectiveness of lands protected by states (or federation units). Our goal was to compare land use change over 35 years in state-level PAs with another area of protection, both in the Amazon of the Maranhao state, Brazil. We employed remote sensing techniques, the geographic information system (GIS), and statistical analysis with the use of analyses of covariance (ANCOVAS) to analyze the presence of the classes of land use and change in the PA. The results indicate that the state PAs were effective in preserving forest cover and decelerating grazing. The implications of the results are discussed in the context of supporting public policies at the state level for the protection of the Amazon.

TI  - Oil palm plantation systems are at a crossroads☆
T2  - OCL-OILSEEDS AND FATS CROPS AND LIPIDS
AB  - The future of most tropical sectors is clouded by growing constraints linked to, among many other parameters, climate change, price volatility and labour scarcity. Perpetuating agricultural systems inherited from the colonial era (a time of abundant arable land, protected markets, and cheap and disciplined labour) will not be enough to prepare these sectors in facing immediate crucial challenges unless substantial structural transformations are made.Implementing a successful agroecological transition in a 70-billion USD sector, covering 25 million ha worldwide, calls for drastic changes in mind-sets and practices. The key issue is no longer simply to increase productivity, but to foster innovations designed to support endangered tropical biodiversity, while providing a decent living for shrinking agricultural communities in the Global South.Agroforestry practices have a role to play in providing substantial climate change mitigation with an impact comparable to other climate-focused solutions, such as reforestation. The expected contribution of oil palm-based agroforestry relies on agro-environmental services, as basic agricultural functions such as soil preservation, pollination, or pest control can be ensured by living organisms inside and around the plantation. Diversified systems are able to achieve both economic and environmental gains, as they use land more efficiently than monocultures. Building on regenerative agriculture, new plantation designs are emerging and deserve to be thoroughly assessed to establish evidence-based advocacy for change.

TI  - Global chocolate supply is limited by low pollination and high temperatures
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) provides livelihoods for 5 million smallholder farmers, but the factors limiting cocoa yield are poorly understood. We present a global analysis of pollination, cocoa tree, plantation, and climate factors affecting cocoa yield, with experimental data from three major cocoa-producing countries: Brazil, Ghana and Indonesia. Hand-pollination increased yield by 20%, showing cocoa yield is limited by pollination, but not nutrients. Leaf litter and large cacao trees, measures of soil resource availability and access, increased yield by 9-19%. Cooler temperatures by 7 degrees C during the hot season increased yield by up to 31%, indicating substantial risks from climate warming. Agricultural production that enhances cocoa pollinator abundance, protects soils, and mitigates climate risks will be the most effective way to secure global cocoa production and support livelihoods into the future.

TI  - Sugar palm (Arenga pinnata (Wurmb) Merr.) for livelihoods and biodiversity conservation in the orangutan habitat of Batang Toru, North Sumatra, Indonesia: mixed prospects for domestication
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Domestication of desirable forest resources in agroforestry is expected to contribute to community based forest conservation efforts, but there may be an optimum level of domestication in this respect. Aren or sugar palm (Arenga pinnata (Wurmb) Merr.) is a multipurpose tree that provides livelihoods for local people and food for other biota in the landscape. However, its domestication is still limited in many places, such as in Batang Toru Forest Block, an area of high conservation value, including habitat for the Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii). Options for aren management were prioritized as part of a landscape-scale conservation study by comparing domestication levels in the area. Data on economic indicators and ecological knowledge were gathered through interviews with key farmers, focus groups and transect walks. Four representative villages were selected for the study, that is, (i) two villages with no domestication of aren; and (ii) two villages with aren cultivation in rubber-based land-use systems. Costbenefit analyses suggested that in a rich biodiversity area, such as Batang Toru, although aren was one of the sources of local livelihoods, additional investment for domestication beyond cultivation was not an option considered by farmers. Farmers still perceived wildlife as an efficient mode of aren regeneration, supported by the coexistence of people and other biota in the area. It appears the value of aren for local people's livelihoods and conservation can be enhanced by increasing its stocking density. There is also scope for improving market access and share of end-user value received by farmers.

TI  - Assessing Dominant Production Systems in the Eastern Amazon Forest
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - The expansion of agricultural frontiers in the Amazon region poses a significant threat to forest conservation and biodiversity persistence. This study focuses on Par & aacute; state, Brazil, aiming to identify and characterize the predominant production systems by combining remote sensing data and landscape structure metrics. A rule-based classification tree algorithm is applied to classify hexagonal cells based on land cover, deforestation patterns, and distance from dairy facilities. The results reveal three dominant production systems: Natural Region, Non-Intensive Beef, and Initial Front, with livestock production being prominent. The analysis indicates that there is a correlation between the productive area and deforestation, emphasizing the role of agriculture as a driver of forest loss. Moreover, road networks significantly influence production system spatial distribution, highlighting the importance of infrastructure in land use dynamics. The Shannon diversity index reveals that areas with production systems exhibit greater diversity in land use and land cover classes, reflecting a wider range of modifications. In contrast, natural vegetation areas show lower Shannon values, suggesting that these areas are more intact and are less affected by human activities. These findings underscore the urgent need for sustainable development policies that will mitigate threats to forest resilience and biodiversity in Par & aacute; state.

TI  - Spatially explicit modeling of land use and land cover in the State of Rio de Janeiro-Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The identification of the types of land use and land cover (LULC) can be one of the first requirements to monitor and evaluate the flow of environmental dynamics, due to the accelerated process of changes in terrestrial space, causing environmental and socioeconomic impacts. The region chosen for this study is an area of high biodiversity and has within its geographical limit the second largest city in the Southeast region of Brazil. The objective of this work was to parameterize a model of LULC, which comprises the State of Rio de Janeiro inserted in the Atlantic Forest Biome. For that, it was necessary to calibrate and validate the simulations, in the period between 2010 and 2016, respectively. The LuccME (Land Use and Cover Change Modeling Environmental) model was adopted, which identified the process of LULC changes, and made it possible to project future scenarios for 2020 and 2030, being optimistic and pessimistic. The study indicated the trend in pessimistic growth scenarios in areas that previously had forest in pastures and urban growth, with a low rate of native vegetation area. This is a warning for public and private sector management about territorial planning, for that in the future the population will suffer from the scarcity of natural resources. In the optimistic scenarios, the changes in vegetation are shows more intensely, since in the areas that were undergoing the process of restoration and reforestation, they recover to the point of changing from pasture to forest. In both scenarios, agriculture remained in the most productive and productive areas, with no significant increases or loss of area. Therefore, the use of this model allows the evaluate to have more consistent of environmental estimates, which can be used in different areas of knowledge.

CP  - IMACS World Congress/Modelling and Simulation Society-of-Australia-and-New-Zealand (MSSANZ)/18th MODSIM09 Biennial Conference on Modelling and Simulation
AB  - Simple simulation models have been built in remote locations with participation of local Indigenous peoples and their representatives to develop a shared understanding of the livelihood implications of conservation initiatives and the potential environmental impacts of measures to improve local livelihoods.
   Models were built with Ba'aka people in the Congo Basin, Punans and other Dayak groups in East Kalimantan, Indonesia and rural communities in Ghana. Recently, the program began developing landscape partnerships and modeling initiatives with Papuans in the West Papua province of Indonesia. The models facilitated discussion and negotiation between Indigenous peoples and representatives of conservationist groups, resource extraction companies and government officials and allowed exploration of different scenarios for both conservation and development interventions.
   The models failed to produce empirical evidence to support claims made by conservation organisations of the positive livelihood impacts of their conservation programmes. In all cases the material benefits to local Indigenous people of activities such as mineral extraction, logging, agro-industrial developments etc. greatly exceed the often hypothetical benefits postulated from the small-scale local development activities of conservation organisations. The modelling exercises also provoked debates and awareness of the broader dimensions of livelihoods as perceived by Indigenous peoples. Health care, education, infrastructure and employment consistently emerged as the highest priorities for Indigenous communities in all the study sites.
   Including Indigenous people in the process of participatory modelling, alongside other stakeholders such as government officials, conservation NGOs, and scientists is important in confronting the challenge of making trade-offs between human well-being and nature. Biodiversity conservation will only succeed in the long term if it is based upon approaches that fully recognize and address the inevitable trade-offs between the development needs of local people and the maintenance of areas of intact nature.
   Forest conservation programmes still do not give enough attention to the legitimate needs of people living within and dependent on the forests. It is all too easy to lay blame on developers, corrupt government officials, and other parties for forest destruction. Successful conservation programmes must allow for the improvement of and the stability of income streams and increasing food security.

TI  - A step to disentangle diversity patterns in Uruguayan grasslands: Climatic seasonality, novel land-uses, and landscape context drive diversity of ground flora
T2  - CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
AB  - South American grasslands contain extraordinary biodiversity and play a central role in the subsistence of regional agroecosystems. In recent decades, afforestation, followed by the soybean planting boom, have led to drastic land-use changes at the expense of grasslands. Impacts on local biodiversity have remained understudied. We explored the taxonomic richness and ss-diversity of plants of ground layer (excluding trees and shrubs) at different land uses, its interplay at regional scale with environmental heterogeneity, and at local scale with novel land cover types and landscape configurations. We conducted correlation, principal component, NDMS, and SDR analysis to explore variation of taxonomic richness, richness difference, replacement, and similarity of ground flora as response to environmental filters and land use change across Uruguay. We surveyed 160 plots distributed in 10 land cover types, that is, closed and open native forests, different grasslands, crops, orchards, and timber plantations. We observed overlaying regional patterns driven by seasonality of temperature and precipitation, and land cover shaping taxonomic richness at local scale. Landscape configuration affects diversity patterns of native ground flora, which seems to be sustained mainly by the "old growth grassland" species pool. Taxonomic richness of native species decreases with an increase of distance to grassland. Crops and grasslands harbor a higher number of native species in the ground flora than native forests and timber plantations. The introduction of exotics is driven mostly by crops or highly modified pastures. Diversity patterns only partially reflect the ecoregion concept. Expanding the perspective from conservation in purely natural ecosystems to measures conserving species richness in human-modified landscapes is a powerful tool against species loss in the Anthropocene.

TI  - Dynamics of leaf litter and soil respiration in a complex multistrata agroforestry system, Pernambuco, Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - High litter inputs in agroforestry systems contribute to soil microbial activity, soil fertility and productivity. Considering that the cycling of organic matter is essential to the maintenance of physical-chemical and microbiological properties of the soil, the aims of this work were to estimate the production, accumulation and decomposition of litter, and assess soil microbial respiration in a complex multistrata agroforestry system located in the north-east of Brazil. This agroforestry system has three strata formed by forest and fruit trees and species of multiple uses. During 3 years (2011-2013), leaf litter was sampled monthly to account for litterfall and quarterly to account for litter accumulation. The rates of litter decomposition were estimated using the ratio produced-to-accumulated litter, and the correlation between litter fall and rainfall was calculated. Precipitation data were provided by the water and climate agency of Pernambuco (APAC). Soil samples (0-15 cm) were also taken quarterly, simultaneously with the litter accumulation samples, and soil microbial respiration was assessed using the capture, by a KOH solution, of the evolved CO2. The annual production of leaf litter was stable in the 3 years of study in this agroforestry system, and the monthly input of litter to the soil was influenced by rainfall, being higher in the dry seasons. The accumulated litter on the ground was constant, as was microbial activity (respiration) through time. The estimated litter decomposition rates were 1.49 (first year), 1.33 (second year) and 1.42 (third year), being considered rapid rates of decomposition. This guarantees (to the farmer) that this system is capable of maintaining soil fertility and eliminates the need for chemical fertilizers.

TI  - Vertical distribution of aboveground biomass in a seasonal deciduous forest
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS AGRARIAS-AGRARIA
AB  - Knowledge of aboveground biomass stock in Seasonal Deciduous Forests is imperative for the implementation of mechanisms to reduce emissions from deforestation, forest degradation and land reclamation. The present study analyzed the vertical distribution of aboveground biomasses in a Seasonal Deciduous Forest in Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. Seven 12 x 12 m plots were established, and all trees inside the plots were weighed directly in the field. Subplots of 5 x 5 m and 1 x 1 m were marked within the main plots to quantify the remaining vegetation. Average dry aboveground biomass was 316.5 Mg ha-1, trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) greater than 10 cm accounting for over 89% of this biomass. Therefore, biomass determination of large trees deserves special attention, since they represent a large part of the biomass of this forest ecosystem. Biomass of plants taller than 1.3 m and with diameter at breast height < 5 cm was 6.9 Mg ha-1, and that of plants lower than 1.3 m was 1.5 Mg ha-1. Average litter mass was 15.6 Mg ha-1. Trees of large diameters must be analyzed very carefully for quantify the biomass and carbon in the forests, because few individuals might represent a large part of the biomass of a forest ecosystem.

TI  - Contribution of agroforests to landscape carbon storage
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - While many studies have measured the carbon (C) stocks of traditional agroforests at the plot level, their contribution to overall landscape C storage has rarely been quantified. Here we demonstrate the significant contribution that traditional agroforests with shaded tree crops can make to landscape C storage, and thus climate change mitigation, focusing on the cocoa (Theobroma cacao) agroforests (locally known as cabrucas) of southern Bahia, Brazil. Using published allometric relationships and tree inventories of 55 shaded cocoa farms, 6 mature forests, 8 disturbed forests and 7 fallows, we calculate average aboveground C stocks of 87 and 46 Mg ha(-1) in traditional and intensified cocoa agroforests, respectively, 183 Mg ha(-1) in old-growth forests, 102 Mg ha(-1) in disturbed forests and 33 Mg ha(-1) in fallows. Based on the most recent land cover data available, we estimate that cocoa agroforests hold 59 % of the total aboveground C stocks of the tree dominated vegetation in this landscape, while forests hold 32 % and fallows hold 9 %. Carbon stocks of intensified cocoa agroforestry systems were only little over one-half of those of traditional agroforests, indicating a threat to landscape C stocks from current land use trends. We show that in agroforests as in natural forests, C stocks are highly concentrated in the largest trees. This suggests that the intensification of traditional agroforests, which generally involves increasing the density of cocoa and other tree crops and reducing the density of shade trees, is possible without greatly affecting their C storage if large trees are conserved. In order to conserve the climate stabilizing effect of traditional agroforests and steer necessary intensification measures towards climate-friendly solutions, we suggest that biodiversity and C-rich traditional agroforests should be included in current discussions about Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) and/or their owners be rewarded for their environmental services through other incentive mechanisms.

TI  - Near Real-Time Fire Detection and Monitoring in the MATOPIBA Region, Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - MATOPIBA is an agricultural frontier, where fires are essential for its biodiversity maintenance. However, the increase in its recurrence and intensity, as well as accidental fires can lead to socioeconomic and environmental losses. Due to this dual relationship with fire, near real-time (NRT) fire management is required throughout the region. In this context, we developed, to the best of our knowledge, the first Machine Learning (ML) algorithm based on the GOES-16 ABI sensor able to detect and monitor Active Fires (AF) in NRT in MATOPIBA. To do so, we analyzed the best combination of three ML algorithms and how long it takes to consider a historical time series able to support accurate AF predictions. We used the most accurate combination for the final model (FM) development. The results show that the FM ensures an overall accuracy rate of approximately 80%. The FM potential is remarkable not only for single detections but also for a consecutive sequence of positive predictions. Roughly, the FM achieves an accuracy rate peak after around 20 h of consecutive AF detections, but there is an important trade-off between the accuracy and the time required to assemble more fire indications, which can be decisive for firefighters in real life.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECT OF LONG TERM TILLAGE ON THE ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZA COLONIZATION OF VEGETABLE CROPS GROWN IN ANDISOLS
T2  - AGRIVITA
AB  - In Indonesia, amount of biodiversity could be found including soil microorganism which were useful for sustainable agriculture. Everything lives in agricultural land were interacts and influences each others. Many factors of biotic and a-biotic environment such as land and climate fluctuation influences microbial expansion within the soils. For example arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) which was formed by myches (fungus) and root of higher plant maybe fluctuated in the expansion due to the soil tillage. Land management and the present higher plant affected its growth and expansion. Mycorrhizae spores as one of the important generative form of various species in the difference host plant. The implication of different host plant often close related to the soil management and properties. Soil sample that was collected from various host plant in the fields or bare land have been found varied spores. Andisols and its properties conserve higher organic matter relatively and developed in the cold temperature, therefore very suitable for AM expansion and also as natural resources stock of AM potentially.

TI  - Street trees reduce the negative effects of urbanization on birds
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The effects of streets on biodiversity is an important aspect of urban ecology, but it has been neglected worldwide. Several vegetation attributes (e.g. street tree density and diversity) have important effects on biodiversity and ecological processes. In this study, we evaluated the influences of urban vegetation-represented by characteristics of street trees (canopy size, proportion of native tree species and tree species richness)-and characteristics of the landscape (distance to parks and vegetation quantity), and human impacts (human population size and exposure to noise) on taxonomic data and functional diversity indices of the bird community inhabiting streets. The study area was the southern region of Belo Horizonte (Minas Gerais, Brazil), a largely urbanized city in the understudied Neotropical region. Bird data were collected on 60 point count locations distributed across the streets of the landscape. We used a series of competing GLM models (using Akaike's information criterion for small sample sizes) to assess the relative contribution of the different sets of variables to explain the observed patterns. Seventy-three bird species were observed exploiting the streets: native species were the most abundant and frequent throughout this landscape. The bird community's functional richness and Rao's Quadratic Entropy presented values lower than 0.5. Therefore, this landscape was favoring few functional traits. Exposure to noise was the most limiting factor for this bird community. However, the average size of arboreal patches and, especially the characteristics of street trees, were able to reduce the negative effects of noise on the bird community. These results show the importance of adequately planning the urban afforestation process: increasing tree species richness, preserving large trees and planting more native trees species in the streets are management practices that will increase bird species richness, abundance and community functional aspects and consequently improve human wellbeing and quality of life.

TI  - The 2015 Borneo fires: What have we learned from the 1997 and 2006 El Ninos?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Fire activity in Indonesia is strongly linked with El Nino events, whose sea surface temperature (SST) patterns can weaken the Walker circulation to induce drought conditions in the region. Here we show via case analyses and idealized climate model simulations that it is the central location of the SST anomalies associated with El Nino, rather than its strength, that is mostly linked with the fire occurrence. During our study period of 1997-2015, Eastern Pacific (EP) El Nino events produced the largest fire events in southern Borneo (i. e., in 1997, 2006, and 2015), while Central Pacific (CP) El Nino events consistently produced minor fire events. The EP El Nino is found to be more capable than the CP El Nino of weakening the Walker circulation that acts to prolong Borneo's drought condition from September to October. The extended dry conditions in October potentially increase the occurrence of fires during EP El Nino years. The 2015 fire event owes its occurrence to the location of the 2015 El Nino but not necessarily its 'Godzilla' strength in affecting the fire episodes over southern Borneo. Projecting the location of El Nino events might be more important than projecting their strength for fire management in southern Borneo.

TI  - Silvopastoral management of beef cattle production for neutralizing the environmental impact of enteric methane emission
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - It is well recognized that commercial beef cattle production systems have a major impact on climate change, mainly due to the emission of enteric methane (CH4). The objective of this research was to evaluate if integrating animal + pasture + timber production in silvopastoral systems (SPS) would help neutralize the impact of enteric CH4 emission by facilitating carbon storage as soil organic carbon (SOC). This paper reports a study conducted in Brazil with a herd of 150 cows in 100 ha of Urochloa brizantha with Eucalyptus urograndis, on four tree configurations: SPS 1-clone GG-100 at 2 x 3 x 15 m spacing; SPS 2-clone i-144 at 2 x 3 x 15 m; SPS 3-clone GG-100 at 3 x 15 m; and SPS 4-clone i-144 at 3 x 15 m. Based on data collected through eight consecutive years, the gas balance was estimated. For all SPS treatments average, the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) of additional C stock exceeded the emissions. Considering only C sequestration from trees, the average CO(2)e sequestration was - 26.27 Mg center dot CO(2)e ha(-1), while the average emissions of CO2 e was 23.54 Mg center dot CO(2)e ha(-1) for enteric CH4 + pasture + tree, giving a net balance of - 2.73 Mg center dot CO(2)e ha(-1). The "loss" of CO(2)e analyzed was compensated by the soil C sequestration in long-lived SOC pools, enhancing the resilience of farming systems by increasing soil organic matter and soil fertility capacity, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, therefore, providing benefits in livestock production and for environmental remediation.

TI  - Dung beetle diversity and functions suggest no major impacts of cattle grazing in the Brazilian Pantanal wetlands
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - 1. Dung beetles perform relevant ecological functions in pastures, such as dung removal and parasite control. Livestock farming is the main economic activity in the Brazilian Pantanal. However, the impact of cattle grazing on the Pantanal's native dung beetle community, and functions performed by them, is still unknown. 2. This study evaluated the effects of cattle activity on dung beetle community attributes (richness, abundance, biomass, composition, and functional group) as well as their ecological functions (dung removal and soil bioturbation) in the Pantanal. In January/February 2016, dung beetles were sampled and their ecological functions measured in 16 sites of native grasslands in Aquidauana, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, 10 areas regularly grazed by cattle and six control ungrazed areas (> 20 years of abandonment). 3. In all, 1169 individuals from 30 species of dung beetles were collected. Although abundance, species richness, and biomass did not differ between grasslands with and without cattle activity, species composition and functional groups differed among systems. Large roller beetles were absent from non-cattle grasslands, and the abundance, richness, and biomass of medium roller beetles was higher in those systems. 4. Despite causing changes in species/functional group composition, the results of this study show that a density compensation of functional groups in cattle-grazed natural grasslands seems to have conserved the ecological functions (dung removal and soil bioturbation), with no significant differences between systems. 5. Therefore, these results provide evidence that cattle breeding in natural grasslands of the Brazilian Pantanal can integrate livestock production with the conservation of the dung beetle community and its ecological functions.

TI  - The Forest Policies of ASEAN and Montreal Process: Comparing Highly and Weakly Formalized Regional Regimes
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Forests are governed by a combination of sub-national and national as well as global and regional regimes. Comparing the institutional variation of regional regimes, including their degrees of formalization, is gaining attention of studies on regionalism in International Relations. This study attempts to analyse the ways in which the selected cases of the forest-related Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and forest-focused Montreal Process (MP) regional regimes may have synergetic overlaps or disparity in their institutional design and forest policy development. For this, we combined IR's 'rational institutional design' theory and a policy analysis approach. Using a qualitative data approach, we analyzed key structure-related historical regime documents (e.g., charters) issued since the inception of both regimes, and their latest forest policy initiatives for the periods 2016-2025 (Strategic Plan of Action for ASEAN Cooperation on Forestry) and 2009-2015 (Conceptual Framework for the Montreal Process Strategic Action Plan) with all relevant policy documents since the adoption of current policies. Based on that, we pose the empirical questions of how both regimes illustrate governance structure (i.e., institutional design), and on the other hand how to explain regime forest policies coherently and consistently in terms of their high versus low degree of formality. The results show that institutional design is highly explanatory based on treaty and non-treaty regime formation as well as forest-related/focused regime formation with the synergistic sustainable forest management (SFM) issue that embraces deforestation and forest degradation, biodiversity, timber certification, and greenhouse gas emission. Additionally, the results suggest that the policy goals adopted by both regimes are coherent and consistent based on the full set of policy elements. Concerning the remedy for fragmented global forest governance arrangements, both regimes would be an example of practicing SFM-focused policies with the incorporation of forest-related policy elements into a larger governance assemblage dealing with issues such as biodiversity conservation or climate change mitigation.

TI  - Assessment of the Diverse Roles of Home Gardens and Their Sustainable Management for Livelihood Improvement in West Java, Indonesia
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Home garden is a traditional agroforestry system, which is an ecologically and socio-economically sustainable land use system in West Java, Indonesia. It plays a fundamental role in providing subsistence food and income to local people through a multi-strata structure. Despite the importance of the home garden, which is strongly linked with quality of living, there is still a lack of quantitative data and information. Therefore, we quantified the economic and ecological characteristics of home gardens in the present study to evaluate their diverse roles. In addition, general strategies that are applicable to home gardens in West Java were developed for sustainable management. The results of this study indicated that: (1) large landholding size showed a significantly higher Net Present Value (NPV) than small landholding size when the home gardens were dominated by fruit tree species, (2) species richness, species diversity, and carbon stock did not differ significantly among the different types and sizes of home gardens in West Java, and (3) multi-layered and diverse species composition is considerable for sustainable management of home gardens in terms of income generation and against urbanization and commercialization in West Java, Indonesia. Further studies should be considered for developing a standardized and generalized model that is able to evaluate and quantify the various ecosystem values that are generally acceptable and applicable in rural areas.

TI  - Livestock-Carnivore Coexistence: Moving beyond Preventive Killing
T2  - ANIMALS
AB  - Simple Summary Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 indicate that zero hunger (SDG 2) and halting biodiversity loss (SDG 15) are key priorities. Livestock management practices that allow coexistence with top predators are necessary to achieve both objectives in Latin America. This article addresses the situation in local indigenous communities near key biodiversity hotspots that protect top predators in Mesoamerica. Results show that livestock predation is related to landscape variables and human influence. Jaguar and puma conservation requires measures that facilitate human-carnivore coexistence and comply with SDG 2 and SDG 15. This study serves as a baseline to provide livestock management recommendations that mitigate the prevalent conflict with jaguars and pumas to reconcile SDG 2 with SDG 15. Livestock predation is a global problem and constitutes the main source of conflict between large carnivores and human interests. In Latin America, both jaguar and puma are known to prey on livestock, yet studies in Mesoamerica have been scattered and few have been carried out in Honduras. We interviewed ranchers in a biosphere reserve where jaguars and pumas are present. Local indigenous communities reported livestock predation (average annual loss of 7% from 2010-2019), with preventive and retaliatory killing as their main actions against predation by the jaguar and puma. Other sources of cattle loss included diseases and theft. The extensive management system (free grazing) lets cattle access forests where predators are more common. We found that livestock predation is not random, but rather, related to landscape variables and human influence. Sites farther from human influence and closer to forest cover were more susceptible to predation. Jaguar and puma persistence in the biosphere reserve will require measures that facilitate human-carnivore coexistence and comply with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2 and 15 (zero hunger and biodiversity conservation). We propose management practices to mitigate livestock predation in the presence of large carnivores based on examples of proven human-carnivore coexistence in Venezuela, Brazil, Paraguay, and Nicaragua, such as improving the spatial arrangement of livestock (maintaining a distance from forest areas) and the incorporation of confinement pens for young calves (at least the first three months of life) and their mothers. If the pens are built close to the property's house and have constant surveillance and/or dogs, the results are likely to be more effective. Deploying these proven tools may help change the current negative perception of ranchers towards large carnivores that is essential to conservation under the aims of SDG 15. We recommend government policies and support aimed to strengthen livestock health to increase productivity and to reduce their vulnerability to predation. Finally, this study represents a baseline to understand the magnitude of the human-carnivore conflict over cattle in one of the largest biosphere reserves in Mesoamerica.

TI  - The influence of land use systems on soil and surface litter fauna in the western region of Santa Catarina
T2  - REVISTA CIENCIA AGRONOMICA
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the abundance of soil and surface litter fauna in the western region of Santa Catarina state, southern Brazil, in the following land use systems (LUS): no-tillage crops (NT), integrated crop-livestock (ICL), pasture (PA), Eucalyptus plantation (EP) and native forest fragments (NF). Sampling was done in three counties in the western region of Santa Catarina: Xanxere, Chapeco and Sao Miguel do Oeste, in two seasons (winter and summer). The evaluation of soil/litter fauna in each LUS was performed by installing nine "pitfall traps" per sampling grid (3 x 3). The counties are true replicas. The soil for the chemical attributes was collected at the same sampling points for soil fauna. Altogether, 17 taxa were identified in the five LUS. The presence of groups of fauna was influenced by the type of soil management used. The LUS NF and EP provide better soil conditions for the development of a higher diversity of soil fauna groups compared to other LUS, which showed varying degrees of human intervention, regardless of the sampling season (winter or summer). However, annual crop systems NT and ICL groups showed greater richness and total abundance when compared to the perennial systems (EP and PA). Principal component analysis is an important tool in the study of biological indicators of sustainability because it allows use of soil attributes (chemical and physical) as explanatory environmental variables, which helps in the interpretation of ecological data.

TI  - Microtopographic specialization and flexibility in tropical peat swamp forest tree species
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Tropical tree species distributions are determined by a wide range of biotic and abiotic factors, including topography and hydrology. Tropical peat swamp forests (TPSFs) are characterized in part by small-scale variations in topography ('hummocks' and 'hollows') that create distinct microhabitats and thus may contribute to niche diversification among TPSF tree species. Using tree elevations calibrated to daily peat water levels collected using a data logger and a permutation test, we evaluated topographical microhabitat preferences for 21 tree species in a relatively undisturbed TPSF in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, to determine whether these species show preferential association with hummocks or hollows and to quantify the prevalence of microhabitat specialization among them. Only one species, Tetractomia tetrandrum, emerged as a hollow specialist, with no hummock specialists among the species tested. The remaining 20 species, including Psydrax dicoccos, which had the lowest mean observed elevation, and Maasia hypoleuca, which had the highest mean observed elevation, showed no clear microtopographic preference. This suggests that many TPSF species may be resilient to the natural hydrologic variations that occur in relatively intact peat swamp forests. Such studies of microtopographic preferences of tree species in TPSF and other wetland forest ecosystems can inform selection of tree species for reforestation projects, and potentially also provide information on how future climate change may impact these habitats and their resident tree species.

TI  - Earthworms in various agricultural and forest ecosystems in S?o Carlos-SP, Brazil
T2  - ZOOTAXA
AB  - Integrated agricultural systems have been greatly expanding in Brazil and currently cover over 30 million hectares. Although these land use systems help soil and environmental quality, little is known of their impacts on earthworm communities. In the present study we evaluated earthworm abundance, biomass and species richness in various integrated and conventional agricultural production systems (pasture, crops), as well as native forest and Eucalyptus plantations. The research was carried out at Fazenda Canchim (Embrapa Livestock Southeast) and at the neighboring campus of the University de Sao Carlos (UFSCar), in Sao Carlos municipality in Sao Paulo state, Brazil. Two earthworm sampling methods, i.e., quantitative (25 x 25 x 20 cm deep monoliths) and qualitative (holes of similar size and niche sampling), were used in three integrated production systems, three conventional systems and two forest systems, totaling 232 quantitative samples and over 160 qualitative samples. Earthworms were counted and identified using available keys. Eight earthworm species of five families (Rhinodrilidae, Ocnerodrilidae, Megascolecidae, Benhamiidae and Glossoscolecidae) were found, with most of the 2,145 individuals being exotic or peregrine species, particularly Pontoscolex corethrurus (88% of total) and various Dichogaster spp. (8% of total). Two native species were encountered in low abundance (55 individuals), both of which are new to science (Fimoscolex n.sp.7 and Glossoscolex n.sp.9) and must still be formally described. The new species were found in the agricultural systems, but not in the native forest and the Eucalyptus plantation, where P. corethrurus and Megascolecids predominated. One unidentified Ocnerodrilid sp. was found only in the intensive pasture. Species richness was highest in the intensive pasture (7 spp.), followed by the agrosilvopastoral and agropastoral systems, highlighting the importance of integrated and pastoral systems in preserving earthworm richness and native species.

TI  - Diversity of mycorrhizal fungi and soil indicative species in coastal plantations of northeast Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi as soil indicators and the mycorrhization of native and exotic tree species planted in the Acarau basin, a transition area from the coast to the Brazilian semiarid region. Plots with 6-year-old trees of four native and three non-native species as well as one non-forested area were evaluated in terms of the diversity of AM fungi in the mycorrhizosphere and the root colonization by AM and ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi. Twenty-four AM fungi were identified;Claroideoglomus etunicatum, Glomus sinuosum, Paraglomus albidum, Acaulospora laevis,andAcaulospora brasiliensiswere abundant in the forest soil. Diversity, dominance, evenness and richness indices of AM fungi were higher in plots with native trees. All root samples were colonized by AM fungi and onlyAnadenanthera colubrina, Acacia mangium, Casuarina equisetifoliaandEucalyptus urophyllaformed associations with EcM fungi.Acaulosporamorphotypes served as soil indicators for coverings with the native speciesAstronium fraxinifoliumandColubrina glandulosa. Exotic species may favor the proliferation of rarer AM fungi. These fungi-plant relationships may be important in the management of forest systems, and the evidence with mycorrhizal associations allows the inclusion of Brazilian species in tropical reforestation.

TI  - Environmental drivers and diversity of open plant communities in grassland and wetland mosaics in coastal southern Brazil
T2  - FOLIA GEOBOTANICA
AB  - Small-scale biotic and abiotic variables can influence species composition at a given location, and environmental heterogeneity across sites can lead to the development of vegetation mosaics. Understanding how plant communities are influenced by these variables is fundamental to devise adequate management strategies for biodiversity conservation and management. Here, we evaluated the plant species composition and environmental drivers of different open environments of Lagoa do Peixe National Park in subtropical southern Brazil. We used cluster analysis (UPGMA) to classify the sites into major vegetation types and verified the relationship of these groups with environmental variables through redundancy analysis (RDA). We conducted indicator species analysis for each group of sites. We found seven groups of sites with distinct species composition: marsh, shrub grassland, wet lowland, grazed grassland, dune vegetation, dune grassland and degraded wet lowland. Variables related to moisture, vegetation height and soil cover, as well as indicators of cattle management and the presence of invasive pine, were the main drivers of changes in species composition among the different groups. At the study site, grazing management contributes to biodiversity conservation, maintaining open habitat with typical species. Understanding open landscapes as compatible with and dependent on management is essential for the conservation of the typical species of these environments.

TI  - Does deforestation promote or inhibit malaria transmission in the Amazon? A systematic literature review and critical appraisal of current evidence
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Considerable interest in the relationship between biodiversity and disease has recently captured the attention of the research community, with important public policy implications. In particular, malaria in the Amazon region is often cited as an example of how forest conservation can improve public health outcomes. However, despite a growing body of literature and an increased understanding of the relationship between malaria and land use/land cover change (LULC) in Amazonia, contradictions have emerged. While some studies report that deforestation increases malaria risk, others claim the opposite. Assessing malaria risk requires examination of dynamic processes among three main components: (i) the environment (i.e. LULC and landscape transformations), (ii) vector biology (e.g. mosquito species distributions, vector activity and life cycle, plasmodium infection rates), and (iii) human populations (e.g. forest-related activity, host susceptibility, movement patterns). In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review on malaria risk and deforestation in the Amazon focusing on these three components. We explore key features that are likely to generate these contrasting results using the reviewed articles and our own data from Brazil and Peru, and conclude with suggestions for productive avenues in future research.
   This article is part of the themed issue 'Conservation, biodiversity and infectious disease: scientific evidence and policy implications'.

TI  - Acoustic indices as proxies for biodiversity in certified and non-certified cocoa plantations in Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB  - Acoustic indices allow time efficient analysis of large acoustic datasets obtained from passive acoustic monitoring, but results regarding their effectiveness in assessing biodiversity are inconsistent. We evaluated the efficacy of six acoustic indices (ACI, ADI, AEI, H, BI, NDSI) for studying bird and structural diversity in 51 cocoa plantations, 24 of which were certified by Rainforest Alliance, in Luwu Timur, Sulawesi, Indonesia. We used linear models to assess the correlation of index values with bird species richness, and linear mixed models to test the influence of canopy closure, shade tree basal area, distance to primary forest and tree cover in a 200-m buffer on index values. Bird species richness was positively correlated with BI (p = 0.02) and negatively with H (p = 0.03), yet predictive power was low (R2 = 0.10 and 0.09, respectively). Acoustic indices did not differ significantly for certified cocoa plantations. Tree cover within the 200-m buffer moderately well predicted ACI values (marginal R2 = 0.37) while for the other indices effect sizes were low or correlations were not significant. Comparing our results to other studies, acoustic indices may reflect biodiversity across land uses, but were of limited value for tracking subtle differences in cocoa plantations in Sulawesi. Future studies may include more land uses (i.e. rice paddies, secondary forest, oil palm) as well as more taxa (i.e. insects). More research is needed on the comparability of acoustic indices, as we found them to be influenced by recording equipment and calculation settings.

TI  - Climate change could threaten cocoa production: Effects of 2015-16 El Nino-related drought on cocoa agroforests in Bahia, Brazil
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Climate models predict a possible increase in the frequency of strong climate events such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which in parts of the tropics are the cause of exceptional droughts, these threaten global food production. Agroforestry systems are often suggested as promising diversification options to increase farmers' resilience to extreme climatic events. In the Northeastern state of Bahia, where most Brazilian cocoa is grown in wildlife-friendly agroforests, ENSOs cause severe droughts which negatively affect forest and agriculture. Cocoa (Theobroma cacao) is described as being sensitive to drought but there are no field-studies of the effect of ENSO-related drought on adult cocoa trees in the America's; there is one study of an experimentally-imposed drought in Indonesia which resulted in 10 to 46% yield loss. In our study, in randomly chosen farms in Bahia, Brazil, we measured the effect of the 2015-16 severe ENSO, which caused an unprecedented drought in cocoa agroforests. We show that drought caused high cocoa tree mortality (15%) and severely decreased cocoa yield (89%); the drought also increased infection rate of the chronic fungal disease witches' broom (Moniliophthora perniciosa). Ours findings showed that Brazilian cocoa agroforests are at risk and that increasing frequency of strong droughts are likely to cause decreased cocoa yields in the coming decades. Furthermore, because cocoa, like many crops, is grown somewhat beyond its climatic limits, it and other crops could be the 'canaries in the coalmine' warning of forthcoming major drought effects on semi-natural and natural vegetation.

TI  - Vulnerability of bird species in highly fragmented forests of southern Brazil: implications for conservation
T2  - ORNITHOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - The seasonal semideciduous forest (SSF) is the most threatened vegetation type of Parana state. Protecting large extensions of pristine forest is essential to prevent biodiversity loss, but evaluating the potential of anthropogenic areas in maintaining biodiversity is important in highly fragmented landscapes. Here, we studied the avifauna of Parana SSF in several habitats (RE, pristine forest considered as reference sites; LF, large forest fragments; MF, middle-sized forest fragments; SF, small forest fragments; UF, urban forest fragments; AF, agricultural fields; RA, reforestation areas) aiming to investigate which are the most vulnerable species in this vegetation type. In order to do so, we categorized each species according to habitat specialization, level of threat, and level of sensitivity to forest fragmentation. We also measured the similarity in bird species composition among six habitat categories with different types of anthropogenic disturbance (LF, MF, SF, UF, AF, and RA). We recorded 368 terrestrial bird species, of which 41 were considered to be vulnerable due to being forest specialist birds that were also sensitive and/or threatened. Sensitive and/or threatened species were rarely found in UF, AF, and RA (1-3 species). Therefore, large forests such as RE are of vital importance to bird species conservation. The similarity in bird species composition among LF, MF, and SF indicates that general ecological functions of birds could be similar in these habitats, suggesting that the conservation of forest fragments is important for the maintenance of bird community functionality in the present Parana SSF.

TI  - Forest cover change and its carbon dynamic of the karst area in Bulusaraung, South Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Information on land forest cover changes and carbon stocks in karst areas is vital for management planning. Therefore, an analysis of the dynamics of land forest cover, carbon stocks of secondary karst forests, and their future projections is necessary. This study aimed to analyze the carbon stocks of secondary forests, forest cover change, and their projections in karst areas. We used 43 sample plots of 20 m x 20 m to measure Above Ground Biomass (AGB) and soil organic carbon stocks. Forest cover data were collected using remote sensing and GIS tools. Data analysis of the ABG of the secondary forest for the karst plain and karst tower was conducted using the Chave equation. Land-cover change was analyzed by delineating the 2011, 2016, and 2021 land-cover data from satellite imagery and testing the accuracy using survey data fields and high-resolution images. Land-cover projections for 2026 and 2031 were obtained using Cellular Automata Markov (CA-Markov) analysis. The results revealed ten land cover types in the karst area of the Bulusaraung Forest Management Unit (FMU). Secondary dryland karst forests (tower and plain karst) were the dominant forest types (60%) in the Maros-Pangkep essential karst ecosystem area. Both karst types of secondary forests are relatively high carbon stores. Data projection shows that the mining area will grow extensively by 2031. Secondary dryland karst forests will be degraded by 15.5% in 20 years due to increased mining activities, conversion to paddy fields, dryland agriculture, and mixed dryland agriculture. Karst ecosystems are vital for carbon and water storage. Therefore, some strategies are required for the sustainable management of Maros-Pangkep Karst are as follows: (i) controlling the opening of mining areas according to sustainable environmental principles, (ii) encouraging the implementation of post-mining land rehabilitation, (iii) increasing public awareness of the importance of preserving karst areas, and (iv) implementing soil conservation rules by prioritizing agroforestry systems in dryland farming.

TI  - Soil Quality Indicators in Peasant Agroecosystems in Paraíba State, Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - Background and Research Aims: Soil quality (SQ) is the basis for the Sustainability of Peasant Farming Systems (PFS). We hypothesized that different land uses modify soil quality through changes that can be analyzed by determining the Soil Quality Index (SQI).Methods: Soil samples were collected from the 0-20 cm layer in five subsystems of peasant agroecosystems located in the municipalities of Solanea (A), Casserengue (B), and Serraria (C). SQI was calculated using non-linear scoring, while a principal component analysis was performed using all data (bulk and particle density, total porosity, particle size, pH, macronutrients, and soil organic carbon) to determine a Minimum Data Set (MDS).Results: The MDS composed of P available, Ca+2, Al+3, sand, silt, H+Al, base saturation (BS%), and the aluminum saturation (AS%) indicate that these parameters can serve as indicators for soil quality assessment in peasant agroecosystems. Sand and silt are related to pedogenic processes and parent material, while the remaining indicators reflect management practices. Land conversion from forest to cropland decreased nutrient availability and soil organic matter in agroecosystems A (Arenosol) and B (Luvisol) and increased the cation exchange capacity in agroecosystem C (Lixisol).Conclusions: All agroecosystems showed low SQI values, highlighting the need to expand conservation practices in the studied agricultural subsystems, especially regarding the increase of soil organic matter. Our results contribute to improving the use and management of soils and the vulnerability assessment in peasant farming, an essential requirement for the sustainability of agroecosystems.Implications for Conservation: Our results also demonstrated that agroforestry practices can significantly increase soil quality and soil carbon sequestration, a viable alternative for maintaining organic matter in areas susceptible to degradation.
