TI  - Nest Characteristics of the Sumatran Orangutan (Pongo abelii) in the Wildlife Sanctuary Soraya Station in Aceh Province, Indonesia
T2  - TROPICAL LIFE SCIENCES RESEARCH
AB  - Orangutans (Pongo spp.) populations used to be widely distributed throughout Southeast Asia, from Java in the south to the Southern China in the north during the Pleistocene. Their populations have declined up to 75% of their original size and are now distributed only in parts of the tropical rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. Pongo pygmaeus, Pongo tapanuliensis and Pongo abelli are the three most representative species, in this study, here we discussed the latter. Sumatran forests are generally suffering from deforestation with rates ranging from 3.74% to 49.85% between 2000 and 2012. Thus, human wildlife conflict intensity has escalated and gained more traction. Orangutans are known as arboreal great apes and need to build nests for resting. We applied the transect line method (three transects; each 1,000 m long) at different elevations in Soraya Research Station, Gelombang Village, Sultan Daulat sub-district, Subulussalam district, and assessed the nest characteristics. The characteristics are: (1) nesting position referring to the position of nest on a tree; (2) nest successional stages defining the age and leaf decay used in constructing a nest indicated with I (new) until V (almost gone); and (3) nest density to predict the density of nest per square km. Afterwards, the identified nesting trees along the transect were further identified based on their species, and assessed based on three characteristics (the tree height, diameter and the height of a nest measured from the soil). A total of 27 nests were found, and 44% were located in transect III or at the riparian. Out of 27, four orangutans' nests were found on Moraceae (Streblus elongatus) and Myrtaceae (Syzigium spp.), while three nests were found on Dipterocarpus sp. The tree height, tree diameter and nest height were 10 m-25 m (mean = 17.5 m; SD = +/- 0.25), 10 cm-30 cm (mean = 20 cm; SD = +/- 0.4) and 16 m-20 m (mean = 18 m; SD = +/- 0.35), respectively. Meanwhile, nest density calculated based on the form: d = [NI (L* 2w)], and the values obtained were 8.4, 13.45, 26.9 nests/km(2) located on transect I, II and III or at the riparian. The most commonly found nest successional stages and position were stage III and position 3, respectively. This study could serve as a baseline research in primate conservation and nest characterisation could be used as guidance for any future activity planning (e.g. tree reforestation) in a particular region and the existence of various tree species diversity are indispensable for maintaining orangutan habitats' quality.

TI  - Time since fire as a driver of taxonomic and phylogenetic patterns of grassland plant communities
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Fire plays a key role in grasslands, determining the distribution and evolution of species and boundaries with neighboring ecosystems. Evidence of community-wide responses to fire is largely based on taxonomic and functional descriptors, while the phylogenetic dimension is overlooked. Here we evaluated how the taxonomic and phylogenetic structure of grassland plant communities responded to a time since fire (TSF) gradient. We sampled 12 communities in Southern Brazil under varying TSF and calculated taxonomic species richness (S) and dominance (D), phylogenetic diversity (PD), and mean phylogenetic distances (MPD). We used Structural Equation Models to test the relationships between the environmental gradient and community descriptors. Communities with longer TSF presented higher PD and MPD but lower species richness and increased taxonomic dominance. These sites were dominated by monocots, specifically C4 grasses, but also presented exclusive clades, whereas recently-burned sites presented lower taxonomic dominance and more species distributed in a wider variety of clades. Our results indicate that these scenarios are interchangeable and dependent on fire management. Fire adaptation was not constrained by phylogenetic relatedness, contrasting with previous findings for tropical savannahs and indicating that temperate and tropical non-forest ecosystems from South America respond differently to fire, possibly due to different evolutionary histories.

TI  - Current trends in forestry research of Latin-America: an editorial overview of the Special Issue
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
AB  - Mendoza city (Argentina) hosted the VIII Latin American Forestry Congress (CONFLAT) and the V Forestry Congress of Argentina (CFA) in 2023, where relevant issues were addressed, such as climate change, degradation, reforestation, management and forest industry, monitoring, environmental services, social issues, and governance, among others. The objective of this Special Issue was to present the main advances in Forestry Science for Latin-America in the context of changing governance and forest livelihoods for people. The fifteen articles emphasize the interdisciplinary nature of the forest management and conservation, and that multiple variables must be considered to achieve sustainability. The articles come from studies across Southern South-America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay), and the collaboration of researchers of other countries (M & eacute;xico, Canada, and Spain). Articles include research in tropical, Mediterranean and temperate Sub-Antarctic forests. Together, these articles provide a snapshot of new forestry research carried out locally and internationally to bring about beneficial ecological and environmental outcomes in a world facing the challenges of sustainable management and conservation amongst the threats and uncertainty of climate change and environmental degradation responsible for extensive loss of biodiversity and environmental services. We believe that this Special Issue will encourage more inter-disciplinary research focusing on management and conservation of forests.

TI  - Diversity Loss of Epigeic Collembola after Grassland Conversion into Eucalyptus Forestry in Brazilian Pampa Domain
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
AB  - The Brazilian Pampa is a rich domain mainly represented by grasslands. Conversion of native vegetation into Eucalyptus plantation leads to soil degradation and losses on local fauna and flora. The objectives of this study were to compare the taxonomic structure and abundance of epigeic springtails (Collembola) in two different types of land-use in the Brazilian Pampa, native grassland and Eucalyptus plantation, as well as to understand the processes that may cause species loss after grassland afforestation. Specimens were sampled in 10 paired plots of grasslands and Eucalyptus in southern Brazil. After sampling, all specimens were sorted, counted and identified. We evaluated the taxonomic composition, alpha and beta diversity, and used Random Forest Analysis to understand the influence of environmental factors on the structure and composition of Collembola communities. We sampled 1249 specimens in 26 morphospecies, and our data support there are significant losses in native Collembola communities after the conversion of grasslands into Eucalyptus plantations regarding abundance, species composition, richness, and alpha diversity. Species turnover better explained the beta diversity, and plant richness and dominance were the main environmental factors driving the Collembola diversity. These results deepen the knowledge of the impacts of native grassland conversion on soil fauna.

TI  - Intensification of land use in Neotropical environments determines loss of taxonomic and functional diversity of spiders
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The structure and complexity of landscapes can significantly impact the composition and functional traits of spiders, given their strong response to environmental changes. Understanding these effects helps to assess the impact of agricultural practices on spider communities. Our study aimed to evaluate the influence of land use and management systems on taxonomic and functional diversity, as well as changes in spider functional traits. Conducted in the eastern and western regions of Santa Catarina State, Brazil, the study focused on land use systems (LUS), including native forest (NF), eucalyptus reforestation (ER), pasture (PA), crop-livestock integration (CLI), and no-tillage (NT). The sampling of the eastern region occurred between July, August and December 2011 and January 2012 and in the western region occurred in April, August 2018. Each collection site represented a sampling station with up to 1 km distance between stations, totaling 888 sampling points. Two collection methods were employed: Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility (TSBF) and pitfall traps. Spider functional diversity was assessed based on eight functional traits. Taxonomic diversity was evaluated through richness, and indices such as FRic, FEve, FDis, FDiv, and CWM were calculated. Generalized linear models (GLMM) were applied to compare the indices. The highest functional and taxonomic richness of spiders was found in native forest (NF). Functional traits, particularly dispersal capacity and stratum preference, showed significant variation across land use systems (LUS), with CLI and PA exhibiting the greatest impacts on functional diversity. The intensity of management practices appears to favor generalist species that are more just more plastic, tolerant and/or dispersive to environmental changes, which could lead to functional biotic homogenization.

TI  - From chocolate to palm oil: The future of Indonesia's cocoa plantations
T2  - AMBIO
AB  - Indonesia is the world's third largest cocoa producer, but production is decreasing since 2011. We revisited cocoa farmers for an environmental assessment in Luwu Timur, Sulawesi, 7 months after a socio-economic survey on cocoa certification outcomes and observed many cocoa plantations being converted into oil palm and maize. Including our field data as well as secondary data on commodity prices and yields, we outline reasons for cocoa conversion, potential consequences for biodiversity, and assess the future outlook for the Indonesian cocoa sector. Low cocoa productivity, volatile cocoa prices and higher revenue for oil palm, among others, drive land-use change. If shade trees are cut during cocoa conversion, it may have negative implications for biodiversity. Solutions to low soil fertility, omnipresent pests and diseases, and stable producer prices are needed to increase profitability of cocoa and prevent conversion of cocoa agroforests to oil palm monocultures.

TI  - Ants as bioindicators of soil quality in integrated crop-livestock system
T2  - CIENCIA RURAL
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the ant community in different systems involving the crop rotations between livestock, under no-tillage, compared to other management systems and natural systems of the Mid-Western region. The study was carried out in the Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil, on a Typic Hapludox soil, in parcels including crop-livestock rotation production system under no-tillage, rotated every two years, no-tillage crop system, succession of crops under conventional tillage, continuous pasture and two fragments of native vegetation, Cerrado and Semideciduous Forest. The samples of soil were conducted during the rainy season (2009/2010), and litter sampling performed with the use of mini-Winkler extractors, following the protocol ALL (Ants of the Leaf Litter). The results indicated that the morphospecies of Strumygenys sp. and Hypoponera sp. as potential bioindicators of soil quality, depending on their frequency changes in response to different systems observed. The study have demonstrated the importance of maintaining forest fragments as stock of local biodiversity and showed that integrated systems, such as crop-livestock, are less impact ful to the meso-fauna and contribute to the conservation of ant and maintenance of soil quality.

TI  - Rio Doce State Park buffer zone: forest fragmentation and land use dynamics
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The investigation of land use changes by anthropic processes, spatially and temporally, is a fundamental tool to establish correlations between landscape patterns and processes and management of the buffer zone of Conservation Units. This study aimed to analyze the forest fragmentation and land use dynamics in the buffer zone of the Rio Doce State Park (PERD), located in Minas Gerais, Brazil, for the year 2015. Its buffer zone was delimited to a radius of 10 km, covering a total area of 128.893,36 ha. Land use classification was based on Landsat 8 image, orbit 217, point 73 and 74, and two types of ecosystems were identified: natural and anthropic. In the thematic mapping, the pressure of the anthropic use over the natural was notified, as well as the high number of forest fragments, which is a negative impact on the resilience required for the conservation of biodiversity and the local Atlantic forest. The fragments have different shapes and sizes and are distributed throughout the buffer zone of the PERD. There is a need to adopt conservation strategies, such as environmental education, reforestation techniques, recovery of degraded areas and ecological corridors. Even with a worrying current scenario, this finding makes it possible to establish an optimistic point for biodiversity conservation, associated with a tendency to reduce the forces of direct changes on natural systems.

TI  - Dynamic of epigeous macrofauna under organic soil management in the Brazilian semi-arid region
T2  - SEMINA-CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
AB  - Soil macrofauna is responsible for soil fertility through cycling of nutrients, tillage and fragmentation of organic matter, as well as through the association between groups of fauna with conserved and/or degraded pedoenvironments. Nevertheless, under the conditions of the Brazilian semi-arid region, there is little information about this resource. The objective of this study was to evaluate the epigeous macrofauna in successive cropping using previous green manure and subsequent planting of melon (Cucumis melo L.) in Juazeiro county, Bahia, Brazil. Sampling dates were undertaken in November 2007 and February, April and July 2008, using traps containing 4 % formaldehyde for seven days in plots of 64 m(2). Results obtained indicate that there is no difference among the treatments with mixed cover crops, and epigeous macrofauna is influenced by the time of collection. Diversity and uniformity are inversely correlated with total density of epigeous macrofauna. Diversification of plant species favors the increase of diversity and uniformity of epigeous macrofauna. Formicidae, followed by Isopoda, Coleoptera and Oligochaeta are the groups of fauna most numerous in the areas.

TI  - How much land is available for sustainable palm oil?
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Current consumption of palm oil accounts for one third of the growing world demand for vegetable oil. Amidst the burgeoning industry, huge ecological costs have been accrued within just three decades due to the rapid oil palm expansion in many parts of the world. Many oil palm plantations are linked to deforestation, biodiversity losses, land use change emissions, among other ecological problems. Total replacement of palm oil could result in even greater adverse environmental consequences as alternative crops will require more land. To satisfy the growing demands in a sustainable manner, any new plantations must be located in environmentally-benign lands. This study identifies and quantifies the potentially available lands in Malaysia and Indonesia through a novel fuzzy GIS-based land suitability analysis. Three maps were generated: biophysically suitable land, based on optimal conditions for oil palm cultivation, excluding peatlands and existing protected areas; environmentally suitable land, further excluding forest cover; and potentially available land, further excluding existing plantations and other land uses. About 4.5 million hectares of available land for new plantations have been identified that could provide 1.3 million tonnes per year of sustainable palm oil. However, most of these areas are fragmented and scattered throughout the entire archipelago, which could pose economic and socio-political hurdles to developers of sustainable palm oil. With affordable and fairer certification schemes, sustainable oil palm plantations can be achieved by smallholders on these potentially available lands. Yield improvement and biodiversity restoration of existing plantations should be the focus through revitalised sustainable agriculture and strategic forest conservation policies, respectively. The maps provide valuable policy insights into the possibility of future sustainable oil palm plantations and a starting point for on-the-ground assessment and further verification.

TI  - Soil organic carbon fractions in agroforestry system in Brazil: seasonality and short-term dynamic assessment
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
AB  - Adopting land-uses that contribute with a considerable litter input can affect the accumulation, protection, and bioavailability of organic carbon in the edaphic environment, compromising the different compartments of soil organic matter (SOM) and the associated benefits. Moreover, changes in seasons can influence the dynamic of SOM. Notably, the mechanisms involved in SOM stabilization and storage, particularly in agroforestry production areas, are still poorly explored. This study aimed to verify if the contents of soil organic carbon (SOC) and the physical fractions of the SOM are modified as a function of agroforestry systems implemented in the short term, and verify if seasonality can affect the compartmentalization of SOM in agrifood systems. Also, we tested if the carbon management index (CMI) is sensitive to detecting management practices quality across the unmanaged pasture, different agroforestry systems, and a reference area (forest). We measured soil physical properties, SOC content in bulk soil, particular organic carbon (POC), and mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) fractions at three different depths (0.00-0.05, 0.05-0.10, and 0.10-0.20 m) in response to the adoption of agroforestry systems. Our results show that after a short period of implementation of agroforestry systems, significant changes were observed in SOC contents and the physical fractions of SOM in the most superficial layers (0.00-0.05 and 0.05-0.10 m), with emphasis on the particulate fraction of SOM. We verified that the seasonality affected the SOC, POC, and MAOC contents. We also found that the CMI index was more sensitive and efficient in detecting changes arising from seasonality and the management practices involved. According to this index, it was possible to verify that the agroforestry system with the highest density of species for biomass production (AS3) has been accumulating more carbon in the soil. Therefore, this study provides relevant information regarding soil carbon management in agroforestry systems.

TI  - Influence of soil management for soybean production under microbial diversity in amazon soils
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - The tropical Amazon has a unique biodiversity that has been affected by the development of pastures and economically important crops, such as soybeans. In the Amazon soil, the communities of microorganisms are diverse and act in different biogeochemical activities relevant to their adaptation to the environment. The assessment of changes in soil microorganism communities is essential to consider the impact of agribusiness action in one of the wealthiest regions in diversity in the world. Thus, the soil microbial diversity of the Amazon forest, the north region of Brazil, was evaluated regarding the influence of soybean farming with regions with periods of two and 14 years of exploitation, with regions of pasture and forest area, through the metagenomics approach with new generation sequencing technology, in addition, it was considered chemical characteristics such as pH value, organic matter content, macronutrients, micronutrients, and cations. High microbial diversity was identified at all collection sites and, despite this, bacterial, archaeal, and virus communities were very diverse between sites, with higher identification of Enterobacter cloacae and species of Pseudomonas, Pseudoplusia includens, Methanosarcina barkeri in the farmed and pasture, whose microbial diversity is influenced by the presence of cations and the interaction of organic matter with clay. It was evident that there is a change in the communities of native microorganisms for others adapted in the areas that had their vegetal cover eliminated.

TI  - Protected areas within multifunctional landscapes: Squeezing out intermediate land use intensities in the tropics?
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - A protected area (PA) tends to be designated in an area where tracts of primary forest remain, often with poor accessibility due to terrain features and yet with some exposure to threats. Typically, a PA is at the start of a 'forest transition' gradient. The establishment of a PA influences the whole gradient. We analyzed the temporal patterns of land-use change inside and outside four PAs, with one located in each of Laos, Indonesia, Madagascar and Cameroon. In Laos, in the Viengkham landscape, the rates of conversion of natural forest increased after the designation of the PA and were higher than the spatial baseline predicted. In the three other landscapes, the policies associated with the implementation of PAs increased the conversion rate immediately outside the boundary of the PAs. In Indonesia, in the Bungo landscape, forms of land-use associated with multifunctional agroforestry activities involving rubber trees land-use became the target for conversion to oil palm and monoculture rubber tree crops when the rules on the protection of the remaining natural forest were tightened. We tested a new metric for the degree of integration of forest in multifunctional landscapes which recognizes the surrounding matrix, both as surrogate habitat and as a corridor for tree species. Two important findings were: (i) a 'leakage' zone of influence of at least 10 km around a PA needs to be included for quantification of the deforestation and degradation changes that may be due to forest protection inside the PA and (ii) agroforest and other mixed tree cover can maintain or increase the degree of integration of forest in the multifunctional landscape for biodiversity maintenance and conservation, while providing a source of livelihood for the local people.

TI  - The Public Policy of Support to the Family Farming in Biodiversity Conservation in Brazil
T2  - DESENVOLVIMENTO E MEIO AMBIENTE
AB  - Initially, this work deals with the concept of multifunctionality of agriculture and discusses the international debate around this issue, which sets two groups of countries in opposite sides. Then, this work lists the roles played by the family farming in Brazil, defending the view point that Brazil does meet the agriculture environmental role, by allocating subsidized funds to family farmers in two Lines of credit from the National Program for the Strengthening of Family Farming - Pronaf, dedicated, mainly, to agroecology and agroforestry. These lines of credit focus on the sustainable use of agroecossystems and forestry resources. Through the years of the existing Program its credit policies have shown low performance maybe in spite of the Draconian policies of evaluation/analysis made by the financial analyzers to approve the projects based on the arguments of lack for models of agroforestry systems production and also lack for ecological crops systems that show acknowledge technical and financial rates. On the other hand, the projects supported by the Agroforestry and Agroecology Pronaf have shown to be a valuable tool for biodiversity conservation in Brazil, once they incorporate ecological principles based on the species conservation and restoration of ecosystem functions of natural resources.

TI  - Unraveling the water and land nexus through inter- and transdisciplinary research: sustainable land management in a semi-arid watershed in Brazil's Northeast
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB  - For decades, large reservoirs have been built for hydropower plants in Brazil's Sao Francisco River Basin. Rural development has been a simultaneous goal with a primary focus on irrigation. Irrigated agriculture, however, has suffered from poor soils, insufficient water management strategies, and a disregard for integrating grazing-based smallholdings outside of the irrigation schemes. Recurrent droughts are distressing all sectors. This synthesis assessed sustainable land management options by investigating the aquatic and terrestrial land use systems alongside their underlying ecosystem functions and services. Decisions about the allocation of scarce water proved to be both the major issue of land use discourses and driver of practices. The primarily hydroelectricity-focused water management practice cannot be maintained at the same level in the long run, as it has become ever more adverse towards competing water usages. The increasing use of the water and adjacent land also constitutes a major potential threat to water quality. Managed water level fluctuations should generally mimic natural patterns. Wind and solar power generation are suitable complements to agricultural land use. Cycling scarce nutrients between aquatic and terrestrial sectors is ambitious but promising, ultimately improving the generally poor soils in the area. Smart management of biodiversity can foster intensively-irrigated cropping, although the non-irrigated Caatinga ecosystem needs better management of its conflicting uses. Aims and responsibilities of multi-level planning and management require clarification and coordination between sectors, while practices of public participation should be revised in order to better support a comprehensive and transparent transition towards sustainability.

TI  - No effect of Rainforest Alliance cocoa certification on shade cover and bird species richness in Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
AB  - Voluntary Sustainability Standards (VSS) and certification are promoted to enhance sustainable agricultural practices, but environmental outcomes of cocoa certification remain understudied. We selected 31 Rainforest Alliance (RA) certified and 31 non-certified cocoa plantations in Luwu Timur, Sulawesi, Indonesia, from a previous socioeconomic survey and assessed vegetation structure, soil fertility, as well as bird species richness. Using Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests, GLMMs and NMDS, we did not find certified plantations to have a higher shade tree diversity, shade tree basal area, and soil fertility. Bird species richness was significantly higher in certified plantations (p = 0.03), but the observed effect on bird species richness became statistically insignificant after controlling for elevation and plantation age in the GLMM. Current RA shade criteria are low, and potentially not sufficiently enforced, limiting RA potential to enhance biodiversity habitat. Certified farmers more frequently used improved farming techniques and received training; hence, certification might provide socioeconomic benefits to farmers while we found environmental outcomes of certification to be limited. Further research is needed to draw robust conclusions on VSS potential to enhance sustainable agriculture.

TI  - The livelihood impacts of oil palm: smallholders in Indonesia
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - The biodiversity and climate consequences of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) expansion across South East Asia have received considerable attention. The human side of the issue, highlighted with reports of negative livelihood outcomes and rights abuses by oil palm companies, has also led to controversy. Oil palm related conflicts have been widely documented in Indonesia yet uptake by farmers has also been extensive. An assessment of the livelihood impacts of oil palm development, including sources of conflict, is needed to shed light on the apparent contradiction between these reports and the evident enthusiasm of farmers to join the oil palm craze thereby informing future expansion. We assessed the impact of oil palm development on the economic wellbeing of rural farmers in Indonesia. We found that many smallholders have benefited substantially from the higher returns to land and labour afforded by oil palm but district authorities and smallholder cooperatives play key roles in the realisation of benefits. Conflicts between communities and companies have resulted almost entirely from lack of transparency, the absence of free, prior, and informed consent and unequal benefit sharing, and have been exacerbated by the absence of clear land rights. We make specific recommendations to improve the present situation and foster the establishment of smallholder friendly production regimes. Oil palm expansion in Indonesia is set to continue. If environmental standards can be raised and policy interventions targeted at the broader social impacts of land development this expansion may be achieved to the significant benefit of large numbers of rural smallholders.

TI  - Assessing Knowledge Production for Agrosilvopastoral Systems in South America
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
AB  - In recent decades agroforestry has undergone significant development in Latin America. South America generates the most scientific research on the topic in the region. We conducted a comprehensive review and analysis of knowledge production for South American agroforestry that includes livestock grazing, known as agrosilvopastoralism (AS), examining how different sociopolitical factors such as sources of funding, institutional priorities, and international cooperation can bias the direction and objectives of scientific research. We assessed the major attributes of scientific publications on the topic (25 articles per country: overall n = 210) and the potential factors underlying the processes of research and development in the region. The tree component was the most studied, while the livestock component received less attention. Studies were mainly focused on the production of goods and services (monetary or nonmonetary approaches), except in Brazil, where conservation was the major study objective. Stakeholders were involved in more than half of the studies (60%), and they were mostly ranchers and local producers. More than half (70%) of the studies offered recommendations based on their results, and such recommendations were mostly concerned with the management of agrosilvopastoral system components. In general, studies were led just as often by local as foreign first authors and coauthored by more than three people as part of interinstitutional working groups. Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Chile had more frequent cooperation among institutions and countries but mainly used their own funding. In contrast, Bolivia. Ecuador, and Peru had almost 100% of their studies supported by foreign countries (North America and Europe). Countries with greater internal funding of research generated more long-term studies. Besides this, two clear trends were detected: 1) conservation and social aspects were mainly supported by sources from external countries led by foreign principal investigators, and 2) production issues were supported from sources within countries and supported high levels of cooperation among institutions.

TI  - Quantifying above- and belowground biomass carbon loss with forest conversion in tropical lowlands of Sumatra (Indonesia)
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Natural forests in South-East Asia have been extensively converted into other land-use systems in the past decades and still show high deforestation rates. Historically, lowland forests have been converted into rubber forests, but more recently, the dominant conversion is into oil palm plantations. While it is expected that the large-scale conversion has strong effects on the carbon cycle, detailed studies quantifying carbon pools and total net primary production (NPPtotal) in above- and belowground tree biomass in land-use systems replacing rainforest (incl. oil palm plantations) are rare so far. We measured above- and belowground carbon pools in tree biomass together with NPPtotal in natural old-growth forests, jungle rubber' agroforests under natural tree cover, and rubber and oil palm monocultures in Sumatra. In total, 32 stands (eight plot replicates per land-use system) were studied in two different regions. Total tree biomass in the natural forest (mean: 384Mgha(-1)) was more than two times higher than in jungle rubber stands (147Mgha(-1)) and >four times higher than in monoculture rubber and oil palm plantations (78 and 50Mgha(-1)). NPPtotal was higher in the natural forest (24Mgha(-1)yr(-1)) than in the rubber systems (20 and 15Mgha(-1)yr(-1)), but was highest in the oil palm system (33Mgha(-1)yr(-1)) due to very high fruit production (15-20Mgha(-1)yr(-1)). NPPtotal was dominated in all systems by aboveground production, but belowground productivity was significantly higher in the natural forest and jungle rubber than in plantations. We conclude that conversion of natural lowland forest into different agricultural systems leads to a strong reduction not only in the biomass carbon pool (up to 166MgCha(-1)) but also in carbon sequestration as carbon residence time (i.e. biomass-C:NPP-C) was 3-10 times higher in the natural forest than in rubber and oil palm plantations.

TI  - Processes related to habitat selection, diversity and niche similarity in assemblages of non-volant small mammals at grassland-forest ecotones
T2  - NATUREZA & CONSERVACAO
AB  - Habitat suitability for mammal species in grassland/forest ecotones may be affected by changes in abiotic conditions (e.g. light incidence), grazing and burning disturbances, and woody encroachment. We evaluate models addressing the role of such factors on structuring non-volant small mammal assemblages considering (1) only disturbed and (2) all ecotones (disturbed and undisturbed). A complete model (i.e., abiotic gradients, disturbances and woody encroachment) was the most plausible for abundance considering all ecotones, and for niche similarity considering both all and only disturbed.ecotones. Niche similarity increased with distance from hydric resources, and abundance with increasing vegetation height. Further, disturbed habitats harbored simplified species assemblages. Habitat selection was detected in all ecotones due to the occurrence of habitat-specialist species on undisturbed sites. We did not find an exclusive influence of woody encroachment on mammal diversity. Patterns described here are relevant for management of productive lands and for biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Potential of integrated trees-pasture-based systems for GHG emission mitigation and improving soil carbon dynamics in the Atlantic forest biome, Southeastern of Brazil
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
AB  - Brazilian cattle production is mainly carried out in pastures, and mitigating the livestock's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has become an essential prerequisite. The importance of planted forests in beef cattle pasture-based integrated systems has been widely recognized in the context of GHG emission mitigation. Adopting the intensification and integration with forest and crops of pasture-based livestock production systems are alternatives to optimizing the soil and tree carbon (C) sequestration; however, research on tropical conditions is still necessary. This long-term trial evaluated the potential of C sequestration (soil + trees) of the forest and the grazing systems with two replicate areas of 3 ha each: 1. continuous stocking rate (CLS) - pasture under continuous stocking; 2. agropastoral or crop-livestock system (AGROP) - pasture under rotational stocking in rotation with corn; 3. agrosilvipastoral or crop-livestock-forestry system (AGROSIL) - similar to AGROP but including eucalyptus; 4. silvipastoral or livestock-forestry system (SIL) - pasture under rotational stocking + eucalyptus and 5. Atlantic Forest (FOR). Soil samples were analysed for texture, C and bulk density in eight soil layers from three to eight trenches for each treatment, then C stock and C accumulation rates were calculated. Data from Eucalyptus urograndis of the SIL and AGROSIL systems with 333 trees. ha- 1 during five first years and 166 trees. ha- 1 in subsequent years were collected (five- and eight-years old trees) and used to define the wood volume and acquire wood rings. Elemental analyzer CHN performed soil and trees C content. Equations for determining stem volume and tree biomass and, afterward, the C pools of the tree trunks were proposed. The potential of GHG emission mitigation (t CO2 e.. ha- 1. year- 1) by annual C sequestration (soil or soil + trees) was calculated, including the wood used for the lumber-mill scenario. The participation of the C stock from the 0-30 cm soil layer was between 45 % and 53 % of the total C stock in the 0-100 cm soil layer. Regardless of the elevated C soil accumulation rates, 0.88, 2.54, and 1.74 t C. ha-1. year- 1 in the conversion stages CLS -> AGROP; AGROP -> SIL; AGROP -> AGROSIL, respectively, it was not possible to compensate for the negative result of the Forest -> CLS conversion (-2.55 t C. ha-1. year- 1) because this stage lasted 12 years, while the implementation of AGROSIL and SIL systems had only six years. However, when C tree accumulation rates were considered, the potential of GHG emission mitigation (t CO2 e. ha- 1. year- 1) by annual C sequestration (soil +trees) was 19.89 to AGROSIL and 18.97 to SIL, including the wood used for the lumber-mill scenario. Based on these results, it can be concluded that C sequestration in trees-pasture integrated systems occurs in layers deeper, with the diverse species contributing in different soil layers; there is a positive effect of improved land-use management, with the use of integrated systems on annual C soil sequestration and the trees consists of an important strategy to improve the GHG mitigation.

TI  - Landscape heterogeneity shapes bird phylogenetic responses at forest-matrix interfaces in Atlantic Forest, Brazil
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Agricultural intensification is one of the major factors driving biodiversity loss. However, most studies in human-dominated landscapes have used taxonomic diversity in their analysis, ignoring evolutionary relationships. Consequently, the relationship between landscape structure and phylogenetic diversity is not well understood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that landscape heterogeneity is positively related to bird phylogenetic indexes of diversity and structure, leading to over-dispersed phylogenies in very heterogeneous landscapes. We analyzed phylogenetic responses in interfaces between forest edges and anthropogenic matrices (forest-pasture and forest-eucalyptus) using generalized linear mixed models. We also compared these indexes between land covers to assess which one best preserves the phylogenetic history of communities. We used both traditional phylogenetic indexes and those corrected for species richness. Our results showed that phylogenetic diversity varied significantly between land cover types, but this did not occur when we removed effects associated with species richness, suggesting that all land covers preserve similar levels of evolutionary history. Additionally, our best models showed a positive relationship between landscape heterogeneity and bird phylogenetic indexes of diversity and structure, but the strength of these relationships may be land cover dependent. In summary, our work highlights the influence of landscape heterogeneity on the phylogenetic diversity and structure of bird communities, reinforcing the need for its incorporation into conservation-based studies.

TI  - Nocturnal Bees as Crop Pollinators
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Bees are typically diurnal but around 1% of described species have nocturnal activity. Nocturnal bees are still poorly studied due to bias towards studying diurnal insects. However, knowledge concerning their biology and role as crop pollinators has increased. We review the literature on nocturnal bees' traits and their host plants, and assess the crop pollination effectiveness of this neglected group. Nocturnal bees have visual adaptations to cope with low light intensities, and floral scents are a key sensory cue used to find their host flowers. Nocturnal bees generally show high flower constancy, the ability to vibrate flowers, and high transfer rates of pollen grains to stigmas. The flowers visited by nocturnal bees range from small radial and zygomorphic flowers to large brush blossoms; moreover, they visit plants with different flowering strategies. Nocturnal bees are effective pollinators of regional fruit crops in Brazil, such as cambuci (Campomanesia phaea), guarana (Paullinia cupana), caja (Spondias mombin), and in North America of cultivated pumpkins (Cucurbita species). However, they most likely are pollinators of several other crops. Strategies to host high numbers of nocturnal bees around cropping areas should be taken, such as preserving adjacent native forests, restricting soil management, providing food resources beyond crop flowers, and avoiding light pollution.

TI  - Linking Carbon, Biodiversity and Livelihoods Near Forest Margins: The Role of Agroforestry
T2  - CARBON SEQUESTRATION POTENTIAL OF AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS: OPPOORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES
AB  - Agroforestry systems distinguish themselves from other forms of agriculture through their ability to store higher amounts of carbon (C) in their biomass, and often also to conserve more biodiversity. However, in both regards they are generally inferior to forests. Therefore, the impact of agroforestry practices on landscape C stocks and biodiversity needs to be analyzed both in terms of the interactions between agroforestry and forest, which may be positive or negative, and in terms of the conservation of C and biodiversity in the farming systems themselves. This paper argues that in forest frontier situations, the most important characteristic of land use systems in terms of C and biodiversity conservation is to be "land-sparing" (i.e. minimizing forest conversion), which requires a certain level of intensification. In land use mosaics, on the other hand, where natural habitat has already been reduced to small fragments, land use practices should also be biodiversity-friendly and have high levels of C storage to complement those in natural vegetation. Agroforestry has a role to play in both situations by making land use more sustainable and by making inhabited reserves ecologically and economically more viable. The paper presents three case studies where different sets of incentives are used to provide communities with the means to conserve C and biodiversity on their land and adjacent forest. In the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, Mexico, C trading is combined with shade coffee (Coffea sp.) production to conserve and increase tree cover on farm land in biosphere reserves. In North Sumatra, Indonesia, coffee-growing communities receive technical and marketing support and assistance with legalizing their land tenure situation as incentives to stop forest conversion for coffee, with a prospect of adding C trading later. In the central Brazilian Amazon, communities reforest their land in an extractive reserve and offer reforestation credits on a local market while laying the basis for a more tree-based reserve economy. In all three cases, the bundling of various forms of incentives is meant to increase the resilience of the respective approach to market and policy changes. Approaches like these would benefit from a better integration of agricultural and forest policies.

TI  - Floral abundance and corolla length predict the importance of species in connecting urban green areas
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
AB  - Despite the growing urbanization rate and its consequences on biodiversity and species interactions worldwide, the connection among urban green areas, performed by interacting species, is still poorly understood. We evaluated how plant and hummingbird species vary across the urban landscape of a tropical city in Brazil, identifying traits of species taking part in shared interactions between areas. We recorded plant-hummingbird interactions in five green spaces and two remnants of native vegetation, and: (1) contrasted species traits and species-level indices of both plants and hummingbirds; (2) evaluated how species and interactions vary among pairs of areas; (3) used a meta -network approach to identify which pairs of interacting species are more important in connecting areas. Species turnover was the component that better explained the beta-diversity of interactions among sites. In green spaces, plant species presented greater centrality and longer corollas than in remnants. However, both plants and hummingbirds were similarly specialized regardless of the type of area. Trees with large floral displays and with longer corollas shared more interactions and were present in more networks. Most interactions recorded in remnants are unique to them, due to the exclusiveness of some hummingbirds and plant species in such native habitat and are, thus, more sensitive to habitat conversion. Our findings support the importance of preserving remnants and using mass flowering native species in urban afforestation to maintain plant-hummingbird interactions and promote urban biodiversity. We evidenced that few interactions (16.6%) were redundant across areas, indicating a highly susceptible and fragmented system in the urban space.

TI  - Quick qualitative and quantitative changes in reproductive efforts in an open cerrado community: An explorative study of fire-stimulated species
T2  - FLORA
AB  - Cerrado is a tropical savanna hotspot that is impacted by frequent wildfires, but where many effects of fire still are poorly understood. This is especially true for the herbaceous strata at the community level, in which reproductive efforts are deeply affected by fire. The objectives of this study were the following: evaluate if fire qualitatively and/or quantitatively affects the production of sexual reproductive structures in an open cerrado community; describe fire-stimulated or fire-inhibited flowering and fruiting species; and evaluate the influence of water availability on flowering and fruiting. The number of species with flowers and fruits/m(2) and the number of reproductive units/m(2) were sampled in eight 20x20 m(2) plots in Chapada Diamantina, Brazil. After the first sampling in the beginning of the rainy season (November 2009), the vegetation in four plots was burned and then the eight plots were resampled over five months. Indexes of fire-stimulated and fire-inhibited flowering and fruiting species were calculated. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and cross-correlation analyses were calculated and differences between the burnt and unburnt plots were compared with an analysis of variance. Sexual reproduction was deeply affected by fire, which changed the composition of reproducing species. Profuse reproduction of graminoids (Poaceae) and geophytic herbs classified as fire-stimulated flowering and/or firestimulated fruiting species concomitantly occurred with a high increase of water in the burnt soil compared to the unburnt soil in the first two months after the fires. The sexual reproduction of shrubby species was inhibited by fire. In an objective way, 21 species stimulated or inhibited by fire were recorded. Fire also changed the influence of rainfall on reproductive efforts. This study shows quick qualitative and quantitative effects of fire on open cerrado functioning and highlights the necessity of fire management for biodiversity conservation in savannas.

TI  - Earthworm species in various land use systems in the Campos Gerais region of Lapa, Parana, Brazil
T2  - ZOOTAXA
AB  - The Campos Gerais region of Parana are on an ancient plateau of sandstone origin and are covered with a diverse vegetation including mainly grasslands and various types of Atlantic Forest (particularly Araucaria forest). The region represents an important natural capital for biodiversity conservation as well as for agricultural and forestry production. However, little is known of the species richness and diversity of soil macroinvertebrates in this region. In the present study we evaluated earthworm species occurrence and richness in five land use systems (LUS) in the southern part of the Campos Gerais in Lapa county. Earthworms were handsorted from up to 18 soil monoliths on five occasions over three years (Feb. 2014, Feb., Mar., Nov. 2015, Jul. 2016) in the following LUS: old native forest, native grassland, young regenerating forest and grass lawn in the Uru Reserve and annual crop fields (soybean) in neighboring private farms (not all systems were sampled on all occasions). Nine earthworm species belonging to four families and five genera were found, of which six were native and three exotic species (Dichogaster gracilis, Amynthas gracilis, A. corticis). Of the native species, Urobenus brasiliensis and Andiorrhinus duseni (a large bodied-worm) are already well known from S and SE Brazil, while the remaining four were new species that require further description (Fimoscolex n. sp. 1 and n. sp. 2, Glossoscolex n. sp. 1 and n. sp. 2). In general, more species were found in February (summer) than March and November. The cropping system (soybean) had the lowest abundance and species richness in relation to other sites, although in the young and old forests no earthworms were found on some sample dates. Given the several new species found in this small reserve, and the relatively few sites studied thus far in the Campos Gerais, further efforts are needed to adequately characterize the earthworm fauna of the region, from which many other species are expected.

TI  - Patterns of fine root mass and distribution along a disturbance gradient in a tropical montane forest, Central Sulawesi (Indonesia)
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Large parts of the remaining tropical moist forests of South-east Asia are encroached at their margins by selective logging, rattan harvesting and the establishment of small agroforest plantations under the rainforest canopy. These slight to heavy disturbances affect aboveground forest structure by reducing wood biomass and canopy cover; however, they may also have a profound impact on the belowground compartment. In a lower montane moist forest of Central Sulawesi, we studied the profile totals of fine root biomass (FRBtot, roots < 2 mm until 50 cm of soil depth) and of fine root necromass (FRNtot), the vertical distribution of fine root mass, and the fine root live/dead ratio by root coring in 12 forest stands that represented a gradient in forest use (or disturbance) intensity (forest use type A: undisturbed natural forest, B and C: slightly or moderately disturbed forests with selective timber extraction, D: heavily disturbed cacao agroforest systems under a remaining rainforest cover; each forest types being replicated three times). FRBtot decreased significantly from forest A to the disturbed B, C and D forests, and reached less than 60% of the FRBtot value of A in the agroforest systems D. A similar decrease with increasing disturbance intensity was found for FRNtot. Forest disturbance intensity had no significant influence on the vertical distribution of fine root biomass in the profiles. According to correlation and principal components analyses, fractional canopy cover was the most important factor influencing FRBtot and FRNtot, whereas diameter at breast height, stand basal area, stem density, soil pH and base saturation had only a minor or no influence on root mass. A reduction in canopy cover from 90% (forest type A) to 75% (types C and D) was associated with a reduction in FRBtot by about 45% which indicates that timber extraction leads not only to canopy gaps but to corresponding 'root gaps' in the soil as well. We conclude that forest encroachment that is widespread in large parts of South-east Asia's remaining rainforests significantly reduces tree fine root biomass and associated carbon sequestration, even if it is conducted at moderate intensities only.

TI  - Soil carbon stocks and origin under different cacao agroforestry systems in Southern Bahia, Brazil
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Cacao agroforestry systems (AFS) are characterized by accumulating large amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC). However, information on the influence of shade trees on SOC stock up-to 100 cm depth is scarce in the literature. The objectives of this study were to quantify the SOC storage under different cacao AFS, natural forest and pasture to a depth of 100 cm; and to evaluate the origin of SOC using the C-13 isotopic ratio as an indicator of relative contribution of trees (C-3 plants) and grass (C-4 plants), after 4 years of pasture conversion into cacao and rubber AFS. SOC was determined by dry combustion in six layers (0-10, 10-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80 and 80-100 cm). The natural abundance of C-13 technique was used only on cacao and rubber lines in contrast to the SOC accumulated by pasture before conversion into AFS. The SOC stock in a depth between 0-100 cm was significantly high in the pasture and in both younger cacao and rubber AFS (4 years old). Systems that were more than 20 years old 'cabruca', cacao and Erythrina and cacao and rubber system (20 years) had lower SOC stocks and did not differ significantly from the natural forest. In the surface layers of soil there were significant differences in the SOC stock. However, below 20 cm all the systems were similar to each other. The SOC stock in the first 20 cm accounted between 31 and 44% of total SOC stored in the 100 cm in the seven systems, followed by 19-23% at a depth of 20-40 cm, 15-18% at a depth of 40-60 cm and 11-14% in the last two depths. After four years of establishment cacao and rubber AFS were the most efficient systems in the accumulation of SOC in the first 20 cm of soil and consequently up to 100 cm deep. Cacao was more efficient than rubber tree to accumulate C-3-derived C. While the rubber increased by almost 70% of C-3, cacao increased 131%. After the 40 cm of depth the SOC is still from the original natural forest. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Edaphic fauna in soil profile after three decades of different soil management and cover crops in a subtropical region
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
AB  - This research evaluated the effects of long-term (30 years) winter cover crops under conventional farming system and no-tillage system on edaphic fauna in a Rhodic Hapludox soil, from Parana State, Brazil. We used three winter cover crops (black oat, hairy vetch and fallow), and as a reference a fragment of natural forest. Soil monoliths were collected at two times, one during the flowering of maize (April 2013) and the other during the flowering of soybean (January 2014). The extraction of the monoliths was carried out in three layers in the soil profile (0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm). Seventeen taxonomic groups were sampled. The density of the edaphic fauna is inversely related to soil depth. The winter crops associated with the no-tillage system in long-term resulted in fauna densities similar to the natural environment, with a higher density (density increase of 2.2x) at a depth of 10-20 cm in areas with black oat. At 0-10 cm depth, black oat and vetch under no-tillage systems resulted in an increase of 62% and 69% (April 2013) and 46 and 44% (January 2014), respectively, in the density of soil fauna, when compared to the same winter crops in conventional farming system.

TI  - Beneath the Surface: A Scientometric Review of Edaphic Fauna of Agricultural Landscapes
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
AB  - Soil fauna play a crucial role in agricultural development, directly influencing soil health and crop productivity. This study utilized scientometric analysis to investigate current knowledge about soil fauna across different agricultural agroecosystems. A total of 1,127 documents were identified in the Web of Science Core Collection using the search terms, covering research from 1967 to 2024. The findings showed a steady increase in publications, peaking in 2022. Brazil, France, and China were the most productive countries, with France showing significant influence, marked by a centrality of 0.25. The analysis of knowledge areas and keywords indicated a growing interdisciplinarity in the study of soil fauna, reflecting a rising interest in understanding ecological relationships comprehensively. The main organisms evaluated include meso and macrofauna, earthworms, mites, springtails and nematodes, with variations in management practices focusing on the functions that soil fauna performs within the agroecosystem. Although research has traditionally focused on conventional agricultural systems, attention is shifting toward agroecological and organic systems. Emerging trends include studies on toxicology and food chains, emphasizing topics such as microplastics and interactions with microorganisms. Therefore, this study provides a comprehensive and current overview of soil fauna research in agricultural environments, highlights the increasing importance of soil fauna in the development of sustainable agricultural systems, and anticipates continued interest in this area, particularly in relation to broader ecological relationships, suggesting future research directions.

TI  - Environmental benefits and sustainable land-use options in the Jambi transect, Sumatra
T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
CP  - IGBP Terrestrial Transects Workshop
AB  - Loss of environmental services provided by forests is a non-linear process in Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia. Intermediate-intensity land-use types in the form of complex agroforests have maintained global environmental benefits under a sustainable and profitable land use regime. Conversion to tree crop monocultures, however, poses a challenge to the environmental stakeholders and an opportunity from to stakeholders in the private economy. We quantified environmental indicators, as well as profitability and sustainability of a range of existing and possible production systems. Criteria and indicators were used at plot to landscape scales, taking into account local, national and global perspectives. Agronomic sustainability and profitability were assessed at plot level as they are of primarily local concern, while environmental services of forests, such as plant species and functional type richness, carbon stocks, greenhouse gas emissions, and trans-boundary haze, which are of national and global concern, were assessed at landscape level. Quantitative trade-offs and complementarities were analysed between global environmental benefits and local profitability. The current trend towards simplification of the complex agro-ecosystems and inherent loss of environmental services of forests is driven by profitability. The sequence in which environmental services of forests are lost is: standing carbon stocks, biodiversity, an low or negative greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - How Can the Environmental Efficiency of Indonesian Cocoa Farms Be Increased?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Increasing global cocoa demand in the new millennium has triggered farmers in developing countries to expand cocoa cultivation. A challenge is how to sustainably increase cocoa production without causing deforestation. We examine this trade-off around the Lore Lindu National Park in Indonesia and investigate the determinants of environmental efficiency by applying a distance output function that includes cocoa production and rainforest plant abundance. We analyze 208 cocoa producers' variables from 2015 using both measured and self-reported data. We find that cocoa intensification results in higher ecosystem degradation, and that producers in our sample display a 50% mean efficiency. This low value points to the increased infestation of cocoa pod borer and the failure of the Gemas government program. Increasing efficiency could lead to a win-win-win situation: higher cocoa production from fewer hectares, and with more native rainforest plants co-existing with cocoa on those hectares. On average, efficiency scores suggest that there is scope to expand production by 367 kg of cocoa per farm and year on the existing planted area, to increase rainforest plants per 5*5 m area by 109 while maintaining existing areas and production levels, or to reduce acreage by 0.52 ha per farm without reducing production.

TI  - Conservation value of cacao agroforestry for amphibians and reptiles in South-East Asia: combining correlative models with follow-up field experiments
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - P>Although agricultural expansion is a primary threat to tropical biodiversity, experimental studies evaluating the conservation value of tropical agricultural habitats are scarce. In particular, little is known about the sensitivity of amphibians and reptiles to habitat disturbance in areas of very high diversity such as South-East Asia.
   We used a two-step approach to determine the relationship between habitat complexity and conservation value of cacao agroforestry for herpetological diversity in Sulawesi (Indonesia). Indonesia is the third largest cacao-exporting country globally and forest conversion to cacao plantations is a major threat to its biodiversity. We first sampled 43 cacao plantations six times to determine the environmental variables that best explained herpetofaunal diversity patterns using a Bayesian model selection approach. Based on these results, we experimentally manipulated leaf litter thickness (LLT), number of branch piles (LOGS) and LLT + LOGS combinations in the cacao plots. The experimental data were analysed using Bayesian hierarchical regression.
   The best supported correlative models incorporated LLT, LOGS, air temperature and the ratio between leaf litter and shrub cover, showing the importance of habitat heterogeneity and suggesting climate change sensitivity. The subsequent structural manipulation of these attributes changed amphibian and reptile species richness, and reptile abundance, but only addition of leaf litter did so in a biologically meaningful way, providing microhabitat resources. However, the main beneficiaries were common disturbance-tolerant reptiles.
   Synthesis and applications. The different results from the correlative model and the independent manipulative experiments showed how important such a combined approach is to derive adequate conservation management recommendations. Increasing leaf litter in cacao agroforestry will work best if implemented on a landscape scale to incorporate sufficient environmental variation and species life histories. This will mainly enhance the richness and abundance of disturbance-tolerant species, which still may maintain ecosystem functions such as pest removal. Particularly for rare species, native forests remain critical for herpetological richness. The direct temperature sensitivity suggests that future climate change impacts may be severe for herpetological diversity in plantation habitats and, hence, demand further research.

TI  - Environmental and anthropogenic factors structuring waterbird habitats of tropical coastal lagoons: Implications for management
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Tropical coastal lagoons are among the most threatened ecosystems on Earth due to multiple factors. The loss and degradation of coastal lagoons can adversely affect waterbirds, which depend crucially on wetland habitats. This study investigates the effects of a number of environmental variables on waterbird habitat use. Specifically, we assessed the abundances of six waterbird guilds in relation to hydrochemical, structural, and anthropogenic factors in 351 survey blocks of 22 tropical coastal lagoons of southeastern Brazil. Patterns of habitat use were analyzed using generalized mixed models. We found that water depth was the most important variable influencing the waterbird assemblage. Increasing water depth reduced the abundance of small and large wading birds, dabbling ducks, and diving birds. Extreme values of salinity negatively affected diving birds and large wading birds. Vegetation height influenced shorebirds negatively, while it influenced vegetation gleaners positively. Anthropogenic factors played an important role in structuring the habitat of small wading birds, dabbling ducks, diving birds and fishing birds. Our study indicates that the various guilds showed specific responses to different habitat variables. We conclude that the maintenance of water depths in the range of 0-20 cm, the preservation of a mosaic of vegetation heights, and the reduction of livestock grazing pressure are among the most important aspects for supporting high avian abundance and biodiversity in tropical coastal lagoons. Management strategies should therefore address a specific number of structural and hydrochemical attributes of coastal lagoons and should carefully consider the effects of land use practices.

TI  - Genetic Diversity of Dominant Plant Species in Tropical Land-Use Systems in Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - Biodiversity hotspots like tropical lowland rainforests in Sumatra are threatened by the agricultural expansion, which increases the deforestation rate in Indonesia, which is highest worldwide. Main land-use change drivers in Indonesia include the production of rubber and palm oil, both of which lead to a high forest conversion rate. In the remaining and degraded forest patches, species diversity has declined and species composition has been altered. Effects of habitat fragmentation and land-use change on genetic structure were frequently investigated at the species level and compared across plant species, but not for plant communities. In addition, the effect of land-use change on the genetic structure of plants has not yet been investigated. Using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism marker, the genetic diversity of 112 dominant plant species was assessed in four different land-use systems in Sumatra: old growth tropical lowland rainforest, jungle rubber, rubber plantation, and oil palm plantation. The four systems were investigated in two regions with four replicates, respectively. Because of different species compositions, characterized by different life history traits, forest and jungle rubber plots showed the highest diversity level, while oil palm and rubber plantations showed the lower diversity levels. The two intensively managed plantation systems showed similar genetic diversity levels as the tree dominated systems but are dominated by mainly alien species. This indicates that oil palm and rubber plantations could not be identified as habitats of conservational value. The newly introduced collection and analysis approach presents a universally applicable method to investigate different ecosystems in their plant genetic diversity to support the identification of habitats with high conservational value.

TI  - Human-climate interactions shape fire regimes in the Cerrado of Sa∼o Paulo state, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
AB  - The Cerrado is the most diverse tropical savanna in the world. As a fire-prone ecosystem, natural fire in the Cerrado shapes plant communities and drives evolutionary processes. Human activities and landscape management can alter natural fire regimes and reshape Cerrado dynamics, making biodiversity conservation a challenge, particularly in densely populated areas. We reconstructed the historical fire regime of three protected areas (PA) and their buffer zones in Sa similar to o Paulo state to understand how current fire exclusion policies are affecting fire regimes and to measure how human-climate-fire relationships can change in areas under different land management. We used Landsat satellite imagery, from 1984 to 2017, with 30 m of spatial resolution and 16 days of temporal resolution. In total, we mapped 49,471 ha of burned area, and we detected variations in fire frequency and fire size among sites. PA dominated by open savanna in Itirapina concentrated 93 % of all observed fires, while PA dominated by forest-like formations in Assis represented only 2% of the fires. Annual rainfall showed a very weak relationship (R2 = 0.04) with annual total burned area, while the rainfall split between dry and wet seasons showed a tendency to have a fuel moisture effect which determined the vegetation available to burn in the dry season (R2 = 0.09). Fire regimes in PA were similar to those observed in buffer zones suggesting that fire-exclusion policies do not effectively prevent fires in PA that are surrounded by an anthropic matrix where fire is often used. When we included human factors in addition to rainfall, our models explained 44 % of variation of burned areas. We conclude that fire regimes in Sa similar to o Paulo Cerrado have been modified by humans and that fire exclusion is not a suitable policy for protected areas in this fire-prone ecosystem.

TI  - Lightning fires in a Brazilian Savanna National Park: Rethinking management strategies
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Fire occurrences and their sources were monitored in Emas National Park, Brazil (17 degrees 49'-18 degrees 28'S; 52 degrees 39'-53 degrees 10'W) from June 1995 to May 1999. The extent of burned area and weather conditions were registered. Forty-five fires were recorded and mapped on a GIS during this study. Four fires occurred in the dry winter season (June-August; 7,942 ha burned), all caused by humans; 10 fires occurred in the seasonally transitional months (May and September) (33,386 ha burned); 31 fires occurred in the wet season, of which 30 were caused by lightning inside the park (29,326 ha burned), and one started outside the park (866 ha burned). Wet season lightning fires started in the open vegetation (wet field or grassy savanna) at a flat plateau, an area that showed significantly higher fire incidence. On average, winter fires burned larger areas and spread more quickly, compared to lightning fires, and fire suppression was necessary to extinguish them. Most lightning fires were patchy and extinguished primarily by rain. lightning fires in the wet season, previously considered unimportant episodes, were shown to be very frequent and probably represent the natural fire pattern in the region. Lightning fires should be regarded as ecologically beneficial, as they create natural barriers to the spread of winter fires. The present: lire management in the park is based on the burning of preventive firebreaks in the dry season and exclusion of any other fire. This policy does not take advantage of the beneficial effects of the natural lire regime and may in fact reduce biodiversity. The results presented here stress the need for reevaluating present policies and management procedures concerning fire in cerrado conservation areas.

TI  - Ecology and conservation of grassland birds in southeastern South America: a review
T2  - JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY
AB  - The grasslands of southeastern South America (SESA), comprising one of the most extensive grassland ecosystems in the Neotropics, have been negatively impacted by the development of the livestock industry, arable agriculture, and forestry. SESA grasslands have a rich avifauna that includes 22 globally threatened and near-threatened species, and many other species have suffered local population extinctions and range reductions. In addition to habitat loss and fragmentation, grassland birds in SESA are threatened by improper use of agrochemicals, unfavorable fire management regimes, pollution, and illegal capture and hunting. Studies to date have provided information about the distribution of grassland birds, the threats populations face, and the habitat requirements of some threatened species, but more information is needed concerning dispersal and migration patterns, genetics, and factors that influence habitat use and species survival in both natural and agricultural landscapes. There are few public protected areas in the region (1% of original grasslands), and many populations of threatened grassland birds are found on private lands. Therefore, efforts to preserve grassland habitat must reconcile the interests of land owners and conservationists. Current conservation efforts include establishment of public and private reserves, promotion of agricultural activities that reconcile production with biodiversity conservation, development of multilateral conservation projects across countries, and elaboration of action plans. Measures that result in significant losses to private land owners should include economic compensation, and use of economic incentives to promote agriculture and forestry in native grassland areas should be discouraged, especially in priority areas for grassland birds. Although more studies are needed, some actions, particularly habitat protection and improved management of public and private lands, should be taken immediately to improve the conservation status of grassland birds in SESA.

TI  - Kebon tatangkalan: a disappearing agroforest in the Upper Citarum Watershed, West Java, Indonesia
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - A comprehensive study was carried out on a typical indigenous agroforestry system, called kebon tatangkalan, in the changing agricultural landscape of the Upper Citarum Watershed, West Java, Indonesia. ne main objectives of the study are to elucidate the structural patterns, multidimensional functions, and dynamics of this multi-layered agroforest. The study has identified 12 groups of different plant assemblages indicating that this type of agroforest contributes considerably to the heterogeneity of the agricultural landscape in the study area. Multivariate analysis suggests that elevation and slope are the biophysical factors that correlate most significantly with the distribution of plant species in kebon tatangkalan. The presence of this man-made vegetation is currently declining from the landscape due to population growth and rapid regional economic development. Serious effort to revitalize this traditional agroforest is needed to prevent its disappearance. Introduction of highly productive species and establishment of integrated policies in regional land-use planning and management are measures that should be taken into account in preserving this traditional agroforestry system.

TI  - SPECIES DIVERSITY AND CARBON STORAGE OF UNDERGROWTH AND LITTER IN THE AGROFORESTRY SYSTEM OF NORTH SUMATERA-INDONESIA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - The purpose of this research was to look into the diversity of species and carbon storage in agroforestry systems in the Forest for Special Purpose at Aek Nauli, North Sumatera Province, Indonesia. A total of 60 subplots, 1.0x1.0m were used to represent different undergrowth species in the agroforestry system. By identifying constituent species in the agroforestry system, the diversity of undergrowth species was studied, and the potential for biomass and carbon storage of undergrowth and litter was measured and analyzed. Undergrowth species in agroforestry Toona sureni and Coffee Arabica are significantly richer in plant species (27 species vs. 14 in agroforestry P. Merkusii and C. Arabica). The results showed that the diversity undergrowth was categorized as moderate, and the evenness indices were low, ranging from 0.33 to 44. In the agroforestry system, the mean biomass of undergrowth was 1.65 tons ha(-1), and the carbon storage of undergrowth was 0.43 tons ha(-1). Meanwhile, litter biomass was 5.18 tons ha(-1) on average, with 2.5 tons ha(-1) of litter carbon storage. Both biomass and carbon storage of undergrowth and litter in agroforestry T. Sureni, and C. Arabiba vs. P. Merkusii and C. Arabica are significantly different. By applying sustainable agroforestry management in forests for special purposes, this study helps with future climate change adaptation and mitigation.

TI  - Policy governance of climate change to strengthen national resilience in Indonesia
T2  - 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CLIMATE CHANGE 2019 (4TH ICCC 2019)
CP  - 4th International Conference on Climate Change (ICCC)
AB  - Economic growth has led to tremendous environmental changes including resulted pollution, overexploitation of natural resources (biodiversity), converted land/sea (reclamation) and increasing carbon emissions. How developing countries have ability to manage climate change impacts as committed in international climate agreement such as the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), UNFCCC, COP 21 and so on, is important to be analyzed. As middle income countries, most developing countries (such as Indonesia) have already dealed with other various issues - political, economic, social, etc - in which most government put their priorities and allocate most of their resources to solve those challenges. It is critical to provide policy framework on adaptation and mitigation of climate change impact to strengthen national resilience. As conceptual paper this study aims to analyse the policy governance that integrate the perspective of social and economic issues to address the impacts of climate change on particular case. By exploring global issues of multi level perspectives, this paper provides several propositions for policy makers to strengthen the key strategic policy in national and local contexts of climate change challenges.

TI  - CLUSTERING LOCAL PLANTS IN THE RIPARIAN ZONE OF THE KAMPAR RIVER, INDONESIA: TOWARDS AN AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Agriculture plays a vital role of biodiversity management strategies aimed at developing sustainable agricultural and food systems. Riparian vegetation management strategies are essential for the sustainability of agricultural systems, particularly through the selecting suitable plant species. The objective of this study is to analyze the riparian vegetation of the Kampar River basin and clustering species. The study was conducted in the riparian area of the Kampar River, Indonesia, across eight stations. The methods included phytosociological relev & eacute;s, cluster analysis, and ecophysiological indicator analysis. The study identified 38 dominant plant species in the riparian area of the Kampar River Basin on podsolic soils, grouped into five main clusters. On peatlands, 26 plant species were identified, organized into three clusters based on similarities in chemical and physical properties of soil and mesoclimatic factors. The identification and use of local plants that are well-adapted can be used to develop riparian vegetation management strategies and support sustainable agriculture in the riparian zone of the Kampar River Basin.

TI  - Biodiversity Impacts of Increased Ethanol Production in Brazil
T2  - LAND
AB  - Growing domestic and international ethanol demand is expected to result in increased sugarcane cultivation in Brazil. Sugarcane expansion currently results in land-use changes mainly in the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest biomes, two severely threatened biodiversity hotspots. This study quantifies potential biodiversity impacts of increased ethanol demand in Brazil in a spatially explicit manner. We project changes in potential total, threatened, endemic, and range-restricted mammals' species richness up to 2030. Decreased potential species richness due to increased ethanol demand in 2030 was projected for about 19,000 km(2) in the Cerrado, 17,000 km(2) in the Atlantic Forest, and 7000 km(2) in the Pantanal. In the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest, the biodiversity impacts of sugarcane expansion were mainly due to direct land-use change; in the Pantanal, they were largely due to indirect land-use change. The biodiversity impact of increased ethanol demand was projected to be smaller than the impact of other drivers of land-use change. This study provides a first indication of biodiversity impacts related to increased ethanol production in Brazil, which is useful for policy makers and ethanol producers aiming to mitigate impacts. Future research should assess the impact of potential mitigation options, such as nature protection, agroforestry, or agricultural intensification.

TI  - Diversity, utilization, and sustainable management of wild edible fruit plants in agroforestry systems: a case study in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - This study investigates the diversity, utilization, and sustainable management of wild edible fruit species (WEFs) in agroforestry systems in the Saripoi and Olong Ulu villages of Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. This study aims to analyze the species richness of WEFs, evaluate their contributions to local livelihoods, and identify challenges to sustainable management. Field surveys were conducted in 40 agroforestry home gardens, representing 40 households actively engaged in these systems. Data were gathered through direct observation and interviews with 228 respondents, all of whom manage their agroforestry areas. A total of 61 WEFs from 16 plant families were discovered, with Phyllanthaceae and Moraceae being the most prominent. High-value species such as Durio kutejensis and Artocarpus integer significantly contributed to household income. However, despite these advantages, land tenure insecurity, limited market access, pest management issues, and the erosion of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) pose major threats to the long-term sustainability of agroforestry systems. The decline of TEK is largely attributed to urban migration among younger generations, disrupting the intergenerational transmission of traditional knowledge. Sustainable harvesting strategies, such as selective hand-picking, were found to be effective in preserving productivity, whereas more aggressive methods were linked to lower yields and tree damage. Policy interventions should focus on securing land rights for uncertified land and social forestry areas by accelerating land certification, simplifying permit processes, and strengthening legal recognition of agroforestry to ensure long-term security for smallholder farmers and indigenous communities. In addition, policymakers should prioritize rural infrastructure development, enhance market access, and support the integration of TEK with contemporary agroforestry practices. These strategies are essential for strengthening the ecological and economic sustainability of agroforestry systems while safeguarding rural livelihoods amid socioeconomic transformations.

TI  - Allometric relationships of frequently used shade tree species in cacao agroforestry systems in Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Shade trees play an important role within agroforestry systems by influencing radiation and wind regimes as well as nutrient and hydrological cycling. However, there is a lack of quantitative assessments of their functions. One of the reasons is the rare information on structural characteristics of shade tree species. Therefore, the aim of this study is to provide basic information on the structure of frequently used shade tree species for the implementation of models simulating the ecosystem processes in agroforestry systems. The investigation of the shade trees was conducted at two cacao agroforestry sites on Sulawesi, Indonesia. The measurements of the main structural parameters: diameter at breast height, tree height, trunk height, crown length and crown radius were carried out for the shade tree species Aleurites moluccana, Cocos nucifera and Gliricidia sepium. For data collection, the National Forest Inventory Field Manual Template by FAO (2004) was applied. Based on this information allometric functions were derived for the correspondent shade tree species. The best significant relationships were obtained for the height-crown length relationship of the dicotyledonous tree species' A. moluccana and G. sepium with a coefficient of determination rA(2)A = 0.925 and rA(2)A = 0.738, respectively, and the height-crown length relationship of the monocotyledonous palm C. nucifera with rA(2)A = 0.663. The transferability tests 'analysis of covariance' and 'homogeneity of slopes' have shown that the obtained allometric functions are also applicable to other cacao agroforestry systems of the region.

TI  - Soil biochemistry and microbial activity in vineyards under conventional and organic management at Northeast Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
AB  - The Sao Francisco Submedium Valley is located at the Brazilian semiarid region and is an important center for irrigated fruit growing. This region is responsible for 97% of the national exportation of table grapes, including seedless grapes. Based on the fact that organic fertilization can improve soil quality, we compared the effects of conventional and organic soil management on microbial activity and mycorrhization of seedless grape crops. We measured glomerospores number, most probable number (MPN) of propagules, richness of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) species, AMF root colonization, EE-BRSP production, carbon microbial biomass (C-MB), microbial respiration, fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic activity (FDA) and metabolic coefficient (qCO(2)). The organic management led to an increase in all variables with the exception of EE-BRSP and qCO(2). Mycorrhizal colonization increased from 4.7% in conventional crops to 15.9% in organic crops. Spore number ranged from 4.1 to 12.4 per 50 g(-1) soil in both management systems. The most probable number of AMF propagules increased from 79 cm(-3) soil in the conventional system to 110 cm(-3) soil in the organic system. Microbial carbon, CO2 emission, and FDA activity were increased by 100 to 200% in the organic crop. Thirteen species of AMF were identified, the majority in the organic cultivation system. Acaulospora excavata, Entrophospora infrequens, Glomus sp.3 and Scutellospora sp. were found only in the organically managed crop. S. gregaria was found only in the conventional crop. Organically managed vineyards increased mycorrhization and general soil microbial activity.

TI  - Analysis of threats to South American flora and its implications for conservation
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
AB  - South America houses a significant proportion of the world's plant diversity and therefore merits conservation attention. However, ongoing habitat fragmentation, degradation and destruction of natural habitats threaten biodiversity. A set of seven threats to natural ecosystems derived from a previous study (Jarvis et al. 2010), combined with a dataset of occurrences from 16,339 species, and also with the World Database of Protected Areas were used to analyse the patterns of threats to flora in South America and its conservation. Species richness per similar to 50 km side cell ranged from 1 to 2149 taxa, but with most of the areas presenting between 1 and 58 taxa. Population accessibility, expansion of agriculture and grazing pressure were found to be the key drivers of immediate extinction risk. A considerable (78.4%) number of species presented at least one population under high threat due to the expansion and intensification of these anthropogenic activities. In addition, some 13.8% of the analysed species presented up to 80% of their populations at risk of extinction (high threat index). On the conservation side, 82.3% of the analysed taxa have at least one population occurring within a protected site. However, it is important to note that for a protected area system to be effective and efficient, the conservation of within-taxon genetic diversity is required. The expansion, monitoring and strengthening of 24 existing protected areas holding up to 70% of South American plant diversity is suggested; as is the revision of seven additional sites where up to 200 species not currently conserved are present. Critical areas to monitor, expand and strengthen are mainly located in the Ecuadorian and Colombian Andes, southern Paraguay, the Guyana shield, southern Brazil, and Bolivia. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - Resilience in the functional responses of Axonopus affinis Chase (Poaceae) to diurnal light variation in an overgrazed grassland
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - Overgrazed grasslands of Southern Brazil are responsible in part for the degradation, low productivity and loss of biodiversity of the grassland ecosystems submitted to such management. Axonopus affinis Chase, the carpet grass, is a dominant creeping grass species in overgrazed grasslands. The species readily spreads, is highly tolerant of frequent defoliation and to trampling. In any natural environment, different light intensity regimes vary considerably along the day. Such phenomenon requires a high level of plasticity, resistance, and resilience from plants. Within this context, the aim of this study was to describe the mechanisms of photochemical activity in Axonopus affinis (Poaceae) in response to natural variations in daylight. Here we report hysteresis related functional behavior in overgrazed grasslands. This study was conducted in grassland vegetation within an experimental overgrazed area from the Embrapa Pecuaria Sul, Bage/Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (austral spring 2014). By means of preferential sampling, homogeneous areas with a 90% dominance of Axonopus affinis Chase were selected. In the present study 60 sample units were analyzed (young leaves, non-damaged and fully expanded). Photochemical variables and OJIP curves were sampled in two distinct conditions along one day, under light intensities labeled as: 1 - high photosynthetic photon flux density (HI), when under full sunlight; and 2 low photosynthetic photon flux density (LI), when under cloudy days. It was possible to quantify and identify the alternative stable states of A. affinis in response to light resource availability, expanding the interpretation of the multivariate analysis (triangular trajectory) and therefore, contributing to univariate metrics (bimodal trajectory). In this study, HI produced hysteretic behavior while LI of dynamic photoinhibition in A. affinis. The Delta F/F-m' variable was the most important mechanism to explain the plasticity of A. affinis in HI and LI (R-2 > 0.98 in function of the PCoA coordinates). However, the non-photochemical quenching activity was responsible for the stability in the OJIP curve. Therefore, A. affinis presented photochemical mechanisms that contribute to the occupation and dominance of overgrazed grasslands with different light regimes.

TI  - Assessing strategies to reconcile agriculture and bird conservation in the temperate grasslands of South America
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - Globally, agriculture is the greatest source of threat to biodiversity, through both ongoing conversion of natural habitat and intensification of existing farmland. Land sparing and land sharing have been suggested as alternative approaches to reconcile this threat with the need for land to produce food. To examine which approach holds most promise for grassland species, we examined how bird population densities changed with farm yield (production per unit area) in the Campos of Brazil and Uruguay. We obtained information on biodiversity and crop yields from 24 sites that differed in agricultural yield. Density-yield functions were fitted for 121 bird species to describe the response of population densities to increasing farm yield, measured in terms of both food energy and profit. We categorized individual species according to how their population changed across the yield gradient as being positively or negatively affected by farming and according to whether the species' total population size was greater under land-sparing, land-sharing, or an intermediate strategy. Irrespective of the yield, most species were negatively affected by farming. Increasing yields reduced densities of approximately 80% of bird species. We estimated land sparing would result in larger populations than other sorts of strategies for 67% to 70% of negatively affected species, given current production levels, including three threatened species. This suggests that increasing yields in some areas while reducing grazing to low levels elsewhere may be the best option for bird conservation in these grasslands. Implementing such an approach would require conservation and production policies to be explicitly linked to support yield increases in farmed areas and concurrently guarantee that larger areas of lightly grazed natural grasslands are set aside for conservation.

TI  - Metagenomics analysis of soil microbial communities in plant agroforestry system rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) - Ganyong (Canna sp.)
T2  - SOUTHEAST ASIA PLANT PROTECTION CONFERENCE 2019
CP  - 1st Southeast Asia Plant Protection Conference
AB  - Rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) is one of important industrial plants in Indonesia. It is planted widely in some provinces in Indonesia, one of which is in West Java under management of the PTPN VIII plantation, Subang Regency. Intercropping system using underutilized crops Canna sp. (Ganyong) had been introduced on Rubber plantation. The aim of this research is to analyze the diversity, abundance and richness of rhizosphere soil microbial under rubber-canna agroforestry system using metagenomic analysis of 16S rRNA gene of soil rhizosphere bacteria. The research was carried out by collecting soil samples from 2 different soil conditions (soils with Canna (G) and soils without Canna (TG)). 2 different soil depths conditions (20 and 40 cm) were also investigated. The results showed that number of microbial in G soils was found more abundance than in TG soils, while based on soil depth there was no significant effect on soil microbial abundance. Based on class level was found 84 Classes. There were 3 classes that are mostly found in G and TG, namely Ktedonobacteria, Acidobacteria and Planctomycetia. Microbial diversity in family level mostly found in G and TG, Namely Koribacteraceae, Gemmataceae, Synobacteraceae, Hyphomicrobiaceae.

TI  - Earthworm species in Musa spp. plantations in Brazil and worldwide
T2  - ZOOKEYS
AB  - Bananas and plantains are major commodity/food crops that represent an important habitat for earthworms, although so far, no review is available on earthworm communities associated with banana/plantain crops worldwide. The Vale do Ribeira region is among the largest banana producing areas in Brazil, but little is known of the earthworms living there. Hence, the present study assessed earthworm populations and species in three banana plantations and adjacent Atlantic forest fragments along the Ribeira de Iguape River using standard (hand sorting) methodologies. Furthermore, we review earthworm populations reported in banana/plantain plantations worldwide. Only two species (Pontoscolex corethrurus, Amynthas gracilis) belonging to two families (Rhinodrilidae, Megascolecidae) were found in the Ribeira River valley, occurring concurrently. Abundance was low (< 13 indiv. m(-2)) compared with other banana plantations worldwide, that frequently surpassed 100 indiv. m(-2). More than 70 studies reported earthworms from >200 banana plantations in 28 countries, and mean species richness was 2.7 per site, ranging from 1 to 10 species. Exotics predominated in most sites and P. corethrurus was the most prevalent species encountered. Overall, more than 104 species from 10 families were reported, with around 61 native and 43 exotic widespread species, mainly of the Megascolecidae, Lumbricidae and Acanthodrilidae families. Richness was highest in India (27 spp.) and the Canary Islands (25 spp.), but native species dominated only in a few countries and sites, while exotics were prevalent especially in island countries and Brazil. Lower-input practices appear to be important for earthworm communities and banana plantations can have large earthworm populations in some cases, which may be contributing to soil processes and plant production, topics that deserve further attention. However, many important banana-producing countries have not yet been evaluated, so further work is warranted, both in terms of applied ecology and biodiversity.

TI  - Diversity and composition of bird assemblages in a forest-shrub-savanna gradient of the Semiarid Chaco, Argentina
T2  - ORNITOLOGIA NEOTROPICAL
AB  - The primitive landscape predominant in the Chaco region of Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia and Brazil, was a patchwork of forests alternating with grasslands and savannas. Regionally, over-grazing produced the replacement of herbaceous communities of grasslands and savannas for woody communities, leading to widespread shrublands. The aim of this study was to evaluate variation in diversity and composition of birds in a gradient of three types of habitats of Semi-arid Chaco: (i) Quebrachos Forest (Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco, Schinopsis lorentzii); (ii) Low shrubland, which constitutes a degraded version of the; (iii) Aibe Savanna (Elionurus muticus). The results suggest that the diversity of birds was determined by the vertical complexity of the vegetation and the degree of similarity of bird assemblages by the degree of similarity between habitat types. This led to: (i) gradual decreases in diversity of birds from the more complex (Forest) to the less complex habitat (Savanna); (ii) a unique composition of species in the Forest and the Savanna (more dissimilar habitats), where birds of closed habitats prevail in the first and open habitat species in the second and; (iii) Low shrubland, displaying greater similarity to the Forest than to the Savanna, representing a habitat unsuitable for open habitat birds. In forested areas the management should strive to maintain or improve the vegetal structure. In shrublands, grasslands and savannas prescribed fire could be used to favor open habitats birds.

TI  - Analysis of information used in the management of plant genetic resources: a case study from northwestern Mato Grosso, Brazil
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Evaluation and monitoring are critical to agroforestry (AFS) project management, especially if they aim to contribute to use and conservation of biodiversity and plant genetic resources. A methodology to analyze information used in decision-making processes was developed and applied in a biodiversity conservation project in the Brazilian Amazon. Quality of information gathered at landscape, AFS, species (Bactris gasipaes Kunth, both wild and cultivated varieties) and genetic diversity levels in three dimensions was analyzed. The information at the landscape level was good, while that in the organizational-institutional and socio-economic dimensions was acceptable; information gaps were serious in the genetic-ecological dimension. Ecological and economic functionality assessment based on indicators built upon reported administrative actions suggests that information related to conservation played a greater role in decision-making and management than information associated with use and development. The application of the methodology proved instrumental for enhancing efficacy of decision-making within an adaptive management approach to plant genetic resources use and conservation.

TI  - Changes in the Cerrado vegetation structure: insights from more than three decades of ecological succession
T2  - WEB ECOLOGY
AB  - Changes in the vegetation of Brazilian Cerrado may occur over time. However, long-term dynamics are not fully understood yet, especially woody plant encroachment (WPE). The objective of this study was to examine changes in vegetation structure in a preserved area in Triangulo Mineiro region, within the southern Brazilian Cerrado domain, over 32 years (1987, 2005, and 2019). We based the study on field and literature surveys, as well as satellite imagery, and hypothesized that, due to the absence of periodic fires or grazing, Cerrado open formations (i.e., grassland or savanna) tend to become denser due to WPE. Shrubby grassland cover assessed in 1987 disappeared in the following periods (from 30.0% to 0.0% in 2019) while forest formations increased (from 7.0% in 1987 to 11.0% in 2019). Changes between 2005 and 2019 occurred within the stricto sensu cerrado subdivisions, with reduction of sparse cerrado (from 34.2% to 7.7 %) and an increase in dense cerrado (from 6.9% to 39.8 %). Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) applied for similar periods indicates a progressive increase of values over time (from 1986 (0.61 +/- 0.10) to 2004 (0.65 +/- 0.06) and 2018 (0.78 +/- 0.05)) and corroborates the WPE process. These patterns imply the loss of biodiversity in open plant formation. Another major consequence was the reduction of wetlands and possible impact on water supply. Such patterns are important to support plant management plans for the threatened Cerrado open plant formations.

TI  - Alpha and beta diversity of plants and animals along a tropical land-use gradient
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Assessing the overall biological diversity of tropical rain forests is a seemingly insurmountable task for ecologists. Therefore, researchers frequently sample selected taxa that they believe reflect general biodiversity patterns. Usually, these studies focus on the congruence of alpha diversity (the number of species found per sampling unit) between taxa rather than on beta diversity (turnover of species assemblages between sampling units). Such approaches ignore the potential role of habitat heterogeneity that, depending on the taxonomic group considered, can greatly enhance beta diversity at local and landscape scales. We compared alpha and beta diversity of four plant groups (trees, lianas, terrestrial herbs, epiphytic liverworts) and eight animal groups (birds, butterflies, lower canopy ants, lower canopy beetles, dung beetles, bees, wasps, and the parasitoids of the latter two) at 15 sites in Sulawesi, Indonesia, that represented natural rain forest and three types of cacao agroforests differing in management intensity. In total, we recorded 863 species. Patterns of species richness per study site varied strongly between taxonomic groups. Only 13-17% of the variance in species richness of one taxonomic group could be predicted from the species richness of another, and on average 12-18% of the variance of beta diversity of a given group was predicted by that in other groups, although some taxon pairs had higher values (up to 76% for wasps and their parasitoids). The degree of congruence of patterns of alpha diversity was not influenced by sampling completeness, whereas the indicator value for beta diversity improved when using a similarity index that accounts for incomplete sampling. The indication potential of alpha diversity for beta diversity and vice versa was limited within taxa (7-20%) and virtually nil between them (0-4%). We conclude that different taxa can have largely independent patterns of alpha diversity and that patterns of beta diversity can be more congruent. Thus, conservation plans on a landscape scale need to put more emphasis on the high heterogeneity of agroforests and the overarching role of beta diversity shaping overall diversity patterns.

TI  - ECOLOGY OF FLOODPLAIN CAMPOS DE MURUNDUS SAVANNA IN SOUTHERN AMAZONIA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES
AB  - Premise of research. This represents one of the first studies of the ecology, diversity, and structure of campos de murundus termite savannas in the vast seasonal wetlands of southern Amazonia. We aimed to improve understanding of this threatened system by assessing species richness, abundance, and co-occurrence among trees and herbs of murundus (earth mounds), investigating the environmental and biological mechanisms underlying these patterns, and discussing implications for biodiversity conservation.
   Methodology. We identified every tree, shrub, subshrub, and herb on 373 murundus across 11 ha at Araguaia State Park, southern Amazonia. We constructed species abundance distributions of trees and herbs, assessed best-fit models, and tested for nonrandom patterns of species co-occurrence using checkerboard scores. Using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), we assessed the affinities among tree species and their positions in murundus.
   Pivotal results. A total of 166 species, 123 genera, and 49 families occupied the murundus. The species abundance distribution of trees followed a lognormal distribution, whereas that of herbs was best described by a Mandelbrot distribution. Observed C-score indices for trees and herbs were significantly larger than expected by chance, indicating nonrandom distributions and species segregation among murundus. DCA revealed a strong gradient in species occurrence within murundus, suggesting that internal structuring may be hydrologically based (e.g., variation in mound microrelief).
   Conclusions. Environmental (e.g., flooding) and biological (e.g., competition between plants) factors are important for controlling the occurrence of tree and herb species on the murundus. The murundus function as critical bases for the maintenance of species diversity in this extensive floodplain, thereby deserving recognition among ecosystems with high conservation priorities.

TI  - Passive restoration of subtropical grasslands leads to incomplete recovery of ant communities in early successional stages
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Understanding how land use and management practices affect biodiversity is essential for developing effective restoration and conservation strategies. Here, we used ant communities to evaluate the effects of historical land uses (former agriculture or tree plantation) and current management (grazing, burning, mowing, and fertilizing) in subtropical grasslands. We also examined how ant species richness and composition are affected through changes in resource diversity and habitat structure. We classified 80 study sites in southern Brazil into two groups: permanent and secondary grasslands. Permanent grasslands presented high, medium or low management intensities that had never been under other land use. Secondary grasslands are former grasslands that were used for agriculture or pine plantations in the past, followed by passive restoration. We sampled ant communities with D-Vac suction in three multiplots per site in 2013-2015. We found that secondary grasslands had lower ant species diversity and different community composition than permanent grasslands. Ant diversity did not differ among permanent grasslands, but composition was markedly different, especially when comparing medium and high management intensities with low. Additionally, ant richness in secondary grasslands was mainly mediated by a decreased resource diversity (i.e., plant species richness) and grass cover, while burning and mowing management increased ant richness by increasing resource diversity. Our results indicate that passive recovery of grasslands in early successional stages after other land uses leads to incomplete recovery of ant communities, as important resource and structure-related drivers of ant species remain altered. In contrast, traditional management practices promote ant diversity.

TI  - Evaluating Sustainability in Traditional Silvopastoral Systems (caivas): Looking Beyond the Impact of Animals on Biodiversity
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Caivas are traditional silvopastoral systems that occur in the Araucaria Forest biome, Southern Brazil, in which animal production and erva-mate extraction are integrated. Participatory research was conducted in caivas in the Northern Plateau, Santa Catarina State, to identify strategies to intensify pasture use and increase animal productivity. To better understand the outcomes of these strategies, a sustainability assessment was conducted in properties that participated in the research (improved caivas; IC) and those that did not (traditional caivas; TC). The Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture Systems (SAFA) tool 2.0.0 for smallholders was chosen as it evaluates the productive unit as a whole using environmental, social, economic, and governance indicators and is tailored for small-scale production. All evaluated indicators showed higher scores for IC properties in relation to TC. In general, the SAFA analysis showed that when evaluated as productive systems, TCs are a strategic option for rural development, as 65% of their indicators were evaluated as good. With the support of rural outreach and research and the adoption of appropriate technologies, this percentage increased to 86% in ICs. These results confirm that with adequate support caivas can significantly contribute to the development of more sustainable livestock farming in Southern Brazil.

TI  - Influence of land use on the diversity of pond-breeding anurans in South Brazilian grasslands
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - The degradation of natural ecosystems due to land use changes has been increasing, altering ecosystem composition, structure and processes, which negatively affects biodiversity. Herein, we explored how the diversity patterns of anurans respond to the scenario of extensive replacement of grasslands with agriculture in southernmost Brazil. We determined possible changes in the species richness, taxonomic composition, and structure of pond-breeding anuran communities in the grassland ecosystems of the South Brazilian Grasslands (SBG). Using the survey at breeding sites method, we sampled a total of 238 ponds, 153 from extensive livestock grazing on grasslands and 85 from agricultural areas. The higher species richness was found in the livestock areas on grasslands. There was a significant nestedness pattern associated with agricultural areas, indicating a non-random process of community simplification by species loss. Seven anuran species were considered land use indicators, of which five were considered indicators of grasslands with livestock, and two as indicators of agricultural areas. Generalist species were persistent and dominant in agricultural areas, while habitat specialists disappeared from these areas. Land use was a significant factor explaining the community structure segregation between land uses regardless of the natural variation reported at the local and regional levels. We highlight the importance of grasslands for the conservation of pond-breeding anurans in non-forest landscapes of the subtropical region, and we discuss the view that extensive livestock production needs strategic incentives to help the conservation of SBG biodiversity, such as multi-institutional measures.

TI  - The sloping agricultural land management on buffer zone of Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park in Malang Regency
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GREEN AGRO-INDUSTRY AND BIOECONOMY
CP  - International Conference on Green Agro-Industry and Bioeconomy (ICGAB)
AB  - The land management in the buffer zone of the protected area has been considered important to support biodiversity in the conservational area. Many areas in the buffer zone of Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park (BTSNP) in Malang Regency, Indonesia, have been threatened by improper agricultural activity. The objective of this study was to examine the profiles of soil quality and biodiversity of several sloping agricultural land management in the buffer zone. The assessment of soil quality (pH and C Organic) and biodiversity of trees, shrubs, and herbs were done in the five land use type i.e. bare land, monoculture of chili, pine-coffee, pine-taro, and coffee agroforestry. The data were analyzed using the principal component analysis. The results showed that agroforestry with coffee as the main crop was the most appropriate land management model for biodiversity, carbon storage, sustainable agroforestry, and production profit stability.

TI  - Separating the two faces of "bioeconomy": Plantation economy and sociobiodiverse economy in Brazil
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - This article analyzes the metadiscourse of bioeconomy and the ways in which bioeconomy is gaining new meanings in Brazil. We argue that the currently unfolding framing of Amazonian diverse economies in natural forests as part of a bioeconomy-on a par with, for example, soybean plantations-is a dangerous and misleading path. Recent reports framing the Amazon as a potential hotspot of bioeconomy are critically scrutinized. We find it important to disintegrate the all-embracing bio-concept that refers to anything "bio" and make visible and strengthen a radical and sustainable version of the bio-based economy against the extractive economy of the plantation. It is essential to analyze how land use practices impact diversity, both in the biological sphere and in social organization. We contrast and compare two types of land use based economies, the "plantation economy" and the "sociobiodiverse economy" offering a toolbox with which to analyze the nature of land use based economies when they expand over new territories and political economic systems. We explore how these two logics of land use compete for the same land and rule each other out, as rivals, using agroforestry and plantation studies as a basis. We find that the term bioeconomy has become so conflated that it cannot be rescued to serve the development of sociobiodiverse economies, such as agroecology or agroforestry. We conclude by making policy suggestions from a more global development perspective, situating the bioeconomy framing into the current moment of converging global crises.

TI  - Long-term change of ant community structure in cacao agroforestry landscapes in Indonesia
T2  - INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY
AB  - Land-use change and agricultural intensification can strongly affect biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Although many studies investigate management impacts, data on the long-term change of species communities in agroecosystems are scarce. We analysed the long-term change in diversity and composition of ant communities in cacao agroforestry systems in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia and attempted to disentangle the driving factors of this change. Ant communities were resampled in 2009 from sites for which previous surveys had been conducted either in 2001 (the rainforest-poor Palolo region) or 2003 (the rainforest-rich Kulawi region) using insecticide fogging. Ant community composition changed significantly over time in Palolo and Kulawi. The change in ant species richness differed between regions. Species richness increased in Kulawi, probably due to the increasing availability of nest sites and microhabitats as trees grow larger and older. In the Palolo region, species richness decreased, suggesting that the high local intensification and landscape-wide changes may have counteracted the effects of tree age. Changes in ant communities over time were significant, but were more difficult to explain than expected, despite clear difference in management changes within and between regions. The findings suggest that the landscape-scale differences between the two study regions play a more important role for species diversity and its composition than changes in local management. This highlights the importance of long-term studies across contrasting landscapes for better understanding the consequences land-use intensification has on tropical biodiversity.

TI  - Plant diversity, forest dependency, and alien plant invasions in tropical agricultural landscapes
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Land-use change and intensification in tropical rainforest regions is generally linked to a loss in species diversity that especially affects forest-dependent species. Indonesia is currently the country with the highest deforestation rates worldwide with potentially devastating effects on its diverse and highly endemic flora and fauna. Here we present a comprehensive assessment of the varied effects of forest conversion and land-use intensification on vascular plant diversity across the four dominant land-use systems in the lowlands of Sumatra: rainforest, jungle rubber agroforest, rubber plantations, and oil palm plantations. We conducted plot-based species inventories in Jambi Province and assessed a total of 156,006 individuals and 1382 plant species. Forest had the highest levels of alpha, beta, and gamma diversity, followed by jungle rubber. Plant communities in oil palm plantations were characterized by a high density of herbaceous weeds, but low species numbers and low beta diversity. Species numbers were comparable in oil palm and rubber plantations, but the latter showed slightly higher beta diversity. Forest had a clearly distinct floristic composition while the floristic composition of the other systems and especially the two plantation systems - converged. Alien species were almost completely absent from forest, but the number and relative abundance of alien species increased with increasing land-use intensity and was highest in oil palm plantations where 25% of the species and 62% of the individuals belonged to alien species. Our results represent a first quantitative baseline for how forest conversion in Southeast Asia causes loss in species richness, changes in floristic composition and vegetation structure, as well as a shift from native to alien dominated plant communities.

TI  - Untangling a web of spider fungi: Gibellula agroflorestalis (Hypocreales, Ascomycota), a new species of spider parasite from Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY
AB  - Gibellula (Cordycipitaceae) includes widely distributed spider pathogenic fungi. This study describes a novel species, Gibellula agroflorestalis, recorded in agroforestry systems (AFS) and Atlantic Forest remnants in Pernambuco State, northeastern Brazil. The morphology of synnemata and conidiophores was studied, and phylogenetic analyses used SSU, LSU and TEF1 data in order to confirm the distinctiveness of the new species. The new species presents particular morphological characteristics, such as lacrimoid conidia and white synnemata. Comparison with other species in the genus revealed significant differences both in conidial and synnematal morphology. Based on Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference phylogenies, G. agroflorestalis is a sister species to G. pulchra. The variations observed in the samples may be attributed to the microenvironmental conditions of AFS, which can influence phenotypic expression. This research emphasizes the importance of AFS in biodiversity conservation and in the discovery of new species.

TI  - Assessing soil erosion and its drivers in agricultural landscapes: a case study in southern Bahia, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
AB  - Erosion is a worldwide threat to biodiversity conservation and agricultural yield, and it is linked to deforestation. In this study, we aim to assess soil loss in landscapes of the Cachoeira River watershed, in southern Bahia, northeastern Brazil. We estimate the role of forests in diminishing soil erosion using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). We compare real and simulated scenarios in which the forest was replaced by agricultural use, also comparing estimates of erosivity factor (R factor) derived from remote sensing and climatological station data. Real and simulated annual soil losses varied from 0 to 167.87 t/year and from 0 to 351.81 t/year along the watershed, respectively. However, only 0.04 and 1.67% of this area is highly and severely exposed to erosion, using data from climatological stations and remote sensing, respectively. We showed that soil loss in the simulated deforested scenario was approximately two times higher than the real annual soil loss, indicating the importance of forest cover to mitigate soil erosion. Moreover, soil loss was 10.5 times greater when using precipitation data from remote sensing compared to climatological stations. Conclusively, the practice of agroforestry can be used as an alternative to avoid erosion. HIGHLIGHTS center dot This paper assessed soil erosion in an important river in Brazil. center dot Real and simulated scenarios of soil loss were discussed in this study. center dot Soil loss was 10.5 times greater when using precipitation data from remote sensing compared to climatological stations. center dot Soil loss is twice as high in non-forested areas as in forested areas.

TI  - Soil and litter fauna of cacao agroforestry systems in Bahia, Brazil
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Agroforestry systems deposit great amounts of plant residues on soil and this leads to high levels of soil organic matter content and has increased soil biodiversity and improved its conservation. This study compares the distribution of meso and macrofaunal communities in soil and litter under cacao agroforestry systems and in a natural forest in the southern Bahia state of Brazil. Soil and litter samples were obtained in September 2003, February 2004, and August 2004 in five cacao agroforestry systems. The systems evaluated included: cacao renewed under Erythrina sp. (Erythrina poeppigiana) (CRE); cacao renewed under natural forest (Cabruca, CRF); an old cacao system under Erythrina sp. (OCE); an old cacao system under a natural forest system (Cabruca, OCF) and a cacao germplasm collection area (CGC). As a reference soil and litter under a natural forest (NF) was included. Organisms were collected over a 15-day period with a Berlese-Tullgren apparatus. The density and richness of total fauna varied distinctly according to sites, sampling time and material sampled (soil and litter). 16,409 of fauna were recovered from soil and litter samples and the density of total fauna was 2,094 individuals m(-2) in the litter and 641 individuals m(-2) in the soil. The richness was 11.8 in the litter and 7.5 in the soil. The cacao agroforestry systems adopted for growing cacao in the southern Bahia region of Brazil have beneficial effects on the soil and litter faunal communities, and such systems of cacao cultivation could be considered as a conservation system for soil fauna. The development of a litter layer resulted in higher abundance and diversity of soil fauna.

TI  - The influence of emergent trees on rainfall distribution in a cacao agroforest (Sulawesi, Indonesia)
T2  - FLORA
AB  - Emergent trees may have an influence on the volume and the spatial distribution of water input into agroforestry stands and may thus affect water availability for the main crops. Our goal was to analyze the influence of such trees on rainfall distribution in a cacao agroforest area in the rainforest margin zone of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. The emergent trees studied belong to the species Bischofia javanica (Phyllanthaccae) and were 15 m high remnants from the natural forest. A set of 96 throughfall gauges was systematically distributed underneath canopies of cacao only, and underneath canopies of cacao plus emergent trees (cacao plus trees). From an earlier study we knew that stemflow can safely be estimated with less than 1% of gross precipitation (Pg).
   Median throughfall tended to be lower in gauges underneath cacao plus trees than under cacao only (p <= 0.1), and the estimated rainfall interception loss was 4% and 16% of Pg in cacao only and cacao plus trees plots, respectively. This difference was most likely caused by a tree-induced enhancement of the canopy water storage capacity and an increase in canopy roughness. Underneath the canopy of emergent trees (cacao plus trees), throughfall exceeded gross precipitation east of the tree stems (113%) and was significantly lower (p <= 0.05) west and north of the tree stems (67-77% of Pg). Significant effects of trees on throughfall did not extend beyond their canopy area. We assume that wind-driven rain was stripped out east of the stems causing an increase in throughfall, while rain-shadow effects led to a decrease in throughfall west and north of the tree stems. Thus, at our study site emergent trees tended to reduce rain water input, and produced clear spatial patterns in throughfall distribution. A reduced water availability may lead to reduced cacao bean yields in times of water scarcity but a more complete assessment of the hydrological function of shade trees in agroforestry systems may also reveal positive influences of shade trees on cacao trees. Such an advanced analysis of hydrological functions still remains to be done. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

TI  - The contribution of agroforestry systems to reducing farmers' dependence on the resources of adjacent national parks: a case study from Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - There is much debate about the way conservation and development are best integrated to reduce the encroachment pressures of poor rural communities on the biodiversity resources of protected areas in the tropics. One frequently recommended instrument is to intensify farming systems in the adjacent areas, so as to decrease the need to harvest resources from national parks. This study examined this issue by analyzing the effects of different household land uses in villages near a national park on their propensity to harvest resources from the park. In the northern part of the Kerinci Seblat National Park (Sumatra Island, Indonesia) the park buffer zone is comprised largely of community or village forests and human settlements. The village forests were formerly managed as production forests and provided significant cash income to the village. They were converted into farmland, particularly to mixed-tree gardens or agroforests. Natural forest coverage has now declined to 10% of the former area within village forest land. We analyzed the characteristics of the mixed gardens and village forests, and their practical contribution to reducing farmers' dependence on the adjacent national park resources. Households with farms that were more diversified were found to have much less dependency on the national park resources. Households that farmed only wetland rice fields registered the highest value of forest products obtained from inside the park. Households that farmed only mixed gardens had an intermediate level of park resource extraction, while those that had farms composed of both components (i.e. wetland rice fields and mixed gardens) had a dramatically lower level of economic dependency on park resources than households in either of the other two categories.

TI  - On-farm evaluation of the establishment of clonal rubber in multistrata agroforests in Jambi, Indonesia
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
CP  - International Symposium on Multistrata Agroforestry Systems with Perennial Crops
AB  - Perennial tree crops are often grown in complex multistrata systems that incorporate natural vegetation. These systems contribute simultaneously to sustaining rural livelihoods and to the conservation of biodiversity, but their productivity is usually low. Introduction of high yielding germplasm, usually selected in monocultural plantations, is a potential way to increase productivity, but a critical requirement is that such plants can be established in a competitive multispecies environment. The establishment of clonal planting stock in the jungle rubber agroforests of Indonesia was explored through participatory on-farm research. The trial involved four farmers who grew clonal rubber trees in a total of 20 plots, constituting five replicate experimental blocks spread across four farms. Unexpectedly, vertebrate pest damage by monkeys (Presbytis melalophos nobilis) and wild pigs (Sus scrofa) was the most important influence on establishment, explaining almost 70% of the variation in rubber tree growth. The amount of labour invested in weeding was also positively correlated with rubber tree growth. Farmers generally decided to completely cut back vegetation between rows of rubber trees, including potentially valuable trees, rather than weeding within the rows and selectively pruning trees in the inter-row. Farmers thought that the inter-row vegetation would harbour vertebrate pests and compete with the clonal rubber, and they had access to fruits, firewood and other non-timber forest products from other land. Thus, contrary to expectations, when offered clonal germplasm, farmers opted to use plantation monoculture methods to protect what they considered a valuable asset, rather than maintain the traditional multispecies strategy they use with local germplasm.

TI  - Agroecological Transition of Conilon Coffee (Coffea canephora) Agroforestry Systems in the State of Esp rito Santo, Brazil
T2  - AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Coffee is a very important product in the State of Espirito Santo, Brazil, and most of it is planted as unshaded coffee monocultures, with few growers managing shaded coffee agroforestry systems (AFS). To analyze the opportunities and challenges associated with coffee agroforestry management, we conducted 58 semistructured interviews with coffee growers. In addition, we conducted a field investigation that tested production of Coffea canephora with the shade trees Australian Cedar (Toona ciliata), Jequitiba (Cariniana legalis), and Teak (Tectona grandis). Of the 58 interviewed farmers, 64% (37) were satisfied with the AFS. One of the main factors that caused satisfaction was obtaining income from sources other than coffee. Unsatisfied farmers mentioned the competition between shade trees and coffee shrubs. Cedar was the shade tree that grew most and reduced coffee production, while the combination with Jequitiba maintained more stable yields. We conclude that the higher the growth rate of trees, the higher the negative impact on the coffee production in the study areas.

TI  - Spatial Variability of Soil Fauna Under Different Land Use and Managements
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
AB  - Geostatistics allows the evaluation of the distribution pattern of data with high spatial variability in agricultural systems. This study aimed to evaluate the spatial variability of biological diversity indices of soil fauna under different land (agriculture and forest). Samples were collected in seven areas (millet, soybean, corn, eucalyptus, pasture crops, and preserved and disturbed Cerrado), in Maranhao state, Brazil. The soil fauna was caught trapped in pitfall traps, installed 3 m away from each other. In each area, 130 traps were maintained for seven days. After this period, they were removed and their content transferred to bottles and taken to the laboratory, where the insects were screened and identified at the level of orders and families. Eight indices were calculated, namely: individuals trap(-1) day(-1), Jackknife richness estimator, the Simpson, McIntosh, Shannon, and total diversity, and Simpson dominance, and Pielou equitability indices. The spatial variability was derived from the semivariograms fitted to Gaussian, spherical, and exponential geostatistical models. Statistical analysis showed medium values of the coefficient of variation for millet, except for the indices individuals trap(-1) day(-1) and McIntosh diversity, which were considered high. The values of the correlation matrix were negative for some indices, suggesting an inverse relationship. For millet, corn, eucalyptus, disturbed Cerrado, and pasture areas, the Shannon diversity index exhibited a pure nugget effect. For the areas of millet, corn, disturbed Cerrado and pasture, the total diversity index was adjusted to the Gaussian model. The degree of spatial dependence was considered high for the individuals trap(-1) day(-1) and Pielou equitability indices for millet. Only for soybean and pasture similarity in the scaled semivariograms was observed for the spatial variability of the indices, indicating similarity of performance. Soil management and land use affect the patterns of soil fauna abundance, richness, and diversity. The presence of groups such as Araneae, Diplura, and Poduromorpha are related to ecological equilibrium, quality, and sustainability of the agricultural systems studied.

TI  - Biodiversity indicator groups of tropical land-use systems:: Comparing plants, birds, and insects
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Tropical landscapes are dominated by land-use systems, but their contribution to the conservation of biodiversity is largely unknown. Since changes in biodiversity in response to human impact are known to differ widely among taxonomic groups and guilds there is a need for multidisciplinary collaboration of plant, vertebrate, and invertebrate experts. We used inventories of trees, understory plants, birds (subdivided into endemics, insectivores, frugivores/nectar feeders), butterflies (endemics, fruit feeders), and dung beetles in Sulawesi (Indonesia) to characterize a gradient from near-primary to secondary forests, agroforestry systems, and annual crops. As expected, overall species richness tended to decrease within this gradient of increasing habitat modification, but, in contrast to previous studies, we found the species richness between most taxonomic groups to be significantly correlated (36 out of 38 pairwise comparisons). However, on average only 48% of the variance could be explained (within the five main groups), and only a few taxonomic groups/guilds turned out to be good predictors for others: for example, trees for fruit- and nectar-feeding birds (88% explanation) and fruit-feeding butterflies (83%), endemic birds for endemic butterflies (72%), and frugivorous/nectar-feeding birds for fruit-feeding butterflies (67%). Although biodiversity of land-use systems showed taxonomic group- and guild-specific differences, most groups were affected in a similar way by habitat modification. Near-primary forest sites proved to be of principal importance for conservation; however, land-use systems such as secondary forests (for understory plants, birds, and butterflies) and agroforestry systems (for butterflies) supported relatively high numbers of species and might play a significant role for biodiversity conservation in tropical landscapes.

TI  - Agroforestry adoption and maintenance: self-efficacy, attitudes and socio-economic factors
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Agroforestry is a key land use in the development of ecological corridors in tropical rainforests biomes. This research tested the social dimensions of agroforestry adoption and maintenance in the Atlantic rainforest of Southern Bahia, Brazil. A quasi-experiment research design compared a group of farmers who participated in an agroforestry development program with a group of similar farmers who were not participants in the program. The effects of the program on the participants' self-efficacy, attitudes and intentions to adopt or maintain agroforestry were tested. The effects of socio-economic factors and attitudes were also compared to self-efficacy in terms of farmers' intentions to adopt or maintain agroforestry. Results indicate that the program neither raised nor lowered the farmers' attitudes, self-efficacy or intentions to adopt or maintain agroforestry. However, multiple regression and logistic model analyses indicate that perceived behavioral control, attitudes about conservation and available labor contributed most significantly to farmers' intentions to adopt or maintain agroforestry. Overall, perceived behavioral control proved to have the most significant correlation with farmers' intentions to adopt or maintain agroforestry. Therefore, agroforestry development programs could benefit from focusing on farmers' perceived control of certain behaviors to enhance the persistence of agroforestry practices.

TI  - Pollination of Coffea canephora in relation to local and regional agroforestry management
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Pollination of crops depends on local agricultural management and the quality of adjacent habitats. Lowland coffee Coffea canephora, is an important tropical cash crop. Fruit set depends on cross-pollination by bees, so inadequate pollination leads to reduced yield. In this study we analyse the relationship between bee pollinators, fruit set in coffee, and the local and regional agroforestry systems to identify the optimal conditions for pollinators.
   2. We analysed the abundance and species composition of coffee flower-visiting bees in 15 agroforestry systems differing in distance to forest (important for wood-nesting species), light intensity (important for ground-nesting species), blossom cover of coffee and noncoffee-flowering plants, and species richness of flowering plants (as pollen and nectar resources) in Central Sulawesi (Indonesia). We examined which factors were most important for optimal pollination success. We carried out bagged and open pollination experiments in each agroforestry system, to measure the pollination efficiency of 15 bee species.
   3. The number of social bee species decreased with distance to forest, whereas the number of solitary bee species increased with light intensity (less shade) and greater quantities of blossoms.
   4. Fruit set of open pollinated flowers (as opposed to manually cross-pollinated flowers) increased with the diversity and abundance of flower-visiting bees. In the agroforestry systems studied, a bee community of 20 species or more led to a higher fruit set (95%) than a species-poor bee community of six species (70% fruit set).
   5. Pollination activity by members of the species-rich solitary bee assemblage led to higher levels of fruit set than that arising from pollination activity by members of the more abundant social bee assemblage.
   6. Synthesis and applications. A species-rich and abundant bee assemblage will facilitate high pollination success in lowland coffee. This will increase fruit set and coffee yield. Farmers can encourage different species of bees through simple management measures such as growing coffee in shade beneath a variety of trees; by pruning trees to increase levels of sunlight and numbers of flowering herbs; and by increasing the availability of nesting sites for solitary bees. Weed control and the use of herbicides should be kept to a minimum so that a diverse nectar and pollen resource is available to bees throughout the year. Natural forests and forest fragments should be preserved in the vicinity of coffee agroforestry systems (< 500 m) so that forest-nesting social bees can travel easily to the coffee fields to pollinate the flowers.

TI  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi occurrence in revegetated areas after bauxite mining at Porto Trombetas, Para State, Brazil
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the structure and diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in revegetated areas at Porto Trombetas, Para, Brazil. Composite samples were collected in August (dry season) and April (wet season) in areas with top soil after 2, 4, 6, 12 and 16 years of revegetation, in area without the top soil or vegetation, and in a pristine forest. The AMF spores were extracted, and the species identified. The relative density and frequency of occurrence of each species, the Shannon-Wiener and Simpson indexes were calculated. The results indicated that the density of AMF spores did not differ significantly with season. However, the number of AMF species was significantly higher in the dry season at the pristine forest and in the area two years after revegetation. Among the AMF species, Glomus macrocarpum and Acaulospora mellea were represented in higher numbers. After two years of planting, the diversity was highest and the dominance of AMF species was lowest. The addition of top soil with the planting of mycorthizal seedlings were efficient to colonize areas with AMF after open cast bauxite mining.

TI  - Effect of rosewood plantation chronosequence on soil attributes in Central Amazonia
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Rosewood (Aniba rosaeodora Ducke) is an endangered Amazonian tree species that produces a commercially valuable essential oil, used mainly in cosmetics and fine fragrances production. The species can also be used in reforestation programs, which generate jobs and as a source of income and reduce the pressure of exploitation on natural rosewood populations. The objective of this study was to verify the influence of rosewood stands on physical and chemical soil attributes. This study was conducted at a rural farm in the Males municipality, 350 km from Manaus, Amazonas State, Brazil. Samples were collected in five areas; 4-, 10- and 20-year-old rosewood stands, and 15- and 60-year-old secondary forests. The latter two served as control treatments, reflecting natural spontaneous succession conditions over time. Soil was sampled at 10 equidistant points within each area to measure physicochemical attributes, and at the center of each one, a soil profile was dug for description and classification of morphological characteristics. Based on the profile description, the soils were classified as Xanthic Hapludox. The results show that soil conditions under 20-year-old rosewood stand resembled those beneath the 60-year-old secondary forest, and likewise for the soil under the 10-year-old rosewood stand and the 15-year-old secondary forest. The soil bulk density ranged from 0.81 to 0.99 g cm(-3) among all areas and no significant difference was found (P = 0.052). With exception to 4-year-old stand, the organic matter (2.68-5.87%) and carbon stock (18.57-31.71 Mg ha(-1)) did not differ significantly between stands and control treatments. For the soil macronutrients, nitrogen (0.10-0.22%), phosphorus (1.17-11.70 mg kg(-1)), calcium (0.03-0.31 mg kg(-1)) and magnesium (0.02-0.16 mg kg(-1)) were higher or equal in the rosewood stands in comparison to the two controls, while the potassium values (0.03-0.36 mg kg(-1)) were significantly higher in 60-year-old secondary forests only compared to the 10-year-old rosewood stands (P = 0.005). The soil beneath the 4-year-old rosewood stand, however, differed from the other four areas, having significantly higher natural clay content ( > 600 g kg(-1)) and higher topsoil chemical concentrations, associated with the more recent burning. This result represents the first step in addressing concern about sustainable soil use in rosewood forestry economics. Consequently, this kind of rosewood plantation can be recommended as an appropriate use of historically exploited areas, providing economic return from local biodiversity.

TI  - Diversity and spatial distribution of predacious Dolichopodidae (Insecta: Diptera) on organic vegetable fields and adjacent habitats in Brazil
T2  - FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST
AB  - Adults of the fly family Dolichopodidae (Diptera) are general predators on small soft-bodied invertebrates, and often are abundant in agroecosystems. However, information about their diversity and spatial distribution in agricultural landscapes are scarce. Using structured sampling, we identified the species of Dolichopodidae associated with organic vegetable crops, fallow, agroforestry, and native vegetation in the Federal District of Brazil, and evaluate their richness and abundance. We collected 70 species Dolichopodidae distributed in 17 genera and 9 subfamilies. Of these, some 80% of the specimens belong to the following 5 taxa: Chrysotus spectabilis (Loew), Thrypticus violaceous Van Duzee, Condylostylus depressus (Aldrich), Condylostylus "caudatus group" females, and Condylostylus erectus Becker (all Diptera: Dolichopodidae). Habitats with vegetable crops harbored a higher abundance and number of species (diversity a), with a gradual reduction towards more forested environments of native vegetation. This is an inverse gradient with the general patterns of community studies with other taxa. We also verified the importance of less disturbed habitats over time in the agricultural landscape, such as agroforestry and native vegetation, as complementary habitats for the maintenance and conservation of dolichopodid species in particular, a scenario to be tested for other insect groups.

TI  - Effects of habitat type, vegetation structure, and proximity to forests on bird species richness in a forest-agricultural landscape of West Java, Indonesia
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - To halt biodiversity loss in the humid tropics of developing countries, it is crucial to understand the roles and effects of human-modified landscapes with fragmented forest remnants in maintaining biodiversity while fulfilling the demands of local communities and reducing poverty. To implement appropriate landscape planning for conserving biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, appropriate information is required about parameters of habitat suitability among various anthropogenic habitats with a range of distances to forests and vegetation characteristics, but such information is limited. We examined differences in avian communities between a remnant forest and four types of man-made forest (two mature plantations and two agroforests) in a forest-agricultural landscape of West Java, and we analyzed the effects of both local and landscape factors on various types of species richness in this landscape. The results from non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed avifauna in the two types of agroforest was clustered separately from that in the remnant forest, mainly because drastic declines in the abundance of forest specialists (including IUCN red-listed species) and their replacement with open-habitat generalists. The mixed-tree agroforests were colonized by 30 % of forest specialists and forest-edge species found in the remnant forest, and maintained the highest richness of species endemic to Indonesia among man-made forests, implying that some forest specialists and endemics might have adapted to ancient landscape heterogeneity. High proportion of insectivorous birds was found in the remnant forest (more than 50 %) and drastically decline in man-made forests, although the species richness of insectivores did not decline significantly in broad-leaved plantations. We concluded that protection of remnant forests should be prioritized to conserve forest bird diversity. However, as different environmental factors affected the richness values of different ecological groups, appropriate landscape design and habitat management could improve functional diversity in forest-agricultural landscapes in the tropics.

TI  - INSECT AS BIOLOGICAL INDICATOR FROM PROTECTED TO THE DISTURB LANDSCAPE IN CENTRAL JAVA INDONESIA
T2  - AGRIVITA
AB  - In the biological science, invertebrate (especially insect) diversity is relatively well known. Yet, little study about their interaction with specific land use or specific system function. With the rapid changes of landscape, biodiversity is also changes in response to human impact; due to each organism have the specific interaction with certain environment. In this research, the assessment of insect order in the different landscape types was conducted using several method of trapping to understand the specific pattern of insect which are inhabited the landscape. The objectives of this research were monitored the Insect diversity, its ecological importance to agro-forestry ecosystem, and compare it with other forest type in this area. Another objective was determined the insect characteristic as the indicator of environmental quality on each land-use system (forest, agroforestry, plantation and monoculture). Monoculture agriculture has the largest number of Lepidoptera and Hemiptera order (herbivore insect dominated) while in agro-forest system has the largest number of Diptera and coleoptera order. Protected forest, plantation forest and agro-forestry showed the similar index number which shows the similar ecological services for the insect as their habitat. However, in the monoculture agriculture, there was an unbalance insect composition and high dominance.

TI  - Recovery of species richness and conservation of native Atlantic forest trees in the cacao plantations of southern Bahia in Brazil
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - The Atlantic forests of southern Bahia in Brazil present great species richness and a high degree of endemism. A large part of these native forests were transformed into cacao plantations in an agroforestry system known locally as cabrucas, where native trees were culled and cacao was planted under the shade of remaining trees. The present study analyzed the influence of time of implantation ( age) and time of abandonment of management practices on tree species diversity of cabruca plantations to evaluate the capacity for conservation and recovery of species richness of native Atlantic Forest trees in cabrucas. Phytosociological surveys were conducted in five cabrucas with different conditions of age and state of abandonment. All trees, including hemiepiphytes and excluding the cacao plants, with a minimum stem diameter of 10 cm at breast height, were surveyed within a 3- ha sampling area in each plantation. A total of 2514 individual trees belonging to 293 species and 52 families were recorded in the five cabrucas. The Shannon diversity index varied from 3.31 to 4.22 among the cabrucas and was positively correlated with the time of abandonment ( r = 0.97). The new cabrucas showed the highest values of estimated total richness ( Chao) and the highest proportion of late successional species than the old ones. All areas preserved a very high proportion of native forest species while the three old cabrucas showed a higher proportion of exotic species than the two new ones. Thus the exotic species seem to replace more of the native species in the long run because of management practices and local preferences. The cabrucas presented also a high capacity for the regeneration of tree species richness after abandonment. Simple alterations in management practices could improve the recruitment of late successional species in these areas. Economic incentives may be necessary for the farmers to adopt management practices to retain native species which bring no economic returns.

TI  - Cabruca agroforests in southern Bahia, Brazil: tree component, management practices and tree species conservation
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - In southern Bahia, Brazil, cabrucas are the traditional agroforests in which cacao trees are planted under thinned-out native forests. To analyze the role of cabrucas in tree species conservation, we inventoried the non-cocoa trees in 1.0 ha plots of cabruca in 16 cocoa farms and compared our results with a similar survey undertaken in the early 1960s in the same region to analyze the long term changes. We also interviewed 160 cocoa farmers to investigate their preferences for species and the main practices used in managing shade trees. The cabrucas showed high levels of tree diversity for an agroforestry system (Shannon index ranging from 2.21 to 3.52) and also high variation in structure and composition among the different farms. Forest specialist trees accounted for most species (63.9%) in the survey and were among the species most preferred by the farmers, although we found evidence that some of these trees are gradually being replaced by other species. Our results indicate that cabrucas are poor substitutes for undisturbed forests in terms of tree species richness, but their presence in human-altered landscapes is of utmost importance to the conservation of forest tree species as they increase overall heterogeneity and may serve as ecological corridors, additional habitats, and buffer zones.

TI  - Can Joint Carbon and Biodiversity Management in Tropical Agroforestry Landscapes Be Optimized?
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Managing ecosystems for carbon storage may also benefit biodiversity conservation, but such a potential 'win-win' scenario has not yet been assessed for tropical agroforestry landscapes. We measured above-and below-ground carbon stocks as well as the species richness of four groups of plants and eight of animals on 14 representative plots in Sulawesi, Indonesia, ranging from natural rainforest to cacao agroforests that have replaced former natural forest. The conversion of natural forests with carbon stocks of 227-362 Mg C ha(-1) to agroforests with 82-211 Mg C ha(-1) showed no relationships to overall biodiversity but led to a significant loss of forest-related species richness. We conclude that the conservation of the forest-related biodiversity, and to a lesser degree of carbon stocks, mainly depends on the preservation of natural forest habitats. In the three most carbon-rich agroforestry systems, carbon stocks were about 60% of those of natural forest, suggesting that 1.6 ha of optimally managed agroforest can contribute to the conservation of carbon stocks as much as 1 ha of natural forest. However, agroforestry systems had comparatively low biodiversity, and we found no evidence for a tight link between carbon storage and biodiversity. Yet, potential win-win agroforestry management solutions include combining high shade-tree quality which favours biodiversity with cacao-yield adapted shade levels.

TI  - Deforestation and the environmental Kuznets curve: A cross-national investigation of intervening mechanisms
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY
AB  - Objective. We draw on ecological modernization theory and international political economy arguments to examine the sources of an environmental Kuznets curve (or EKC) that produces an inverted U-shaped rate of deforestation relative to economic development. Method. We use ordinary least squares regression with White's ( 1978) correction Cor possible heteroskedasticity to examine the rate of deforestation (1980-1995) in less developed countries. Results. Net of controls for initial forest stock and the quality of deforestation estimates, we find strong evidence for an EKC driven by (1) agglomeration effects linked to the level of urbanization, (2) rural-to-urban migration that partially offsets rural population pressure, (3) the growth of services-dominated urban economies, and (4) strong democratic states. We Find little evidence that foreign debt or export dependence influence the deforestation rate. Conclusions. Although deforestation continues to pose pressing and potentially irreversible environmental risks, there is evidence of self-corrective ecological and modernization processes inherent in development that act to mitigate these risks.
   Deforestation is a pressing environmental problem involving permanent loss of species, soil degradation, impact on global climate change, and long-term resource depletion. Of the approximately 3.4 billion hectares of forest land that existed around the globe in 1980, approximately 5 percent had been cleared by 1995 (FAO, 1997). Although some decline in the rate of deforestation has been detected in the 1990s (with rapid deforestation in some regions being offset by uneven decreases in Brazil and reforestation in some developed nations), there is no guarantee of abatement in the near future (World Resources Institute, 2000). Given the inextricable links between forest cover and biodiversity, soil quality, and atmospheric replenish-ment, understanding the causes and consequences of deforestation must be central to both natural and social environmental science.
   Of the various forms of environmental degradation, deforestation holds a special appeal because (1) the felling of trees is spatially fixed and therefore more amenable to study, (2) deforestation is unambiguously due to human activities, and (3) the loss of forest cover is uniquely intertwined with nearly all other forms of environmental degradation. This article extends and improves on prior cross-national analyses of deforestation. Whereas most past studies have been empirical and descriptive, more recent investigations have been more theoretical, emphasizing modernization processes, demographic pressures, and dependency/world systems constraints (e.g., Rock, 1996; Rudel and Roper, 1997; Ehrhardt-Martinez, 1998, 1999). As a part of this theorizing, the existence and implications of an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) have garnered increasing attention. Given that the actual meaning of this curvilinear relationship between development and deforestation depends heavily on the intervening mechanisms linking the two, the purpose of this investigation is first to establish the existence of an EKC for deforestation and then to examine various competing explanations for this pattern.

TI  - Slow death of Atlantic forest trees in cocoa agroforestry in southeastern Brazil
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Cocoa ( Theobroma cacao) is cultivated in the states of Bahia and Espirito Santo in eastern Brazil under the so-called 'cabruca system', where the understorey of native Atlantic forest is cleared and the canopy is thinned out to provide adequate shading for the cocoa trees. Apart from its economic and social role, the cabruca system is said to be important for the conservation of Atlantic forest biodiversity. In this paper we studied tree species richness and forest structure of cabrucas to examine the demographic health of these forests and discuss their long-term survival. Data were collected in 20 farms located alongside a 30 km track of the northern margin of the Rio Doce, in northern Espirito Santo. All trees greater than or equal to5 cm DBH were identified and their diameter was measured in 80 plots (600 m(2)), totalling 4.8 ha of sampled area. Recorded trees were also allocated to four different regeneration phases ( pioneers, early secondary, late secondary and climax). The inventory resulted in 507 trees belonging to 105 species in 39 families. This species richness is much lower than in less disturbed forests located in the region. Pioneers and early secondary species dominate the cabruca forest in terms of number of species (56.2%), density (71.0%) and basal area (72.3%). The distribution of diameter frequency showed an imbalance in tree regeneration. Most trees in the range of 5-30 cm DBH were pioneers (40.7%), or early secondary species (32.6%), while late secondary and climax trees were less frequent (10.2 and 16.5% of the sampled trees, respectively). The dominance of species of early regeneration phases was also observed for trees >30 cm DBH (69.0% of pioneers or early secondary and 31.0% of late secondary or climax species). The results indicated that the cabruca forests are not only less diverse and less dense than secondary or primary forests of the region, but also, and more importantly, their natural succession and gap dynamics are being severely impaired. As a consequence, cabrucas present a structure where tree species of late successional phases are becoming increasingly rare while pioneers and early secondary species are becoming dominant. If current management practices of thinning and clearing of native trees are not improved, the long-term survival of these forests is questionable and their role in maintaining biodiversity in the long run is limited.

TI  - Floristics of the herbaceous-shrub vegetation in the restinga of Araoca Beach, municipality of Guimarães, Maranhão, Northeast Brazil
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - The Environmental Protection Area of Reentr & acirc;ncias Maranhenses is located on the northern coast of the state of Maranh & atilde;o, covering 16 municipalities and great floristic diversity. However, this biodiversity is threatened by the reduction and even extinction of species aggravated by anthropogenic action. The objectives of this study were (i) to analyze the floristic composition of the herbaceous and shrubby vegetation in the restinga ecosystem of Araoca Beach, located in the municipality of Guimar & atilde;es; (ii) classify habits; (iii) to analyze pollination and seed dispersal syndromes; (iv) to categorize the physiognomies present and (v) to identify environmental impacts. Field expeditions were carried out between July 2022 to October 2023 (during the dry and rainy seasons) and plant species were recorded using the walking method. In total, 122 herbaceous and shrub species belonging to 95 genera and 50 families were cataloged. The families with the highest species richness were Fabaceae (24), Cyperaceae (10), Rubiaceae (6), and Asteraceae (5), corresponding to 37.2% of the total species collected. Herbaceous species (59), shrubs (29), sub-shrubs (21), lianas and vines (12) accounted for 48.4%, 23.8%, 17.2%, and 9.8% of the species, respectively. The survey also recorded a single species of palm (Arecaceae), corresponding to 0.8% of the species collected. As for pollination, 100 species were categorized exclusively as zoophilic and 15 as anemophilic. Concerning seed dispersal, anemochory accounted for 7.4% of the individuals (9); exclusive zoochory was present in 33.6% of the species (41); and exclusive autochory in 70 species (57.4% of the samples). Only Pavonia cancellata (L.) Cav. showed two types of dispersal (zoochory and autochory). The following physiognomies were described: unflooded open field, flooded open field-halophytic, unflooded closed shrubby vegetation, flooded closed shrubby vegetation, and flooded open shrubby vegetation. Araoca's plant diversity indicates a similarity to other restingas in Maranh & atilde;o. The considerable amount of garbage left in the vicinity of the dunes, formation of trails, and cattle grazing areas alter the dynamics and compromise the balance of this ecosystem. Considering this scenario, the restinga of Araoca Beach is subject to loss of floristic composition, making it necessary to develop studies aimed at maintaining its diversity.

TI  - Integrating climate change into agroforestry conservation: A case study on native plant species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Designing multispecies systems with suitable climatic affinity and identifying species' vulnerability under human-driven climate change are current challenges to achieve successful adaptation of natural systems. To address this problem, we need to (1) identify groups of species with climatic similarity under climate scenarios and (2) identify areas with high conservation value under predicted climate change.
   2. To recognize species with similar climatic niche requirements that can be grouped for mixed cropping in Brazil, we employed ecological niche models (ENMs) and Spearman's. for overlap. We also used prioritization algorithms to map areas of high conservation value using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP3-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) to assess mid-term (2041-2060) and long-term (2061-2080) climate change impacts.
   3. We identified 15 species groups with finer climatic affinities at different times depicted on hierarchical clustering dendrograms, which can be combined into agroecological agroforestry systems. Furthermore, we highlight the climatically suitable areas for these groups of species, thus providing an outlook of where different species will need to be planted over time to be conserved. In addition, we observed that climate change is predicted to modify the spatial association of these groups under different future climate scenarios, causing a mean negative change in species climatic similarity of 9.5% to 13.7% under SSP2-4.5 scenario and 9.5% to 10.5% under SSP5-8.5, for 2041-2060 and 2061-2080, respectively.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our findings provide a framework for agroforestry conservation. The groups of species with finer climatic affinities identified and the climatically suitable areas can be combined into agroecological productive systems, and provide an outlook of where different species may be planted over time. In addition, the conservation priority zones displaying high climate stability for each species individually and all at once can be incorporated into Brazil's conservation plans by policymakers to prioritize specific sites. Lastly, we urge policymakers, conservation organizations and donors to promote interventions involving farmers and local communities, since the species' evaluated have proven to maintain landscapes with productive forest fragments and can be conserved in different Brazilian ecosystems.

TI  - Richness and abundance of Aechmea and Hohenbergia (Bromeliaceae) in forest fragments and shade cocoa plantations in two contrasting landscapes in southern Bahia, Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - The intensification of agricultural activity can have profound impacts on biodiversity. We evaluated the influence of the landscape's percentage of forest cover and shaded cocoa plantations on the community of zoochorous bromeliads in southern Bahia, Brazil. We selected two contrasting landscapes, one dominated by Atlantic tropical rainforest and the other by traditional cocoa plantations. In each landscape we sampled three forest fragments and three areas of cocoa plantation, where we conducted a survey of epiphytic bromeliads of the genera Aechmea and Hohenbergia in eight plots of 400 m(2) in each area. The number of trees differed between landscapes and habitats, and was higher in forest fragments than in shade cocoa plantations, but the number of phorophytes was similar between landscapes and habitats. Highest richness of Aechmea and Hohenbergia species was found in forest fragments in landscapes where forests are predominant. Contrary to expectations, the richness in the other areas was relatively low, and extremely low in the landscape dominated by cocoa plantations, ranging from zero to four species per fragment. Bromeliad abundance was not different among landscapes and habitats, but the shade cocoa plantations located in predominant agroforest landscape showed the higher number of stands. Moreover, the species found in the cocoa plantations were more drought-tolerant species. These results suggest that the conservation of species of these genera depends on factors such as the conservation status of each forest fragment and the microclimatic alterations in the habitats, and not only on the percentage of forest in the landscape per se.

TI  - The effects of forest conversion on annual crops and pastures: Estimates of carbon emissions and plant species loss in a Brazilian Amazon colony
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The municipality of Theobroma in Rondonia, Brazil, covers 2165 km(2), of which 43% was deforested by 1993. Between 1973 and 1993, the national government continued to improve highway BR364 connecting the area to Brazil's south-central region and established a colony in Theobroma. During this period, 98% of the deforestation occurred. Some 1800 settler families continue to convert forest into pasture in a system based on the slash-and-burn agriculture and dual-purpose cattle production. Trends in carbon emissions and plant species losses during the 20-year history of Theobroma were analyzed by combining observed shifts in land-use types with estimates for the carbon stocks and plant species richness of each of these types. Carbon stocks declined from about 200 t ha(-1) in the forest to 28 t ha(-1) in the pasture and of 326 plant species encountered in the forest, only 20 remained in pastures (along with 66 species not found in forests). The effects of converting more than 93000 ha of forest into other uses over 20 years include approximate losses of 14 million tons of C to the atmosphere and substantial losses of plant species. Land use alternatives that would store more C include agroforestry and - given the strong incentives for settlers to convert lands into pasture - improving pasture management or developing silvopastoral systems. Plant species conservation may be improved with proposed ways to add private value to the forest. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Frugivory by five bird species in agroforest home gardens of Pontal do Paranapanema, Brazil
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - The inefficiency of conservation efforts based exclusively on natural habitat patches has called the attention of some conservationists to the matrix. Described as the major component of a landscape, the matrix is often agricultural, particularly in the tropics. In this context, agroforestry practices have been recognized for their ability to support a rich fauna and flora. Besides the extensive literature concerning bird communities in agroforestry systems, very few studies analyze how different species respond to the management of such practices. Our study describes the diet and habitat use frequency of five frugivorous bird species in agroforest home gardens, secondary forests, and pastures in the region of Pontal do Paranapanema, Brazil. The focal species were Ramphastos toco (Toco Toucan), Pteroglossus castanotis (Chestnut-eared Aracari), Amazona aestiva (Blue-fronted Amazon), Ara chloroptera (Green-winged Macaw), and Cyanocorax chrysops (Plush-crested Jay). We gathered both habitat use frequency and diet using the "feeding-bout" method. Overall frequency was higher in the secondary forest when compared to pasture and home gardens for all bird species except A. aestiva. The number of feeding bouts was higher in home gardens than in forests for all species with the exception of C. chrysops. Differences in monthly median feeding activity were only statistically significant for C. chrysops and for A. aestiva. The latter was the only species observed feeding in pasture habitats. The total number of food taxa was larger in home gardens than in the forest. Our results reinforce the importance of agroforestry systems as a resource-rich habitat for frugivorous birds.

TI  - Landscape and farm scale management to enhance biodiversity conservation in the cocoa producing region of southern Bahia, Brazil
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - In southern Bahia, Brazil, large land areas are used for the production of cocoa (Theobroma cacao), which is predominantly grown under the shade of native trees in an agroforestry system locally known as cabruca. As a dominant forest-like landscape element of the cocoa region, the cabrucas play an important role in the conservation of the region's biodiversity. The purpose of this review is to provide the scientific basis for an action plan to reconcile cocoa production and biodiversity conservation in southern Bahia. The available research collectively highlights the diversity of responses of different species and biological groups to both the habitat quality of the cabrucas themselves and to the general characteristics of the landscape, such as the relative extent and spatial configuration of different vegetation types within the landscape mosaic. We identify factors that influence directly or indirectly the occurrence of native species in the cabrucas and the wider landscape of the cocoa region and develop recommendations for their conservation management. We show that the current scientific knowledge already provides a good basis for a biodiversity friendly management of the cocoa region of southern Bahia, although more work is needed to refine some management recommendations, especially on shade canopy composition and density, and verify their economic viability. The implementation of our recommendations should be accompanied by appropriate biological and socioeconomic monitoring and the findings should inform a broad program of adaptive management of the cabrucas and the wider cocoa landscape.

TI  - Evaluating the nodulation status of leguminous species from the Amazonian forest of Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
AB  - Numerous leguminous species are used or have potential uses for timber production, pharmacological products, or land reclamation. Through N-2-fixation, many leguminous trees contribute to the N-balance of tropical wetlands and rainforests. Therefore, studies of the N-2-fixation ability of leguminous species appear to be crucial for the better use and conservation of these resources. The global nodulation inventory in the Leguminosae family is constantly being enriched with new records, suggesting the existence of undiscovered nodulated species, especially in tropical natural ecosystems and other hot spots of biodiversity. In this respect, the nodulation of leguminous species from the Amazonian forest of Porto Trombetas (Brazil) was surveyed. Overall, 199 leguminous species from flooded and non-flooded areas, were examined for their nodulation status by combining field observations, seedling inoculations, and screening of N-2-fixing bacterial strains from the collected nodules. The results revealed a tendency for a higher relative frequency of nodulation in the species from the flooded areas (74%) compared with those from the non-flooded areas (67%). Nodulation was observed in the Caesalpinioideae, Mimosoideae, and Papilionoideae, with 25, 88, and 84% of the examined species in each subfamily, respectively. Of the 137 nodulated leguminous species, 32 including three Caesalpinoideae, 19 Mimosoideae, and 10 Papilionoideae are new records. One new nodulated genus (Cymbosema) was found in the Papilionoideae. Twelve non-nodulating leguminous species were also observed for the first time. The results are discussed based on the systematics of the Leguminosae family and the influence of available nutrients to the legume-bacteria symbiosis.

TI  - Evaluation of soil conditions in fast-growing plantations of Eucalyptus grandis and Acacia mangium in Brazil:: a contribution to the study of sustainable land use
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - This study is a comparison of the holorganic horizons (L and F) and hemiorganic horizons (AI > and A12) of 7-years-old stands of Eucalyptus grandis and Acacia rnangium, in the region of the Tabuleiro Forest, in Linhares, Espirito Santo, Brazil. In the soil under A. mangiutn, the stocks of organic matter in the L and F horizons were higher, and the C/N ratio was lower, due to the high nitrogen content of the leaf material. The same was observed for the A horizon chemical properties: the C and nutrients concentrations of the soil fine fraction were higher under A. mangium. The comparison of the C and nutrient concentrations between the A(11) and A(12) horizons and between the aggregate fraction and fine fraction showed similar trends in both sites. In both plantations, the C and nutrient concentrations were higher in A(11) than in A12 horizons, and the soil aggregate fraction had higher concentration of nutrients than the soil fine fraction. Nevertheless, the percentage of aggregates in the soil matrix was much higher in A. mangium than in E. grandis. These results show that in this superficially sandy soil (Argissolo Amarelo Distrofico - Ultisol), the organic matter is the most important way of keeping nutrients, and that the aggregate fraction can be the most effective way of avoiding nutrient loss to the deeper soil horizons. In this context, A. mangium provides better conditions for restoring the soil fertility and soil biodiversity, thus providing better sustainability of the cropping systems than E. grandis.

TI  - Identifying appropriate reference ecosystems based on soil indicators to evaluate post-mining reclamation: A multivariate framework
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
AB  - Large-scale mining operations, such as those associated with iron extraction, disturb soils and vegetation and create the need for effective rehabilitation practices. The Iron Quadrangle region of southeastern Brazil is one of the world's biodiversity hotspots; however, iron mining activities threaten many natural and seminatural ecosystem types in which many rare/protected species occur. The Iron Quadrangle has four main ecosystem types: Atlantic Forest (AF), ferruginous rupestrian grassland with dense vegetation (FRG-D); ferruginous rupestrian grassland with sparse vegetation (FRG-S); and quartzite rupestrian grassland (QRG). To support rehabilitation and monitoring plans, we evaluated reference areas and identified soil and vegetative attributes that best differentiated between these four ecosystems. We measured thirty-four physical, chemical, and biological soil properties and two vegetation parameters and, using a multivariate analysis, detected: 1) correlations between properties and 2) differences between areas. We identified twelve properties that best differentiated the areas (in order from most to least relevant): nickel content; exchangeable aluminum; clay content; above-ground vegetation volume; aluminum saturation; particle density; bulk density; arsenic content; zinc content; lead content, fine sand plus silt content; and fine sand content. Soil physicochemical properties proved to be more sensitive to differences in ecosystem type, and in particular, parameters related to fertility and the presence of metals and semi-metals differentiated the AF from the FRG-D and FRG-S. Soil physical properties, including fine sand and silt content, were most important for differentiating QRG from the other ecosystems, possibly resulting from the exposure of quartzite material to erosive processes. This study demonstrates the importance of identifying appropriate reference areas for post-mining reclamation.

TI  - Landscape forest cover and local vegetation structure mediate multitrophic relationships but not the leaf damage in cacao trees
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Cacao is the most important agricultural product in the southern region of Bahia state, Brazil, with 70 % of its production occurring under the traditional agroforestry where cacao is mostly shaded by native trees. This traditional system allows to reconcile the production with the maintenance of the portion of original biodiversity. However, increased deforestation and intensified agroforestry management aimed at boosting productivity may impact the diversity of native species and the services they provide. In this context, our aim was to disentangle the role of landscape forest cover and the local vegetation complexity on predation of caterpillars and herbivory of cacao plants located in agroforestry systems. The study was conducted across 18 cacao agroforest sites in southern Bahia located in landscapes with different amounts of forest cover. We assessed predation rate using dummy caterpillars, sampling understory birds and arthropods and collected leaves of cacao trees to analyze damage by herbivory. We also measured shading levels and the abundance of cacao trees in each agroforestry. Predation pressure on dummy caterpillars was positively influenced by the abundance of total predators and the level of landscape forest cover and negatively by the number of cacao trees. Even so, we found no evidence that landscape, local features or the actual invertebrate assemblages (predators or herbivores) influenced the cacao leaf damage. The findings highlight the multifaceted interactions between ecological factors, predation pressure, and leaf damage within cacao agroforestry systems.

TI  - Ants' higher taxa as surrogates of species richness in a chronosequence of fallows, old-grown forests and agroforestry systems in the Eastern Amazon, Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - Deforestation in Amazon forests is one of the main causes for biodiversity loss worldwide. Ants are key into the ecosystem because act like engineers; hence, the loss of ants' biodiversity may be a guide to measure the loss of essential functions into the ecosystems. The aim of this study was to evaluate soil ant's richness and to estimate whether higher taxa levels (Subfamily and Genus) can be used as surrogates of species richness in different vegetation types (fallows, old -growth forests and agroforestry systems) in Eastern Amazon. The samples were taken in 65 areas in the Maranhao and Para States in the period 2011-2014. The sampling scheme followed the procedure of Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility (TSBF). Initially, the vegetation types were characterized according to their age and estimated species richness. Linear and exponential functions were applied to evaluate if higher taxa can be used as surrogates and correlated with the Pearson coefficient. In total, 180 species distributed in 60 genera were identified. The results showed that ant species richness was higher in intermediate fallows (88) and old secondary forest (76), and was lower in agroforestry systems (38) and mature riparian forest (35). The genus level was the best surrogate to estimate the ant's species richness across the different vegetation types, and explained 72-97 % (P < 0.001) of the total species variability. The results confirmed that the genus level is an excellent surrogate to estimate the ant's species richness in the region and that both fallows and agroforestry systems may contribute in the conservation of Eastem Amazon ant community.

TI  - Tree Health Typology of Homegardens and Dry Fields Along an Altitudinal Gradient in Kulon Progo, Indonesia
T2  - AGRIVITA
AB  - Homegarden-dry field is one of land management form that maintains biodiversity while at the same time synergize the production and conservation. Changes in market conditions pose a threat for monoculturalism on homegarden and dry field. On the basis of this consideration, it is necessary to do a research on trees health in homegarden and dry field. This study aimed to determine the constituent species in the agroforestry system of Kulon Progo, tree health typology in Kulon Progo, and the type of damages to homegarden and dry field tree species in agroforestry. This research method used inventory of species in the agroforestry system and identification of damage to trees using Forest Health Monitoring (FHM). The result showed that there were three typologies of tree's health. Those were classified into typology 1, 2 and 3 in Kulon Progo. The types of damage that present at homegarden and dry field in Kulon Progo are the open wound, galls rust, broken branch, leaf spot, excessive branching, gummosis and termite attack.

TI  - Assessment and Mapping of Tradeoffs Land Uses in the Orangutan Habitat: A Case Pongo Pygmeus Pygmeus Habitat of West Kalimantan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON CURRENT PROGRESS IN MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCES 2016 (ISCPMS 2016)
CP  - 2nd International Symposium on Current Progress in Mathematics and Sciences (ISCPMS)
AB  - This study aims to analyse trade-offs among 6 (six) types of dominant land uses to consider Orangutan livelihood and landscape sustainability. The results of this study assists landscape's planners and policy makers for selecting development scenarios as well as policy within the landscape, especially to reduce human and wildlife conflict as impact of development. This study was conducted in Orangutan sub species Pongo pygmeus pygmeus habitat in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Net present value analysis was applied to identify economic profit of land uses and also perspective of expert judgment was applied to identify suitability of the land uses to Orangutan livelihood. The study shows that palm oil plantation was the dominant land use type in non-forest area category and natural forest is in forest area category within the site. Palm oil contributed highest economic profit (average IDR 11 Million per year) compared to other land use types, and thus the worst land use type for supporting Orangutan conservation; index suitability for Orangutan achieved only 21.8. The development of agroforestry which planted more than 3 valuable economic commodities is used as an alternative in forest buffer area development that can provide better gain for economic and Orangutan conservation with index suitability for Orangutan was 43.5. In achieving sustainability at the landscape level, it needs to consider the sustainability of the umbrella species, such as Orangutan. The existence of the umbrella species would also protect other biodiversity, forest and its environmental services.

TI  - Drone-based photogrammetry-derived crown metrics for predicting tree and oil palm water use
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
AB  - Transpiration at the stand level is often estimated from water use measurements on a limited number of plants and then scaled up by predicting the remaining plants of a stand by plant size-related variables. Today, drone-based methods offer new opportunities for plant size assessments. We tested crown variables derived from drone-based photogrammetry for predicting and scaling plant water use. In an oil palm agroforest and an oil palm monoculture plantation in lowland Sumatra, Indonesia, tree and oil palm water use rates were measured by sap flux techniques. Simultaneously, aerial images were taken from an octocopter equipped with an Red Green Blue (RGB) camera. We used the structure from motion approach to compute several crown variables such as crown length, width, and volume. Crown volumes for both palms (69%) and trees (81%) explained much of the observed spatial variability in water use; however, the specific crown volume model differed between palms and trees and there was no single linear model fitting for both. Among the trees, crown volume explained more of the observed variability than stem diameter, and in consequence, uncertainties in stand level estimates resulting from scaling were largely reduced. For oil palms, an appropriate whole-plant size-related predictor variable was thus far not available. Stand level transpiration estimates in the studied oil palm agroforest were lower than those in the oil palm monoculture, which is probably due to the small-statured trees. In conclusion, we consider drone-derived crown metrics very useful for the scaling from single plant water use to stand-level transpiration.

TI  - Relationships between invertebrate communities, litter quality and soil attributes under different cacao agroforestry systems in the south of Bahia, Brazil
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - This study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between soil and litter attributes to soil and litter fauna, and further to determine which of these attributes would be most significant in explaining the distribution of faunal communities in cacao agroforestry systems in the south of Bahia, Brazil. Soil and litter samples were collected in five cacao agroforestry systems: a cacao system renewed under Erythrina sp. (CRE); a cacao system renewed under natural forest (Cabruca-CRF); a cacao system under Erythrina sp. (CE); a cacao system under a natural forest system (Cabruca-CNF) and a cacao germplasm collection area (CGC). Soil and litter samples were also collected from natural forest (NF) near the agroforestry systems. The path analysis was used to evaluate the interdependencies among a set of variables including direct and indirect test effects that can be mediated by an intermediary variable. An average of 1367 (+/-126.5) individuals m(-2) and 10 (+/-0.3) taxa per sample were found under these areas. Soil attributes and litter quality under different cacao agroforestry systems affected the diversity of the soil and litter fauna, and these attributes are potential regulators of the fauna functional groups. The chemical components related to acidity, nutrition, and palatability are most decisive for abundant and diverse soil and litter fauna. Attributes which affected soil fauna in cacao agroforestry systems included mainly pH and bulk density in soil and polyphenols and lignin content in the litter. The faunal communities were more sensitive to litter quality than soil quality. Litter management could be a good practice to maintain healthy activities of the faunal community and to maintain improved ecosystem functioning in cacao agroforestry systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Assessment of mite fauna in different coffee cropping systems in Brazil
T2  - BIOCONTROL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Agro-ecological diversification may increase natural biodiversity and decrease environmental impacts caused by the intensification of management practices, especially with respect to pest control. This study aimed to evaluate mite populations from surveys in commercial coffee (Coffea arabica) orchards managed in different ways. Four different cropping systems were compared: a conventional system (CS), non-pesticide system (NPS), organic system (OS) and organic agroforestry system (OAS). Mite samples were taken from 24 coffee plantations (n = 6 for each management strategy). Six leaves per plant were collected from five sampling sites totalling 30 leaves from each plantation. Mites were removed from individual leaves, counted and identified to family level. Amongst the predatory mites, two families were detected; the Phytoseiidae was the most abundant family while the Stigmaeidae, generalist predatory mites, were only found in two management systems (NPS and AOS). Of the two families of phytophagous mites, the family Tenuipalpidae was the most abundant, but rarely found in AOS. The other phytophagous family, Tetranychidae, was less abundant in coffee crops than Tenuipalpidae, but the most abundant phytophagous family in CS. Understanding the relationship between mite populations and management practices can aid in choice of spraying strategies for different coffee management systems.

TI  - The value of differently managed cacao plantations for forest bird conservation in Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL
AB  - In order to assess the potential value of differently managed cacao plantations for bird conservation on Sulawesi, We Surveyed birds in near-primary forest (with limited timber and rattan extraction, and Some hunting), cacao plantations with remnant forest trees and plantations lacking forest trees, from February to April 2007. A total of 16 50 x 50 in plots were visited twice and records of 87 species were obtained. Bird species richness and the number of endemics and forest specialists decreased along this gradient of forest conversion, With 20% of the forest specialists, among them 10 endemics, exclusively found in forest. Species composition changed dramatically between habitat types. Sorensen indices showed a similarity of species composition between forests and plantarions of 45-60% for forest specialists and 65-71% for all species. The most important environmental variable for the diversity and composition of birds was the number of remnant rainforest trees present in the plantations. Our results Suggest that large, undisturbed rainforest arc, most important for the conservation of forest specialists and endemics but that cacao plantations, if managed to maintain a high and diverse cover of forest trees, call harbour up to 60% of forest specialists and endemics.

TI  - Finding alternatives to swidden agriculture: does agroforestry improve livelihood options and reduce pressure on existing forest?
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Swidden cultivation can contribute to deforestation and land degradation, which can subsequently result in a number of serious environmental problems. This paper examines the economic and social potential of agroforestry systems and the barriers to their widespread adoption, as a land use alternative to swidden cultivation, which may potentially help protect local forest. The Gunung Salak valley in West Java, Indonesia is presented as a case study. Based on farmers' and experts' assessment, costs and benefits have been estimated, which show that the two investigated agroforestry systems have higher net present value and benefit-cost ratio (B/C) than the two swidden cultivation systems. Tree ownership also creates more permanent rights to farmland and is prestigious in the community. Agroforestry products (fruit, vegetables etc.) have high monetary value and help strengthen social cohesion when shared with neighbors. However, farmers are reluctant to implement agroforestry. Stated reasons are related to both culture and capacity. Farmers practicing agroforestry are less involved in forest clearing and forest products collection than swidden farmers indicating that it may contribute positively to conservation of local forests. Increasing the adoption of agroforestry farming in the study area will require support to overcome capacity constraints.

TI  - Dataset on microclimate and drone-based thermal patterns within an oil palm agroforestry system
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
AB  - Microclimate and Land Surface Temperature (LST) are important analytical variables used to understand complex oil palm agroforestry systems and their effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functions. In order to examine experimental effects of tree species richness (0, 1, 2, 3 or 6), plot size (25 m(2), 100 m(2), 400 m(2), 1600 m(2)) and stand structural complexity on microclimate and Land Surface Temperature, related data were collected following a strict design. The experiment was carried out in the Jambi province, in Sumatra (Indonesia), as part of the collaborative project EFForTS [Ecological and Socioeconomic Functions of Tropical Lowland Rainforest Transformation Systems]. Microclimate data collected using miniaturized data loggers combined with drone-based thermal data were considered within an oil palm plantation enriched with six target tree species. The time-frame considered for data analysis was 20th September 2017 to 26th September 2017. The experiment data can be used for comparison with data from conventional oil palm agroforestry systems in the tropics. They can more specifically be used as reference to assess microclimate and Land Surface Temperature patterns within similar agroforestry systems. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Landscape constraints on functional diversity of birds and insects in tropical agroecosystems
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - In this paper, we analyzeatabases on birds and insects to assess patterns of functional diversity in human-dominated landscapes in the tropics. A perspective from developed landscapes is essential for understanding remnant natural ecosystems, because most species experience their surroundings at spatial scales beyond the plot level, and spillover between natural and managed ecosystems is common. Agricultural bird species have greater habitat and diet breadth than forest species. Based on a global data base, bird assemblages in tropical agroforest ecosystems were composed of disproportionately more frugivorous and nectarivorous, but fewer insectivorous bird species compared with forest. Similarly, insect predators of plant-feeding arthropods were more diverse in Ecuadorian agroforest and forest compared with rice and pasture, while, in Indonesia, bee diversity was also higher in forested habitats. Hence, diversity of insectivorous birds and insect predators as well as bee pollinators declined with agricultural transformation. In contrast, with increasing agricultural intensification, avian pollinators and seed dispersers initially increase then decrease in proportion. It is well established that the proximity of agricultural habitats to forests has a strong influence on the functional diversity of agroecosystems. Community similarity is higher among agricultural systems than in natural habitats and higher in simple than in complex landscapes for both birds and insects, so natural communities, low-intensity agriculture, and heterogeneous landscapes appear to be critical in the preservation of beta diversity. We require a better understanding of the relative role of landscape composition and the spatial configuration of landscape elements in affecting spillover of functionally important species across managed and natural habitats. This is important for data-based management of tropical human-dominated landscapes sustaining the capacity of communities to reorganize after disturbance and to ensure ecological functioning.

TI  - Homegardens in the Central Amazon: characterization, social importance and agrobiodiversity
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
AB  - The objective of the present study was to describe the main characteristics of homegardens in Central Amazon, as well as to evaluate the social importance and contribution of these agroecosystems to the conservation of agrobiodiversity. Three hundred and thirty-four (334) homegardens in 14 municipalities in the state of Para were sampled, Brazil. The owners or those responsible for the homegardens were interviewed for the collection of history, uses and management of these homegardens. The homegardens of Central Amazon are managed from low to medium intensity with the use of internal inputs and the main criteria for selecting plants are related to their potential use, shade formation and longevity of the species. In addition to the production of food for family consumption, homegardens have aesthetic, social, recreational and religious functions. The homegardens in Central Amazon have an important role in the conservation of agrobiodiversity.

TI  - Community conserved areas: policy issues in historic and contemporary context
T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
AB  - Indigenous and community conserved areas (ICCAs) are natural and/or modified ecosystems containing biodiversity values, ecological services, and cultural values, voluntarily conserved by indigenous and other communities through local or customary laws. They are found in both terrestrial and marine areas; they range in size from <1 ha sacred groves to >30,000 km(2) indigenous territories in Brazil. ICCAs should be recognized for what they may contribute to national and global conservation systems, but there is little documentation of their potential or discussion of their policy implications. Here I examine the historic and contemporary context of ICCAs, provide examples, and raise policy issues related to: assessing the conservation benefits of ICCAs, integrating traditional knowledge into protected area management, finding the right mix of governance regimes, and dealing with challenges faced by them.

TI  - Legacy Effects Overshadow Tree Diversity Effects on Soil Fungal Communities in Oil Palm-Enrichment Plantations
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - Financially profitable large-scale cultivation of oil palm monocultures in previously diverse tropical rain forest areas constitutes a major ecological crisis today. Not only is a large proportion of the aboveground diversity lost, but the belowground soil microbiome, which is important for the sustainability of soil function, is massively altered. Intermixing oil palms with native tree species promotes vegetation biodiversity and stand structural complexity in plantations, but the impact on soil fungi remains unknown. Here, we analyzed the diversity and community composition of soil fungi three years after tree diversity enrichment in an oil palm plantation in Sumatra (Indonesia). We tested the effects of tree diversity, stand structural complexity indices, and soil abiotic conditions on the diversity and community composition of soil fungi. We hypothesized that the enrichment experiment alters the taxonomic and functional community composition, promoting soil fungal diversity. Fungal community composition was affected by soil abiotic conditions (pH, N, and P), but not by tree diversity and stand structural complexity indices. These results suggest that intensive land use and abiotic filters are a legacy to fungal communities, overshadowing the structuring effects of the vegetation, at least in the initial years after enrichment plantings.

TI  - Nature vs. nurture: managing relationships between forests, agroforestry and wild biodiversity
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
CP  - 1st World Congress of Agroforestry
AB  - Many agroforestry systems are found in places that otherwise would be appropriate for natural forests, and often have replaced them. Humans have had a profound influence on forests virtually everywhere they both are found. Thus 'natural' defined as 'without human influence' is a hypothetical construct, though one that has assumed mythological value among many conservationists. Biodiversity is a forest value that does not carry a market price. It is the foundation, however, upon which productive systems depend. The relationship between agroforestry and the wild biodiversity contained in more natural forests is a complicated one, depending on the composition of the agroforestry system itself and the way it is managed. Complex forest gardens are more supportive of biodiversity than monocrop systems, shade coffee more than sun coffee, and systems using native plants tend to be more biologically diverse. Nonnative plants, especially potentially invasive alien species, threaten biodiversity and need to be avoided. The relationship between forests, agroforestry and wild biodiversity can be made most productive through applying adaptive management approaches that incorporate ongoing research and monitoring in order to feed information back into the management system. Maintaining diversity in approaches to management of agroforestry systems will provide humanity with the widest range of options for adapting to changing conditions. Clear government policy frameworks are needed that support alliances among the many interest groups involved in forest biodiversity.

TI  - Bacterial functional redundancy along a soil reclamation gradient
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - A strategy to measure bacterial functional redundancy was developed and tested with soils collected along a soil reclamation gradient by determining the richness and diversity of bacterial groups capable of in situ growth on selected carbon substrates. Soil cores were collected from four sites along a transect from the Jamari tin mine site in the Jamari National Forest, Rondonia, RO, Brazil: denuded mine spoil, soil from below the canopy of invading pioneer trees, revegetated soil under new growth on the forest edge, and the forest floor of an adjacent preserved forest. Bacterial population responses were analyzed by amending these soil samples with individual carbon substrates in the presence of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), BrdU-labeled DNA was then subjected to a 16S-23S rRNA intergenic analysis to depict the actively growing bacteria from each site, The number and diversity of bacterial groups responding to four carbon substrates (L-serine, L-threonine, sodium citrate, and or-lactose hydrate) increased along the reclamation-vegetation gradient such that the preserved forest soil samples contained the highest functional redundancy for each substrate. These data suggest that bacterial functional redundancy increases in relation to the regrowth of plant communities and may therefore represent an important aspect of the restoration of soil biological functionality to reclaimed mine spoils. They also suggest that bacterial functional redundancy may be a useful indicator of soil quality and ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Microclimate and land surface temperature in a biodiversity enriched oil palm plantation
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Agroforestry options such as mixed-species tree planting and natural regeneration in oil palm plantations may alleviate negative effects of forest loss on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The effects of agroforestry on microclimate and land surface temperatures (LST) remain largely unknown despite their central role in controlling abiotic and biotic factors and in buffering climate at a larger scale. We assessed spatial and temporal microclimate and LST variability in a biodiversity enrichment experiment, in which tree islands have been planted in an oil palm plantation in Sumatra (Indonesia). Four years after establishment of the experiment, we measured microclimate and LST using mini microclimate sensors and drone-recorded thermal images. We examined experimental effects of tree species richness (0, 1, 2, 3 or 6), plot size (25 m(2), 100 m(2), 400 m(2), 1600 m(2)) and stand structural complexity on microclimate and LST. Diurnal patterns showed ambient air temperature peaks and relative humidity (RH) minima at 3 pm, whereas diurnal soil temperatures peaked around 6 pm. The lowest LST were observed from oil palm canopy leaves and the highest from bare soils and understorey vegetation (including trees). Spatial and temporal ranges of ambient air temperature were smaller than LST ranges, and average ambient air temperature and LST were positively correlated. Tree species diversity had no overall significant effect neither on microclimate nor LST, but humidity was higher in planted tree islands compared to natural regeneration only. Smaller plots were characterized by higher mean air, soil and LST, compared to larger plots. Structurally complex plots were associated with low mean and maximum values of ambient air temperature, soil temperature and LST and high mean and minimum RH. Still, conditions were hotter and drier in several experimental plots compared to conventional oil palm plantations, considering a higher transpiration in the latest. We conclude that stand structural complexity and tree island size control microclimate and LST in the experimental oil palm agroforests, but alleviating the harsh microclimate conditions in oil palm plantations might take longer to occur.

TI  - Human behaviors determine the direct and indirect impacts of free-ranging dogs on wildlife
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY
AB  - Dogs (Canis familiaris) are among the most abundant and widely distributed carnivores worldwide, and their presence can have negative impacts on native fauna. This study investigated the invasion of cacao agroforests by free-ranging dogs in Brazil. By monitoring the behavior of dogs using direct observations, we assessed whether direct (chasing and predation) and indirect (urine and fecal deposition) interactions with wildlife are more common when dogs enter the agroforests with humans than when they stay outside. We also compared the time that dogs spent inside versus outside the agroforests, and estimated their areas of use. The dogs (n = 10) spent a small fraction of the time without their owners, and only when moving inside the cacao agroforests. The dogs fed and rested more in open habitats and house surroundings than in agroforests, but they were more active and depredated wildlife exclusively in the latter. Kernel estimates of space use at the 50% and 95% levels ranged from 1 to 46 ha and 6 to 202 ha, respectively. Most of the area used by dogs was within cacao agroforest, while core areas were concentrated near human residences and in places of owner permanence in cacao agroforest. Human movement was a key determining factor in the use of space by the dogs. Changes to human behaviors toward their dogs must be considered if the direct and indirect impacts of dogs on wildlife are to be mitigated.

TI  - NATIVE AMAZONIAN FUNGI TO CONTROL TERMITES Nasutitermes sp. (BLATTODEA: TERMITIDAE)
T2  - ACTA BIOLOGICA COLOMBIANA
AB  - Termites of the Nasutitermes genus are considered one of the main urban and agroforestry pests in Brazil, where the main method of control is the application of pesticides. The uso of entomopathogenic fungi to reduce the population of this plague in the environment could be use as an alternative. The goal of this study was to evaluate the virulence of isolates native Amazonian fungi belonging to the Tolypocladium endophyticum, Metarhizium anisopliae and Metarhizium marquandii species for the control of Nasutitermes sp. The strains of T. endophyticum (4.439), M. anisopliae (4.443) and M. marquandii (4.472) with their respective isolation codes, were evaluated using suspensions at concentrations of 105, 106, 107 and 108 conidia/mL against the termites. The fungi were characterized to species level by molecular analysis. The greatest virulence was registered with T. endophyticum (4.439), with a mortality of 100 % on the 4th day of treatment for all analyzed concentrations. The M. anisopliae strain (4.443) proved to be efficient, causing a mortality of 100 % on the 7th and 6th days at dilutions of 107 and 108 conidia/mL, respectively. Rates lower than 100 % were registered with M. marquandii (4.472). Therefore, the three fungal strains showed virulence against the termites Nasutitermes sp. In this study, the fungi Tolypocladium endophyticum and Metarhizium marquandii are reported for the first time for the biological control of pests, indicating the potential of native Amazonian fungi for the biological control of thermites Nasutitermes sp.

TI  - A scientometrics analysis of silvopastoral systems: what we know and what we need to know?
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Silvopastoral systems (SPS) are a sustainable alternative to reduce livestock environmental impacts and restore degraded pastures due to their higher diversity, increased forage production and quality, enhanced soil quality, and C storage. Legume-based silvopastoral systems also contribute through biological nitrogen fixation by the legume component. In this study we evaluate the scientific production on the Web of Science database from 2010 to 2022, with a two-step process. First the keywords "silvopastoral systems" were used for an initial analysis of the overall literature, followed by "legume" or "enzym*" or "microbial communit*, yielding more than 870 papers. The number of publications grew exponentially during the period evaluated, and between 2019 and 2022, approximately 63% of all publications occurred. Brazil had the largest number of published articles, followed by Mexico, USA, Spain, and Colombia. There was also a network of collaborations between institutions in these countries. Agriculture is the research area with the most published articles, with the most studied topics being management, biodiversity, and nutrient dynamics and cycling, especially carbon and nitrogen. However, only nine of these studied the soil microbial community and five, the soil enzymatic activity. Although these previous studies have observed the effect of SPS on important soil indicators, how SPS is used as a restoration tool to affect the microbial biomass and activity of extracellular enzymes remains poorly understood and is important to validate the regeneration strategies. Thus, this article analyzes the evolution of publications on this agroecosystem to advance the knowledge and sustainability in those segments that are still little studied, such as the microbial community and soil enzymatic activity.

TI  - Living in the shadows: Diversity of amphibians, reptiles and birds in shade-grown yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis) plantations
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
AB  - NativeIlex paraguariensis(yerba mate) is one of the most widespread crops in the Atlantic Forest region of southern South America and has an important economic and cultural value in Paraguay, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. Despite the known potential of shade-grown products (especially cocoa and coffee) to protect biodiversity, the benefits of shade-grown yerba mate for biodiversity conservation in the Atlantic Forest remain scarce, one of the most threatened ecoregions in the world, also considered a biodiversity hotspot. In order to understand these potential benefits, it is important to identify how species use shade-grown yerba mate plantations, as well as if it can be an strategy to improve or maintain biodiversity in complex socio-ecological landscapes. We analysed the potential benefits of forests with shade-grown yerba mate for birds, amphibian and reptiles in the Reserve for National Park 'San Rafael' and its buffer area (Itapua Department, Paraguay). We evaluated differences in species richness and composition between three environments: forest with shade-grown yerba mate, forest edge and monoculture crop plantations analysing beta diversity. A total of 112 bird species were recorded in all three environments. Regarding the herpetological community, we recorded 10 species (seven amphibians and three reptiles). Our results indicate that forests with yerba mate plantations not only maintains the bird species richness, but also its species composition differs significantly from edge and croplands, which might be an indicator of the contribution of shade-grown yerba mate plantations to conservation. The results of the research would help to value the impact of sustainable agroforestry activities for the conservation of Atlantic Forest biodiversity. in Spanish is available with online material.

TI  - COMPOSITION OF THE SOIL FAUNA COMMUNITY AND LEAF LITTER STOCK IN AGRO-FORESTRY SYSTEMS AND SECONDARY FORESTRY
T2  - BIOSCIENCE JOURNAL
AB  - Agro-Forestry Systems (AFS), in addition to being a means of providing income, can be considered an alternative way of helping conserve biodiversity, both above and below ground. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accumulation of tree leaf litter and its nutrient content as well as the composition of fauna in the soil-litter layer in two Agro-Forestry Systems (AFS-1 and AFS-2), using as reference an area of secondary Forest (SF), in the Quilombola do Campinho da Independencia community, Paraty, in the state of Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Brazil. The collection of accumulated leaf litter and soil-litter fauna was carried out from four sample points in each area and at two different seasons of the year, the rainy and the dry season. The leaf litter stock and its nutrient content (Ca, Mg, P, K and N) were measured. The extraction of fauna was carried out according to Tullgren's method, modifying the Berlese funnel. The stock of accumulated leaf litter differed between the two areas only in the rainy season; the amounts were smaller in AFS-2. In general, the Agro-Forestry Systems were very similar to the secondary forest in terms of levels and/or stock of nutrients in the majority of cases, at least in one of the seasons studied. The composition of the soil fauna groups in the Agro-Forestry System (AFS-1 and AFS-2) had a high degree of similarity to that found in the forest, and these systems mainly favour the populations of groups like Collembola and Formicidae.

TI  - Use of local ecological knowledge as phenology indicator in native food species in the semiarid region of Northeast Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Phenological studies that aggregate local ecological knowledge on the expression of phenophases may be useful in the elaboration of management strategies of species that are important to a given local system. In this study, we seek to answer the following questions: 1) How do the different phenophases of two important native food species are expressed in the three phytophysiognomies of the Cerrado (Brazilian savannah) where they are collected? 2) How does rainfall influence the expression of the phenophases of these species on the evaluated phytophysiognomies? 3) Does the local ecological knowledge of the residents of the Araripe National Forest (hereafter FLONA) on the phenophases of native species of high importance correspond to what occurs in the three phytophysiognomies of the Cerrado? The phenological monitoring was executed monthly from January 2012 to December 2013. In order to retrieve the local knowledge about phenophases, key informants from three communities located around the FLONA were selected. Rainfall is a limiting factor for the expression of the reproductive phenophases of Caryocar coriaceum, differently from what occurs for the vegetative phases and for Hancornia speciosa. There were no significant differences between the local knowledge of communities that collect resources in the forest and most of the data collected in the phenological evaluation. In addition, there was no difference in the expression of the phenophases among the three phytophysiognomies, also corroborating with the local ecological knowledge. As for the community that collects in agroforestry yards, there were significant differences between knowledge and expression of phenophases. Thus, the use of local ecological knowledge of people who collect resources in the forest has proved to be reliable and may be promising mainly in rapid diagnoses of biodiversity.

TI  - Predatory beetles in cacao agroforestry systems in Brazilian Atlantic forest: a test of the natural enemy hypothesis
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - The natural enemy hypothesis predicts a positive correlation between plant species diversity and natural enemy control. This study aimed to evaluate the role of traditional cacao agroforests, known as "cabrucas," on the conservation of the predatory beetle community compared to that of monodominant rubber agroforests. Predatory beetles were sampled in three habitats in Southeastern Bahia, Brazil: cabrucas and rubber agroforests and native Atlantic forests. In each habitat, 18 10 m(2) plots were established, in which canopy cover was measured and beetles were sampled with a modified Malaise/window trap. Land use intensification did not affect the composition of predatory beetles, with the presence of widely distributed species that are also capable of colonizing simpler environments such as the rubber agroforest. Canopy cover had a positive effect on generalist predator diversity and we observed a reduction in the abundance and species richness of generalist predators with increasing habitat homogenization. Despite the simplified structure of the habitat, the remaining tree diversity and canopy cover in cabrucas supported a community of generalist predators similar to the one found in the native forest. Species diversity of bark beetle predators was higher in cabrucas, which may be due to the high diversity of bark beetles and the favorable abiotic conditions, whereas the low abundance of prey in the native forest and severe abiotic conditions in the rubber agroforest probably determined the lower diversity of generalist predators in these habitats. Cabrucas play an important role in the conservation, supporting a community of predatory beetles more similar to the one found in native forest and that is more effective at controlling populations of herbivores than in homogeneous rubber agroforests.

TI  - Influence of land use on the trophic niche overlap of dung beetles in the semideciduous Atlantic forest of Argentina
T2  - INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY
AB  - The degradation and replacement of natural ecosystems affect species abundance, diversity and interspecific interaction through the modification of resource availability and environmental conditions. Land uses preserving the forest canopy show higher species richness and similarity to the native forest. In this study, we explored changes in the trophic niche overlap of dung beetles between the native forest and different land uses in the semideciduous Atlantic forest, under the hypothesis that trophic niche overlap increases with species richness. We sampled dung beetles in protected native forests and four land uses (pine plantations, agroforestry parklands, silvo-pastoral systems and open pastures), using seven potential food sources (monkey, feline, tapir and deer dung, decomposing fruit, decomposing fungi and carrion). The species richness of each habitat, the trophic niche overlap and the relation between both measures were analysed. Also, we explored species trophic preferences in each habitat to explain and discuss the results obtained in trophic niche overlap measures. As expected, our results showed a positive relation between species richness and trophic niche overlap. Moreover, the addition of different resources in open habitats did not increase species richness, suggesting that resource availability may not be the main mechanism explaining the empoverished dung beetle community observed in open habitats. Other mechanisms, such as physiological restrictions, may play a role in limiting the use of these habitats. Studies on the mechanisms leading to the patterns of species abundance and diversity observed in land uses are necessary to propose management recommendations that increase the sustainability of open habitats.

TI  - A socio-eco-efficiency analysis of integrated and non-integrated crop-livestock-forestry systems in the Brazilian Cerrado based on LCA
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Crop-livestock-forest (CLFi) and crop-livestock (CLi) systems are among the most recent agricultural developments in Brazil, and aligned with the principles of cleaner production. Such integrated systems can provide at least three types of product from the same land area over a defined period. This paper presents a holistic sustainability evaluation using life cycle assessment to compare combinations of integrated and conventional systems in the Brazilian Cerrado region. The study assesses a comprehensive set of indicators in the three sustainability dimensions: environmental, economic, and social (socio-eco-efficiency). By prioritizing CLFi, the production area to meet the demand of grains, meat and energy for 500 Brazilians, from 2007 to 2014, reached 70 ha, while the conventional systems would need 420 ha to meet the same demand. This result shows that it is possible to increase production to meet the growing food global demand without the need of expanding the agricultural frontier, preserving the remaining forestland. CLFi combinations systems decreased 55% in climate change potential (2389 t of CO2 equivalent), when compared to the conventional systems. It was also observed that the more integrated systems improved the quality of employment, promoted future generation investments in society, and decreased the total production costs in 54%, when compared to conventional systems. Therefore, intensification achieved through good practices such as association, rotation, and succession by an agroforestry system, optimization of inputs (including water, energy, fertilizers, and crop protection agents), land use, soil quality, biodiversity and social aspects.

TI  - Food plants and landscapes: use and conservation in Sertao do Ubatumirim, Ubatuba, Brazil
T2  - DESENVOLVIMENTO E MEIO AMBIENTE
AB  - The management of food plants by traditional communities is crucial for biodiversity conservation, especially in locations where the unique biota has a high level of endemism. There are many factors responsible for changes on the local landscape during the years of 1966 to 2011. We discuss how protected areas (Picinguaba Nucleus of the Serra do Mar State Park and Bocaina National Park) and the traditional smallholder farmers' (caicaras) management affected this scenario. We assume that continuous and in situ use of food plants are key factors for maintaining local biodiversity and we point out other drivers acting on this socioecological system, which is analyzed on this research. We collected data through participant observation, questionnaires and interviews. We used geoprocessing tools for linking landscape distinction emic criteria with phytosociological aspects, forest cover and diversity. These factors indicate that caicara farmers should have a voice in decisions related to biodiversity conservation in both parks.

TI  - What Makes Agroforestry a Potential Restoration Measure in a Degraded Conservation Forest?
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Agroforestry is a win-win solution in terms of restoring forest function while benefiting the local community. This research aimed to (1) understand the regulations concerning conservation forest management and the restoration strategies adopted based on the history of forest degradation in the area, (2) investigate the factors driving local people to adopt agroforestry systems in the area, and (3) investigate the characteristics of the agroforestry system developed and its impacts based on farmers' perceptions. This research was performed in Wan Abdul Rachman Grand Forest Park, Lampung Province, Indonesia, and involved 59 respondents who managed 63 agroforestry plots in the area. Several schemes had been implemented to restore the degraded forest without involving the community, and the results were unsatisfactory. Changing the regulations concerning managing conservation forests to involve the community and providing legal permits and support from the management improved forest function due to community willingness to implement the agroforestry system. About 81% of observed plots consisted of 5-12 plant species, and 16% of plots consisted of 13-16 species per plot. Theobroma cacao was the most common species in the agroforestry plots, followed by Durio zibethinus, Parkia speciosa, and Aleurites moluccana. The size of the agroforestry plot affected the number of species in the plot. The community perception demonstrated that agroforestry has positive impacts on livelihood, the environment, and biodiversity at the landscape level.

TI  - AGROFORESTRY AS A SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REGULARIZATION OF RURAL CONSOLIDATED OCCUPATIONS
T2  - CERNE
AB  - The great expectation about the New Forest Code consisted in reducing the hermeneutics distortions and increasing legal certainty for farmers. However, the new legislation raised more uncertainties and discussions, mainly because it consolidates the anthropic use and allows of low-impact activities in areas that should, by law, be kept untouched. This study aimed to survey and to describe the legislation related to protected areas on the rural area (APP and RL), to analyze the consolidated forms of use, occupation and low impact activities that can be developed in these areas, and to propose sustainable technical alternatives for interventions in the areas already consolidated and their recovery. The text is based on literature and documents, elaborated on the survey and study of legal aspects about protected areas in rural properties of Brazil and the main low-impact farming techniques, highlighting the agroforestry systems as an alternative of consolidated occupations in environmental protection areas. The text provides in an organized way the main aspects of the legislation on such areas and describes the sustainable activities allowed in APP and RL according to the flexibility of the new Forest Code.

TI  - Response of the ant assemblage to a gradient of environmental change in the soil-litter interface
T2  - IHERINGIA SERIE ZOOLOGIA
AB  - The present study aimed at assessing the response of the assemblage of ants that nest in the soil-litter interface to a gradient of environmental change. Fieldwork was carried out in three environments under different land use regimes: a forest fragment, an agroforestry system (AFS), and a pasture, all located within the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil. In each environment we marked ten 1-m(2) plots and recorded all ant nests found within them. We recorded 215 nests (103 in the forest, 64 in the AFS, and 48 in the pasture) of 31 species. The cumulative number of species was higher in the forest than in the pasture; the forest and the AFS differed from the pasture, but did not differ from each other. Species composition differed between the forest and the other two environments. The average species richness was high in the forest and low in the pasture. The amount of litter did not explain the differences in species richness among environments. Human activities that reduce vegetation heterogeneity change the composition and reduce the richness of the ant assemblage.

TI  - Land sparing or sharing? Exploring livestock fodder options in combination with land use zoning and consequences for livelihoods and net carbon stocks using the FALLOW model
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Livestock as an integral part of farming systems can increase resource use efficiency and land use intensity of agricultural systems, but can also be a driver of forest conversion and associated greenhouse gas emissions. Forest policies that limit land use options may be able to halt forest change, if strongly enforced, but concurrently may also reduce livestock carrying capacity. This study explored the use of the spatially explicit FALLOW model, with a new livestock module, to assess the impact of land use zoning strategies, in combination with access to fodder harvesting, on welfare, fodder availability and landscape carbon stocks in the Upper Konto catchment, Indonesia. The existing land zoning in Upper Konto catchment is in name 'land-sparing' but de facto combined with 'land sharing' approach with access to cut and carry fodder sources in watershed protection areas. Scenario analysis revealed that the existing land zoning approach is the most promising in terms of balancing fodder availability, farmers' welfare (total profits gained from production in the landscape minus products consumed by people living in the area) and ecosystem functions (with above-ground carbon stocks as indicator). A pure land sparing approach with agricultural intensification indicates increase in farmers' welfare but with a higher decrease (in percentage) of landscape above-ground carbon stocks. Hence, careful integration of livestock systems into zoned conservation areas can achieve multiple goals including enhancing peoples' livelihoods and protecting environmental services.

TI  - Tradeoffs between income, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning during tropical rainforest conversion and agroforestry intensification
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Losses of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning due to rainforest destruction and agricultural intensification are prime concerns for science and society alike. Potentially, ecosystems show nonlinear responses to land-use intensification that would open management options with limited ecological losses but satisfying economic gains. However, multidisciplinary studies to quantify ecological losses and socioeconomic tradeoffs under different management options are rare. Here, we evaluate opposing land use strategies in cacao agroforestry in Sulawesi, Indonesia, by using data on species richness of nine plant and animal taxa, six related ecosystem functions, and on socioeconomic drivers of agroforestry expansion. Expansion of cacao cultivation by 230% in the last two decades was triggered not only by economic market mechanisms, but also by rarely considered cultural factors. Transformation from near-primary forest to agroforestry had little effect on overall species richness, but reduced plant biomass and carbon storage by approximate to 75% and species richness of forest-using species by approximate to 60%. In contrast, increased land use intensity in cacao agroforestry, coupled with a reduction in shade tree cover from 80% to 40%, caused only minor quantitative changes in biodiversity and maintained high levels of ecosystem functioning while doubling farmers' net income. However, unshaded systems further increased income by approximate to 40%, implying that current economic incentives and cultural preferences for new intensification practices put shaded systems at risk. We conclude that low-shade agroforestry provides the best available compromise between economic forces and ecological needs. Certification schemes for shade-grown crops may provide a market-based mechanism to slow down current intensification trends.

TI  - Tropical rainforest conversion and land use intensification reduce understorey plant phylogenetic diversity
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Conversion of rainforest into agricultural land affects multiple facets of tropical plant diversity. While the effects of tropical land use change and intensification on species diversity are comparatively well studied, the effects on phylogenetic diversity (PD) and structure of plant communities are largely unknown. Furthermore, it is not clear how the loss of native species and addition of alien species collectively affect PD and structure.
   2. We investigated the PD and structure of understorey plants; a diverse and ecologically important, yet poorly studied group. We studied four prominent land use systems (tropical lowland rainforest, jungle rubber agroforest, rubber plantations, and oil palm plantations) in the lowlands of Sumatra (Indonesia), a region experiencing dramatic land use changes.
   3. Across the four systems, we investigated differences in four metrics of phylogenetic community structure (PD, mean pairwise distance, mean nearest taxon distance, and their abundance-weighted variants). Our analyses were based on a comprehensive vegetation survey consisting of 32 plots, 1,197 species of vascular plants, and 146,599 plant individuals.
   4. Our results showed that forest conversion into agricultural systems leads to a pronounced loss of PD. Furthermore, the standardized effect size of mean pairwise distance indicated a gradual change from clustered to overdispersed phylogenetic community structure with increasing land use intensity from forest over jungle rubber to the monoculture plantations. In most land use systems, the presence or absence of alien plant species did not affect phylogenetic structure. Only in oil palm plantations, removing alien species from the data led to a more overdispersed structure. In conclusion, conserving the PD and structure requires efficient protection of the last remaining rainforests.

AB  - We analysed species diversity of epiphytic bryophytes in different land use types in tropical America (Bolivia, Ecuador Costa Rica) and Indonesia (Sulawesi) including natural rain forests secondary rain forests fallows, isolated pasture trees and cacao agroforests Changes in species richness from the natural forest towards the modified habitats varied greatly from 0-10% species loss in old secondary forest to 65-80 % in young fallows and cacao agroforest Species turnover was more constant with forest species losses varying from 30-40% in old regenerating forests to 75% in fallows and cacao agroforests The low percentage of forest species in cacao agroforest suggests that these agroforests are of minor conservation importance for bryophytes In contrast remnant forest trees in pastures are a rich habitat for bryophytes and may play an important role in then conservation in ale is where the rain forest has been converted Life forms proportions were considerably affected by land use change in submontane forest areas but not at higher montane elevation As expected shade epiphytes were replaced by sun epiphytes in the drier landuse types Canopy closure, microclimate and host tree characteristics were identified as principal drivers of epiphytic bryophyte diversity in the different land use types The results support the notion that preservation of canopy cover is crucial to the conservation of tropical rain forest biodiversity The results also confirmed that recovery of bryophyte diversity in regenerating tropical rain forest following clear cutting is a very slow process and may take more than one hunched years

TI  - A whole-ecosystem method for experimentally suppressing ants on a small scale
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Ant suppression experiments have emerged as a powerful method for assessing the role of ants in ecosystems. However, traditional methods have been limited to canopy ants, and not assessed the role of ants on and below ground. Recent advances have enabled whole-ecosystem ant suppression in large plots, but large-scale experiments are not always feasible. Here, we develop a small-scale, whole-ecosystem suppression method. We compare techniques for monitoring suppression experiments, and assess whether habitat complexity in oil palm influences our method's effectiveness. We conducted ant suppression experiments in oil palm agroforestry in Sumatra, Indonesia. We used targeted poison baits, a physical barrier and canopy isolation to suppress ants in 4 m radius arenas around single palms. We sequentially tested three suppression methods that increased in intensity over 18 months. We sampled ant abundance before and after suppression by fogging, using pitfall traps and extracting soil monoliths. We also monitored ants throughout the experiment by baiting. We tested the soil for residual poison and monitored other invertebrates (Araneae, Coleoptera, Orthoptera and Chilopoda) to test for cross-contamination. Plots were established under four oil palm management treatments that varied in their habitat complexity: reduced, intermediate and high understorey complexity treatments in mature plantation, and a recently replanted plantation. Post-treatment ant abundance was 92% lower in suppression than control plots. Only the most intensive suppression method, which ran for the final 9 months, worked. Baiting rarely reflected the other monitoring methods. The treatment negatively affected Orthoptera, but not other taxa. There was no residual poison in the soil. Coleoptera abundance increased in suppression plots post-treatment, potentially due to reduced competition with ants. Our findings were consistent across management treatments. We developed a whole-ecosystem method for suppressing ants on a small scale in oil palm plantations. Our method represents a significant advance; previous reductions in ant abundance have not exceeded 38%. We provide the first example of ants being experimentally suppressed belowground. Baiting alone is not adequate for assessing suppression effectiveness, and testing a range of taxa for confounding impacts is important. Our study can act as a blueprint for developing suppression methods for other taxa, which offer unique insights into community ecology.

TI  - The invasive Yellow Crazy Ant and the decline of forest ant diversity in Indonesian cacao agroforests
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB  - Throughout the tropics, agroforests are often the only remaining habitat with a considerable tree cover. Agroforestry systems can support high numbers of species and are therefore frequently heralded as the future for tropical biodiversity conservation. However, anthropogenic habitat modification can facilitate species invasions that may suppress native fauna. We compared the ant fauna of lower canopy trees in natural rainforest sites with that of cacao trees in agroforests in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia in order to assess the effects of agroforestry on occurrence of the Yellow Crazy Ant Anoplolepis gracilipes, a common invasive species in the area, and its effects on overall ant richness. The agroforests differed in the type of shade-tree composition, tree density, canopy cover, and distance to the village. On average, 43% of the species in agroforests also occurred in the lower canopy of nearby primary forest and the number of forest ant species that occurred on cacao trees was not related to agroforestry characteristics. However, A. gracilipes was the most common non-forest ant species, and forest ant richness decreased significantly with the presence of this species. Our results indicate that agroforestry may have promoted the occurrence of A. gracilipes, possibly because tree management in agroforests negatively affects ant species that depend on trees for nesting and foraging, whereas A. gracilipes is a generalist when it comes to nesting sites and food preference. Thus, agroforestry management that includes the thinning of tree stands can facilitate ant invasions, thereby threatening the potential of cultivated land for the conservation of tropical ant diversity.

TI  - Drone-Based Assessment of Canopy Cover for Analyzing Tree Mortality in an Oil Palm Agroforest
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Oil palm monocultures are highly productive, but there are widespread negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Some of these negative impacts might be mitigated by mixed-species tree interplanting to create agroforestry systems, but there is little experience with the performance of trees planted in oil palm plantations. We studied a biodiversity enrichment experiment in the lowlands of Sumatra that was established in a 6- to 12-year-old oil palm plantation by planting six tree species in different mixtures on 48 plots. Three years after tree planting, canopy cover was assessed by drone-based photogrammetry using the structure-from-motion technique. Drone-derived canopy cover estimates were highly correlated with traditional ground-based hemispherical photography along the equality line, indicating the usefulness and comparability of the approach. Canopy cover was further partitioned between oil palm and tree canopies. Thinning of oil palms before tree planting created a more open and heterogeneous canopy cover. Oil palm canopy cover was then extracted at the level of oil palms and individual trees and combined with ground-based mortality assessment for all 3,819 planted trees. For three tree species (Archidendron pauciflorum, Durio zibethinus, and Shorea leprosula), the probability of mortality during the year of the study was dependent on the amount of oil palm canopy cover. We regard the drone-based method for deriving and partitioning spatially explicit information as a promising way for many questions addressing canopy cover in ecological applications and the management of agroforestry systems.

TI  - RUBBER TREE INTERCROPPING WITH FOOD-CROPS, PERENNIAL, FRUIT AND TREE CROPS: SEVERAL EXAMPLES IN ASIA, AFRICA AND AMERICA
T2  - BOIS ET FORETS DES TROPIQUES
AB  - Initially developed by the Estate sector at the beginning of the century, most rubber tree plantings are from the smallholder sector. The initial model of diffusion was based on a strict monoculture. However, intercropping with annual food crops during the immature period of rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis, are relatively well developed, including in rubber projects. On the other hand, the associations with perennial or forestry crops are rarely listed and often with little recognition from development institutions as it was the case in Indonesia during the 1990's. Such systems do exist locally, sometimes on a relatively important area such as the "jungle rubber" system for example. These agroforestry practices ensure a better land and tabour valorization. Permanent associations with perennial crops during mature period constitute an economic factor of stabilization and diversification of income. The complex agroforestry systems have also ecological advantages guaranteeing maintenance of a part of forest biodiversity. The lack of interest officially recognized for these associations in spite of economic and environmental advantages can be charged to the fact that such systems do not correspond to the dominating Estate and development projects rubber tree model. Many farmers innovated and developed pragmatic systems with agroforestry practices enabling them to decrease risks and to diversify their productions. This article tends to give a progress report on existing associations of rubber tree with food crops, coffee, tea, cocoa, rattan, fruit and timber trees or other forest species. It does not claim to analyze all systems in detail but provide an idea of the diversity of associations.

TI  - Diseases and insect pests challenge to meet wood production demand of Tectona grandis (L.), a high-value tropical tree species
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION
AB  - Tectona grandis L. (teak) is one of the cherished heritage tropical hardwood species that belongs to the Lamiaceae family. It is a large deciduous tree native to India, Myanmar and Thailand. The natural populations of teak remain an important source from the economic, ecological and environmental perspectives. Teak timber is well known for its quality in terms of durability and market value. It is naturally resistant to various biotic stress components due to the presence of tectoquinone, lapachol and deoxy lapachol; however, it takes a minimum of 20-25 years for the production of marketable wood to fetch high returns. This long haul provides sufficient time for pests and diseases to feast upon teak at various growth stages starting from nursery to timber mills which leads to a downturn in timber production. To meet the rising demand from wood industries, it is essential to manage the health of the teak plantation outside forests. The reports of new pests and diseases on teak escalated since 2010, especially from countries like Brazil and Mexico where we witness recent rise in commercial teak forests, and this vulnerability emphasizes the deployment of protection measures right from the supply of quality planting material. The update on the biotic factors comprising insect pests, fungal and bacterial infections, which are currently limiting teak wood production, will supplement the efforts involved in quality planting material production. Identification of plus trees with genetic resistance, molecular characterization and monitoring of pests and diseases on teak harnessing the recent developments in plant protection, along with the research on development of the package of practices for teak nurseries and plantation management, will only sustain teak production in near future.

TI  - The earthworm fauna of regenerating forests and anthropogenic habitats in the coastal region of Parana
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate abundance, biomass and diversity of earthworms in the southern coast region of the Mata Atlantica biodiversity hotspot. A total of 51 study sites in pastures, banana monocultures, mixed agroforestry systems, secondary forests in succession and old-growth forests near the coast of Parana, Brazil, were evaluated. Each site was sampled once. Species richness of the earthworms was generally low and varied little between sites. At all sites except for one, the peregrine species Pontoscolex corethrurus (Glossoscolecidae) strongly dominated. Three other peregrine species, Amynthas corticis, Amynthas gracilis (Megascolecidae) and Ocnerodrilus occidentalis (Ocnerodrilidae), were frequent in moist sites. No autochthonous species were found. Abundance and biomass of earthworms varied strongly within and between sites (0-338 individuals m(-2), 0-96 g m(-2) fresh weight). Pastures had significantly lower abundance than all other sites. The forest sites had similar earthworm abundance and biomass, with a tendency to be higher in younger succession stages. The coastal plain region has been strongly altered by human activities. Reasons for the lack of any autochthonous species and the dominance of one peregrine species require further investigation.

TI  - Trends in Agroforestry Research from 1993 to 2022: A Topic Model Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and HJ-Biplot
T2  - MATHEMATICS
AB  - Background: There is an immense debate about the factors that could limit the adoption of agroforestry systems. However, one of the most important is the generation of scientific information that supports the viability and benefits of the proposed techniques. Statistical analysis: This work used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modeling method to identify and interpret scientific information on topics in relation to existing categories in a set of documents. It also used the HJ-Biplot method to determine the relationship between the analyzed topics, taking into consideration the years under study. Results: A review of the literature was conducted in this study and a total of 9794 abstracts of scientific articles published between 1993 and 2022 were obtained. The United States, India, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and Germany were the five countries that published the largest number of studies about agroforestry, particularly soil organic carbon, which was the most studied case. The five more frequently studied topics were: soil organic carbon, adoption of agroforestry practices, biodiversity, climatic change global policies, and carbon and climatic change. Conclusion: the LDA and HJ-Biplot statistical methods are useful tools for determining topicality in text analysis in agroforestry and related topics.

TI  - Effects of shade cocoa plantation on artificial fruit consumption by birds in two contrasting landscapes in Southern Bahia, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - To investigate the influence of forests and agroforestry systems on fruit consumption by birds, we studied two landscapes, one covered predominantly with forests and the other dominated by traditional shade cocoa plantations. In each landscape, we sampled three forest fragments and three shade cocoa plantations. We placed 15 artificial fruits in 25, 1-2-m-tall shrubs spaced every 50 m and evaluated the detection and consumption of fruits after 72 h. We used hemispherical photographs positioned above each fruit station to evaluate canopy openness. We found a statistically significant difference in fruit consumption between landscapes, which means that more fruits were detected and consumed in the forest-dominated landscape. However, forests and shade cocoa plantations within each landscape exhibited similar fruit consumption. Canopy openness was similar between the landscapes, however, the cocoa plantations exhibited greater canopy openness than forests. The results of this study reinforce the importance of the presence of forests in the agricultural landscape. Thus, to evaluate the capacity of agroforest to protect species and maintain ecological interactions it is also necessary to consider the landscape context.

TI  - Effects of habitat management on different feeding guilds of herbivorous insects in cacao agroforestry systems
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - Human pressure on natural habitats increases the importance of agroforests for biodiversity conservation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of cacao traditional cultivation system (CTCS) on the conservation of the herbivorous insect community when compared with a monodominant rubber agroforest, a type of agricultural system for cacao cultivation. The insects were sampled in three habitats in Southeastern Bahia, Brazil: native forests, CTCS and rubber agroforests. In each habitat, 18 plots of 10 m(2) were established, and the structural measures were collected and herbivorous insects were sampled with a Malaise/window trap. The diversity of folivorous decreased with the simplification of vegetation structure, but species composition was similar among habitats. In addition to a decrease in the availability of resources in monodominant rubber agroforests, the latex present in these systems have limited the occurrence of species that cannot circumvent latex toxicity. The diversity of sap-sucking insects was similar among habitats, but species composition was similar only in the CTCS and native forest, and it was different in the rubber agroforest. We observed turnover and a higher frequency of individuals of the family Psyllidae in the rubber agroforest. The biology and behavior of Psyllids and absence of natural enemies enable their diversity to increase when they are adapted to a new host. We observed a shift in the composition of xylophagous insects in the rubber agroforest compared to that in other habitats. Moreover, this agroforest has low species richness, but high individual abundance. Latex extraction is likely an important additional source of volatile compounds discharged into the environment, and it increases the attraction and recruitment of coleoborers to these sites. We concluded that CTCS has an herbivorous insect community with a structure similar to the community found in native forests of the region, and they present a more interesting conservation strategy when compared to rubber agroforests. We also emphasized the potential risk of local pest outbreaks in rubber agroforests for both the rubber and associated cacao trees.

TI  - Ethnobotany of the Kombong Agroforestry System and Tongkonan Conservation in the Toraja Tribe, South Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - FOREST AND SOCIETY
AB  - The Kombong agroforestry system (KAS) has long been practiced and plays an important role in the livelihoods of the Toraja trib & eacute;s settlements, in addition to their social, cultural, and environmental sustainability. This research aims to explain the species composition and wood volume, how the utilization of plant species in the KAS has social, cultural, economic, and ecological functions, analyze the plant cultural significance of KAS of the Toraja tribe, the role of KAS for the conservation of Tongkonan Traditional Houses (TTHs) and KAS in preserving the Rambu Tuka' and Rambu Solo' traditional ceremonies of Toraja tribe. The research used vegetation survey methods and indepth interviews with respondents, which were conducted using a set of guidelines for questionnaires. The research results indicate that there 115 plant species belonging to 49 families. The plant use category high, with foodstuffs and fruit being the use category with the highest number of species. The index of cultural significance (ICS) of the Toraja tribe varies greatly, from very high categories to those whose use is not known. Rice has the highest ICS value, with a score of 130. The KAS and TTHs are closely related and are always found in traditional Toraja settlements. They form a unit that supports each other, and the existence and sustainability of a TTH largely depend on the preservation the KAS. The KAS has a close connection to both the Rambu Solo ' and Rambu Tuka' traditional ceremonies. All plant species needed to build and maintain a TTH and for conducting these two traditional ceremonies found in the KAS. Thus, the KAS is very important for the Toraja tribe because it not only supports the economic and social aspects of their lives but also functions to protect the environment and traditional culture, including preserving the TTH form and the Rambu Solo' and Rambu Tuka' traditional parties.

TI  - Landscape heterogeneity increases bird functional diversity within Neotropical vineyards
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Conversion of lands to agroecosystems has resulted in a decline in bird biodiversity. Analyzing functional diversity is a central tool for detecting changes in the ecological functions performed by birds in these landscapes. This paper aims to investigate the responses of bird taxonomic and functional diversity to landscape heterogeneity and native forest cover in Neotropical vineyards. We sampled 19 vineyard landscapes in southeastern Brazil. These landscapes covered a gradient of forest cover and heterogeneity resulting from various land-uses. To assess bird diversity, we considered both taxonomic diversity and functional diversity (i.e., functional richness, evenness, and divergence). To examine the potential interactions between landscapes and bird assemblages, we employed generalized linear models (GLM). Taxonomic diversity showed no correlation with any landscape metrics. On the other hand, variation in the three metrics of functional diversity was related to landscape heterogeneity. However, in heterogeneous landscapes, these communities can be structured by limiting similarity processes. We highlight the negative impact of landscape homogenization on the ecological functions performed by birds in vineyards, while finding no significant effect on species diversity. These findings can provide valuable support for the formulation of public policies aimed at striking a balance between agricultural production and biodiversity conservation.Abstract in Portuguese is available with online material.
   A conversao global de terras em agroecossistemas resultou em declinio na biodiversidade de aves, e a analise da diversidade funcional e uma ferramenta importante para detectar mudancas nas funcoes ecologicas desempenhadas por aves nesses ambientes. Este artigo tem como objetivos investigar as respostas da diversidade taxonomica e funcional de aves a heterogeneidade da paisagem e a cobertura florestal nativa (Mata Atlantica) em vinhedos neotropicais. Para isso, amostramos 19 paisagens de vinhedos no sudeste do Brasil. Essas paisagens cobriam um gradiente de cobertura florestal e heterogeneidade resultante de diferentes usos da terra. Para avaliar a diversidade de aves, consideramos tanto a diversidade taxonomica quanto a diversidade funcional (ou seja, riqueza funcional, uniformidade funcional e divergencia funcional). Para examinar as interacoes potenciais entre as paisagens e as assembleias de aves, empregamos modelos lineares generalizados (GLM). A diversidade taxonomica nao mostrou correlacao com nenhuma metrica da paisagem. Por outro lado, a variacao nas tres metricas da diversidade funcional foi relacionada a heterogeneidade da paisagem. No entanto, em paisagens heterogeneas, essas comunidades podem ser estruturadas por processos de similaridade limitante. Destacamos o impacto negativo da homogeneizacao da paisagem nas funcoes ecologicas desempenhadas por aves em vinhedos, porem nao encontramos efeito significativo na diversidade de especies. Esses resultados podem fornecer um arcabouco valioso para a formulacao de politicas publicas voltadas para encontrar um equilibrio entre producao agricola e conservacao da biodiversidade.

TI  - Forest conflict mitigation through coffee-based agroforestry provide secure habitat for Javan Slow Lorise in a lowland fragmented forest in Central Java, Indonesia
T2  - 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN AGROFORESTRY (ICAF): ADOPTING MODERN AGROFORESTRY TOWARD SMART SOCIAL FORESTRY PROGRAM
CP  - 3rd International Conference in Agroforestry (ICAF SEANAFE) - Adopting Modern Agroforestry Toward Smart Social Forestry Program
AB  - Java Island has experienced numbers of forest conflict. Consequently, it may contribute to the disturbance of the sustainability of its forest biodiversity and increasing number of local poverty surrounding the forest area. Agroforestry system is known as one of the strategies to mitigate the forest conflict. The system helps the farmers to increase agricultural production, social life, and ecological stability. Local community in Kemuning forest had been implementing coffee- based agroforestry system for a long time, as part of their main income. This system allowed farmers to acces the forest through an intensive interaction between locals and its forest environment. This study aimed to understand the forest conflict mitigation through agroforestry practices in Kemuning forest better, which allegedly become a key factor for the sustainability of the presence of Javan slow lorise. This study builds on the assumption that people frame conflicts on Kemuning forest according to their experiences, expectations, objectives and interests at a specific moment. The basis for our analytical framework is found in theories on framing. In doing so, the study uses the framing analysis theory to identify framing of the conflict by different involved stakeholders. Data were collected in 2018 - 2019 through several techniques such as in depth interview, field observation, and study literatures. Collected data were analyzed descriptively by discussing each finding with framing analysis theory. Findings revealed that conflict in Kemuning forest were triggered by three main issue/problem frames identified as the root causes of the conflicts which are forest security, unfollow the signed contract, and an unequal benefit sharing from the coffee-based agroforestry sector. Other frames: identity, characterization, and conflict management frames were constructed in such a way to reinforce the issue/problem frames. This study also found that related to Javan slow lorise habitat, this coffee-based agroforestry system is the appropriate land use management that provide secure habitat for the sustainability of the presence of the animal within Kemuning forest.

TI  - Is shadier better? The effect of agroforestry management on small mammal diversity
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Agroforestry systems play fundamental roles for wildlife conservation, but are prone to disturbances from management practices aiming at increasing local productivity. This work investigates the small mammal assemblages present in cacao agroforests, which differ in shade tree density. We tested the prediction that higher tree density increases shade level, analyzed how some environmental variables important for small mammals (vegetation complexity, tree basal area, and invertebrate biomass) vary across the shade level gradient, and how the assemblages respond to these variations. We also tested the effect of the environmental variables on the abundance of the three most common species: Rhipidomys mastacalis, Hylaeamys seuanezi, and Marmosa murina. We captured 651 individuals belonging to 18 species. A positive relationship was observed between an abundance of non-forest specialists and tree basal area, while species diversity within this group showed positive association with vegetation complexity. Assemblage structure (described by a matrix of species abundance per site) was not affected by our environmental variables, but R. mastacalis was more abundant in sites with lower vegetation complexity. Higher shade levels in cacao agroforest tended to occur in sites with greater tree basal area, which was not a good predictor of small mammal diversity. This suggests that environmental management to reduce shade with the purpose of increasing cacao productivity is not necessarily negative for small mammal conservation. Species diversity was favored by structurally complex systems, a possible response to greater niche diversity.

TI  - Challenges for agroecological and organic management of Cabruca cocoa agroecosystems in three rural settlements in south Bahia, Brazil: perceptions from local actors
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
CP  - 15th North American Agroforestry Conference
AB  - Cabruca agroforestry systems play a crucial role as ecological corridors in biodiversity conservation on the south coast of Bahia. The decline in these agroecosystems due to land-use changes poses as a major threat to Atlantic Forest biodiversity conservation. Therefore, efficient agricultural extension actions towards the maintenance of these agroforestry systems are paramount. This research evaluated the process of construction and sharing of knowledge in agricultural extension practices toward agroecological management of the Cabruca in three agrarian reform settlements, and the challenges for the persistence of Cabruca in this region. We interviewed seven farmers and three extension agents from the Cabruca Institute. The study showed that most of the proposed practices adopted by farmers were already part of the traditional Cabruca management. The main limitations for the adoption of new practices were that they required increased labor, which is scarce and expensive. In fact, exodus and aging of the rural population remain major threats for long-term sustainability and persistence of Cabruca agroecosystems. Other limitations for organic management include the absence of differentiated price and marketing channels for organic cocoa and other products for the Cabruca social biodiversity. Although the process of construction and sharing of knowledge was participatory, overall community participation in the process was low. Extensionists should devise and implement innovative community engagement strategies to empower these small-scale farmer communities to ensure the persistence of Cabruca in the region and consolidate organic management of Cabruca agroecosystems.

TI  - Climate change threatens native potential agroforestry plant species in Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Climate change is one of the main drivers of species extinction in the twentyfirst-century. Here, we (1) quantify potential changes in species' bioclimatic area of habitat (BAH) of 135 native potential agroforestry species from the Brazilian flora, using two different climate change scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) and dispersal scenarios, where species have no ability to disperse and reach new areas (non-dispersal) and where species can migrate within the estimated BAH (full dispersal) for 2041-2060 and 2061-2080. We then (2) assess the preliminary conservation status of each species based on IUCN criteria. Current and future potential habitats for species were predicted using MaxEnt, a machine-learning algorithm used to estimate species' probability distribution. Future climate is predicted to trigger a mean decline in BAH between 38.5-56.3% under the non-dispersal scenario and between 22.3-41.9% under the full dispersal scenario for 135 native potential agroforestry species. Additionally, we found that only 4.3% of the studied species could be threatened under the IUCN Red List criteria B1 and B2. However, when considering the predicted quantitative habitat loss due to climate change (A3c criterion) the percentages increased between 68.8-84.4% under the non-dispersal scenario and between 40.7-64.4% under the full dispersal scenario. To lessen such threats, we argue that encouraging the use of these species in rural and peri-urban agroecosystems are promising, complementary strategies for their long-term conservation.

TI  - Environmental filtering of agroforestry systems reduces the risk of biological invasion
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Prevention is the most effective way of mitigating the negative impacts of exotic species invasions on biodiversity. Preventative measures include inhibiting the further dispersal and recruitment of established invasive species. We expect coffee production in agroforestry systems to reduce the recruitment of exotic species relative to monoculture stands because intercropped trees function as environmental filters that select for individuals with traits such as shade tolerance. If ecologically similar species are also closely related phylogenetically, such environmental filters should reduce phylogenetic diversity, supporting the coexistence of closely related species. Here, we test whether the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of native and exotic species in agroforestry systems is lower than in monocultures. We sampled the understory in 180 plots distributed in both habitats in three study sites within the Araponga municipality, Brazil, and measured understory light availability. Phylogenetic diversity was calculated as the net relatedness index (NRI) and the nearest taxon index (NTI). Understory light availability was lower in agroforestry systems. Of the 48 species found, 25 occurred in agroforestry systems, three of which were exotics. Forty-two species were found in monoculture stands (including 13 exotics). As expected, NRI and NTI indicated lower phylogenetic diversity in agroforestry systems than in monoculture stands. Agroforestry systems provide less favorable habitats for exotic species, filtering them from the understory. The mechanisms that select against exotic species remain unknown; however, shading might exclude predominantly heliophytic exotic species from the agricultural matrix. Therefore, agroforestry systems may function as buffer zones preventing invasion into sensitive ecosystems.

TI  - Dog invasion in agroforests: The importance of households, roads and dog population size in the surroundings
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Dogs are considered an invasive species, whose presence in natural habitats adversely affects wildlife. We investigate the effects of household and road proximity, and of dog population size in the surroundings on the invasion of cacao agroforest by dogs, and evaluate if dogs raised in the vicinity are more likely to invade agroforests than dogs of unknown origin. The study was conducted in a landscape dominated by agroforests, within the cacao growing region of Southern Bahia, Brazil. Dogs were recorded by cameratraps in 15 agroforest sites, and we identified dogs inhabiting the vicinity of each sampled agroforest site by visiting all households up to 800 m from sampling sites. We obtained 115 photographic records of 47 individuals, and identified 213 dogs inhabiting the site surroundings. The number of individuals and frequency of visit of dogs tend to be higher in agroforests located nearer a household, but were not associated with the distance to the nearest road or the dog population size in the surroundings. The frequency of visits in agroforests did not differ between dogs residing in the surroundings and dogs of unknown origin. Our results indicate that the surroundings are not the main source of dogs invading agroforests, most likely because dogs perform long-distance movements in association to humans. Strategies to reduce the impacts of dogs on wildlife will gain from studies on movement ecology and should include practices to restrict dogs' home range.

TI  - Soil fertility and carbon and nitrogen stocks under agroforestry systems in the Cerrado of Minas Gerais State
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
AB  - Agroforestry systems are used to diversify food production, provide an increase in the biodiversity of fauna and flora as well as the conservation of carbon and nutrients in the soil. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the fertility and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks of the soil after ten years of agroforestry system (SAFs) implantation in the Cerrado biome of Minas Gerais state, Brazil. The study was carried out in the American Agroextractivist Settlement, located in the municipality of Grao Mogol, northern mesoregion of the state of Minas Gerais. Three SAFs and two adjacent native vegetation areas (VNs) were used as reference for the study, which were grouped according to the soil class: Red-Yellow Latosol and Haplic Cambisol. The soil sampling was carried out in March 2013, ten years after the implementation of the SAFs, where composite samples were removed from the 0-5 and 0-20 cm soil depth layers for the evaluation of nutrient contents and apparent density, and in the first layer the soil C and N stocks. SAFs that were deployed with management based on prune trees and maintenance of floristic diversity contributed with the improvement of the soil quality and the maintenance of fertility and C stocks at levels like in native vegetation. On the other hand, the SAF that was implanted with the previous suppression of the native vegetation reduced the tree diversity and, consequently, the C stocks over time. However management with annual crops and the use of legumes contributed to the improvement of soil fertility an to the increase of N contents and stocks.

TI  - Can agroforest woodlots work as stepping stones for birds in the Atlantic forest region?
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - In fragmented landscapes, agroforest woodlots can potentially act as stepping stones facilitating movement between forest fragments. We assessed the influence of agroforest woodlots on bird distribution and diversity in the Atlantic forest region (SE Brazil), and also tested which categories of species can use different types of connection elements, and whether this use is influenced by the distance to large forest patches. We studied two fragmented landscapes, with and without stepping stones linking large fragments, and one forested landscape. Using a point count, a bird survey was undertaken in the fragmented landscapes in five different elements: large remnants (> 400 ha), agroforest woodlots (0.4-1.1 ha), small patches (0.5-7 ha), riparian corridor, and pasture areas (the main matrix). Generalist and open-area species were commonly observed in the agroforest system or other connection elements, whereas only a few forest species were present in these connections. For the latter species, the distance of woodlots to large patches was essential to determine their richness and abundance. Based on our results and data from literature, we suggest that there is an optimal relationship between the permeability of the matrix and the efficiency of stepping stones, which occurs at intermediate degrees of matrix resistance, and is species-dependent. Because the presence of agroforest system favors a higher richness of generalist species, they appeared to be more advantageous for conservation than the monoculture system; for this reason, they should be considered as a management alternative, particularly when the matrix permeability requirement is met.

TI  - Mimosa scabrella BENTH. (FABACEAE) ENHANCES THE RESTORATION IN COAL MINING AREAS IN THE ATLANTIC RAINFOREST
T2  - CERNE
AB  - A Pilot Reclamation Project (PRP) was developed in 1982 by the Environmental Protection Agency of the State of Santa Catarina-Brazil, with the objective to evaluating the adaptation of woody species to a land degraded by coal mining. After a full topographic reconstitution of the landscape, addition of nutrient load and sowing of herbaceous species, the area was split into 12 plots in which seedlings of 12 tree species were planted: three native trees [Bastardiopsis densiflora (Hook. & Arn.) Hassl., Mimosa scabrella Benth., Schizolobium parahyba (Vell.) Blake] and nine exotic species [Eucalyptus saligna Sm., E. viminalis Labill., E. citriodora Hook., Grevillea hilliana F.Muell., Hovenia dulcis Thunb, Melia azedarach L., Pinus elliottii Engelm., P. taeda L., Syzygium cumini (L.) Skeels]. After 22 years, from the beginning of the PRP, the exotic species presented higher percentage of survival than native species; the plots which received either B. densiflora and S. parahyba or were covered only with herbaceous vegetation associated with solely a few shrubs. Conversely, the plots which received seedlings of M. scabrella displayed clear evidence of restoration in progress. The study conducted in plots that have received M. scabrella indicate an improvement of nutrient load (N, K, organic matter) in the substrate, a diversified composition of tree coverage (very similar to the nearby remnants of the Atlantic Rainforest) and other life forms, with prominent establishment of native trees with predominance of zoophilous and zoochorous species. Some characteristics of M. scabrella that could explain its outstanding capacity to enhance the restoration of the Atlantic Rainforest are also discussed along this paper.

TI  - POEMA: A proposal for sustainable development in Amazonia
T2  - THIRD MILLENNIUM FOR HUMANITY?: THE SEARCH FOR PATHS OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
CP  - Forum Belem I on a 3rd Millennium for Humanity - The Search for Paths of Sustainable Development
AB  - The living conditions of the majority of the Amazonian population are sharply contrasted by the natural wealth of this region. The state of poverty is characterised by severe nutritional deficiencies, absence of basic needs such as safe drinking water, sanitation, education and health, and low levels of income. The precarious survival situation of both the rural and urban poor leads to a strong human impact on the natural resources of the Amazon region. A protection of Amazonian ecosystems is only possible when strategies are elaborated which substantially improve the living conditions of the poor classes. This is the background of the programme Poverty and Environment in Amazonia (POEMA), initiated by an interdisciplinary research group of the Federal University of Pari at Belem, Brazil. In an integrated and participatory approach, POEMA elaborated activities in various sectors such as basic sanitation, health and education, agroforestry, renewable energy, processing of non-timber forest products and advisory support. Activities were started in close co-operation with several pilot communities throughout Para at municipal level. The main focus was set on basic sanitation and development of a sustainable land use system, based on agroforestry (multi-storey agriculture). Also value-adding and processing of raw materials was considered. All activities were evaluated by the participating communities and thus adapted to the local needs. Meanwhile, an infrastructure for supplying water treatment kits and processing of non-timber forest products for industrial use is established. POEMA nevertheless gives only a glimpse of hope for the survival of Amazonian ecosystems. There is still a lack of political decisions for appropriate and well-defined investments which enable actors to take advantage of a sustainable use of the region's biodiversity.

TI  - Insect diversity responses to forest conversion and agroforestry management
T2  - STABILITY OF TROPICAL RAINFOREST MARGINS: LINKING ECOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONSTRAINTS OF LAND USE AND CONSERVATION
CP  - International Symposium on Stability of Tropical Rainforest Margins
AB  - The ongoing loss of pristine tropical rainforests increases the potential importance of agroforestry systems for the conservation of tropical arthropod diversity. Shaded agroforestry systems can still support high levels of biodiversity, even resembling those supported by undisturbed forests, but intensively managed open agroforestry systems may cause severe losses in insect diversity. In this study we evaluate the conservation value of agroforestry systems for species richness and diversity (Simpson's index) of four insect groups at natural forest sites and three different types of cacao-dominated agroforestry systems in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. The agroforestry systems were characterised by low, intermediate and high diversity of shade trees. Each habitat type was studied with 4 replicates, i.e. 16 study sites altogether. We compared responses of solitary bees and wasps, dung beetles and lower canopy dwelling beetles and ants. These taxa represent diverse and functionally important insect groups: solitary bees and wasps act as crop pollinators or pest predators, dung beetles as decomposers of mammalian excrements and canopy dwelling beetles and ants include abundant herbivores and predators. High percentages of forest species did not occur in agroforestry systems, but diversity and species richness in agroforests remained as high as or even higher than in the forest lower canopy. Diversity, species richness and abundance of the functionally important dung beetles and canopy ants showed strong resilience against both forest conversion and changes in agroforestry management. Diversity, species. richness and abundance of solitary bees and wasps as well as canopy beetles even seemed to profit from the effects of opening the upper canopy that was related to forest conversion and changes in shade tree compositions. On the latter two groups the effects of opening the upper canopy were stronger than effects of reduced shade tree richness. Based on our results, we recommend the inclusion of agroforestry systems with a diversity of shade trees in tropical conservation plans in addition to pristine forest reserves. Furthermore, regional differences in local agroforestry management contributed to between 31% (for dung beetles) and 58% (for canopy beetles) of the total species richness, which stresses the importance of conservation policies aimed at a diversity of habitat types on a broader landscape scale.

CP  - 3rd International Conference in Agroforestry (ICAF SEANAFE) - Adopting Modern Agroforestry Toward Smart Social Forestry Program
AB  - Although human intervention remains high,a shade-grown coffee agroforestry in Kemuning, Central Java still have important roles for biodiversity conservation. Among various fauna, the Javan slow loris (Nycticebus javanicus), a critically endangered species, can survive in this agroforestry system. The use of spatial method on shade-grown coffee agroforestry seems unusual. We aim to investigate the utilization of tree and other vegetation by Javan slow lorises in a shade-grown coffee agroforestry ecosystem in Kemuning Forest. We followed two individuals (male and female) of slow lorises from December 2018 until May 2019 using radio collar. We recorded both vertical and horizontal positions of each individual based on their position on trees at two spatial dimensions (vertical and horizontal). To explore whether lorises select certain tree species, we laid 275 plots (20x20m) in their habitat and using Chi-square test for the analysis. Our findings show that both male and female of Javan slow loris in shade-grown coffee agroforestry use different forest stratum for their activity. The female used 42.11% of their time to do exploratory activity in the outer part of the canopy, regardless the vertical position, and 43.76% in the middle part (vertical position) and the outer part (horizontal position) of the canopy. While the male mostly uses the inner part of the canopy (52.57%) and upper part of the canopy for feeding activity (64.37%). Both male (Chi-square test = 264.05, p < 0.05) and female (Chi-square test = 357.35, p < 0.05) lorises select tree species for their behavior. We provide here evidence of biodiversity conservation services by shade-grown coffee agroforestry practices in Indonesia. The intensity of coffee management under tropical trees seems does not impact significantly to the presence and behavior of slow loris, however precautionary measures to reduce poaching should be done as this endangered species threatened by illegal activity. Benefivial values from managing shade-grown coffee agroforestry for generating income for locals such as wildlife-friendly coffee production can also be alternative hand in hand to reduce poaching.

TI  - Tree species richness and density affect parasitoid diversity in cacao agroforestry
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - In Brazil, cacao is mostly planted beneath shade trees. The diversity of shade trees varies from monospecific to highly diverse canopies, characteristic of pristine Atlantic Forest. This study evaluates the relationships between family richness of Hymenoptera-Parasitica and Chrysidoidea, and tree species richness and density, the species richness of herbaceous understorey, and the area and age of the cacao agroforestry system. We sampled 16 cacao agroforestry systems, with canopy diversity ranging from one to 22 tree species per hectare, in three seasons: summer (March), winter (August) and spring (November). Parasitoids were sampled using eight Malaise-Townes traps per site. Tree species richness and density were enumerated within 1 ha at each site, and herbaceous plant species richness was calculated in eight 1 m 2 plots, within the hectare. The number of parasitoid families increased with tree species richness and density in spring and summer, but decreased in winter. Neither species richness of herbaceous plants nor area and age of the system affected parasitoid family richness. We suggest that the increase of parasitoid diversity with tree species richness and density in warmer seasons reflects increasing heterogeneity and availabitity of resources. The decrease in parasitoid family number with tree density in winter may be due to local impoverishment of resources, leading to parasitoid emigration to neighbouring forest remnants. This result implies that a higher diversity of shade trees will help to maintain high parasitoid levels and, in consequence, higher levels of natural enemies of cacao pests, particularly in the warmer seasons. This prediction is borne out in the experience of cacao producers. The proper management of shade tree diversity will. play a vital role in maintaining the sustainability of cacao agroforestry production systems in the tropics and, concurrently, will. maintain high biodiversity values in these locations.

TI  - The diversity of soil-dwelling arthropods is significantly influenced by land use systems with tree cover in semiarid conditions
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY
AB  - Seasonal changes in vegetation and climate exert significant influences on soil fauna in natural and agricultural ecosystems. Additionally, evidence indicates that interactions between different plant layers promote soil fauna diversity through the variety of resources available. The objective was to assess the edaphic fauna in traditional land use systems, agroforestry systems and natural vegetation, under the influence of rainfall seasonality and plant strata in the semiarid region of Brazil. For this purpose, six types of land use were selected: agroforestry; silvopastoral; slash and burn with intensive use without fallow; slash and burn with six years of fallow; slash and burn with nine years of fallow; and a system representing the natural vegetation of the Caatinga. Edaphic fauna was collected using pitfall traps in the dry and rainy seasons. A total of 43,363 individuals of the edaphic fauna were collected and grouped into taxa, determining abundance, diversity and functional groups. The results revealed higher abundance and diversity of edaphic fauna in the rainy season across all land use systems, but significantly higher numbers in systems with tree strata. The greater the abundance, richness and diversity of trees, the higher the diversity of edaphic fauna (Shannon Index - H: 0.7 < H- < 1) for the seasonal effect. Agroforestry systems were intermediate in the diversity of edaphic fauna (H- < 0.8) compared to other systems. Systems with greater heterogeneity in tree and herbaceous strata were the ones that most increased the diversity and activity of functional groups of edaphic fauna (H < 0.8; 0.5 < r < 0.9). In semiarid conditions, more attention should be given to agricultural production systems with greater tree diversity and interaction between tree and herbaceous strata to conserve the biodiversity of edaphic fauna and improve the soil health.

TI  - Acca sellowiana: Physical-chemical-sensorial characterization and gastronomic potentialities
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GASTRONOMY AND FOOD SCIENCE
CP  - Gastro-Science-Chef International Symposium (GSC) on Science and Cooking
AB  - The gastronomical use of wild and native foods has gained the attention of chefs around the world in the search for new flavors. To make use of such foods also helps in the preservation of local and native flora. Native plants should be reconsidered throughout their value chain, linking their socio-cultural importance, their health benefits and their economic advantages to local communities. Brazil has the richest flora in the world, with more than 56 thousand species of plants, corresponding to almost 20% of the world flora. The Atlantic Forest biome has around 20,000 plant species. Acca sellowiana is one of the native fruits of the highland region in southern Brazilian and it grows wild in the Atlantic Forest biome. The physical, chemical and sensory characteristics of four different cultivars of feijoa fruits are the focus of this study. In addition, this study evaluated the potential use of feijoa fruits in gastronomy. The oven drying technique and the osmotic dehydration method can provide potential gastronomic products with Acca sellowiana, that can become an important source of income for local families. Sensory analysis and culinary preparations have demonstrated that the wild feijoa fruits, via agroforestry production techniques, have a specific sensory niche since they imparts a "terroir" taste. The Helena feijoa cultivar presents stronger floral, sweet flavors than the other cultivars, and also is the largest in size and has the highest values for total soluble solids and a high pH. This study shows that there is a potential to develop new products with feijoa using the fruit, flower or leaves. The wide array of products developed with feijoa during the study such as chutney, sorbet, compote and spice powder, showed that gastronomy has an important role in maintaining local biodiversity while developing sustainable gastronomical products.

TI  - DINAMICA POPULACIONAL DE Hypothenemus hampei (COLEOPTERA: SCOLYTIDAE) SOB SISTEMA AGROFLORESTAL E MONOCULTIVO DE CAFE CONILON NO SUL DO ESTADO DO AMAZONAS, BRASIL
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
AB  - Hypothenemus hampei is the main coffee pest in the Amazon and worldwide. Although coffee cultivation exists in the State of Amazonas, there is no information regarding the behavior of this species population in this region of Brazil. Since the Amazon region is a favorable environment for H. hampei, the present study aimed to investigate this insect population in the following cultivation systems implanted in the municipality of Humaita, Southern Amazonas: i) coffee in native forest (CNF), ii) coffee intercropped with cupuacu and acai (native Brazilian fruits) (CCA) and iii) coffee in monoculture (MC). Also, the climatic and phenological parameters of the plant were used in relation with the population dynamics of the insect. For that, ten baited traps were installed in each field for the monthly sampling of the H. hampei population from July/2018 to June/2019. The highest population abundance of the insect was observed during the coffee flowering season, mainly in monoculture crops, when compared to the other intercropped fields. The total mean value of the insect population observed in the three environments evaluated was highest in August/2018, with a recorded value of 1749. The increase in rainfall indexes occurred simultaneously with a decrease in the insect population; this coincides with the end of the flowering season (October/2018, 161.8 mm) and the beginning of grain formation (November/2018, 234.8 mm). The lowest abundance of the insect observed in the coffee fields in native forest, with an abundance of 83 (CNF), indicates that the local biodiversity disfavors the population size of the pest in the environment. These results suggest that phenological phases of conilon coffee and the influence of climatic conditions can result in changes in the population dynamics of the H. hampei. Coffee agroforestry systems are more promising to maintain this population at low levels.

TI  - Trophic niche differentiation and utilisation of food resources in Collembola is altered by rainforest conversion to plantation systems
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Intensively managed monoculture plantations are increasingly replacing natural forests across the tropics resulting in changes in ecological niches of species and communities, and in ecosystem functioning. Collembola are among the most abundant arthropods inhabiting the belowground system sensitively responding to changes in vegetation and soil conditions. However, most studies on the response of Collembola to land-use change were conducted in temperate ecosystems and focused on shifts in community composition or morphological traits, while parameters more closely linked to ecosystem functioning, such as trophic niches, received little attention. Here, we used stable isotope analysis (C-13 and N-15) to investigate changes in the trophic structure and use of food resources by Collembola in Jambi province (Sumatra, Indonesia), a region that experienced strong deforestation in the last decades. Isotopic values of Collembola from 32 sites representing four land-use systems were analyzed (rainforest, rubber agroforest, rubber (Hevea brasiliansis) and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) monoculture plantations). Across Collembola species Delta C-13 values were highest in rainforest suggesting more pronounced processing of litter resources by microorganisms and consumption of these microorganisms by Collembola in this system. Lower Delta C-13 values, but high Delta C-13 variation in Collembola in oil palm plantations indicated that Collembola shifted towards herbivory and used more variable resources in this system. Small range in Delta N-15 values in Collembola species in monoculture plantations in comparison to rainforest indicated that conversion of rainforest into plantations is associated with simplification in the trophic structure of Collembola communities. This was further confirmed by generally lower isotopic niche differentiation among species in plantations. Across the studied ecosystems, atmobiotic species (Symphypleona and Paronellidae) occupied the lowest, whereas euedaphic Collembola species occupied the highest trophic position, resembling patterns in temperate forests. Some species of Paronellidae in rainforest and jungle rubber had Delta N-15 values below those of leaf litter suggesting algivory (Salina sp.1, Callyntrura sp.1 and Lepidonella sp.1), while a dominant species, Pseudosinella sp.1, had the highest Delta N-15 values in most of the land-use systems suggesting that this species at least in part lives as predator or scavenger. Overall, the results suggest that rainforest conversion into plantation systems is associated with marked shifts in the structure of trophic niches in soil and litter Collembola with potential consequences for ecosystem functioning and food-web stability.

TI  - Acrocomia spp.: neglected crop, ballyhooed multipurpose palm or fit for the bioeconomy? A review
T2  - AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Acrocomia spp., a genus of wild-growing palms in the neotropics, is rapidly gaining interest as a promising multipurpose crop. Diverse products can be derived from various components of the palm, the oils being of highest interest. Acrocomia shows similar oil yield and fatty acid composition to the African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). It is, however, able to cope with a wider range of environmental conditions, including temporary water scarcity and lower temperatures, thus potentially a more sustainable alternative to its tropical counterpart. Acrocomia's research history is recent compared to other traditional crops and thus knowledge gaps, uncertainty, and challenges need to be addressed. This review attempts to assess the acrocomia's preparedness for cultivation by highlighting the state-of-the-art in research and identifying research gaps. Based on a systematic literature search following a value web approach, it (a) provides a comprehensive overview of research topics, (b) shows the development of publication activities over time and the drivers of this development, and (c) compiles main findings to assess the acrocomia's preparedness for commercial cultivation. Our results confirm its multipurpose characteristic as a potential feedstock for manifold sectors. Research has continued to increase over the last decade, especially on A. aculeata and is driven by the interest in bioenergy. Increasing knowledge on botany has contributed to understanding the genetic diversity and genus-specific biology. This has enabled applied research on seed germination and propagation toward domestication and initial plantation activities, mostly in Brazil. Main research gaps are associated with genotype-environment interaction, planting material, crop management, and sustainable cropping systems. Overall, we conclude that acrocomia is at an early phase of development as an alternative and multipurpose crop and its up-scaling requires the integration of sustainability strategies tailored to location-based social-ecological conditions.

TI  - Crop functional diversity drives multiple ecosystem functions during early agroforestry succession
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - We still lack practical guidelines for diversifying cropping systems that consider both yield and regulating functions of agroecosystems. Recent studies have suggested that maximizing functional diversity (FD, the distribution of species with different functional traits in the niche space) may lead to agroecosystems with greater multifunctionality due to niche complementarity. Therefore, scientists are now advocating the use of a trait-based approach to develop multifunctional sustainable agroecosystems.
   In order to assess the effects of crop FD on key agroecosystem functions and to consider trade-offs and synergies among them, we established, in late 2016, permanent experimental field plots of successional agroforestry systems (SAFS), in humid subtropical Southern Brazil. The experiment represents a gradient of plant functional trait diversity (designed FD based on leaf nitrogen concentration), while maintaining crop species richness constant across all treatments. Our hypothesis is that the observed FD of crops (hereafter, crop FD) drives multiple agroecosystem functions.
   We determined the observed FD by quantifying traits of crops and weeds (maximum plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area) and performed two data collections (March and September 2017) at the end of the summer and winter crops respectively. We used structural equation modelling to test a hypothetical causal model to explain how crop FD affects three functions: weed suppression, soil protection (soil cover by either crops or weeds) and crop yield.
   Our results support the hypothesis that high crop FD drives agroecosystem processes and contributes to the provision of multiple ecosystem functions. We found that with greater crop FD in SAFS, crop plants occupied a large niche space, thereby increasing the total photosynthetic light intercepted in the agroecosystem, that in turn, increased crop yield. Additionally, greater FD increased soil protection by crops and decreased weed cover. This greater FD also reduced the FD of the weed community.
   Synthesis and applications. Crop mixtures based on complementary plant traits can increase the multifunctionality of agroecosystems through their sustainable use. A more heterogeneous structure and projection of crop leaf area drives greater resistance to competition with weeds and produces higher crop yields in young diversified crop mixtures.

TI  - Climate friendliness of cocoa agroforests is compatible with productivity increase
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - There is increasing demand for agricultural commodities that are produced in a climate-friendly manner. At the same time, in many or most tropical countries there is need for intensification of agricultural production to increase yields and incomes, and this usually requires higher external inputs that may cause additional greenhouse gas emissions. Here we investigate if production methods that have a beneficial effect on the climate (are climate-friendly) are compatible with increased inputs and yields for traditional, shaded cocoa (Theobroma cacao) production systems (locally known as cabrucas) in southern Bahia, Brazil. We use two easily measurable and manageable dimensions of climate friendliness, namely the carbon (C) stocks in the large trees and the C footprint as related to on-farm agrochemical and fuel use. Through interviews and field inventories in 26 cabruca farms representing a range of production practices and intensities, we identify the combinations of management practices, yields, C stocks and C footprints typically found in the region. We find that yield levels up to the highest encountered yield of 585 kg ha(-1), or twice the current regional average of 285 kg ha(-1), are compatible with an aboveground C stock in the large shade trees (> 30 cm diameter at breast height) of up to 65 Mg ha(-1) and up to 55 % shade. Higher C stocks and shade levels are generally associated with yields below the regional average. Input-related C emissions increased non-linearly with increasing yield, but even the highest encountered yields were compatible with low (< 0.25 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) of cocoa) to medium (< 0.5 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) of cocoa) input-related emission levels. Cocoa yields responded positively to increased fertilizer applications, provided that other factors, including shade levels, were not limiting. Consequently, the highest input-related emissions (> 1 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) of cocoa) were related to large fertilizer applications that did not proportionately increase yields. We conclude that doubling the cocoa output from southern Bahia, where cabrucas are the predominant form of growing cocoa, is compatible with climate-friendly production practices, measured by local standards. We suggest that the presented methodology can be used to identify opportunities for climate-friendly intensification of tree crops more generally, thereby increasing the contribution of commodity production to global climate change mitigation.
