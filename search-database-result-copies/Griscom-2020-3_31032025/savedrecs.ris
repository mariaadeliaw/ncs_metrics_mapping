TI  - Site and plant community parameters drive the effect of vegetation on litterfall and nutrient inputs in restored tropical forests
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Background and aims Restoring healthy ecosystem depends on recovering not only biodiversity, but also ecosystem processes and functionality. We investigated the effects of tree community parameters and site abiotic conditions on nutrient cycling in restored forests. Methods We assessed litter production and nutrient inputs in five 16-year old restored forests established using different restoration methods and species combinations, i.e. unplanted control (natural regeneration), direct seeding, agroforestry, mixed commercial species plantation (commercial mix), and high-diversity plantation, replicated at two sites that differed in soil fertility. We used adjacent seasonal semideciduous forest remnants as references. Results Restoration treatments with intermediate and high species richness had higher litter and nutrient inputs and did not differ from the reference forest. In the more fertile site, litter and nutrient inputs increased across different treatments with increasing stand density, whereas in the low fertility site, litter and nutrient inputs in the different treatments increased with increasing tree species richness and the proportion of putative nitrogen-fixing tree species. Conclusions Restoration treatments, even those with low species richness, but with a relatively high proportion of trees with nitrogen-fixing capability might be effective in restoring nutrient cycles in lower fertility soils, whereas in the more fertile soils it is possible to increase nutrient inputs by establishing restoration treatments at high stem densities. Our results suggest that the magnitude of relationships among plant community parameters and nutrient cycling depends strongly on site conditions.

TI  - Linking vegetation and soil functions during secondary forest succession in the Atlantic forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Secondary forest succession can be an effective and low-cost strategy to increase forest cover and the associated biodiversity and soil functions. However, little is known about how soil functions develop during succession, and how vegetation attributes influence soil functions, especially in highly biodiverse and fragmented landscapes in the tropics. Here we assessed a wide range of indicators of taxonomic (e.g. number of tree species), structural (e.g. basal area, canopy openness) and functional diversity (e.g. community weighted means of functional traits) of tree species, as well as indicators for soil functions related to soil organic matter accumulation, nutrient cycling and soil cover in secondary forest patches ranging from 5 to 80 years. Two recently abandoned agricultural fields were included as the starting point of forest succession and two primary forest patches served as references for the end point of forest succession. Four ecological hypotheses, centred around the role of functional diversity, structural diversity and biomass, were tested to explore mechanisms in which forest vegetation may influence soil functions. Most measures of structural, taxonomic and functional diversity converged to values found in primary forests after 25-50 years of succession, whereas functional composition changed from acquisitive to conservative species. Soil carbon and nutrient cycling showed a quick recovery to the levels of primary forests after 15 years of succession. Although soil cover also increased during succession, levels of primary forests were not reached within 80 years. Variation in tree height and trait dominance were identified as aboveground drivers of carbon and nutrient cycling, while aboveground biomass was the main driver of litter accumulation, and the associated soil cover and water retention. Our results indicate that secondary forest succession can lead to a relative fast recovery of nutrient and carbon cycling functions, but not of soil cover. Our findings highlight the essential role of secondary forests in providing multiple ecosystem services. These results can be used to inform management and reforestation programmes targeted at strengthening soil functions, such as soil cover, nutrient and carbon cycling.

TI  - Nitrogen and phosphorus uptake dynamics in anthropized and conserved Caatinga dry forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
AB  - Understanding human impacts on drylands is crucial in a global scenario of forest degradation and biodiversity loss. This study analyzed foliar concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) in the Brazilian seasonally dry tropical forests (Caatinga). Foliar patterns of N, P, and the N/P ratio were assessed both within and among botanical families. To do this, 10 plots were established in an anthropized area and 10 in a conserved area. Within each plot, leaves from all tree species and soil samples from four random points were collected. Stoichiometric analyses were performed on the leaves of 136 trees from 14 botanical families. Significant differences were observed in soil P concentrations, organic matter content, and cation exchange capacity, with the highest values found in the conserved area. Foliar N and P concentrations and N/P were also higher in the conserved area for the F+ (nitrogen-fixing Fabaceae), F- (non-nitrogen-fixing Fabaceae), and NF (non-Fabaceae) groups, indicating greater efficiency in nutrient retention and cycling. When comparing species found in both areas, Aspidosperma pyrifolium (NF), Bauhinia forficata (F-), and Mimosa ophthalmocentra (F+) showed significant differences in foliar N concentrations and foliar P (for A. pyrifolium and B. forficata only). Degradation of the Caatinga directly impacts nutrient cycling.

TI  - Characterizing the structural complexity of the Earth's forests with spaceborne lidar
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Forest structural complexity is a key element of ecosystem functioning, impacting light environments, nutrient cycling, biodiversity, and habitat quality. Addressing the need for a comprehensive global assessment of actual forest structural complexity, we derive a near-global map of 3D canopy complexity using data from the GEDI spaceborne lidar mission. These data show that tropical forests harbor most of the high complexity observations, while less than 20% of temperate forests reached median levels of tropical complexity. Structural complexity in tropical forests is more strongly related to canopy attributes from lower and middle waveform layers, whereas in temperate forests upper and middle layers are more influential. Globally, forests exhibit robust scaling relationships between complexity and canopy height, but these vary geographically and by biome. Our results offer insights into the spatial distribution of forest structural complexity and emphasize the importance of considering biome-specific and fine-scale variations for ecological research and management applications. The GEDI Waveform Structural Complexity Index data product, derived from our analyses, provides researchers and conservationists with a single, easily interpretable metric by combining various aspects of canopy structure.
   Forest structural complexity plays a crucial role in ecosystem functioning, influencing factors like light, nutrient cycling, and biodiversity. Here, a global map of 3D canopy complexity modeled from spaceborne lidar reveals that highly complex forests are concentrated in the tropics, with significant variations observed across biomes.

TI  - Tropical forest above-ground productivity is maintained by nutrients cycled in litter
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Tropical forest productivity represents an important global carbon sink, but many tropical forests grow on infertile soils. Efficient nutrient cycling by litterfall has long been assumed to maintain tropical tree growth, but there is no direct evidence that the nutrients cycled in litterfall are essential for tropical forest productivity.To test whether nutrient cycling by litterfall maintains tropical forest above-ground productivity, we established large-scale long-term litter removal (L-) and litter addition (L+) treatments in a mature lowland tropical forest. We hypothesised that the removal of nutrients in litter would reduce tree growth, survival and litter production in L- plots. By contrast, the addition of nutrients in litter would enhance tree growth, survival and litter production in L+ plots. To test our hypotheses, we recorded tree growth and survival every 2 years, and measured litterfall monthly during 17 years of treatments.Tree growth and litterfall declined over time in L- plots, with consistently lower growth rates compared to controls after 8 years, and lower litter production after 4 years of treatments. By contrast, although litterfall was higher in the L+ plots relative to the controls, there was only a minor transient increase in tree growth immediately after the start of treatments. Tree survival declined over time in all treatments but was not affected by litter manipulation.The long-term decline in tree growth and litterfall in the L- plots provides the first empirical evidence that nutrient cycling by litterfall plays a key role in maintaining above-ground productivity in this tropical forest. By contrast, the transient increase in growth in the L+ plots can be attributed to the large inputs of nutrients with the addition of the entire litter standing crop at the start of treatments. The addition of nutrients in litter over the long term was nonetheless sufficient to enhance litter production, possibly by accelerating leaf turnover.Synthesis: Efficient nutrient cycling by litterfall makes an important contribution to the annual nutrient requirements of mature tropical forest trees, compensating for infertile soils. Disturbances that disrupt this finely balanced cycle could therefore reduce biomass carbon sequestration in tropical forests.
   La productividad primaria de los bosques tropicales representa un importante sumidero global de carbono, a pesar de que muchos de estos bosques crecen sobre suelos infertiles. Por mucho tiempo se ha asumido que el crecimiento de los arboles en estos bosques esta sostenido por un eficiente reciclaje de nutrientes proveniente de la hojarasca, pero no hay evidencia directa de que los nutrientes reciclados en la hojarasca sean esenciales para la productividad de los bosques tropicales.Para probar si el reciclaje de nutrientes de la hojarasca sostiene la productividad epigea de los bosques tropicales, establecimos tratamientos a largo plazo de remocion (L-) y adicion (L+) de hojarasca en un bosque maduro tropical de bajura. Hipotetizamos que la remocion de los nutrientes contenidos en la hojarasca reduciria el crecimiento, la supervivencia, y la produccion de hojarasca de los arboles en parcelas de L-. Al contrario, hipotetizamos que la adicion de nutrientes en hojarasca aumentaria el crecimiento, la supervivencia, y la produccion de hojarasca de los arboles en parcelas de L+. Para probar nuestra hipotesis, registramos el crecimiento y la supervivencia de los arboles cada dos anos, y medimos hojarasca mensualmente durante 17 anos de tratamientos.El crecimiento de los arboles y la produccion de hojarasca disminuyo con el tiempo en parcelas de L-, con tasas de crecimiento consistentemente menores que en los controles despues de ocho anos, y una menor produccion de hojarasca despues de cuatro anos de tratamientos. En contraste, aunque la produccion de hojarasca fue mayor en parcelas de L+ comparada con los controles, solo hubo un aumento transitorio en el crecimiento de los arboles inmediatamente despues del inicio de los tratamientos. La supervivencia de los arboles disminuyo con el tiempo en todos los tratamientos, pero no fue afectada por la manipulacion de hojarasca.El declive a largo plazo observado en el crecimiento de los arboles y la produccion de hojarasca en las parcelas de L- brinda una primera evidencia empirica de que el reciclaje de nutrientes en la hojarasca juega un papel clave para sostener la productividad epigea de este bosque tropical. En contraste, el aumento transitorio en el crecimiento de los arboles en las parcelas de L+ se puede atribuir a la gran entrada de nutrientes que representa la adicion del mantillo entero al inicio de los tratamientos. La adicion de nutrientes en la hojarasca a largo plazo fue sin embargo suficiente para aumentar la produccion de hojarasca, posiblemente a traves de un aumento en la tasa de recambio de las hojas.Sintesis: El reciclaje eficiente de nutrientes a traves de la hojarasca contribuye significativamente a los requerimientos anuales de nutrientes de los arboles en bosque maduro tropical, compensando la infertilidad del suelo. Por lo tanto, perturbaciones a este delicado ciclo podrian reducir el secuestro de carbono en la biomasa de los bosques tropicales.
   The maintenance of highly productive lowland tropical forests on infertile soils is often attributed to nutrient cycling via litterfall. Almost 40 years after this theory was first proposed, our large-scale field experiment demonstrates that tree growth and litter production decline in response to long-term litter removal, providing the first empirical evidence that nutrient cycling by litterfall plays a key role in maintaining above-ground productivity in this tropical forest.image

TI  - Influence of an invasive ant on grazing and detrital communities and nutrient fluxes in a tropical forest
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
AB  - Aim Pathways linking grazing and detrital subsystems of terrestrial ecosystems are important for ecosystem processes and function, but remain poorly understood. The invasion of a generalist predator creates a unique opportunity to study the effects of predation across these subsystems. We examine here, the effects of a non-native generalist predator, the little red fire ant (Wasmannia auropunctata, Roger) on both grazing and detrital invertebrate communities and ecosystem processes in a rain forest understorey.
   Location Gamba Protected Area Complex, south-western Gabon, Africa.
   Methods We measured abundances and diversities of understorey grazing and detrital invertebrate communities, soil nutrients, herbivory, litter fragmentation rates and leaf chemistry of a dominant understorey shrub inside and outside of 19 separate invasion fronts. We then explored possible trophic cascades and pathways of interaction using path analysis.
   Results Results suggest that invasive ants may alter herbivory regimes, grazing and detrital communities, and may indirectly alter litter decomposition and nutrient cycling in the soil by suppressing important microbivore and detritivore populations with consequences for leaf chemistry.
   Main conclusions These results demonstrate that generalist predators may be major drivers of both grazing and detrital subsystems by inducing strong shifts in adjacent communities that ultimately affect ecosystem processes.

TI  - Patterns of litter and nutrient return to the soil during passive restoration in Cerrado, Brazil
T2  - BIOLOGIA
AB  - Passive restoration offer better preservation for the diverse legacy of forest ecosystems, but many interactions on the restoration process remain poorly understood. In this study, the seasonality of accumulated litter layer, nutrient content, potential return, and soil quality were evaluated under the initial (subjected to 11-year) and advanced (subjected to 46-year) passive restoration conditions in Cerrado, Brazil. Measurements were carried out for a period of one year. Accumulated litter layer, nutrient content, potential return, and nutrient use efficiency were 50%, 43%, 13%, and 42% higher in the advanced passive restoration site compared to the initial restoration site. For both sites, the annual litter content followed the order: N > Ca > K > Mg > P > Fe > Mn > B > Zn > Cu. Significant increases in soil organic matter and cation exchange capacity were found in the advanced passive restoration. The annual average had shown a higher macronutrient concentration in the soil for the initial restoration, while a higher micronutrient concentration was found for the advanced restoration. The seasonality affected the accumulated litter layer, litter nutrients, potential return and soil quality. Some litter and soil nutrients were significantly correlated, evidencing the nutrient associations between litter and soil. Hence, both the passive restoration stages and rain were factors that regulated the temporal patterns of accumulated litter layer as well as the nutrient cycling in Cerrado passive restoration models.

TI  - The Global Ecosystems Monitoring network: Monitoring ecosystem productivity and carbon cycling across the tropics
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - A rich understanding of the productivity, carbon and nutrient cycling of terrestrial ecosystems is essential in the context of understanding, modelling and managing the future response of the biosphere to global change. This need is particularly acute in tropical ecosystems, home to over 60% of global terrestrial productivity, over half of planetary biodiversity, and hotspots of anthropogenic pressure. In recent years there has been a surge of activity in collecting data on the carbon cycle, productivity, and plant functional traits of tropical ecosystems, most intensively through the Global Ecosystems Monitoring network (GEM). The GEM approach provides valuable insights by linking field-based ecosystem ecology with the needs of Earth system science. In this paper, we review and synthesize the context, history and recent scientific output from the GEM network. Key insights have emerged on the spatial and temporal variability of ecosystem productivity and on the role of temperature and drought stress on ecosystem function and resilience. New work across the network is now linking carbon cycling to nutrient cycling and plant functional traits, and subsequently to airborne remote sensing. We discuss some of the novel emerging patterns and practical and methodological challenges of this approach, and examine current and possible future directions, both within this network and as lessons for a more general terrestrial ecosystem observation scheme.

TI  - Effects of fire and edges on plant litterfall in a Neotropical rainforest, Brazil
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
AB  - Anthropogenic forest fires are occurring with increasing frequency in tropical forests, with negative consequences for a variety of ecological processes, including litterfall. Litterfall provides several ecosystem services, such as nutrient cycling and carbon storage, thus playing an important role in ecosystem functioning. We assessed the impacts of fire and fire-created edges on litterfall in Atlantic Forest remnants in Bahia, Brazil. Litterfall was assessed at monthly intervals over one year along seven 300 m-long transects placed perpendicular to the edge between the unburnt forest and the burnt forest. We installed litterfall traps at the edge (0 m) and 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 150 m into both the burnt and unburnt forest. The total litterfall was smaller in the burnt forest (mean of 2.5 +/- 2.2 SD t.ha-1.y-1) than in the unburnt forest (mean of 5.9 +/- 3.4 SD t.ha-1.y-1). In addition, leaf litter gradually increased from the edge toward the unburnt forest interior. Our results highlight that there is less litterfall in the burnt forest, and that the relative contribution of different litter types (leaves, twigs, and miscellaneous litter) differ between burnt forest and unburnt forest. The lower amount of litterfall in the burnt forest and forest edge may have negative consequences for the natural regeneration of these areas, as the ecosystem services provided by plant litter that are important for forest regeneration are likely to be impaired.

TI  - Effects of Tree Functional Traits on Soil Respiration in Tropical Forest Plantations
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Fast-growing tree species, including Eucalyptus sp. and Acacia sp., are widely used to rehabilitate degraded tropical forestland quickly, while mitigating climate change. However, the extent of carbon losses through soil respiration (R-S) often remains unknown. Moreover, the promotion of these non-native species has raised concerns over their impact on other ecosystem services, including N-2-fixation-induced soil acidification and nutrient cycling. This study compared two non-native and native species, with one of each being N-2-fixing, growing in 11-year-old monospecific plantations in NE Thailand. Hourly R-S was measured monthly over one year and combined with stand characteristics, as well as soil microclimatic and chemical properties. Mixed-effects models were used to capture this hierarchical, diurnal, and seasonal dataset. R-S rates were influenced by soil temperature and moisture following a parabolic relation, and negatively affected by acidity. Overall, R-S varied significantly according to species-specific microclimates and productivity. Despite the high input of organic matter, non-native species failed to ameliorate extreme soil moisture or temperature; limiting microbial decomposition and reducing R-S. Hopea odorata produced moderate levels of carbon sequestration, but maintained soil fertility. The choice of tree species can significantly affect carbon sequestration and storage, as well as nutrient cycling, and careful species selection could optimize these ecosystem services.

TI  - Carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling in agroforestry systems on degraded soils of Eastern Amazon, Brazil
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Land degradation and rural poverty are widespread in the Eastern Brazilian Amazon. Slash-and-burn agriculture is the main source of livelihood in small farms but also a driver of degradation. In this context, Agroforestry Systems (AFS) are an alternative for climate change mitigation and land restoration, allying food security and ecosystem services reestablishment. We evaluated the increment of carbon stock (aboveground biomass, necromass, and soil) and standing litter nutrients in AFS and compared with natural succession. Treatments were established in 30 x 30 m plots with six repetitions (randomized block design) on a very degraded soil at UEMA School farm, in Eastern Amazon. In AFS, the 17 planted tree species of local interest (for fruit, timber, N-fixing) were associated with agricultural species and fertilized according to local standards. Carbon stock was measured in 2012 before the experiment setup (baseline) and in 2018. Aboveground carbon increment (Mg ha(-1)) was higher in AFS (26.79 +/- 23.41) than in natural succession (1.13 +/- 1.5), because of tree and shrub cover as a result of planting efforts. We found very high variability in plant development and carbon sequestration between plots. Soil organic carbon did not present increment between 2012 and 2018, and no differences between treatments were found in 2018. Species choice plays a keyhole for carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling reestablishment. Areas under natural succession presented very low resilience, evidencing the need for active restoration. Diverse agroforestry systems are an efficient strategy to restore forest cover on degraded soils of Amazon allying ecosystem services reestablishment and production.

TI  - Global change effects on humid tropical forests: Evidence for biogeochemical and biodiversity shifts at an ecosystem scale
T2  - REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS
AB  - Government and international agencies have highlighted the need to focus global change research efforts on tropical ecosystems. However, no recent comprehensive review exists synthesizing humid tropical forest responses across global change factors, including warming, decreased precipitation, carbon dioxide fertilization, nitrogen deposition, and land use/land cover changes. This paper assesses research across spatial and temporal scales for the tropics, including modeling, field, and controlled laboratory studies. The review aims to (1) provide a broad understanding of how a suite of global change factors are altering humid tropical forest ecosystem properties and biogeochemical processes; (2) assess spatial variability in responses to global change factors among humid tropical regions; (3) synthesize results from across humid tropical regions to identify emergent trends in ecosystem responses; (4) identify research and management priorities for the humid tropics in the context of global change. Ecosystem responses covered here include plant growth, carbon storage, nutrient cycling, biodiversity, and disturbance regime shifts. The review demonstrates overall negative effects of global change on all ecosystem properties, with the greatest uncertainty and variability in nutrient cycling responses. Generally, all global change factors reviewed, except for carbon dioxide fertilization, demonstrate great potential to trigger positive feedbacks to global warming via greenhouse gas emissions and biogeophysical changes that cause regional warming. This assessment demonstrates that effects of decreased rainfall and deforestation on tropical forests are relatively well understood, whereas the potential effects of warming, carbon dioxide fertilization, nitrogen deposition, and plant species invasions require more cross-site, mechanistic research to predict tropical forest responses at regional and global scales.

TI  - Soil nutrient dissimilarity and litter nutrient limitation as major drivers of home field advantage in riparian tropical forests
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Decomposition is a key process driving carbon and nutrient cycling in ecosystems worldwide. The home field advantage effect (HFA) has been found to accelerate decomposition rates when litter originates from "home" when compared to other ("away") sites. It is still poorly known how HFA plays out in tropical, riparian forests, particularly in forests under restoration. We carried out three independent reciprocal litter transplant experiments to test how litter quality, soil nutrient concentrations, and successional stage (age) influenced HFA in tropical riparian forests. These experimental areas formed a wide gradient of soil and litter nutrients, which we used to evaluate the more general hypothesis that HFA varies with dissimilarity in soil nutrients and litter quality. We found that HFA increased with soil nutrient dissimilarity, suggesting that litter translocation uncouples relationships between decomposers and litter characteristics; and with litter N:P, indicating P limitation in this system. We also found negative HFA effects at a site under restoration that presented low decomposer ability, suggesting that forest restoration does not necessarily recover decomposer communities and nutrient cycling. Within each of the independent experiments, the occurrence of HFA effects was limited and their magnitude was not related to forest age, nor soil and litter quality. Our results imply that HFA effects in tropical ecosystems are influenced by litter nutrient limitation and soil nutrient dissimilarity between home and away sites, but to further disentangle major HFA drivers in tropical areas, a gradient of dissimilarity between litter and soil properties must be implemented in future experimental designs.Abstract in Portuguese is available with online material.

TI  - Non-destructive estimation of tree biomass by using wood specific gravity in the estimator
T2  - NATIONAL ACADEMY SCIENCE LETTERS-INDIA
AB  - Estimates of forest biomass are required for understanding several ecological processes such as nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration. We compared the biomass estimates of seven tropical tree species measured on the basis of two methods: (i) allometric equations relating destructively measured tree biomass and the circumference at breast height (CBH), and (ii) non-destructive equation having wood specific gravity (p) in the estimator. There were strong correlations between the two methods for all tree species. We suggest that p-based estimator is a viable option for non-destructive estimation of forest biomass.

TI  - Litter dynamics recover faster than arthropod biodiversity during tropical forest succession
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Litterfall and litter decomposition are key elements of nutrient cycling in tropical forests, a process in which decomposer communities such as macro-arthropods play a critical role. Understanding the rate and extent to which ecosystem function and biodiversity recover during succession is useful to managing the growing area of tropical successional forest globally. Using a replicated chronosequence of forest succession (5-15, 15-30, 30-45 years, and primary forest) on abandoned pastures in lowland tropical wet forest, we examined litterfall, litter chemistry, and effects of macro-arthropod exclusion on decomposition of two litter types (primary and 5- to 15-years-old secondary forest). Further, we assessed macro-arthropod diversity and community composition across the chronosequence. Overstory cover, litterfall, and litter nutrients reached levels similar to primary forest within 15-30 years. Young secondary forest litter (5-15 years) had lower initial N and P content, higher C:N, and decayed 60 percent faster than primary forest litter. The presence of macro-arthropods strongly mediated decomposition and nutrient release rates, increasing litter mass loss by 35-44 percent, N released by 53 percent, and P release by 84 percent. Forest age had no effect on soil nutrients, rates of litter decomposition, nutrient release, or macro-arthropod influence. In contrast, abundance and community composition of macro-arthropods remained significantly lower and distinct in all ages of secondary compared with primary forest. Order richness was lower in 5-15 years of secondary compared with primary forest. Our results suggest that in highly productive tropical wet forest, functional recovery of litter dynamics precedes recovery of decomposer community structure and biodiversity. in Spanish is available with online material.

TI  - Litter decomposition and nutrient release for two tropical N-fixing species in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
AB  - Litter production and decomposition are critical to forest productivity, nutrient cycling, and carbon sequestration in tropical woody ecosystems. However, nutrient release and leaf litter stoichiometry in tropical legume tree plantations over the long term after outplanting are poorly understood or even unknown. Toward improving our understanding of the pattern of changes in the decomposition of N-fixing leaf litters and their possible impact on carbon storage, we measured litter production, mass loss and nutrient release for 240 d during litter decomposition for two tropical legume tree species (Plathymenia reticulata and Hymenaea courbaril), in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Litter production for P. reticulata was 5.689 kg ha(-1) a(-1) and 3.231 kg ha(-1) a(-1) for H. courbaril. The patterns of mass loss rates were similar; however, nutrient release was greater for P. reticulata, while H. courbaril showed immobilization of nutrients, especially for N, which increased by almost 20% in the early phase of decomposition followed by gradual release. Litter from the N-fixing species did differ in nutrient chemistries over time, which was not surprising given that initial nutrient concentrations varied broadly, except for C and P. Most of the nutrient concentrations increased as the remaining litter mass decreased in both species, except for C and K. The C:N and N:P ratios differed between the species, but N:P did not correlate to mass loss. Both species had N-rich leaves, but P. reticulata decomposition was very likely P-limited, while H. courbaril seemed to be co-limited by N and P. The results showed different patterns in nutrient release and the stoichiometry involved in the decomposition dynamics of the two tropical N-fixing species, even though they have similar litter decay rates. Both species, but especially P. reticulata, may help re-establish nutrient cycling in disturbed ecosystems.

TI  - Successional response of a tropical forest termite assemblage to experimental habitat perturbation
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Research into the successional responses of tropical forest communities following disturbance has potential applications for habitat restoration. Currently little is known of how these responses relate to the recovery of biodiversity and ecosystem processes. Succession of assemblages of decomposer arthropods is essential for the recovery of the soil community and nutrient cycling processes.
   2. This study investigated the successional response of a termite assemblage to the experimental perturbation of forest habitat in southern Cameroon, examining the implications for tropical forest restoration. A randomized block design consisting of four experimental perturbations of differing severity was established in an old secondary forest in the Mbalmayo Forest Reserve. Isolated control sites were left in undisturbed forest. Recovery of the termite assemblage was assessed by measuring termite species richness and abundance at regular intervals over the subsequent 12 months.
   3. The speed of recovery of the termite assemblage varied with the type and extent of perturbation. In treatments involving severe soil and canopy disturbance, termite species richness and abundance recovered more rapidly when dead wood was left on the ground following perturbation. The availability of dead wood also resulted in recolonization by a subset of the termite assemblage that was distinct compositionally from that sampled from all other treatments. This subset at sites with additional dead wood included not only certain wood-feeding species, but also soil feeders.
   4. The positive effects upon the termite assemblage of leaving substantial dead wood on the ground has implications for the restoration of tropical forests following human-induced disturbances such as logging. The accelerated recovery of termite diversity and assemblage composition is a significant component of soil community recovery and the restoration of nutrient cycles. These benefits are expected to influence soil fertility and, ultimately, forest regeneration. The duration and persistence of these effects will depend crucially on the type, scale and intensity of the original disturbance. The impact of termites on soil properties, and vice versa, clearly deserves more attention in studies of tropical forest regeneration and recovery.

TI  - Short-term effects of forest management on litter decomposition in Caatinga dry forest
T2  - ENERGY ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The Caatinga is a Brazilian biome, which belongs to the group of dry tropical forests and constitutes one of the largest semiarid areas in the world, with high housing levels of biodiversity. Despite this, the biome has been intensely impacted by anthropic interference, which makes sustainable forest management (SFM) practices an opportunity to associate the conservation of the biome with the generation of income. However, the effects of different SFM practices on the Caatinga balance have not yet been addressed, especially concerning soil and litter. This study aims to answer the following questions: (1) Do forest management practices influence leaf litter's decomposition and chemical composition? (2) Does the effect of forest management on litter decomposition vary according to its level of intervention in the vegetation? For this, the leaf litter decomposition was evaluated in three forest management conditions and a control condition: clear cutting (CC), selective cutting by minimum diameter (SCD), selective cutting by species (SCS), and unmanaged Caatinga (UC). Decomposition was evaluated using the litterbags method over 260 days. The levels of total nitrogen, polyphenols, lignin, and cellulose in the leaf litter were determined at the beginning and end of the experiment. Our results showed the participation of leaves in the total litter (CC = 15%; SCD = 24%; SCS = 46%; UC = 55%). In all treatments, the leaf material decomposition process occurred with greater intensity after 120 days, reaching losses greater than 33% at 180 days. The management SCS is the practice that most favors the litter decomposition process with the most expressive value of k constant (0.0038 g g(-1) dia(-1)) and half-life of 182 days compared to the others and may have future implications for nutrient cycling. On the other hand, CC and SCD were the practices that most increased the amount and composition of the accumulated litter and the mineralization of chemical compounds of the leaf litter.

TI  - Land use not litter quality is a stronger driver of decomposition in hyperdiverse tropical forest
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - In hyperdiverse tropical forests, the key drivers of litter decomposition are poorly understood despite its crucial role in facilitating nutrient availability for plants and microbes. Selective logging is a pressing land use with potential for considerable impacts on plant-soil interactions, litter decomposition, and nutrient cycling. Here, in Borneo's tropical rainforests, we test the hypothesis that decomposition is driven by litter quality and that there is a significant home-field advantage, that is positive interaction between local litter quality and land use. We determined mass loss of leaf litter, collected from selectively logged and old-growth forest, in a fully factorial experimental design, using meshes that either allowed or precluded access by mesofauna. We measured leaf litter chemical composition before and after the experiment. Key soil chemical and biological properties and microclimatic conditions were measured as land-use descriptors. We found that despite substantial differences in litter quality, the main driver of decomposition was land-use type. Whilst inclusion of mesofauna accelerated decomposition, their effect was independent of land use and litter quality. Decomposition of all litters was slower in selectively logged forest than in old-growth forest. However, there was significantly greater loss of nutrients from litter, especially phosphorus, in selectively logged forest. The analyses of several covariates detected minor microclimatic differences between land-use types but no alterations in soil chemical properties or free-living microbial composition. These results demonstrate that selective logging can significantly reduce litter decomposition in tropical rainforest with no evidence of a home-field advantage. We show that loss of key limiting nutrients from litter (P & N) is greater in selectively logged forest. Overall, the findings hint at subtle differences in microclimate overriding litter quality that result in reduced decomposition rates in selectively logged forests and potentially affect biogeochemical nutrient cycling in the long term.

TI  - High termite richness in an urban fragment of Atlantic Forest in northeastern Brazil
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - Termites are very abundant in tropical ecosystems and have active roles in nutrient cycling and soil formation, but few studies of their assemblages have been undertaken in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. The present study analyzed the composition of termite assemblages in a fragment of Atlantic Forest embedded within an urban matrix in northeastern Brazil. Five standardized sampling protocols of termites were applied, with a total sampling effort of 1500m(2). We encountered 45 species of termites belonging to 25 genera and three families. The soil-feeders group demonstrated the greatest species richness, while wood-feeders species were the most abundant. The species richness of termite in the study area was the greatest yet recorded for an Atlantic forest site in Brazil, indicating the importance of urban fragments for conserving tropical biodiversity.

TI  - Influence of Acacia mangium on Soil Fertility and Bacterial Community in Eucalyptus Plantations in the Congolese Coastal Plains
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Productivity and sustainability of tropical forest plantations greatly rely on regulation of ecosystem functioning and nutrient cycling, i.e., the link between plant growth, nutrient availability, and the microbial community structure. So far, these interactions have never been evaluated in the Acacia and Eucalyptus forest planted on infertile soils in the Congolese coastal plains. In the present work, the soil bacterial community has been investigated by metabarcoding of the 16S rRNA bacterial gene in different stands of monoculture and mixed-species plantation to evaluate the potential of nitrogen-fixing trees on nutrient and bacterial structure. At the phylum level, the soil bacterial community was dominated by Actinobacteria, followed by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Acidobacteria. A principal coordinate analysis revealed that bacterial communities from pure Eucalyptus, compared to those from plantations containing Acacia in pure and mixed-species stands, showed different community composition (beta-diversity). Regardless of the large variability of the studied soils, the prevalence of Firmicutes phylum, and lower bacterial richness and phylogenic diversity were reported in stands containing Acacia relative to the pure Eucalyptus. Distance-based redundancy analysis revealed a positive correlation of available phosphorus (P) and carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio with bacterial community structure. However, the Spearman correlation test revealed a broad correlation between the relative abundance of bacterial taxa and soil attributes, in particular with sulfur (S) and carbon (C), suggesting the important role of soil bacterial community in nutrient cycling in this type of forest management. Concerning mixed plantations, a shift in bacterial community structure was observed, probably linked to other changes, i.e., improvement in soil fertility (enhanced P and C dynamics in forest floor and soil, and increase in soil N status), and C sequestration in both soil and stand wood biomass with the great potential impact to mitigate climate change. Overall, our findings highlight the role of soil attributes, especially C, S, available P, and C/N ratio at a lesser extent, in driving the soil bacterial community in mixed-species plantations and its potential to improve soil fertility and to sustain Eucalyptus plantations established on the infertile and sandy soils of the Congolese coastal plains.

TI  - Contribution of Litter and Leaf Decomposition of Byrsonima gardneriana
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
AB  - The litter in tropical ecosystems is one of the compartments responsible for the transference of nutrients to the soil, having great importance for the conservation and maintenance of biodiversity. Thus, this study aimed to quantify the contribution and stock of litter and the leaf decomposition rate of Gardneriana byrsonima A. Juss (murici) in two areas of Caatinga, semiarid region of Alagoas State. Litter production was measured monthly from March of 2012 to February of 2013. The litter decomposition rate and the remaining leaf mass of the murici were also calculated and analyzed for its material chemically. The leaf decomposition was measured in litter bags and the material was chemically analyzed. In the area of Olho D'Agua Casado, the litter produced was over Delmiro Gouveia. The leaf fraction contributed to the higher percentage in the litter training in both areas. The leaf material showed slow decomposition to high levels of lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, and high C:N ratio.

TI  - Tropical forest restoration in Costa Rica: the effect of several strategies on litter production, accumulation and decomposition
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - Tropical forest restoration in Costa Rica: the effect of several strategies on litter production, accumulation and decomposition. Tropical forest restoration strategies have the potential to accelerate the recovery of the nutrient cycles in degraded lands. Litter production and its decomposition represent the main transfer of organic material and nutrients into the soil substrate. We evaluated litter production, accumulation on the forest floor, and its decomposition under three restoration strategies: plantation (entire area planted with trees), island (trees planted in patches of three different sizes) and control (natural regeneration) plots. We also compared restoration strategies to young secondary forest (7-9yr). Restoration treatments were established in 50x50m plots in June 2004 at six sites in Southern Costa Rica. Planted tree species included two native timber species (Terminalia amazonia and Vochysia guatemalensis) interplanted with two N fixers (Erythrina poeppigiana and Inga edulis). Litter was collected every 15 days between September 2008 and August 2009 in 12 0.25m(2) litter traps distributed within each plot; litter that accumulated on the soil surface was collected at four locations (0.25m(2) quadrats) within each plot in February and May 2009. Total litter production in plantation (6.3Mg/ha) and secondary forest (7.3Mg/ha) did not differ, but were greater than in islands (3.5Mg/ha) and control (1.4Mg/ha). Plantation had greatest accumulation of litter on the soil surface (10.6Mg/ha) as compared to the other treatments (SF=7.2; I=6.7; C=4.9). Secondary forest was the only treatment with a greater annual production of litter than litter accumulation on the soil surface. Carbon storage in litter was similar between plantation and secondary forest, and significantly greater than the other treatments. No differences were found for carbon concentration and storage in the soil among treatments. There was also high variability in the production and accumulation of litter and carbon among sites. Active restoration treatments accelerated the production of litter and carbon storage in comparison to areas under natural recovery. However, the nutrient cycle has not necessarily been restored under these conditions, as high litter accumulation on the soil surface indicates a low decomposition rate, which slows nutrient return to the soil.

TI  - Possibilities for carbon sequestration in tropical and subtropical soils
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Soil organic matter is a key component of all terrestrial ecosystems, and any variation in its composition and abundance has important effects on many of the processes that occur within the system. The role of soil organic matter in soil nutrient cycling and soil gaseous emissions is discussed in the context of agricultural sustainability and global environmental change. Recent data on organic carbon and nitrogen reserves in the soils of the world are presented, with special reference to the subtropical and tropical regions. Possibilities for long-lasting, enhanced sequestration of carbon in the soil through management of the land and water resources are reviewed. Finally, the need is stressed for an up-to-date database on soil resources and for a global monitoring system in order to permit the study of changes in soil organic matter quantity and quality over time, as determined by changes in land-use and climate.

TI  - Functional diversity of macromycete communities along an environmental gradient in a Mexican seasonally dry tropical forest
T2  - FUNGAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Macromycetes are important for ecosystem functioning due to their role in the nutrient cycling, and their function as pathogens and mutualists. Diversity metrics based on functional traits are robust predictors of ecosystem functionality since they incorporate an evolutionary and ecologic background. We examined diversity patterns of macrofungi using functional trait-based metrics of diversity along an altitudinal gradient in a seasonally dry tropical forest in southern Mexico. Our findings show that: (1) functional diversity varies with elevation, relating more to climatic variables than to vegetation structure; (2) functional diversity indexes exhibited contrasting patterns, so measures reflecting heterogeneity on trait abundance and niche complementarity tend to increase with elevation, whereas the measure of trait evenness decreases; and (3) functional diversity patterns depend on the type of functional trait considered and how they respond to environmental conditions. Our results indicate that functional diversity analyses help understanding of how macrofungal communities respond to environmental variation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.

TI  - Defaunation disrupts the behavior of large terrestrial vertebrates, impacting ecological functions in the Amazon
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Wildlife defaunation in tropical forests disrupts critical ecological functions such as predation, seed dispersal, and nutrient cycling. While exclusion experiments are commonly used to investigate the effects of wildlife loss on plant diversity and vegetation structure, their potential impact on broader ecosystem functions remains underexplored. Here we investigate how defaunation could affect ecosystem functions in the Amazon rainforest by quantifying the changes in the occurrence and frequency of behaviors exhibited by terrestrial mammals induced by experimental defaunation. Using camera traps, we recorded vertebrate behaviors across exclusion and control plots, categorizing them into feeding, excretion/defecation, bioturbation, and trampling. We then calculated weighted standardized indices, integrating behavior frequency and body mass, to assess the potential local impacts of vertebrates across plots. We found that all behaviors were drastically reduced (>95 % reduction) under severe defaunation conditions, primarily due to the absence of medium- and large-bodied mammals and birds. In defaunated plots, small mammals partially performed some behaviors, but they were unable to compensate for the loss of larger species. These results highlight the substantial reduction in critical vertebrate behaviors and suggest that such changes can significantly disrupt ecosystem functions in defaunated tropical forests.

TI  - Monitoring expansion of plantations in Lao tropical forests using Landsat time series
T2  - LAND SURFACE REMOTE SENSING II
CP  - Conference on Land Surface Remote Sensing II
AB  - Clearing of native forest for plantation expansion is a significant component of land use change in many tropical regions. The continuing expansion of plantations has many environmental consequences, including the loss and fragmentation of habitat, alteration of nutrient cycling processes, reduction in environmentally sequestered carbon, increased soil erosion and land degradation, and loss of biodiversity. The primary goal of this research was to develop and test remote sensing methods to detect the expansion of plantations in the southern part of the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR). We used Landsat satellite imagery acquired between 2003 and 2012. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to three Landsat temporal image pairs (2003-2006, 2006-2009 and 2009-2012) to identify areas of change. Change identification accuracy was evaluated by comparison against 1,240 random sample locations which had been independently classified from Google Earth imagery from 2006 and 2012. It was found that one of the principal components detected change in areas of plantation in the study area, with producer's accuracy of 92% and user's accuracy of 79%. This method was relatively easy to implement, involved no image purchase costs, and could be used by ecologists or forestry managers seeking to monitor forest loss or plantation expansion.

TI  - Tropical and Highland Temperate Forest Plantations in Mexico: Pathways for Climate Change Mitigation and Ecosystem Services Delivery
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Forest plantations are a possible way of increasing forest productivity in temperate and tropical forests, and therefore also increasing above- and belowground carbon pools. In the context of climate change, monospecific plantations might become an alternative to mitigate global warming; however, their contribution to the structural complexity, complementarity, and biodiversity of forests has not been addressed. Mixed forest plantations can ensure that objectives of climate change mitigation are met through carbon sequestration, while also delivering anticipated ecosystem services (e.g., nutrient cycling, erosion control, and wildlife habitat). However, mixed forest plantations pose considerable operational challenges and research opportunities. For example, it is essential to know how many species or functional traits are necessary to deliver a set of benefits, or what mixture of species and densities are key to maintaining productive plantations and delivering multiple ecosystem services. At the same time, the establishment of forest plantations in Mexico should not be motivated solely by timber production. Forest plantations should also increase carbon sequestration, maintain biodiversity, and provide other ecosystem services. This article analyzes some matters that affect the development of planted forests in the Mexican national context, and presents alternatives for forest resources management through the recommendation of mixed forest plantations as a means of contributing to climate change mitigation and the delivery of ecosystem services.

TI  - The invasive Tradescantia zebrina does not inhibit germination of the native Hymenaea courbaril but does modulate its growth
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY
AB  - BackgroundInvasive plant species can modify ecosystem structure and function, potentially leading to the loss of native species, environmental and biotic homogenisation, changes in nutrient cycling, impairment of ecosystem services, and decrease in the rate of regeneration of plant recruits.AimsWe assessed the effects of the non-native and invasive vine Tradescantia zebrina on the germination and development of the native tree Hymenaea courbaril in north-eastern Brazil. We hypothesised that the invasive species would negatively impact the germination and development, and, via competition, the growth of the native species.MethodsWe conducted a germination experiment for six months in seven forest patches. Seeds of H. courbaril were cultivated in four possible combinations of two treatments: under a cover with and without T. zebrina, and on soil that originated from places with and without T. zebrina present.ResultsNeither T. zebrina cover or soil affected the germination or biomass of H. courbaril during the experiment. H. courbaril seedlings were taller and had longer roots when cultivated in soil that originated from places with T. zebrina.ConclusionsT. zebrina presence alters soil properties in a way that triggers morphological responses in H. courbaril, which can be associated to a perceived competition context.

TI  - Contrasting phenology of Eucalyptus grandis fine roots in upper and very deep soil layers in Brazil
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - While the role of deep roots in major ecosystem services has been shown for tropical forests, there have been few direct measurements of fine root dynamics at depths of more than 2 m. The factors influencing root phenology remain poorly understood, creating a gap in the knowledge required for predicting the effects of climate change. We set out to gain an insight into the fine root phenology of fast-growing trees in deep tropical soils.
   Fine root growth and mortality of Eucalyptus grandis trees were observed fortnightly using minirhizotrons down to a soil depth of 6 m, from 2 to 4 years after planting.
   In the topsoil, the highest live root length production was during the rainy summer (20 cm m(-2) d(-1)) whereas, below 2 m deep, it was at the end of the dry winter (51 cm m(-2) d(-1)). The maximum root elongation rates increased with soil depth to 3.6 cm d(-1) in the 5-6 m soil layer.
   Our study shows that the effect of the soil depth on the seasonal variations in fine root growth should be taken into account when modelling the carbon, water and nutrient cycles in forests growing on deep tropical soils.

TI  - Mangroves among the most carbon-rich forests in the tropics
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
AB  - Mangrove forests occur along ocean coastlines throughout the tropics, and support numerous ecosystem services, including fisheries production and nutrient cycling. However, the areal extent of mangrove forests has declined by 30-50% over the past half century as a result of coastal development, aquaculture expansion and over-harvesting(1-4). Carbon emissions resulting from mangrove loss are uncertain, owing in part to a lack of broad-scale data on the amount of carbon stored in these ecosystems, particularly below ground(5). Here, we quantified whole-ecosystem carbon storage by measuring tree and dead wood biomass, soil carbon content, and soil depth in 25 mangrove forests across a broad area of the Indo-Pacific region-spanning 30 degrees of latitude and 73 degrees of longitude-where mangrove area and diversity are greatest(4,6). These data indicate that mangroves are among the most carbon-rich forests in the tropics, containing on average 1,023Mg carbon per hectare. Organic-rich soils ranged from 0.5m to more than 3m in depth and accounted for 49-98% of carbon storage in these systems. Combining our data with other published information, we estimate that mangrove deforestation generates emissions of 0.02-0.12 Pg carbon per year-as much as around 10% of emissions from deforestation globally, despite accounting for just 0.7% of tropical forest area(6,7).

TI  - Effect of vertebrate exclusion on leaf litter decomposition in the coastal Atlantic forest of southeast Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Forest fragmentation is the main cause of biodiversity loss in the Anthropocene and it is triggering a top-down cascade effect that may influence leaf litter decomposition. However, the link between biodiversity loss and changes in ecosystem processes is not fully understood. We conducted an experiment to evaluate whether the exclusion of vertebrates affects the decomposition rates of different litter types (grass, a pioneer species and a mix of litters from a well preserved secondary forest). To answer this question, we placed litter bags inside artificial exclusion plots that were built in two types of vegetation coverage (abandoned pastureland and preserved forest) in the Atlantic forest of southeast Brazil. Our hypothesis is that vertebrate exclusion will change decomposition rates of different litter types due to the top-down cascade effect on soil invertebrates. We found out that vertebrate exclusion did not affect decomposition rates, possibly due to the overlap of ecological functions in the soil fauna responsible for the decomposition process. Furthermore, grass litter was decomposed faster (k value), possibly due to its initial nutrient content and hence litter quality which plays a significant role on decomposition rates.

TI  - Impact of invasive plant management on soil activity and litter decomposition in a tropical forest restoration
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Tropical forest restoration is needed to mitigate the negative consequences of anthropogenic disturbances and climate change. One of the main limitations for the establishment of tropical forests is the competition with invasive species decreasing the survival and growth of native trees. Invasion management should affect soil microorganisms, which play essential roles in nutrient cycling, plant nutrition and on ecosystem functioning. Although chemical and nonchemical methods are applied worldwide to herbaceous invasion management, their impacts on soil microbial biomass, respiration and litter decomposition have yet to be measured over longer timeframes (>3 months) after application. Using a 3-year-old tropical forest restoration managed through chemical (herbicide pulverization) or nonchemical (mowing) treatments, and a secondary native forest patch nearby used as reference, we measured (1) soil microbial biomass and (2) basal soil respiration over 6 months, and on (3) litter decomposition over 1 year, after one management. We used mixed models to test whether management affected the response variables and found that chemical management resulted in lower microbial biomass and respiration after 5 months. Similarly, after 1 year, litter decomposition rate under chemical management was lower than that in the nonchemical and in the control. Chemical management effects on soil activity and litter decomposition should be considered when choosing suitable methods and its frequency to manage invasion, targeting the success of native trees and general ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Forest Fragmentation and Ecosystem Function
T2  - GLOBAL FOREST FRAGMENTATION
AB  - Urbanization and the spread of agriculture have resulted in high levels of forest loss and fragmentation in many regions of the world. The impact of this anthropogenic fragmentation on ecological functioning has been poorly studied. This chapter assesses the responses of selected plant- and animal-mediated processes to forest fragmentation. Although the number of studies concentrating on different processes is highly variable, with some processes (e.g. nutrient cycling and dung removal) being relatively better studied than others (e.g. predation and parasitism), tentative general insights from recent research include the following: (i) the severity and direction of fragmentation effects are influenced by the individual species involved, the environment and other contributory factors (e.g. surrounding matrix habitat quality); (ii) while processes heavily influenced by larger species are likely to respond negatively to fragmentation, others influenced by a wider range of biotic and abiotic factors are less predictable; (iii) trophic cascades may result in the impacts on one trophic level affecting other parts of the ecosystem; and (iv) the impacts of fragmentation are often exacerbated by synergistic effects such as interactions with the matrix and increased hunting pressures within fragments. Understanding the nature of ecosystem functioning and how functioning becomes disrupted with habitat conversion by combining spatial network models and long-term experimental studies will allow us to predict the eventual trajectories of ecosystems and determine possible remedial actions to preserve healthy functioning ecosystems.

TI  - Tree functional diversity affects litter decomposition and arthropod community composition in a tropical forest
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Disturbance can alter tree species and functional diversity in tropical forests, which in turn could affect carbon and nutrient cycling via the decomposition of plant litter. However, the influence of tropical tree diversity on forest floor organisms and the processes they mediate are far from clear. We investigated the influence of different litter mixtures on arthropod communities and decomposition processes in a 60-year-old lowland tropical forest in Panama, Central America. We used litter mixtures representing pioneer and old growth tree species in experimental mesocosms to assess the links between litter types, decomposition rates, and litter arthropod communities. Overall, pioneer species litter decomposed most rapidly and old growth species litter decomposed the slowest but there were clear nonadditive effects of litter mixtures containing both functional groups. We observed distinct arthropod communities in different litter mixtures at 6 mo, with greater arthropod diversity and abundance in litter from old growth forest species. By comparing the decay of different litter mixtures in mesocosms and conventional litterbags, we demonstrated that our mesocosms represent an effective approach to link studies of litter decomposition and arthropod communities. Our results indicate that changes in the functional diversity of litter could have wider implications for arthropod communities and ecosystem functioning in tropical forests.

TI  - Identifying and Comparing Easily Accessible Frameworks for Assessing Soil Organic Matter Functioning
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) stocks are crucial for soil fertility and food provision and also contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigation. However, assessing SOM changes in cropping systems is difficult due to the varying quantity and quality of input data. SOM processes have been described by several models, but these are complex and require high amounts of input data. In this work, we identified and selected frameworks that simulate SOM pools and stocks as well as the effects of different management practices. We also required that the frameworks be easily accessible for farm-related end users and require limited and accessible amounts of input data. In all, six frameworks met our inclusion criteria: SOCRATES (Soil Organic Carbon Reserves and Transformations in EcoSystems), CCB (CANDY and-Carbon Balance), AMG, CENTURY, CQESTR, and RothC (Rothamsted Carbon Model). We collected information on these frameworks and compared them in terms of their accessibility, the model time steps used, the nutrient cycles included in the simulation, the number of SOM pools, and the agricultural management options included. Our results showed that CCB was the most robust of the frameworks considered, while AMG, CQESTR, and RothC performed the least well. However, all frameworks have strengths which may match the specific requirements and abilities of individual users.

TI  - Spatial variation of dung beetle assemblages associated with forest structure in remnants of southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENTOMOLOGIA
AB  - The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is one of the world's biodiversity hotspots, and is currently highly fragmented and disturbed due to human activities. Variation in environmental conditions in the Atlantic Forest can influence the distribution of species, which may show associations with some environmental features. Dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) are insects that act in nutrient cycling via organic matter decomposition and have been used for monitoring environmental changes. The aim of this study is to identify associations between the spatial distribution of dung beetle species and Atlantic Forest structure. The spatial distribution of some dung beetle species was associated with structural forest features. The number of species among the sampling sites ranged widely, and few species were found in all remnant areas. Principal coordinates analysis indicated that species composition, abundance and biomass showed a spatially structured distribution, and these results were corroborated by permutational multivariate analysis of variance. The indicator value index and redundancy analysis showed an association of several dung beetle species with some explanatory environmental variables related to Atlantic Forest structure. This work demonstrated the existence of a spatially structured distribution of dung beetles, with significant associations between several species and forest structure in Atlantic Forest remnants from Southern Brazil.

TI  - How good are tropical forest patches for ecosystem services provisioning?
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB  - Native forests play an important role regarding ecosystem services related to biodiversity, water, and nutrient cycling, and the intensity of those services should be related to the amount, configuration and quality of the forest. However, in highly dynamic landscapes, such as some tropical regions, ecosystem services are potentially affected not only by the present landscape structure, but also by the historical land use. Here we propose a simple methodological framework to evaluate the contribution of past landscape dynamics and present landscape structure in the provision of ecosystem services. We applied this framework to a traditional agricultural landscape from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest hotspot, where natural forests cover has increased from 8 to 16 % in the last 60 years (1962-2008), and where old forests are being reduced while young forests are being regenerated. Forests of different ages, in association with current landscape structure, reveal a mosaic of forest patches under different conditions, implying different abilities to deliver ecosystem services. With the replacement of old-growth forests by young-regenerating forests and a high level of forest fragmentation, less than 1/4 of the current forest cover is able to fully satisfy the ecosystem service demands. To avoid such tendency, government policies should not only focus on increasing forest cover, but also in conserving old-growth forest fragments or increasing forest quality. The proposed methodology allows integrating historical land use and current landscape structure to evaluate ecosystem services provision and can be useful to establish programs of payment for ecosystem services.

TI  - Assessing the value of secondary forest for amphibians:: Eleutherodactylus frogs in a gradient of forest alteration
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
CP  - 7th INTECOL International Wetland Conference
AB  - Secondary forests constitute a growing portion of forested areas worldwide. They might have a substantial role for the conservation of biodiversity in tropical areas, but there is little information on their potential to support forest species and the recovery of faunal communities. We studied two forest frogs (Eleutherodactylus diastema and E. fitzingeri) in an area of Costa Rica composed of a mosaic of primary forest, young secondary forest and pasture, and we compared the density of calling males in areas with different forest alteration. Autoregressive models were used to compensate for potentially undesired effects of spatial autocorrelation and pseudoreplication. Both species were most abundant in riparian, primary forest. However, E. fitzingeri was also abundant in riparian secondary forests, and its density far from the river was similar in primary and secondary forest, suggesting that river proximity can influence the recovery of secondary forest for amphibians. Conversely, the density of E. diastema was similar in secondary forest and pasture, stressing interspecific differences for recovery rate. These frogs have a keystone role in nutrient cycling and food webs, and their prompt recovery might represent an important step for the functional recovery of forests. Nevertheless, the strong interspecific differences stress the complexity of these processes.

TI  - Enhancement effects of mangrove restoration on blue carbon storage in Qinzhou Bay
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Introduction: Mangroves are the main carbon sinks in tropical regions and have high capabilities for carbon sequestration. Protection and restoration of mangroves are necessary to reduce carbon emissions and fight climate change. While the Qinzhou Bay as the main area of national mangrove restoration plan in the future, studies on its carbon pools, especially assessment of the carbon sink enhancement effect of restored mangroves along forest chronosequence, are lacking.
   Methods: This study aimed to quantify the changes in restored mangrove soil carbon stock, vegetation and root carbon stocks along the forest age sequence in Qinzhou Bay through field survey.
   Results: The results revealed that the carbon stocks of vegetation and roots significantly increased with the developing forest age. Only in the soil layer above 30 cm, the soil carbon storage apparently increased with the developing forest age in non-cofferdam area, and then decreased slowly after reaching the peak (at 6 similar to 8 years). Moreover, the soil carbon storage of mangroves was greater in the cofferdam area than in the non-cofferdam area.
   Discussion: This implied that the cofferdam restoration efforts may be more effective in enhancing blue carbon storage, during the initial stages of the restoration process. The results of this study suggested that mangrove restoration has substantial potential capacity in carbon storage and nutrient cycling, providing a reference for the protection and restoration efforts concerning mangroves.

TI  - The extent of 2014 forest fragmentation in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB  - Despite a 79% reduction in deforestation rates since 2004 in the Brazilian Amazon, the current gross forest loss of 6207 km(2) year(-1) remains significant, promoting continuous habitat fragmentation. This study assessed the status of forest fragmentation in 2014 across the Brazilian Amazon applying a Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA). Our analysis provides the first 60-m-resolution fragmentation map for the entire Brazilian Amazon, including not only the commonly evaluated fragmentation classes such as core, edge and islet, but also four specific metrics measuring the effects of fragmentation on forest patterns (perforation, bridge, loop and forest branches). Areas of intense forest fragmentation were detected not only along the "arc of deforestation" of the eastern and southern Brazilian Amazon but in other regions as well. Considering a 1020-m edge width, we found that 28% (similar to 891,000 km(2)) of the remnant forest was in non-core classes. Among these classes, bridge (i.e., forest corridors too narrow to contain core area) was the most representative (10.8%). The proportion of core area varied greatly among states, from 82.8% of the remaining forest in Amazonas to 26.1 and 13.5% in Maranho and Tocantins, respectively. The detailed diagnosis of tropical forest fragmentation is a critical step for proposing solutions to maintain the stability of tropical forest services, including carbon storage, water and nutrient cycling, and biodiversity.

TI  - Fine root biomass stocks but not the production and turnover rates vary with the age of tropical successional forests in Southern Mexico
T2  - RHIZOSPHERE
AB  - Fine root production, turnover, and decomposition are fundamental rhizosphere processes that can vary when young forest ecosystems pass through different phases of succession towards maturity. To assess these changes during succession, we applied ingrowth bag and sequential coring methods for fine root production and a modified negative exponential model for fine root decomposition at four phases of tropical forest chronosequence: 1) young secondary forests of about 8 years, 2) medium secondary forests of 15 years, 3) advanced secondary forests of 25 years, and 4) old-growth primary forests of > 100 years. Primary forests stored higher fine root biomass than secondary forests but the average fine root productivity did not differ statistically between successional phases. Fine root turnover rates were > 1 yr(-1) for all the phases of succession, indicating that the turnover was higher than the standing fine root biomass. Fine root decay models showed that the decomposition rates did not differ significantly between successional phases. Furthermore, fine root production and mortality correlated positively to soil organic carbon concentrations. Our results showed that fine root productivity and turnover rates in secondary forests get to PF level from the younger phases of succession. The results have important implications in understanding the successional patterns regarding belowground resource allocation, nutrient turnover, and soil organic carbon sequestration in the constantly changing tropical forests ecosystems.

TI  - Dung beetles as hydrological engineers: effects of tunnelling on soil infiltration
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - 1. Soil infiltration capacity determines the partitioning of precipitation into infiltration and overland flow and is therefore an important soil hydrological characteristic. Water infiltration through soil is facilitated by macropores created by roots and soil macrofauna. In clay-rich soils, such as those of the tropical forests of Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, most infiltration occurs via these preferential flow pathways. 2. We evaluated the effects of dung beetle tunnelling on infiltration and macropore creation (depth and width of the flow pathways) in tropical forest soils in Sabah. Using mesocosms, we applied three treatments (i) soil-only, (ii) dung-only, (iii) dung + dung beetles, and measured saturated hydraulic conductivity (i.e., the steady-state infiltration rate) after 0, 5 and 10 days, and assessed depth and width of infiltration pathways by applying a blue dye tracer. 3. The steady-state infiltration rate increased in the presence of dung beetles, though differences among treatments were only statistically significant after 10 days. After 5 days of dung beetle presence, infiltrated water had reached a greater depth than the control mesocosms without beetles. However, there were no differences in the width of infiltration pathways among treatments. 4. These results reveal the important, but under studied roles of dung beetles on soil hydrological functioning, that may have consequences for nutrient cycling and plant productivity. Further, our findings indicate that the novel application of an established hydrological method-blue dye tracer-can provide interesting and reliable results for macrofauna-soil interaction studies.

TI  - Invertebrate-Mediated Ecosystem Processes are Resilient to Disturbance Across a Land-Use Gradient in Borneo
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - A fundamental challenge for ecologists is to evaluate the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on ecosystem processes and functions. Tropical rainforests in Borneo are biologically diverse and provide an array of ecosystem functions and services. However, these forests are being logged and converted to agricultural plantations at a rapid pace. While there are numerous studies on the impacts of these land-use changes on biodiversity, there are far fewer that investigate the consequences of forest disturbance for ecosystem functioning. We investigated the impacts of land-use change in Bornean tropical rainforests on invertebrate-mediated functions using a suite of six easily measurable processes that are linked to nutrient cycling and plant regeneration, and which can be used as indicators of the degree of disturbance and the health of the forest. We explored whether the conversion of primary forest to logged, fragmented forest or agricultural plantations altered the ecosystem processes of dung removal, predation of insect herbivores, functional activity of soil invertebrates, bioturbation, seed removal, and decomposition. Overall, ecosystem processes remained resistant to habitat change except for seed removal, which was lower in heavily logged forests and plantations than in primary forests. This suggests that, despite the loss of many species when forests are logged and converted to agriculture, ecosystem processes provided by invertebrates can remain robust across land-use gradients.

TI  - Variable Responses of Lowland Tropical Forest Nutrient Status to Fertilization and Litter Manipulation
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Predicting future impacts of anthropogenic change on tropical forests requires a clear understanding of nutrient constraints on productivity. We compared experimental fertilization and litter manipulation treatments in an old-growth lowland tropical forest to distinguish between the effects of inorganic nutrient amendments and changes in nutrient cycling via litterfall. We measured the changes in soil and litter nutrient pools, litterfall, and fine root biomass in plots fertilized with nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), or potassium (K), and in litter addition and litter removal treatments during 7 years. Soil inorganic N and litter N increased in double-litter plots but not in N-fertilized plots. Conversely, litter P and soil pools of P and K increased in fertilized plots but not in the double-litter plots. Soil and litter pools of N and K decreased in the no-litter plots. Changes in litterfall with added nutrients or litter were only marginally significant, but fine root biomass decreased with both the litter and the K addition. Differences between the two experiments are mostly attributable to the coupled cycling of carbon and nutrients in litter. Increased nutrient inputs in litter may improve plant uptake of some nutrients compared to fertilization with similar amounts. The litter layer also appears to play a key role in nutrient retention. We discuss our findings in the context of possible impacts of anthropogenic change on tropical forests.

TI  - Secondary tropical forests recover dung beetle functional diversity and trait composition
T2  - ANIMAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Secondary forests dominate some human-modified tropical biomes, and this is expected to increase via both abandonment of marginal agricultural land as well as forest and landscape restoration programmes. A key question is whether promoting the recovery and protection of secondary tropical forests will return invertebrate functional diversity and associated functional traits. Dung beetles are ideal for assessing functional diversity as they play vital roles in several ecosystem functions, including seed dispersal, nutrient cycling and bioturbation. We examined how taxonomic and functional diversity, and the functional trait composition of native dung beetle species recovers in naturally regenerating secondary forests in comparison to both cattle pastures and primary forest in the Colombian Choco-Andes, a global hotspot of threatened biodiversity. Using a space-for-time approach, we found that taxonomic and functional diversity recovered to levels comparable to primary forest within approximately 30 years of secondary forest regrowth. Functional richness and FD, measures of the diversity of traits present in a community, were similar in secondary and primary forest, but significantly lower in pasture. Rolling dung beetle species were positively associated with forest habitats, particularly primary, while dwelling species were more common in pasture. Thus, the functional trait composition of secondary forests was more similar to primary forest than to pasture. The ability of secondary forests to rapidly accumulate primary-forest dung beetle functional diversity, and a representative suite of functional traits, provides an opportunity to protect biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, especially in regions where marginal agricultural land allows cost-effective conservation actions.

TI  - Leaf litter fungi in a Central Amazonian forest: the influence of rainfall, soil and topography on the distribution of fruiting bodies
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Fungi are important components of tropical ecosystems, especially in the recycling of nutrients. However, there is little information on how fungal diversity is structured at scales suitable to plan their conservation. We tested if the distribution of fruiting bodies of litter fungi was random in the landscape (over 25 km(2)) in a tropical evergreen forest in Central Amazonia. We used linear regressions to evaluate the influence of rainfall, soil characteristics and topography on morphospecies richness and composition. Fungi were collected twice in thirty 0.25 x 250 m plots. Short-term rainfall was represented by the cumulative rainfall in the three days before each plot was surveyed. Plots were classified in two groups based on cumulative rainfall. Clay content in soil and rainfall influenced morphospecies richness, but responses to edaphic factors depended on rainfall. Wetter periods apparently decreased limiting moisture conditions in higher areas, allowing fungal activity and fruiting body production. Morphospecies composition was influenced by clay content, but influence on fungi was probably indirect as clay content was correlated with altitude, plant community and nitrogen availability. Our results suggest that the species of litter fungi are not randomly distributed in the landscape. Furthermore, they indicate that it is viable to conduct mesoscale evaluations of fungal diversity, if the temporal and spatial variation and their interaction are taken into account.

TI  - COMPARISON OF TROPICAL TREE PLANTATIONS WITH SECONDARY FORESTS OF SIMILAR AGE
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS
AB  - The structure and dynamics of small plantations of pine (Pinus caribaea; 4 and 18.5 yr old in 1980) and mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla; 17 and 49 yr old in 1980) were compared with those of paired secondary forest stands of similar age and growing adjacent to each other under similar edaphic and climatic conditions. The study was conducted in the Luquillo Experimental Forest between 1980 and 1984. Comparisons included a variety of demographic, production, and nutrient cycling characteristics of stands. Although the small unmanaged plantations had a lower number of species in understory than paired secondary forests, the understory of the older plantations developed high species richness, including many of native tree species. After 17 yr, native tree species invaded the overstory of plantations. After 50 years the species richness in the understory of a mahogany plantation approached that of its paired secondary forest. Plantation understories had important ecological roles, including high nutrient accumulation. Understory plant tissue, particularly leaf litter, had higher nutrient concentration pine plantations than in paired secondary forests. Understory biomass in plantations accumulated a higher proportion of the total nutrient inventory in the stand than did the understory in paired secondary forests. Plantations had higher aboveground biomass and net aboveground biomass production than paired secondary forests. Higher root densities and biomass were found in secondary forests as were greater depth of root penetration, higher nutrient concentration in roots, and more microsites where roots grow, than paired plantations.
   These characteristics may improve the capacity of secondary forests relative to that of paired plantations to rapidly recapture nutrients that become available by mineralization and that could otherwise be lost through hydrological or gaseous pathways. Both forest types accumulated nutrients and mass, but secondary forests recirculated nutrients much faster than the plantations, which tended to store the nutrients. Plantations had higher leaf fall and total litterfall, had litterfall with lower nutrient concentrations, accumulated more nutrients in litter, decomposed more litter on an annual basis, exhibited more variation in the spatial distribution of litter mass, and had more month-to-month variation in litter storage than paired secondary forests. Litter of the secondary forests, on the other hand, had a faster nutrient turnover than plantation litter, though plantations retranslocated more nutrients before leaf fall than did secondary forests. Nutrient retranslocation increased with plantation age. Plantations, particularly pine plantations, produced more litter mass per unit nutrient return than did paired secondary forests. Total nutrient storage in soil gave the best correlation with nutrient use efficiency estimated as element:mass ratios in various compartments. Nutrient use efficiency ranked differently among forest pairs, depending upon which nutrient and ecosystem parameters were being compared. Because of high retranslocation of nutrients, and in spite of greater nutrient "need" to produce higher biomass, plantations had nutrient demands on soil similar to paired secondary forests. Among the ecosystem parameters measured, nutrients in leaf fall correlated best with differences in soil nutrients across stands. Nutrient concentrations in understory species appeared to be a sensitive indicator of whole-stand nutrient use efficiency. Some of the observations of the study could be attributed to intrinsic differences between small unmanaged plantations and secondary forests, but many could be explained by species differences (i.e., timing of leaf fall), age of plantation (i.e., accumulation of biomass or species), or the relative importance of angiosperms and gymnosperms (i.e., nutritional quality of litter). The study challenges the conventional dogma with respect to differences between plantations and native successional ecosystems and underscores the dangers of generalizing about all tropical tree plantations or all natural tropical forests, or even extrapolating from one sector of the ecosystem to another.

TI  - The effects of rainfall and vegetation on litterfall production in the semiarid region of northeastern Brazil
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
AB  - Litterfall has a strong influence on biodiversity and on the chemical and physical characteristics of the soil. Its production can be quite variable over time and space, and can be influenced by both natural and anthropogenic factors. We evaluated litterfall production and its relationship with rainfall, species richness, and the densities of the arboreal vegetation. Thirty litter traps were constructed with 1.0 m(2) nylon mesh (1.0 mm) and randomly installed within a 2000 m x 500 m area of arboreal/shrub Caatinga (dryland) vegetation. Litter samples were collected monthly from November/2010 to June/2012, and the collected material was classified, dried, and weighted. Species richness and tree densities were determined by conducting phytosociological surveys in 20 m x 20 m plots surrounding each of the litter traps. The litterfall accumulation rate was 3.673 Mgha(-1)yr(-1), similar to values from other seasonally dry tropical forests. Litterfall production was continuous, and principally accompanied the rainfall rate, but with a time interval of 2 to 3 months, with the greatest accumulation at the beginning of the dry season and the least during the rainy season. The different fractions of materials demonstrated distinct accumulation rates, with leaves being the principal category. Litterfall production was found to be related to tree density, but no link was found to species richness. The observed temporal heterogeneity of litterfall production demonstrated a strong link between rainfall and the dynamics of nutrient cycling in the semiarid region of Brazil.

TI  - Mine land rehabilitation: Modern ecological approaches for more sustainable mining
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Despite the urgent demand for sustainable mining, the revegetation and rehabilitation of areas degraded by mining activities remain challenging. Uncertainties about species selection, the management and control of alien invasive species and monitoring procedures require ongoing multidisciplinary research. Modern functional and phylogenetic approaches in community ecology represent powerful tools to enhance the entire rehabilitation process and to overcome these challenges, but methodologies that incorporate up-to-date phylogenetic information or knowledge about intraspecific variation along rehabilitation trajectories must be developed. Functional and phylogenetic criteria may play an especially important role in guiding the definition of faster-growing, more resistant species mixtures that can be applied in mine land revegetation and rehabilitation. Limiting similarity approaches may help to reduce biological invasions, enabling native vegetation to outcompete alien invasive species and aiding in the development of enduring mechanisms for controlling such species in rehabilitated mine land. Finally, incorporating phylogenetic and functional aspects into monitoring of the success of mine land rehabilitation with additional tools, such as remote sensing or metabarcoding, can enrich scientific knowledge about ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling, community assembly and resource availability while providing sound information about the success of revegetation activities. In the middle to long term, research activities on these topics can provide valuable technical recommendations for all aspects of the management of rehabilitated ecosystems, thus contributing to more sustainable mining.

TI  - Edaphic attributes indicative of edge effect in Semideciduous tropical forest
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Deforestation of native ecosystems causes microclimatic changes at the edge of the remaining forest fragments. This "edge effect" can modify soil attributes, although there is little information on this. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the edge effect on soil microclimate conditions, chemical, microbiological and arthropod community attributes and their relationship with litter attributes in a fragment of Semideciduous Seasonal Forest, in Pirai, RJ, Brazil. In the middle of the dry period (June/2019), four ranges of distances parallel to each other were established from the edge of the forest fragment: Edge: 0 m; Range 1: 50 m; Range 2: 100 m; and Interior: 160 m. In each range, five sampling points were established, spaced 10 m apart, where soil samples were collected in the 0-5 cm layer and litter samples. This material was employed to determine microclimatic, chemical and biological (arthropod community and microbiological attributes) attributes of the soil; and litter stock, concentration and content of nutrients. Forest fragmentation altered litter attributes and consequently soil moisture and nutrients, the communities' attributes of soil arthropods and microorganisms. These modifications in such aspects of nutrient cycling could compromise the forest functioning and the conservation of local biodiversity. Thus, we suggested the planting of non-pioneer native tree species in distances closest to the forest edge and installing of ecological corridors to connect the forest fragment to other remnants, in order to diminish the edge effect.

TI  - Forest cover change and flood hazards in India
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Forests provide numerous environmental services such as watershed protection, nutrient cycling, pollution control, climatic regulation, carbon sequestration, flood mitigation, and protection from storms, landslides, and soil erosion. Degradation of forest resources is likely to cause adverse effects on the economy and environment both locally and globally. Further, it is observed that the natural forests do reduce the frequency and severity of floods as it traps water during heavy rainfall and releases the same slowly into streams reducing the run off. However, this link between forest covers and flood damages is still unclear and yet to be settled in empirical literatures. Also, the protective role of forests in Indian context has remained largely unexplored and this paper attempts to fill this research gap. The objective of this study is, therefore, to examine the impact of forest cover on the extent of flood damage in India controlling various social, economic and demographic aspects. The study uses secondary data across the Indian states for the period 1998-2011. The data were analyzed using the Poisson and ordinary least square (OLS) regression models. The findings suggest that forest cover in India has an inverse relationship with the flood damages. In addition, socio-economic factors such as literacy, per capita net state domestic product and population size have significant influence on the extent of flood damages. Hence, investments in forest protection and regeneration are necessary to restrict flood damages and protect human lives and properties.

TI  - Dynamics of soil and foliar phosphorus fractions in a secondary tropical forest under altered seasonal precipitation patterns
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Background and aimsUnderstanding how altered precipitation patterns affect the dynamics of phosphorus (P) fractions in both soil and foliage is crucial for predicting climate-induced changes in plant growth and community structure, especially within tropical forests with P-impoverished soils.MethodsWe conducted a nine-year precipitation experiment in a secondary tropical forest, simulating delayed (DW) and wetter wet season (WW) to reflect potential precipitation changes. We analyzed P fractions in soil (0-10 cm and 10-20 cm) and foliage of four dominant trees, and investigated the correlations among these P fractions and photosynthesis.ResultsDW treatment reduced soil P bioavailability and induced foliar P redistribution, while WW treatment increased soil pH and NH4+-N content but had little influence on soil P form. DW treatment generally reduced foliar total P levels and diminished various P fractions with notable species-specific disparities. Moreover, DW treatment variably reduced area-based photosynthetic carbon assimilation rates (Aarea), exhibiting species-specific effects, while WW treatment inconsistently elevated Aarea across species. The structural equation model revealed that Aarea was directly influenced by foliar P fractions and photosynthetic nutrient efficiency, and indirectly by precipitation treatment on soil properties and P fractions.ConclusionAltered seasonal precipitation patterns affect soil bioavailable P forms and/or soil chemical properties, and thereby influence foliar P fractions allocation and photosynthesis of dominant trees. Soil and foliar P fractions responses to precipitation treatments varied across different sampling months, underscoring the complexity of P cycle and suggesting tree acclimation and resilience. These insights improve our understanding of climate effects on nutrient cycles and resilience.

TI  - Insights of Forest Dynamics for the Regional Ecological Fragility Assessment
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Forest ecosystems play a vital role in sustaining various life forms on the earth. These ecosystems support society through the provision of goods (timber, fuelwood, etc.) and an array of ecological services (carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling, etc.). However, unplanned developmental activities have been affecting the ecological integrity evident from the fragmentation of forests, barren hilltops, conversion of perennial streams to intermittent or seasonal streams, etc. During the past three decades, forests have undergone major transitions with the breaking of contiguous native forests into small parcels of land, restricting the movement of species thereby limiting the potential of species for dispersal and colonization. This paper analyzes the landscape dynamics and spatial patterns of forests fragmentation of Shimoga District, Central Western Ghats and prioritizes ecologically fragile or Ecologically Sensitive regions (ESR) at village levels based on bio-geo-climatic-social variables with the land use dynamics considering temporal remote sensing data. Results revealed that there was a net loss of 10% in forest cover from 43.83% (1973) to 34.02% (2018), primarily caused by the expansion of agriculture, horticulture, and forest plantations. Forest fragmentation has increased, evident from the decline of the interior forest to an extent of 11% from 26% (1973-2018). ESR prioritization at village level in the Shimoga district considering the ecological, geo-climatic and social variables indicate that 11% villages are ESR 1 (highest sensitivity), 30% are in ESR 2 (higher sensitivity), 36% are in ESR 3 (high sensitivity) and the remaining 23% are in ESR 4 or moderate sensitivity category. The analysis illustrates the importance of understanding spatiotemporal patterns of landscape structure for sustainable management of tropical forests.

TI  - The breakdown of ecosystem functionality driven by deforestation in a global biodiversity hotspot
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - The pace of deforestation in tropical forests has achieved unprecedented rates, requiring effective and achievable conservation mitigations that are also easily understood by society and policy makers. In this context, we report the outcomes from a large-scale project located in the threatened Atlantic Forest (SISBIOTA network) to understand how deforestation affects ecological patterns and processes in human-modified landscapes. In particular, we compiled data from 28 studies that evaluated habitat quality, biodiversity maintenance or ecological processes and scrutinised their responses along the gradient of forest loss. After a decade of research effort, we provide evidence of key changes in forest quality, species diversity and ecological processes that are ultimately affecting forest functioning of the remaining patches. As deforestation progresses, we unveiled a clear retraction of local vegetation structure, in which forests become similar to secondary forests, as are characterised by retaining shorter and thinner trees, higher foliage density and increased canopy openness. Besides being hotter, patches embedded within deforested landscapes present reduced quality, evidenced by low fruit production and quality. Such changes cascade to disruptions in biodiversity maintenance and ecological processes. Specifically, forest-specialist species exhibit reduced diversity (e.g., juvenile and adult trees, birds and mammals) and for some groups, are compensated by the increase in habitat-generalist species. Furthermore, forest patches immersed in deforested landscapes experience strong alterations in nutrient cycling and carbon stocks, increase of leaf herbivory, reduction of frugivory, and finally, a simplification in bird-plant interactions. Preventing deforestation is imperative, but restoration and rewilding are also required to safeguard forest-dweller species and, consequently, enable ecological functionality.

TI  - Patterns of deadwood amount and deadwood diversity along a natural forest recovery gradient from agriculture to old-growth lowland tropical forests
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB  - Deadwood is a key component of nutrient cycling in natural tropical forests, serving as a globally important carbon storage and habitat for a high number of species. The conversion of tropical forests to agriculture modifies deadwood pools, but we know little about deadwood dynamics in forests recovering from human disturbance. Here we quantified the volume and diversity of coarse woody debris (CWD, >= 7 cm diameter) and the mass of fine woody debris (FWD, < 7 cm) along a chronosequence of natural forest recovery in the lowlands of the Ecuadorian Choc & oacute; region. We sampled forest plots ranging from 1-37 years of recovery post-cessation of agricultural use as either cacao plantation or cattle pasture, as well as actively managed cacao plantations and cattle pastures, and old-growth forests. In contrast to our expectation, we found no significant increase in deadwood volume with recovery time. The diversity in size, decay stage and type of CWD increased along the recovery gradient, with no effect of previous land use type. The mass of FWD increased overall across the recovery gradient, but these results were driven by a steep increase in former pastures, with no change observed in former cacao plantations. We suggest that the range of sizes and decomposition stages of deadwood found in these two major tropical agricultural systems could provide suitable resources for saproxylic organisms and an overlooked carbon storage outside old-growth forests. Our estimates of deadwood in agricultural systems and recovering forests can help improve global assessments of carbon storage and release in the tropics.

TI  - Organic farming enhances soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics in oil palm crops from Southeast Amazon
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
AB  - The expansion of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq, Arecaceae) crops threatens tropical rainforests. It negatively impacts a series of ecosystem services and functions, including carbon (C) sequestration and dynamics, as well as nutrient cycling. Such negative impacts have pressured companies to adopt conservationist practices in palm oil production. And yet the conversion from conventional to organic farming has gained space in the last decade, studies assessing the effects of organic oil palm crops on ecosystem functioning are still scarce. Here, we assessed how alternative farming practices affect organic matter dynamics in oil palm crops. We compared oil palm crops under conventional (CP) and organic (OP) farming in Southeast Amazon. We also sampled lowland dense ombrophilous forest (floresta densa de terra firme, FT) as reference. Soils were sampled at 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm depth intervals to determine soil physical-chemical properties and C and nitrogen (N) concentrations and stocks. The highest soil C and N concentrations were found at 0-10 cm interval in CP and OP. We detected no variation in soil C and N stocks within depth intervals in FT and CP, while OP had higher soil C and N stocks at the 0-10 cm interval. When comparing OP and CP crops, soil C concentrations and stocks did not vary within zones or depth intervals. All OP zones had higher soil N concentrations and stocks than their conventional counterparts, and we found a variation within depth intervals. Our results show that organic farming has positively influenced organic matter dynamics. Organic oil palm crops preserved and even increased C and N sequestration.

TI  - The Influence of Bioclimates and Soil Physicochemical Properties on Bacterial and Archaeal Communities from Forest Ecosystems in Côte d'Ivoire (West Africa)
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Archaea and bacteria communities play pivotal roles in tropical forest ecosystems' functioning, especially nutrient cycling, plant phenology, and health. The objective of this study was to explore the diversity of archaeal and bacterial communities in forest soil ecosystem of Cote d'Ivoire and to identify abiotic factors that influence their composition. Using high-throughput amplicon sequencing targeting the V4V5 hypervariable region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, we analyzed 22 soil samples taken from the 2 main forest areas of Cote d'Ivoire, namely the semi-deciduous moist forest and the evergreen moist forest, both of which are located in the humid and sub-humid areas of the country. The analysis revealed that the biodiversity at the phyla level was congruent with previous studies. Richness and Shannon diversity indices revealed the dominance of bacteria over archaea in all studied soils. Moreover, the predominant bacterial community consisted of Proteobacteria (29.8%), Acidobacteria (15.5%), and Actinobacteria (14.2%), while the archaeal community was dominated by Thaumarchaeota (1.93%). However, at the genus level, patterns emerged. The most abundant and ubiquitous members at the genus level included Bradyrhizobium, Rhodoplanes, Bacillus (bacteria), and Nitrosophaera (archaea). While bacterial core microbiome members were found in almost all soils, Nitrososphaera genus were selective to sub-humid bioclimate and cropland land use. These patterns were correlated to the soils' physicochemical characteristics, bioclimate, and land use. This study sheds light on the intricate relationships between abiotic factors and microbial communities in Cote d'Ivoire's forest soils and helps to identify keys species for future soil management.

TI  - Can mammals thrive near urban areas in the Neotropics? Characterizing the community of a reclaimed tropical forest
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Mammals figure prominently in tropical ecology because of their role in seed dispersal, herbivore control, and nutrient cycling. Urbanization is a conservation concern for mammals not only because of lost habitat, but also other negative impacts such as illegal hunting and pollution. Some mammals are resilient to urbanization and can persist in degraded habitats; however, this has not been studied in many tropical sites. We used camera traps to study mammals in Peperpot Nature Park (PNP), a secondary forest located 5 km from the capital of Suriname, and compared it to the large Central Suriname Nature Reserve (CSNR). We found fewer species in PNP (20) compared to CSNR (30), however, PNP included apex predators and species of conservation concern, and the two sites had a similar relative abundance of large cats and most mesocarnivores. Smaller mammal species had higher relative abundance at PNP while larger herbivores were scarce or absent, likely from poaching, as PNP is still connected to interior forests. The detection models revealed that the park, the camera trap was set in, was the most common significant factor for most species, suggesting that broader landscape level effects are important. In occupancy models, the null model was the most common top model across species, but then followed by park. Despite fewer species being detected than in large protected areas, the presence of some species in PNP which are historically absent in developed areas shows promise for small urban tropical forests to support robust mammal communities, provided they maintain some connectivity to larger source habitats.

TI  - Litterfall Dynamics Under Different Tropical Forest Restoration Strategies in Costa Rica
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - In degraded tropical pastures, active restoration strategies have the potential to facilitate forest regrowth at rates that are faster than natural recovery, enhancing litterfall, and nutrient inputs to the forest floor. We evaluated litterfall and nutrient dynamics under four treatments: plantation (entire area planted), tree islands (planting in six patches of three sizes), control (same age natural regeneration), and young secondary forest (7-9-yr-old natural regeneration). Treatments were established in plots of 50 x 50 m at six replicate sites in southern Costa Rica and the annual litterfall production was measured 5 yr after treatment establishment. Planted species included two native timber-producing hardwoods (Terminalia amazonia and Vochysia guatemalensis) interplanted with two N-fixing species (Inga edulis and Erythrina poeppigiana). Litter production was highest in secondary forests (7.3 Mg/ha/yr) and plantations (6.3), intermediate in islands (3.5), and lowest in controls (1.4). Secondary forests had higher input of all nutrients except N when compared with the plantation plots. Inga contributed 70 percent of leaffall in the plantations, demonstrating the influence that one species can have on litter quantity and quality. Although tree islands had lower litterfall rates, they were similar to plantations in inputs of Mg, K, P, Zn, and Mn. Tree islands increased litter production and nutrient inputs more quickly than natural regeneration. In addition to being less resource intensive than conventional plantations, this planting design promotes a more rapid increase in litter diversity and more spatial heterogeneity, which can accelerate the rate of nutrient cycling and facilitate forest recovery.

TI  - Litterfall and nutrient dynamics shift in tropical forest restoration sites after a decade of recovery
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Multi-year studies comparing changes in litterfall biomass and nutrient inputs in sites under different restoration practices are lacking. We evaluated litterfall dynamics and nutrient inputs at 5yr and after a decade of recovery in four treatments (natural regenerationno planting, plantationentire area planted, tree islandsplanting in patches, and reference forest) at multiple sites in an agricultural landscape in southern Costa Rica. We inter-planted two native species (Terminalia amazonia and Vochysia guatemalensis) and two naturalized N-fixing species (Inga edulis and Erythrina poeppigiana) in plantation and island treatments. Although litterfall N was higher in plantations in the first sampling period, litter production and overall inputs of C, N, Ca, Mg, P, Cu, Mn, and Fe did not differ between island, plantation, or reference forest after a decade; however, all were greater than in natural regeneration. Potassium inputs were lower in the natural regeneration, intermediate in island and plantation, and greater in reference forest. The percentage of litterfall comprised by the N-fixing planted species declined by nearly two-thirds in both plantations and islands between sampling periods, while the percentage of V.guatemalensis more than doubled, and the percentage from naturally regenerated species increased from 27 to 47 percent in islands. Island and plantation treatments were equally effective at restoring litterfall and nutrient inputs to levels similar to the reference system. The nutrient input changed substantially over the 7-yr interval between measurements, reflecting shifts in vegetation composition and demonstrating how rapidly nutrient cycling dynamics can change in recovering forests.
   Resumen Los estudios a largo plazo que comparan los cambios en biomasa de hojarasca y en aportes de nutrientes en sitios bajo diferentes practicas de restauracion son escasos. Este trabajo evaluo la dinamica de la hojarasca y la disponibilidad de nutrientes a los 5 anos y despues de una decada en cuatro tratamientos de restauracion: regeneracion natural (sin plantar), plantacion (toda la superficie plantada), islas de arboles (plantas en seis parches) y bosque de referencia en multiples sitios en un paisaje agricola en el sur de Costa Rica. Se intercalaron dos especies nativas (Terminalia amazonia y Vochysia guatemalensis) y dos especies naturalizadas fijadoras de nitrogeno (Inga edulis y Erythrina poeppigiana) en los tratamientos plantacion e islas. Aunque el aporte de N en la hojarasca fue mas alto en plantacion en la primera evaluacion, la produccion de hojarasca y en general los aportes totales de C, N, Ca, Mg, P, Cu, Mn y Fe no difirieron entre los tratamientos de isla, plantacion o el bosque de referencia despues de una decada; sin embargo, todos fueron mayores que en la regeneracion natural. Los aportes de K fueron menores en la regeneracion natural, intermedios en la isla y plantacion, y mayores en el bosque de referencia. El porcentaje de hojarasca compuesto por especies fijadoras de N plantadas disminuyo casi dos tercios del primero al segundo periodo de muestreo, mientras que para V.guatemalensis fue mas del doble en plantaciones e islas, y el porcentaje producido por especies de regeneracion natural aumento de 27 a 47% en islas. Los tratamientos de isla y plantacion fueron igualmente efectivos para restaurar los aportes de hojarasca y nutrientes a niveles similares al sistema de referencia. El aporte de nutrientes cambio sustancialmente durante el intervalo de 7 anos entre mediciones, reflejando cambios en la composicion de la vegetacion, lo que demuestra la rapidez con que la dinamica del ciclo de nutrientes puede cambiar en bosques en recuperacion.

TI  - Automated method for measuring the extent of selective logging damage with airborne LiDAR data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Selective logging has an impact on the global carbon cycle, as well as on the forest micro-climate, and longer-term changes in erosion, soil and nutrient cycling, and fire susceptibility. Our ability to quantify these impacts is dependent on methods and tools that accurately identify the extent and features of logging activity. LiDAR-based measurements of these features offers significant promise. Here, we present a set of algorithms for automated detection and mapping of critical features associated with logging roads/decks, skid trails, and gaps- using commercial airborne LiDAR data as input. The automated algorithm was applied to commercial LiDAR data collected over two logging concessions in Kalimantan, Indonesia in 2014. The algorithm results were compared to measurements of the logging features collected in the field soon after logging was complete. The automated algorithm-mapped road deck and skid trail features match closely with features measured in the field, with agreement levels ranging from 69% to 99% when adjusting for GPS location error. The algorithm performed most poorly with gaps, which, by their nature, are variable due to the unpredictable impact of tree fall versus the linear and regular features directly created by mechanical means. Overall, the automated algorithm performs well and offers significant promise as a generalizable tool useful to efficiently and accurately capture the effects of selective logging, including the potential to distinguish reduced impact logging from conventional logging.

TI  - The impact of cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.) on biological activity, nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration in tropical soil
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION
AB  - The capacity of trees to act as a long-term reservoir for the sequestration of atmospheric carbon is crucial for mitigating the adverse effects of climate change. Quantifying biomass and carbon accumulation is crucial for sustainable land management practices in tropical regions. Cashew, an important tree crop in tropical areas, can sequester carbon while providing farmers a means of subsistence. This study aims to evaluate the carbon sequestration potential of cashew plantations in weathered tropical soils and their impact on soil fertility and biological activity, highlighting the dual benefits of enhancing agricultural sustainability and mitigating climate change. This study reports on the soil and biomass sequestration capacity of cashew plantations raised on weathered tropical soil in India. According to the study, biomass carbon sequestered by a 20-year-old cashew plantation on extensively weathered lateritic soil can range from 42.93 to 50.41 Mg C ha-1, or 157.56 to 184.99 Mg CO2 equivalents. The total quantity of carbon sequestered in the upper 60 cm layer of the soil in a 20-year-old cashew crop ranged from 99.52 to 104.61 Mg ha-1. The soil carbon accumulation was two to three times greater than carbon stored in biomass during the twentieth year of the crop. Overall, a 19% to 37% increase in nutrient content was observed in a 20-year-old cashew plantation compared to the initial nutrient content. The study demonstrated that the plantation of cashew in weathered tropical soil can lead to the sequestration of carbon in soil and biomass and improve fertility and biological activity.

TI  - Functional recovery of secondary tropical forests
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - One-third of all Neotropical forests are secondary forests that regrow naturally after agricultural use through secondary succession. We need to understand better how and why succession varies across environmental gradients and broad geographic scales. Here, we analyze functional recovery using community data on seven plant characteristics (traits) of 1,016 forest plots from 30 chronosequence sites across the Neotropics. By analyzing communities in terms of their traits, we enhance understanding of the mechanisms of succession, assess ecosystem recovery, and use these insights to propose successful forest restoration strategies. Wet and dry forests diverged markedly for several traits that increase growth rate in wet forests but come at the expense of reduced drought tolerance, delay, or avoidance, which is important in seasonally dry forests. Dry and wet forests showed different successional pathways for several traits. In dry forests, species turnover is driven by drought tolerance traits that are important early in succession and in wet forests by shade tolerance traits that are important later in succession. In both forests, deciduous and compound-leaved trees decreased with forest age, probably because microclimatic conditions became less hot and dry. Our results suggest that climatic water availability drives functional recovery by influencing the start and trajectory of succession, resulting in a convergence of community trait values with forest age when vegetation cover builds up. Within plots, the range in functional trait values increased with age. Based on the observed successional trait changes, we indicate the consequences for carbon and nutrient cycling and propose an ecologically sound strategy to improve forest restoration success.

TI  - Termite (Insecta: Isoptera) Species Composition in a Primary Rain Forest and Agroforests in Central Amazonia
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Termites play important roles in organic matter decomposition, nutrient cycling, and soil structure in tropical rain forests. When forests are replaced by agriculture, termite species richness, abundance, and function often decline. We compared the termite assemblage of a primary forest site with that of a low plant diversity, palm-based agroforest (five plant species) and a high plant diversity, home-garden agroforest (10 plant species) using a rapid biodiversity assessment protocol. In comparing the primary forest termite species composition to previously published studies, we found soil feeders and the Apicotermitinae to be more dominant than previously reported in Amazonia. Thirty percent of the species belonged to the Apicotermitinae, and an unusually high percentage (57%) of species were soil feeders. Unexpectedly, the palm-based agroforest, despite its lower plant diversity, was closer to primary forest in termite species composition, rate of species accumulation, and proportions of species in taxonomic and functional classes than was the home-garden agroforest. This suggests that particular plant attributes may better determine the termite assemblage than plant diversity alone in these agroecosystems. Unlike other agroecosystems reported in the literature, Apicotermitinae and soil feeders were proportionally more abundant in these agroforests than in primary forest. The ability of agroforests to support populations of soil feeders has a potentially positive effect on soil fertility in these agroecosystems; insomuch as feeding guild is a proxy for function, these closed-canopy agroforests may be able to sustain the same termite-mediated functions as primary forest.

TI  - Litter mixture effects on decomposition change with forest succession and are influenced by time and soil fauna in tropical mountain Andes
T2  - FOLIA OECOLOGICA
AB  - In highly transformed regions, such as the tropical Andes, identifying the influence of forest succession and soil fauna on non-additive effects of litter decomposition is crucial for gaining a more realistic understanding of carbon dynamics and nutrient cycles. The objective of this paper was to analyze the changes of litter mixture effects on decomposition between different soil fauna treatments (macrofauna inclusion vs macrofauna exclusion) and successional stages (mature forests vs secondary forests) in upper Andean tropical forests along time by using a reciprocal translocation experiment of 1,344 litterbags that ran for 18 months with six common native Andean species. Thought t-tests, linear regressions, and linear mixed models, I found that litter mixture effects vary among sites and increase with time in secondary forests until the year of decomposition in litterbags with macrofauna exclusion. Mature forests exhibited strong antagonistic effects, while pronounced synergistic effects were observed in secondary forests. Although soil macrofauna did not increase significantly litter decomposition and synergistic effects in the mixtures at any of the stages of decay, it is likely that soil macrofauna may impact litter mixtures through top-down effects within soil food webs, rather than exerting a direct effect in the litter consumption as has been reported in tropical lowland ecosystems. Overall, this study supports the idea that litter mixtures exhibit significant variability across sites, can change with successional stage, and are influenced by soil fauna depending on the stage of decay in tropical Andean montane forests.

TI  - Land use change alters functional gene diversity, composition and abundance in Amazon forest soil microbial communities
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB  - Land use change in the Amazon rainforest alters the taxonomic structure of soil microbial communities, but whether it alters their functional gene composition is unknown. We used the highly parallel microarray technology GeoChip 4.0, which contains 83992 probes specific for genes linked nutrient cycling and other processes, to evaluate how the diversity, abundance and similarity of the targeted genes responded to forest-to-pasture conversion. We also evaluated whether these parameters were reestablished with secondary forest growth. A spatially nested scheme was employed to sample a primary forest, two pastures (6 and 38years old) and a secondary forest. Both pastures had significantly lower microbial functional genes richness and diversity when compared to the primary forest. Gene composition and turnover were also significantly modified with land use change. Edaphic traits associated with soil acidity, iron availability, soil texture and organic matter concentration were correlated with these gene changes. Although primary and secondary forests showed similar functional gene richness and diversity, there were differences in gene composition and turnover, suggesting that community recovery was not complete in the secondary forest. Gene association analysis revealed that response to ecosystem conversion varied significantly across functional gene groups, with genes linked to carbon and nitrogen cycling mostly altered. This study indicates that diversity and abundance of numerous environmentally important genes respond to forest-to-pasture conversion and hence have the potential to affect the related processes at an ecosystem scale.

TI  - Teatime on Mount Kilimanjaro: Assessing climate and land-use effects on litter decomposition and stabilization using the Tea Bag Index
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Decomposition is one of the most important processes in ecosystem carbon (C) and nutrient cycles and is a major factor controlling ecosystem functions. The functioning of Afromontane ecosystems and their ability to provide ecosystem services are particularly threatened by climate and land-use change. Our objectives were to assess the effects of climatic conditions (elevation and seasonality) and land-use intensity on litter decomposition and C stabilization in 10 ecosystems along the unique 3,000-m elevation gradient of Mt. Kilimanjaro. Tea Bag Index parameters (decomposition-rate-constant k and stabilization-factor S) were used to quantify decomposition of standardized litter substrate. Nine pairs of tea bags (green and rooibos tea) were exposed in each ecosystem during the short-wet, warm-dry, long-wet and cold-dry season. Decomposition rate increased from k=0.007 in savanna (SAV; 950-m elevation), up to a maximum of k=0.022 in montane cloud forest (2,100m). This was followed by a 50% decrease in (sub-)alpine ecosystems (>4,000m). SAV experienced the strongest seasonal variation, with 23-times higher S values in dry season compared with wet season. The conversion of SAV to maize monocultures (similar to 1,000m) and traditional agroforestry to large-scale coffee plantations (similar to 1,300m) increased mean k values, and stabilization factors were about one-third lower. Forests between 1,900 and 2,100m represent the zone of sufficient moisture and optimal temperature conditions. Seasonal moisture (lower slope) and temperature limitation (alpine zone) decreases litter decomposition. Mt. Kilimanjaro ecosystems are highly sensitive to land-use change, which accelerates ecosystem cycles and decreases C stabilization.

TI  - Plant diversity and local environmental conditions indirectly affect litter decomposition in a tropical forest
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - One of the challenges in predicting the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning is understanding the balance between the importance of various diversity components and variations in the environment. In megadiverse tropical forests, these relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem processes, such as litter decomposition, are poorly explored. While the direct effects of plant diversity on litter decomposition are relatively well known, the indirect effects of diversity, and the local community and microenvironment have rarely been investigated. We evaluated the indirect effects of plant diversity on litter decomposition in a tropical forest. We assessed diversity using different components (plant species richness, functional composition, and functional diversity), evaluated the environmental gradient (soil attributes, topography and canopy cover) and related it to the dynamics of litter decomposition. A 230-day in situ experiment was performed in the southern areas of the Brazilian Atlantic forest using litterbags filled with standard substrate (to test the indirect effects) to evaluate the decomposition rates. In parallel, we also conducted a taxonomic and functional survey of the vegetation in the area of influence of the decomposition experiment. We demonstrated that there is an indirect effect of plant diversity, via taxonomic and functional diversifies, on litter decomposition. The indirect effect is more pronounced at the beginning of the decomposition process, and the influences of different components of diversity and ecological mechanisms (niche complementarity, mass effect and selection effect) vary over time. Our study revealed the importance of not only small-scale variations in the biotic component but also those of soil in ecosystem functioning in a megadiverse forest. In this way, we have contributed to a better understanding of the determinants of the decomposition process, in addition to those suggested by classical theoretical models (i.e., climate, litter composition and decomposers).

TI  - Fire and land use in recent years in the Atlantic Forest in Brazil
T2  - ADVANCES IN FOREST FIRE RESEARCH 2018
CP  - 8th International Conference on Forest Fire Research
AB  - The biome Atlantic Forest in Brazil covers a substantial portion of the country, where a large population and major cities are located. In spite of the substantial influence from human activities, the region is one of the most diverse tropical ecosystems with a large number of endemic species, and it is one of the world's biodiversity hotspot. In this region, fire is an important disturbance, due to its strong effects on nutrient cycling, vegetation succession, and atmospheric emissions of gases and aerosols, and therefore must be considered when planning on the sustainability of the region. This study presents a set of initial analyses of fire occurrence in respect to different types of land cover and use as classified by the recent Brazilian MapBiomas Project (http://mapbiomas.org). Information on fire occurrence are from remote-sensing with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 Active Fire Product. The data on fires data are for years 2001-2017. The selected data on land cover and use are for year 2010, nearly at the middle of the fire data time spam. For analyses, both datasets were aligned in space and aggregated at 0.5-deg spatial resolution. It was found that in average, most of fires happened during months with less precipitation, as expected. In comparison with other major biomes in Brazil, the density of fire detections in the Atlantic Forest was lower, but still a substantial number of fires are detected yearly in the region. Perhaps, more important is the fact that despite of most of fires detected with MODIS occurred in areas dominated by agriculture and pasture (as expected by the general relations between fire and land use in Brazil), a relatively high number of fires were detected in areas dominated by natural forests. That has important consequences for the high interest in conservation of the study region, based on its marked biodiversity and potential for providing relevant ecosystem services to society.

TI  - Impacts of Nitrogen Deposition on Forest Ecosystems in China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC REACTIVE NITROGEN IN CHINA: EMISSION, DEPOSITION AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
AB  - Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition, mainly driven by reactive N emissions from agricultural and industrial activities, has been enhanced dramatically in China. The enhancement of N deposition has aroused increasing concerns about its effects on ecosystem health and function. Forest covers more than one fifth of the national land area in China and provides fundamental ecosystem services. There have been emerging experimental, observational and modelling efforts to assess the impacts of N deposition on forest ecosystems since the 2000s. Here we summarized these research progresses with a focus on the effects of N deposition on soil chemistry and N transformation, soil microorganisms and enzymes, plant physiology, biodiversity and ecosystem carbon (C) balance. Experimental results and modelling estimates generally indicate a fertilization effect of N deposition on forest growth and consequent C sequestration. However, high-level N deposition has been increasingly evidenced to cause N leaching, soil acidification, nutrient imbalance, increased N2O emissions and decreased soil CH4 uptake, which likely offset the positive effect on ecosystem C storage over time. Meanwhile, N deposition has changed both species composition and richness of plant and soil microbial communities, consequently altering C and nutrient cycling. Moreover, the effects of N deposition are likely non-linear with N doses, and thus the assessment on the threshold values for N deposition would have important implications for N emission regulation and forest management options. We conclude that elevated N deposition is altering ecosystem structure and function of China's forests, especially in the eastern and southern regions. In addition, we highlight research efforts to jointly consider multiple abiotic factors (e.g. climate warming, CO2 enrichment, drought and increase in surface ozone) and biotic factors (e.g. insect outbreaks and invasive species), when evaluating ecological impacts of N deposition in the future.

TI  - Edge effects on trophic cascades in tropical rainforests
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - The cascading effects of biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning of forests have become more apparent. However, how edge effects shape these processes has yet to be established. We assessed how edge effects alter arthropod populations and the strength of any resultant trophic cascades on herbivory rate in tropical forests of Brazil. We established 7 paired forest edge and interior sites. Each site had a vertebrate-exclosure, procedural (exclosure framework with open walls), and control plot (total 42 plots). Forest patches were surrounded by pasture. Understory arthropods and leaf damage were sampled every 4 weeks for 11 months. We used path analysis to determine the strength of trophic cascades in the interior and edge sites. In forest interior exclosures, abundance of predaceous and herbivorous arthropods increased by 326% and 180%, respectively, compared with control plots, and there were significant cascading effects on herbivory. Edge-dwelling invertebrates responded weakly to exclusion and there was no evidence of trophic cascade. Our results suggest that the vertebrate community at forest edges controls invertebrate densities to a lesser extent than it does in the interior. Edge areas can support vertebrate communities with a smaller contingent of insectivores. This allows arthropods to flourish and indirectly accounts for higher levels of plant damage at these sites. Increased herbivory rates may have important consequences for floristic community composition and primary productivity, as well as cascading effects on nutrient cycling. By interspersing natural forest patches with agroforests, instead of pasture, abiotic edge effects can be softened and prevented from penetrating deep into the forest. This would ensure a greater proportion of forest remains habitable for sensitive species and could help retain ecosystem functions in edge zones.

CP  - International Symposium on Impacts of Soil Biodiversity on Biogeochemical Processes in Ecosystems
AB  - Soils are the central organizing entities in terrestrial ecosystems and possess extremely diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic biota. They are physically and chemically complex, with micro- and macro-aggregates embedded within a solid, liquid and gaseous matrix that is continually changing in response to natural and human-induced perturbations. Recent advances in molecular techniques in systematics have provided opportunities for the study of biodiversity and biocomplexity of soil biota. A symposium and workshop on soil biogeochemistry and biodiversity International Symposium on Impacts of Soil Biodiversity on Biogeochemical Processes in Ecosystems, Taiwan Forestry Research Institute, Taipei, Taiwan April 18-24, 2004. Convened an international array of participants working in biomes on virtually every continent on the planet (ranging from polar to tropical regions). This special issue reports on the theoretical bases and applications of molecular methods for the measurement of soil biodiversity.
   Themes addressed include a melding of classical taxonomic investigations with biochemical fingerprinting and molecular probing of organism identities. Several papers highlight new advances in identifications of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Examples include new developments in "fingerprinting" of microbes active in "mycorrhizospheres" using immunocapture and other innovative techniques. Developments in the study of impacts of invasive plant and animal species on ecosystem function and subsequent microbial community composition and function have been very great in the last 2-3 years. Soils are major repositories of legacies, including fine and coarse woody debris and other organic products, which have feedbacks on soil diversity. The ways in which species diversity and function of microbial and faunal communities interact and their importance to ecosystem function are examined in biological and biochemical detail. This paper provides an overview of soil biodiversity and its feedbacks on soil biogeochemical processes in ecosystems. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

TI  - Simultaneous extinction of Madagascar's megaherbivores correlates with late Holocene human-caused landscape transformation
T2  - QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB  - Reconstructing the dynamics and drivers of late Quaternary megafaunal extinctions requires direct radiometric date series that are assessed within probabilistic statistical frameworks. Extinction chronologies are poorly understood for many tropical regions, including Madagascar, which had a diverse, now-extinct Holocene large vertebrate fauna including a "megaherbivore" guild of endemic hippopotami and elephant birds. Madagascar's megaherbivores likely played vital roles in regulating ecosystem structure and nutrient cycling, but few direct dates are available for megaherbivore specimens identified to species level, with uncertainty over when and why different representatives of this guild disappeared. Here, we conduct a new investigation into Malagasy megaherbivore extinction dynamics, including 30 new AMS dates and 63 audited published dates. We use Gaussian-resampled inverse-weighted Mclnerny (GRIWM) analysis to estimate species-specific extinction dates for three elephant bird species (Aepyornis hildebrandti, Mullerornis modestus, Vorombe titan), eggshell representing Aepyornis or Vorombe, and two hippo species (Hippopotamus lemerlei, H. madagascariensis), and to estimate extinction dates for megaherbivore communities in different biomes. Megaherbivores persisted for millennia after first human arrival. Extinction date estimates vary significantly between biomes, with disappearance from dry deciduous forest over a millennium earlier than other biomes, possibly reflecting local variation in megaherbivore population densities or human pressures. However, megaherbivore communities including all elephant bird and hippo species persisted elsewhere across Madagascar until similar to 1200-900 BP, when they collapsed suddenly. Extinctions are closely correlated in time with intensive conversion of forests to grassland at similar to 1100-1000 BP, probably associated with a shift to agro-pastoralism and representing a radical change in sustainability of prehistoric human interactions with biodiversity.

TI  - Leaf habits and their relationship with leaf and wood traits in tropical dry forests
T2  - TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB  - Key message For better categorization of species according to foliar habit, a set of leaf and wood traits must be observed. Tropical forests are influenced by distinct regional rainfall regimes, microclimates, and dynamics of nutrient cycling, which are responsible for creating key biodiversity patterns and differences in leaf deciduousness to drought. Functional traits studies have improved understanding of the functioning and heterogeneity of complex ecosystems. We have reviewed the literature focusing mainly on tropical dry forests and relationships among leaf habits (evergreen and deciduous) and other leaf and wood traits. Thus, we have compiled 121 original papers, 2 reports, and 9 book chapters published since 2000. We also provide a meta-analysis of these traits from Neotropics. Tropical deciduous species often have high photosynthetic rates per mass and specific leaf area and traits that improve water flow throughout the plant, such as wide xylem diameters and high hydraulic conductivity, maximizing resource capture during a limited growing season because of an acquisition strategy. The opposite is observed in evergreen species, namely as conservative species. Regardless of the plant organ, more morphological than physiological traits are available to compare leaf habits. For better categorization of species according to foliar habit, a set of leaf and wood traits must be observed. However, while local comparisons based on one or few traits may group species according to leaf habit, multivariate analyses for large spatial scales can reveal a different pattern. We have identified some open questions that can be further addressed in this research field to contribute to the improvement of theoretical frameworks as well as the consequences of a changing climate for tropical dry forests.

TI  - Impacts of disturbance on soil properties in a dry tropical forest in Southern India
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
AB  - Grazing. fuelwood extraction and burning are common human activities in Indian forests. These activities can represent forest disturbances that drive the degradation of natural deciduous forest cover to scrub forest, with concurrent impacts on soils. The effects of human forest use on ecosystem functions were investigated in Bandipur National Park (BNP) in Peninsular India. This paper reports the impacts on Surface soils. Soils were sampled from 200 locations covering four watersheds within the Park. These samples spanned a degradation gradient measured by a field disturbance index (FDI). Soil physical, nutrient and hydraulic properties were measured. Cation exchange capacity (CEC) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) were analyzed as key response variables describing nutrient availability and infiltration respectively. Effects of cattle and Jeep trails on infiltration and bulk density were evaluated by sampling on-and-off trails. Trail density in research watersheds was estimated with satellite imagery. Soil nutrient availability is negatively impacted by disturbance, resulting front negative impacts on soil organic carbon (SOC) and clay content. Available water capacity (AWC) and saturated moisture content (SMC) were significantly higher in protected watersheds, attributed to reduced clay content in degraded watersheds. Off trails, high spatial variability in infiltration overwhelmed any meaningful trends with disturbance. However, infiltration was substantially reduced on trails as a result of significant increase in bulk density. The density of trails was considerably higher in degraded watersheds compared to protected watersheds. These results provide ground-based and remotely sensed evidence that forest disturbance within the Park has negative impacts on soil organic matter, nutrient availability and hydraulic characteristics. These have consequences for related ecological, nutrient cycling and hydrological processes, and the continuation of the services currently enjoyed by local human populations.

TI  - Conversion of peat swamp forest to oil palm cultivation reduces the diversity and abundance of macrofungi
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Deforestation of tropical peat swamp forests is rapidly taking place across Southeast Asia to make way for agricultural expansion. Within forest ecosystems, macrofungi play a vital role, including wood decomposition and nutrient cycles. To reveal the effects of deforestation and land cover conversion on macrofungi in Southeast Asian tropical forests we assessed the relationship between environmental variables such as air temperature, relative air humidity, soil pH, soil moisture, canopy cover, canopy closure, habitat type (i.e., peat swamp forest, large-scale plantation, monoculture smallholding, and polyculture smallholding) and available substrata with macrofungal species richness and abundance. We sample macrofungi across four habitats on Peninsula Malaysia including peat swamp forest, large-scale plantations, monoculture smallholding and polyculture smallholding. We found that substrate richness had a positive effect on macrofungal morphospecies richness, while soil pH and air temperature had a negative effect. For macrofungal abundance, canopy closure and soil moisture had negative effects, whereas substrate richness and relative air humidity had positive effects. Our data showed considerable variation in functional group responses to environmental variables. The abundance of wood-inhabiting fungi was driven primarily by substrate richness, while relative air humidity, soil moisture, and habitat type play minor roles. The abundance of terricolous saprotrophic fungi was determined principally by habitat type, substrate richness, and relative air humidity. Macrofungal community structure was mainly influenced by substrate richness, followed by microclimates and soil characteristics. Our results can provides critical ecological data to support conservation stakeholders conserve macrofungi in natural and agricultural peatlands. Our study suggests that the expansion of oil palm monocultures, to the detriment of peat swamp forests, is likely to have negative effects on macrofungal biodiversity and further agricultural expansion should be prevented.

TI  - Impact of land use intensification on key drivers of soil organic carbon pools in Brazil's Central-West
T2  - CATENA
AB  - There are studies showing the potential of integrated production systems, such as Crop-Livestock-Forestry (CLF), for soil carbon sequestration, enhancing nutrient cycling, and reducing farmers' dependence on mineral fertilizers. However, more focused research is needed to identify the main biophysical and chemical processes governing SOC accumulation. This study investigated the main drivers of soil organic carbon sequestration and soil quality in a very clayey Rhodic Ferralsol under an 11-year-old CLF system in the Central West region of Brazil. CLF was implemented in 2009 in a conventional Pasture area and soils samples were collected in 2012 and 2020 under two land uses, CLF and conventional Pasture as time-zero reference. The soil in CLF was evaluated within the tree lines (CLF-WL) and in the alley pasture between the tree lines (CLF-BL) having palisade grass. Our results showed that SOC stocks was higher (both in 2012 and 2020) for the CLF-WL (86.70 and 83.74 Mg ha(-1)) than in pasture reference (71.81 and 74.96 Mg ha(-1)) within the 0.3-1.0 m soil layer. Most of the soil's carbon content was in the mineral associated fraction (96-97 %) for all sites. Soil available water for plants (at -8 and -6 kPa) within 0.0-0.1 m soil depth increased in CLF system. Soil nutrient availability increased from 2012 to 2020 in CLF system. While in the Pasture the main drivers of SOC pools were the soil physical properties, in the CLF these were chemical soil properties. These key parameters underscore the role of CLF systems in promoting carbon storage and supporting low-carbon agriculture, particularly in the Brazilian Savanna and similar tropical regions. This knowledge allows farmers to optimize CLF management, balancing soil health with productivity.

TI  - Assessing the strength of climate and land-use influences on montane epiphyte communities
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - Epiphytes, air plants that are structurally dependent on trees, are a keystone group in tropical forests; they support the food and habitat needs of animals and influence water and nutrient cycles. They reach peak diversity in humid montane forests. Climate predictions for Central American mountains include increased temperatures, altered precipitation seasonality, and increased cloud base heights, all of which may challenge epiphytes. Although remaining montane forests are highly fragmented, many tropical agricultural systems include trees that host epiphytes, allowing epiphyte communities to persist even in landscapes with lower forest connectivity. I used structural equations models to test the relative effects of climate, land use, tree characteristics, and biotic interactions on vascular epiphyte diversity with data from 31 shade coffee farms and 2 protected forests in northern Nicaragua. I also tested substrate preferences of common species with randomization tests. Tree size, tree diversity, and climate all affected epiphyte richness, but the effect of climate was almost entirely mediated by bryophyte cover. Bryophytes showed strong sensitivity to mean annual temperature and insolation. Many ferns and some orchids were positively associated with bryophyte mats, whereas bromeliads tended to establish among lichen or on bare bark. The tight relationships between bryophytes and climate and between bryophytes and vascular epiphytes indicated that relatively small climate changes could result in rapid, cascading losses of montane epiphyte communities. Currently, shade coffee farms can support high bryophyte cover and diverse vascular epiphyte assemblages when larger, older trees are present. Agroforests serve as valuable reservoirs for epiphyte biodiversity and may be important early-warning systems as the climate changes.

TI  - Recovering ecosystem functions through the management of regenerating community in agroforestry and plantations with Khaya spp. in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Our aims were to describe the role of the selective management of regenerating community (RC) on the recovery of ecosystem functions in production areas of African mahoganies under mixed stands and agroforestry systems, established on abandoned farmland. A randomized block experiment was set up with the following treatments: (T1) mixed-plantation of African mahogany under conventional system (including herbicide application); (T2) mixed-plantation of African mahogany with selective conduction of RC; (T3) agroforestry system with African mahogany; (T4) agroforestry system with African mahogany with selective conduction of RC. The parameters of horizontal structure, diversity and ecological attributes of species of the regenerating community were studied. In addition, the production of aboveground biomass and nutrient stocks, soil fertility, and soil microbial activity were assessed. In T1, herbicide application (glyphosate) affected the floristic composition of the regenerating community by reducing the dominance of monocots and Pteridium arachnoideum, allowing the regeneration of other taxonomic groups of herbaceous species. In response, there was a reduction in the litter biomass stock comparing to the other treatments. The treatments with selective management of the RC (T2 and T4) produced more biomass and accumulated higher amounts of C and nutrients than the conventional treatments (T1 and T3). These treatments also allowed other shrub and tree species to overcome the ecological filter imposed by grasses and colonize the experimental area. Baccharis dracunculifolia, Vismia guianensis, Cecropia pachystachya and Inga sp. were the most important regenerating species that contributed most to the stocks of all nutrients in living aboveground biomass. Pruning and selective management in T4 increased the soil effective cation exchange, while in the T1 treatment there was a lower activity of the beta-glucosidase enzyme. The selective management of RC in agroforestry systems through the manipulation of competitive relationships allowed the colonization of native tree and shrubby species that provide several additional ecosystem services, including pollination, fauna attraction, food production, pest control and environmental regulation for the agroecosystem.

TI  - Issues in using landscape indicators to assess land changes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Landscape indicators, when combined with information about environmental conditions (such as habitat potential, biodiversity, carbon and nutrient cycling, and erosion) and socioeconomic forces, can provide insights about changing ecosystem services. They also provide information about opportunities for improving natural resources management. Landscape indicators rely on data regarding land cover, land management and land functionality. Challenges in using landscape indicators to assess change and effects include (1) measures of land management and attributes that are reliable, robust and consistent for all areas on the Earth do not exist, and thus land cover is more frequently utilized; (2) multiple types of land cover and management are often found within a single landscape and are constantly changing, which complicates measurement and interpretation; and (3) while causal analysis is essential for understanding and interpreting changes in indicator values, the interactions among multiple causes and effects over time make accurate attribution among many drivers of change particularly difficult. Because of the complexity, sheer number of variables, and limitations of empirical data on land changes, models are often used to illustrate and estimate values for landscape indicators, and those models have several problems. Recommendations to improve our ability to assess the effects of changes in land management include refinement of questions to be more consistent with available information and the development of data sets based on systematic measurement over time of spatially explicit land qualities such as carbon and nutrient stocks, water and soil quality, net primary productivity, habitat and biodiversity. Well-defined and consistent land-classification systems that are capable of tracking changes in these and other qualities that matter to society need to be developed and deployed. Because landscapes are so dynamic, it is crucial to develop ways for the scientific community to work together to collect data and develop tools that will enable better analysis of causes and effects and to develop robust management recommendations that will increases land's capacity to meet societal needs in a changing world.

TI  - Nitrogen aboveground turnover and soil stocks to 8 m depth in primary and selectively logged forest in southern Amazonia
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Extensive areas of Amazonia undergo selective logging, modifying forest structure and nutrient cycles. Anthropogenic-accelerated rates of nitrogen (N) turnover could increase N loss and affect regeneration, carbon sequestration and timber production. We quantified leaf area reduction, canopy opening and downed biomass and resultant N flux from reduced impact logging (RIL) activities. We compared canopy reduction, surface soil moisture and nitrate to 8 m depth between logged gaps and intact primary forest to determine if logging activities increase subsoil nitrate. To test long-term logging effects, we evaluated surface N stocks along a 12-year postlogging chronosequence. At the harvest rate of 2.6 trees ha-1, total N additions in logging gaps, including leaves and wood from felled crowns (24.8 kg N ha-1) and other killed trees (41.9 kg N ha-1), accounted for over 80% of the total N addition to aboveground necromass from all logging activities (81.9 kg N ha-1). Despite this N turnover by logging, belowground nitrate storage to 8 m depth did not differ between logging gaps and primary forest at the low harvest rate and disturbance intensity of this study. Soil water depletion also did not differ between gaps and primary forest over 1 year, indicating the impact on belowground inorganic N was low. Compared with primary forest, nitrate concentrations to 8 m depth in logging gaps were only significantly higher at 60-100 cm, suggesting some N redistribution beyond the bulk of the fine roots in logging gaps. Extrapolated to the Amazon Basin scale, we provide a conservative estimate that logging damage and bole export under RIL would turn over 0.14 +/- 0.07 to 0.23 +/- 0.12 Tg N yr-1 based on 1999-2002 selective logging rates. Greater damage during conventional selective logging would cause higher N turnover throughout the Amazon Basin than our results based on RIL.

TI  - Residue removal and tillage interaction effects on soil properties under rain-fed corn production in Central Mexico
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB  - Determining the effects of residue removal and tillage systems on surface crop residue accumulation, organic carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling is essential for sustainable land management. This study evaluated the effects of 6 years of conventional and conservation tillage with different amounts of crop residues left on the soil surface on selected soil properties of a Vertisol and an Andisol used for rain-fed corn (Zea mays L.) production in Central Mexico (Apatzingan and Casas Blancas, Mich.). The results showed that conservation tillage. i.e. no tillage (NT) with 100, 66 and 33% of crop residues left on the field, and minimum tillage (MT), significantly increased surface crop residue accumulation on the soil surface. In the 0-50 mm surface layer. organic C, microbial biomass C and N, inorganic and total N. and extractable P were approximately twice higher with NT/100%, NT/66%, NT/33%. and MT than with conventional tillage (CT) and NT/0% treatments. Higher levels of soil organic C, microbial biomass C and N, inorganic and total N, and extractable P were directly related to surface accumulation of crop residues promoted by conservation tillage management. Removal of surface crop residues can seriously reduce production sustainability in climates where stressful conditions occur. In general, the mid-term (6 years) sustainability of Vertisol and Andisol for rain-fed corn production seemed to be enhanced by conservation tillage management. To obtain the benefits of conservation tillage in the sub-humid tropical region of Apatzingan (Vertisols), where organic matter is rapidly oxidized, it is necessary to leave at least 60% of the crop residue on the soil surface, while in the sub-humid temperate region of Casas Blancas (Andisol), where organic matter is oxidized slower, leaving 30% of crop residue is sufficient.

TI  - Combining Eucalyptus wood production with the recovery of native tree diversity in mixed plantings: Implications for water use and availability
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Mixed forest plantations now emerge as an alternative to traditional plantations in the tropics and represent ecological gains associated with production, wood quality and nutrient cycling. Mixed plantations with higher diversity may also be advantageous concerning their use of soil water. To shed light onto water-related issues of mixing Eucalyptus and a high diversity of tropical native trees, we explored the following questions: What is the impact of high diversity mixed plantations of Eucalyptus intercropped with native trees on soil water? How does the mixture affect the physiology of water use in native trees? Firstly, we tested the hypothesis that stands of Eucalyptus mixed with a high diversity of native trees consume less water compared to Eucalyptus monocultures, by measuring the temporal dynamics of soil water. Secondly, we tested how mixing with Eucalyptus affects the hydraulic performance of fast- and slow-growing native species in these forestry systems. This is the first time a large experiment has been implemented to compare the effects of monospecific Eucalyptus plantations, native species mixtures and mixed plantations of Eucalyptus and native species on soil water dynamics under controlled conditions in terms of site, age, soil type, topography and climate. We found that high diversity mixed plantations of Eucalyptus and native trees use less soil water, than Eucalyptus monocultures. However, the soil under the mixtures was drier than in native species stands. The mixing with Eucalyptus affected the hydraulic performance of native species by decreasing the leaf water potential and stomata] conductance of the fast-growing species, suggesting that fast-growing species performance may be especially constrained by competition for water from Eucalyptus. These findings have important implications for forest management and ecological restoration in the tropics. They will help to further develop silvicultural options to adapt to climate change and improve plantation forestry by using mixed plantations for production purposes or rehabilitation of degraded lands.

TI  - Litter manipulation and the soil arthropod community in a lowland tropical rainforest
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Tropical soil arthropod communities are highly diverse and provide a number of important ecosystem services, including the maintenance of soil structure, regulation of hydrological processes, nutrient cycling and decomposition. Experiments in temperate regions suggest that litter dynamics are important in determining the abundance, richness and community composition of soil fauna, but there is little information for lowland tropical forests. We used a long-term litter manipulation experiment (removing, doubling and control) in a neotropical forest to investigate the consequences of changing litter dynamics on the soil arthropod community. The abundance and biomass of arthropods were reduced significantly by the removal of litter, but not affected by litter addition. Litter manipulation had no effect on simple measures of taxonomic richness or diversity, but multivariate ordination techniques revealed a significant shift in arthropod community composition with the removal, but not addition, of litter. This suggests the overall importance of top-down controls on the arthropod community in this ecosystem, with bottom-up influences only important following the removal of large quantities of litter. Of the parameters measured, the faunal composition of experimental plots was best predicted by litter depth and the concentrations of total carbon and readily-exchangeable phosphorus (in order of importance), highlighting the influential role of soil chemical properties, in addition to the physical properties of litter, in shaping soil arthropod communities. Comparison with the results of a previous study of litter-dwelling fauna in the same litter manipulation experiment suggested that the soil and litter arthropod communities are influenced by different parameters: total carbon and litter depth for the soil community, but sodium and calcium for the litter community, although phosphorus was important in both environments. We conclude that arthropod community composition is controlled by different factors in the soil than in the litter and is affected by decreasing, but not increasing, depth of litter.

TI  - Soil degradation in oil palm and rubber plantations under land resource scarcity
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Tropical regions, such as Sumatra, experiencing extensive transformation of natural ecosystems, are close to complete exhaustion of available land. Agroecosystems strongly modify water and nutrient cycles, leading to losses of soil fertility, C sequestration and biodiversity. Although large companies are the main drivers of deforestation and plantation establishment, smallholders account for 40% of the oil palm and the majority of the rubber production in Indonesia. Here, we assess the extent and mechanisms of soil degradation under smallholder oil palm and rubber plantations in a context of land scarcity. The topsoil properties (C and N contents, C stocks, C/N ratio, bulk density) in 207 oil palm and rubber plantations in the Jambi province of Sumatra were determined beside trees, inside rows and interrows. Soils under oil palms were on average more degraded than under rubber, showing lower C content and stocks, lower N and higher bulk density. While soil properties were homogenous under rubber, two opposite trends were observed under oil palm plantations: the majority of soils had C content <2.2%, but about one fifth of the plantations had >9% C. This resulted from the establishment of oil palms under conditions of land scarcity. Because the oil palm boom started when rubber was already well-established, oil palms were frequently planted in marginal areas, such as peatlands or riparian areas (high C) or soils degraded by previous use (low C). The management of oil palms led to subsequent soil degradation, especially in interrows: C content decreased and bulk density increased in older oil palm plantations. This was not observed in rubber plantations because of a C input from leaf litter spread homogeneously all over the plantation, higher ground cover and a limited use of motorized vehicles. Considering that 10% of soils under oil palms had very low C content (<1%), we conclude that intensive cultivation can lead to intensive soil degradation and expect future degradation of soils under young oil palms. This challenges the sustainability of agricultural intensification in Sumatra. Because Sumatra is a pioneer of tropical land-use change, this should be regarded as potential threats that other tropical regions may face in future. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Pit volume, soil cover and Eucalyptus forestry residues determine plant growth in restoring areas after gravel mining in eastern Amazon, Brazil
T2  - NEW FORESTS
AB  - Gravel mining destroys the soil structures, with consequent losses in biodiversity and other ecosystem services, such as nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration and regulation of the hydrological cycle. In this context, planting with native species can be an effective method to restore the ecosystems functioning and structure after mining. A restoration study was conducted to evaluate the influence of different planting pit volumes and soil cover on the development of four Fabaceae tree species in an area degraded by gravel mining in the eastern Amazon, Brazil. Two types of ground cover and two pit sizes were assessed: soil covered with coconut fiber blanket and small pit (T1); soil covered with Eucalyptus forestry residues and small pit (T2); small pit filled with 160 dm(-3) with Eucalyptus forestry residues (T3) large pit filled with 320 dm(-3) of Eucalyptus forestry residues (T4). Periodic Annual Increment (PAI) was calculated 1.3 years after planting for total height (PAI(Ht)) and diameter (PAI(DBH)) as well as the survival percentage. All four evaluated species showed mean PAI(Ht) ranging from 160.75 to 279.26 cm year(-1), in which T2 and T4 provided the best performances. Clitoria fairchildiana showed the highest mean PAI(DBH) value at T2 and statistically differed from T1 and T4. On the other hand, there were no significant differences in the other tested species. Survival percentages were greater than 90% for C. fairchildiana, Inga edulis and Inga thibaidiana. Although there was not a clear pattern in relation to the applied treatments, the Eucalyptus forestry residues such as soil cover and large planting pits were more efficient in relation to the increments in growth, diameter and survival of the species used in the initial planting to restore ecosystems degraded by gravel mining. Such results can be applied in future forest restoration projects in the Amazon and other tropical regions.

TI  - Land-use change shifts and magnifies seasonal variations of the decomposer system in lowland tropical landscapes
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Deforestation and agricultural expansion in the tropics affect local and regional climatic conditions, leading to synergistic negative impacts on land ecosystems. Climatic changes manifest in increased inter- and intraseasonal variations and frequency of extreme climatic events (i.e., droughts and floods), which have evident consequences for aboveground biodiversity. However, until today, there have been no studies on how land use affects seasonal variations below ground in tropical ecosystems, which may be more buffered against climatic variation. Here, we analyzed seasonal variations in soil parameters, basal respiration, microbial communities, and abundances of soil invertebrates along with microclimatic conditions in rainforest and monocultures of oil palm and rubber in Sumatra, Indonesia. About 75% (20 out of 26) of the measured litter and soil, microbial, and animal parameters varied with season, with seasonal changes in 50% of the parameters depending on land use. Land use affected seasonal variations in microbial indicators associated with carbon availability and cycling rate. The magnitude of seasonal variations in microbial parameters in the soil of monocultures was almost 40% higher than in the soil of rainforest. Measured parameters were associated with short-term climatic conditions (3-day period air humidity) in plantations, but not in rainforest, confirming a reduced soil buffering ability in plantations. Overall, our findings suggest that land use temporally shifts and increases the magnitude of seasonal variations of the belowground ecosystem compartment, with microbial communities responding most strongly. The increased seasonal variations in soil biota in plantations likely translate into more pronounced fluctuations in essential ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration, and these ramifications ultimately may compromise the stability of tropical ecosystems in the long term. As the observed seasonal dynamics is likely to increase with both local and global climate change, these shifts need closer attention for the long-term sustainable management of plantation systems in the tropics.

TI  - Nutrient cycling and microbial responses to termite and earthworm activity in soils amended with woody residues in the Sudano-Sahel
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY
AB  - Termites and earthworms are the main groups of invertebrates in dry tropical ecosystems and exert significant effects on bioturbation and soil reorganization. The dynamics of microbial communities, enzymes and substrates associated with the flux of energy and nutrients induced by their diverse biogenic structures are still under-investigated in agroecological-based cropping systems. The objective of this study was to determine whether the biogenic structures produced by a grass-woody forager termite (Nasutitermes torquatus) and an endogeic earthworm (Millsonia inermis) shift soil organic C (OC), nutrients, enzyme activities and microbial communities in soils amended with woody residues. The experiment was a randomized block design conducted in a Sudano-Sahelian cropping system that was amended annually with woody residues (3 Mg ha(-1)) or not amended (control soils) for six consecutive years. Samples were taken from fresh sheetings and casts (produced respectively by N. torquatus and M. inermis) and bulk soils in amended plots as well as from control soils in nonamended plots. Samples were analyzed for soil texture, OC, total nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), pH, enzyme activity and microbial composition. The results showed that sheetings and casts altered soil biochemical properties significantly. Sheetings and casts were remarkably enriched in OC (45-55% and 82-94%, respectively) and P (20-55% and 73-130%) compared to bulk soils and control soils. Sheetings and casts substantially stimulated beta-glucosi-dase (153-178% and 158-183%, respectively) and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (43-53% and 84-93%) activity, likely due to gut mucus excretions and favorable physicochemical conditions. Sheetings and casts did not fundamentally alter the microbial diversity but raised soil conditions favorable to selective microbial growth. Overall, casts exhibited higher nutrient content (N, P), enzyme activity, and larger total microbial biomass than sheetings. Both structures stimulated soil microbial communities and enzyme activity associated with the in-crease of pH, OC and nutrients. Earthworm casts and termite sheetings have ecological significance in OC dynamics in plant residues amended soils.

TI  - Integrating abundance and functional traits reveals new global hotspots of fish diversity
T2  - NATURE
AB  - Species richness has dominated our view of global biodiversity patterns for centuries(1,2). The dominance of this paradigm is reflected in the focus by ecologists and conservation managers on richness and associated occurrence-based measures for understanding drivers of broad-scale diversity patterns and as a biological basis for management(3,4). However, this is changing rapidly, as it is now recognized that not only the number of species but the species present, their phenotypes and the number of individuals of each species are critical in determining the nature and strength of the relationships between species diversity and a range of ecological functions (such as biomass production and nutrient cycling)(5). Integrating these measures should provide a more relevant representation of global biodiversity patterns in terms of ecological functions than that provided by simple species counts. Here we provide comparisons of a traditional global biodiversity distribution measure based on richness with metrics that incorporate species abundances and functional traits. We use data from standardized quantitative surveys of 2,473 marine reef fish species at 1,844 sites, spanning 133 degrees of latitude from all ocean basins, to identify new diversity hotspots in some temperate regions and the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean. These relate to high diversity of functional traits amongst individuals in the community (calculated using Rao's Q(6)), and differ from previously reported patterns in functional diversity and richness for terrestrial animals, which emphasize species-rich tropical regions only(7,8). There is a global trend for greater evenness in the number of individuals of each species, across the reef fish species observed at sites ('community evenness'), at higher latitudes. This contributes to the distribution of functional diversity hotspots and contrasts with well-known latitudinal gradients in richness(2,4). Our findings suggest that the contribution of species diversity to a range of ecosystem functions varies over large scales, and imply that in tropical regions, which have higher numbers of species, each species contributes proportionally less to community-level ecological processes on average than species in temperate regions. Metrics of ecological function usefully complement metrics of species diversity in conservation management, including when identifying planning priorities and when tracking changes to biodiversity values.

TI  - No home-field advantage in upper Andean tropical forests despite strong differences in site environmental characteristics
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
AB  - Litter decomposition is not fully explained by the general triangle of climate, litter quality and soil decomposers. Therefore, other theoretical frameworks, such as Home-Field Advantage (HFA), have emerged to explain the remaining variation of decomposition. HFA states that litter decomposes faster in their site of origin (home) than far from it (away). However, there are no consistent patterns of HFA and this can varies depending the ecosystem and plant species analyzed. One of the most variable ecosystems in terms of species biodiversity turnover, topography, and soil conditions are the Upper Andean Tropical Forests (UATF), but to date there is no study testing HFA in this ecosystem. Here, HFA was tested through a reciprocal litterbag translocation field experiment across different UATF. The experiment comprised 2520 litterbags placed in 14 20 x 20 m plots that belonged to four sites to analyze decomposition of 15 plant species for 18 months. Of these 15 species, seven were present at only one site. The mean decomposition was calculated for all 15 species to determine the relative decomposition at each site and the decomposition of the seven species at home and away sites was analyzed through two-way ANOVA (sites x species) and linear mixed models. I contrasted environmental charcteristics between sites including litter depth, slope, leaf area index, canopy openness, and microclimatic variables. The results showed that the pattern of decomposition was always the same, no matter the origin of the species and the decomposition period. Microclimate, litter depth, and slope varied between sites, yet these differences were not enough to influence affinity effects of decomposition, as relative decay rates were similar between home and away sites. Overall, no HFA was found in UATF possibly because: (i) strong environmental filters along montane forests homogenize decomposer communities; (ii) high diversity in litters drive decomposers with high ability to degrade different organic compounds; (iii) little adaptation of decomposers to recurrent litter as they respond mainly to changes in litter quality. These results imply that changes in species composition by current anthropogenic pressures could have profound impacts on carbon cycle and nutrient fluxes depending on the identity of species arriving in UATF.

TI  - Saproxylic beetles in tropical and temperate forests - A standardized comparison of vertical stratification patterns
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Forests are complex three-dimensional ecosystems, but little is known about the influence of vertical stratification of forest structure on biodiversity and species turnover. Saproxylic beetles make a substantial contribution to forest biodiversity and ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling. Management measures aimed at supporting saproxylic biodiversity are becoming an integral part of sustainable forest management practices. Yet, monitoring is carried out under the assumption that saproxylic activity at ground level will be a realistic reflection of saproxylic biodiversity in the forest as a whole.
   To investigate the validity of this assumption we compare vertical stratification and composition of saproxylic beetle assemblages between three forest types of varying altitude and latitude, including a tropical lowland forest in Panama, a temperate lowland forest and a temperate montane forest, both in the eastern Czech Republic. Beetles were sampled following a standardized sampling protocol using flight intercept traps arranged in vertical transects.
   Overall, the tropical forest was estimated to harbour two to three times more saproxylic beetle species than the temperate lowland and the montane forest, respectively. However, point richness estimates within vertical strata were remarkably similar between biomes. Species richness was similar in the understorey of all three forests. It peaked in the canopy of the tropical forest but in the understorey of temperate forests. So, while the beetle assemblages were clearly vertically stratified in all three forest types, stratification patterns varied markedly between tropical and temperate forests. This trend is driven primarily by the high richness of saproxylic beetles in the tropical forest canopy. However these richness differences belie the strong similarities in stratification of feeding guild composition observed all three forest types. This would tend to suggest that similar trophic structuring forces might operate across very different forest biomes of the world.
   Similarities in feeding guild composition suggest that management measures aiming at conserving biodiversity of saproxylic beetles are likely to be effective across different forest types. The differences in vertical stratification, however, suggest that understorey monitoring alone will be insufficient to understand management effects on saproxylic biodiversity. In the tropics, in particular, more emphasis will need to be placed on managing the diverse, three-dimensional structure of forest canopies as habitat for saproxylic beetles.

TI  - Contrasting Patterns of Soil Chemistry and Vegetation Cover Determine Diversity Changes of Soil Phototrophs Along an Afrotropical Elevation Gradient
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Soil phototrophic microbes play key roles in many ecosystem functions, including nutrient cycling, water absorption and retention, substrate weathering and soil stabilization, as well as colonization and persistence of other organisms. Knowledge about the diversity and biomass of soil phototrophs remains limited, especially in tropical forests and savannas. Here, we investigate changes in the diversity and abundance of soil phototrophs across the 4-km elevation gradient on Mt. Cameroon, Africa, from tropical forests (0-2300 m) to treeless savanna (2300-3600 m) and afroalpine vegetation (3600-4000 m). We evaluated the role of soil chemistry and vegetation cover in shaping phototrophic diversity patterns using soil, tree and herb census data from 224 permanent plots. Cyanobacteria from Chroococcales accounted for 65% of the species richness and > 70% of the biovolume. The highest phototrophic diversity and biovolume were recorded in treeless savanna and afroalpine vegetation, and lowest values in mid-elevation tropical forests with dense understory vegetation and hence limited light availability. Higher diversity and biovolume of soil phototrophs were associated with less productive, well-illuminated soils with lower organic matter and nitrogen content and higher pH, phosphorus and cation content. Changes in microbial richness and biovolume across tropical forests showed a U-shaped elevation pattern, with higher values recorded in coastal and lowland forests up to 1000 m elevation, the lowest values in the mid-elevation open-canopy forests with dense understory vegetation caused by disturbances of forest elephants and higher values again in montane forests between 1800 and 2200 m. Above the tree line, soil phototrophic biovolume also showed a U-shaped elevation pattern, with lower richness recorded in compact grasslands between 2700 and 3400 m. At lower-elevation savanna, soil phototrophs are indirectly supported by regular fires during the dry season, which reduces plant cover and increases soil phosphorus and cations, while barren lava fields at higher elevations around the summit support soil phototrophs directly via increased soil P and K content and indirectly by inhibiting plant growth and vegetation cover. Our results shed light on an overlooked part of soil biodiversity in major tropical ecosystems and uncover the role of various ecological filters in structuring phototrophic microbial communities in tropical soils.

TI  - Impacts of deforestation and forest regeneration on soil bacterial communities associated with phosphorus transformation processes in the Brazilian Amazon region
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Land-use change has negative impacts on the biodiversity of plants and animals. However, we lack studies and/ or information about the impacts of land-use change on the biodiversity of soil microorganisms, especially those involved in the phosphorus (P) transformation processes. This represents a great concern since some microbial groups are extremely important to different P transformation processes and regulate P availability in tropical and subtropical regions. In our study, we used shotgun DNA-metagenomic sequencing and P fractionation analysis to assess the effects of forest-to-pasture conversion on the dynamics of soil bacterial groups involved in the P transformation processes and their potential functions. Additionally, we assessed if the dynamics of these specific soil bacterial groups were recovered after pasture abandonment and with secondary forest establishment. Our results demonstrated that the land-use change altered the total amount of P and its fractions in the soils. The bacterial community structure was affected by changes in soil chemical properties, mainly by changes in the aluminum, total P, and labile P contents. The bacterial groups involved in the P transformation processes and their potential functions were also affected by changes in land use. The pasture soil harbored a distinct bacterial community when compared to the primary and secondary forest sites. In general, forest-to-pasture conversion increased bacterial groups involved in the P mineralization, including Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes. Conversely, we observed an increase of Proteobacteria members (e.g., Bradyrhizobiaceae and Beijerinckiaceae) and genes related to P solubilization and mineralization after pasture abandonment and with the secondary forest re-establishment. Our multi-analytical approach suggests that forest-to-pasture conversion has negative impacts on the biodiversity of bacterial groups involved in the P transformation processes and their potential functions, while the secondary forest re-establishment can stimulate resilience. Taken together, our results indicated that the bacterial groups involved in the P transformation and their potential functions can be gradually recovered and reach intermediate and/or even similar levels to those observed in undisturbed forest sites. This brings new insights and helps to improve our knowledge about the impacts of anthropogenic actions on the soil microbiome in the Amazon region.

TI  - Drivers of tropical soil invertebrate community composition and richness across tropical secondary forests using DNA metasystematics
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Tropical forests are fundamental ecosystems, essential for providing terrestrial primary productivity, global nutrient cycling, and biodiversity. Despite their importance, tropical forests are currently threatened by deforestation and associated activities. Moreover, tropical regions are now mostly represented by secondary forest regrowth, with half of the remaining tropical forests as secondary forest. Soil invertebrates are an important component to the functioning and biodiversity of these soil ecosystems. However, it remains unclear how these past land-use activities and subsequent secondary forest developments have altered the soil invertebrate communities and any potential ecological consequences associated with this. DNA metabarcoding offers an effective approach to rapidly monitor soil invertebrate communities under different land-use practices and within secondary forests. In this study, we used DNA metabarcoding to detect community-based patterns of soil invertebrate composition across a primary forest, a 23-year-old secondary forest, and a 33-year-old secondary forest and the associated soil environmental drivers of the soil invertebrate community structure in the Maquenque National Wildlife Refuge of Costa Rica (MNWR). We also used a species contribution analysis (SIMPER) to determine which soil invertebrate groups may be an indication of these soils reaching a pre-disturbed state such as a primary forest. We found that the soil invertebrate community composition at class, order, family, and ESV level were mostly significantly different across that habitats. We also found that the primary forest had a greater richness of soil invertebrates compared to the 23-year-old and 33-year-old secondary forest. Moreover, a redundancy analysis indicated that soil moisture influenced soil invertebrate community structure and explained up to 22% of the total variation observed in the community composition across the habitats; whereas soil invertebrate richness was structured by soil microbial biomass carbon (C) (C-mic) and explained up to 52% of the invertebrate richness across the primary and secondary forests. Lastly, the SIMPER analysis revealed that Naididae, Entomobryidae, and Elateridae could be important indicators of soil and forest recuperation in the MNWR. This study adds to the increasing evidence that soil invertebrates are intimately linked with the soil microbial biomass carbon (C-mic) and that even after 33 years of natural regrowth of a forest, these land use activities can still have persisting effects on the overall composition and richness of the soil invertebrate communities.

TI  - The Multiscale TROPIcal CatchmentS critical zone observatory M-TROPICS dataset III: Hydro-geochemical monitoring of the Mule Hole catchment, south India
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
AB  - Despite the importance of tropical ecosystems for climate regulation, biodiversity, water and nutrient cycles, only a few Critical Zone Observatories (CZOs) are located in the tropics. Among these, most are in humid climates, while very few data exist for semi-arid and sub-humid climates, due to the difficulty of estimating hydro-geochemical balances in catchments with ephemeral streams. We contribute to fill this gap by presenting a meteorological and hydro-geochemical dataset acquired at the Mule Hole catchment (4.1 km(2)), a pristine dry deciduous forest located in a biosphere reserve in south India. The dataset consists of time series of variables related to (i) meteorology, including rainfall, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, and global radiation, (ii) hydrology, including water level and discharge at the catchment outlet, (iii) hydrogeology, including manual (monthly) and/or automated (from 15 min to hourly) groundwater levels in nine piezometers and (iv) geochemistry, including suspended sediment content in the stream and chemical composition of rainfall (event based), groundwater (monthly sampling) and stream water (storm events, 15 min to hourly frequency with an automatic sampler). The time series extend from 2003 to 2019. Measurement errors are minimized by frequent calibration of sensors and quality checks, both in the field and in the laboratory. Despite these precautions, several data gaps exist, due to occasional access restriction to the site and instrument destruction by wildlife. Results show that large seasonal and interannual variations of climatic conditions were reflected in the large variations of stream flow and groundwater recharge, as well as in water chemical composition. Notably, they reveal a long-term evolution of groundwater storage, suggesting hydrogeological cycles on a decadal scale. This dataset, alone or in combination with other data, has already allowed to better understand water and element cycling in tropical dry forests, and the role of forest diversity on biogeochemical cycles. As tropical ecosystems are underrepresented by Critical Zone Observatories, we expect this data note to be valuable for the global scientific community.

TI  - Linking Anthropogenic Landscape Perturbation to Herbivory and Pathogen Leaf Damage in Tropical Tree Communities
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
AB  - Anthropogenic disturbance of tropical humid forests leads to habitat loss, biodiversity decline, landscape fragmentation, altered nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration, soil erosion, pest/pathogen outbreaks, among others. Nevertheless, the impact of these alterations in multitrophic interactions, including host-pathogen and vector-pathogen dynamics, is still not well understood in wild plants. This study aimed to provide insights into the main drivers for the incidence of herbivory and plant pathogen damage, specifically, into how vegetation traits at the local and landscape scale modulate such interactions. For this purpose, in the tropical forest of Calakmul (Campeche, Mexico), we characterised the foliar damage caused by herbivores and pathogens in woody vegetation of 13 sampling sites representing a gradient of forest disturbance and fragmentation in an anthropogenic landscape from well preserved to highly disturbed and fragmented areas. We also evaluated how the incidence of such damage was modulated by the vegetation and landscape attributes. We found that the incidence of damage caused by larger, mobile, generalist herbivores, was more sensitive to changes in landscape configuration, while the incidence of damage caused by small and specialised herbivores with low dispersal capacity was more influenced by vegetation and landscape composition. In relation to pathogen symptoms, the herbivore-induced foliar damage seems to be the main factor related to their incidence, indicating the enormous importance of herbivorous insects in the modulation of disease dynamics across tropical vegetation, as they could be acting as vectors and/or facilitating the entry of pathogens by breaking the foliar tissue and the plant defensive barriers. The incidence of pathogen damage also responded to vegetation structure and landscape configuration; the incidence of anthracnose, black spot, and chlorosis, for example, were favoured in sites surrounded by smaller patches and a higher edge density, as well as those with a greater aggregation of semi-evergreen forest patches. Fungal pathogens were shown to be an important cause of foliar damage for many woody species. Our results indicate that an increasing transformation and fragmentation of the tropical forest of southern Mexico could reduce the degree of specialisation in plant-herbivore interactions and enhance the proliferation of generalist herbivores (chewers and scrapers) and of mobile leaf suckers, and consequently, the proliferation of some symptoms associated with fungal pathogens such as fungus black spots and anthracnose. The symptoms associated with viral and bacterial diseases and to nutrient deficiency, such as chlorosis, could also increase in the vegetation in fragmented landscapes with important consequences in the health and productivity of wild and cultivated plant species. This is a pioneering study evaluating the effect of disturbances on multitrophic interactions, offering key insights on the main drivers of the changes in herbivory interactions and incidence of plant pathogens in tropical forests.

TI  - What shapes cerambycid beetle communities in a tropical forest mosaic? Assessing the effects of host tree identity, forest structure, and vertical stratification
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Due to anthropogenic activities, tropical rain forests face many challenges in sustaining biodiversity and maintaining global climates. This study explores how forest successional stage, tree composition, and stratum affect communities of saproxylic cerambycid beetlesconcealed feeders that play important roles in forest nutrient cycling. Forty trees in five families (Fabaceae, Lecythidaceae, Malvaceae, Moraceae, and Sapotaceae) were sampled in a mosaic of old-growth and secondary forest on the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica. Bait branches yielded 3549 cerambycid individuals in 49 species. Species richness was almost identical in old-growth and secondary forest, and both yielded specialists, but abundance was higher in old-growth forest. Overall community structure was most strongly influenced by host plant species; within most plant families it was also impacted by forest successional status. Moraceae was the exception, presumably because the focal tree species was abundant in both old-growth and secondary forest. Several host and old-growth specialist species reached high densities within patches of old-growth forest, but seldom colonized apparently suitable trees within secondary forest. This suggests that even small areas of old-growth forest can act as refuges, but that secondary forest may act as a barrier to dispersal. The vulnerability of specialized saproxylic insects to land use change will be linked to the ability of their preferred hosts to disperse to and persist in successional habitats; rearing studies may provide the most accurate method to monitor community changes over time.
   Resumen Debido a las actividades antropogenicas, las selvas tropicales enfrentan muchos desafios en el mantenimiento de la biodiversidad y el mantenimiento de los climas mundiales. Esta investigacion explora como las etapa de sucesion de los bosques, composicion de los arboles, y el estrato afectan las comunidades de escarabajos cerambycido saproxilicos, los cuales desempenan papeles importantes en el ciclo de nutrientes del bosque. Cuarenta arboles en cinco familias (Fabaceae, Lecythidaceae, Malvaceae, Moraceae, y Sapotaceae) fueron indentificados en un mosaico de bosques maduro y secundario en la Peninsula Osa, Costa Rica. Ramas de cebo produjeron 3549 individuos Cerambycid en 49 especies. La riqueza de especies fue casi identica en bosques maduro y secundario, y ambos cedio especialistas, pero la abundancia fue mayor en los bosques de edad madura. Estructura general de la comunidad fue mas fuertemente influenciada por las especies de plantas huesped; en la mayoria de las familias de plantas que tambien se vio afectado por el estado de sucesion forestal. Moraceae fue la excepcion, presumiblemente porque las especies de arboles focales era abundante en bosques maduro y secundario. Varias especies especialistas de bosques maduro alcanzaron altas densidades dentro de los parches de bosque maduro, pero rara vez colonizaron arboles aparentemente ideales de bosque secundario. Esto sugiere que pequenas areas de bosques antiguos pueden actuar como refugios, y que los bosques secundarios pueden actuar como una barrera para la dispersion. La vulnerabilidad de los insectos saproxilicos especializados al uso diferente del suelo estara vinculada con la capacidad de dispersar de sus arboles preferidos y que se mantenga en los habitats de sucesion; los estudios de cria puede proporcionar el metodo mas preciso para monitorear los cambios de la comunidad a traves del tiempo.

TI  - Biodiversity and Spatiotemporal Variation of Longhorn Beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) in Tropical Forest of Thailand
T2  - INSECTS
AB  - Simple Summary
   Longhorn beetles are a large family of beetles and have a wide-geographic distribution. Some of them are pests of many economic plants and invasive species. They also play roles in decomposition and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. They feed on living, dying, or dead woody plants in the larval stage. So far, 308 species of longhorn beetles have been reported from northern Thailand. However, the biodiversity and distribution of longhorn beetles in different elevation gradients and seasons, associated with environmental factors across six regions in the country, has not yet been investigated. In this study, longhorn beetle specimens were collected by malaise trap from 41 localities in 24 national parks across six regions in Thailand. A total of 199 morphospecies were identified from 1376 specimens. Seasonal species richness and abundance of longhorn beetles peaked during the hot and early rainy season in five regions, except for the southern region, which peaked in the rainy season. Our finding revealed that most species' distribution was correlated with the region and forest type (at middle and low elevations). Quantitative data from this study can be useful to manage agricultural and forest plantations.
   Longhorn beetles are highly diversified and important for agriculture and health of the environment. However, the fauna and ecology of these beetles are not well known in Thailand. This study is the first to report the biodiversity, elevation, and seasonal distribution of longhorn beetles. Specimens were collected by malaise traps from 41 localities in 24 national parks throughout the country during 2006-2009. The traps were operated at each site for 12 consecutive months with a monthly service. A total of 199 morphotaxa in 36 tribes of 6 subfamilies were identified from 1376 specimens. Of these, 40.7% and 14.5% of total taxa were singletons and doubletons, respectively. The Shannon diversity index and observed species richness at Panernthung, Loei Forest Unit and Mae Fang Hotspring were high at 0.96 (30), 0.88 (50), and 0.86 (34), respectively. Local richness ranged between 3 and 50 species, while the species richness estimator showed between 6 and 1275 species. The most relatively abundant species, Nupserha lenita, Pterolophia sp.1, Oberea sp.3, Acalolepta pseudospeciosa, and Ac. rustricatrix represented 4.80%, 4.80%, 4.80%, 4.5%, and 4.43% of the species, respectively. The species with the widest distribution range of percentage of species occurrence (% SO) was Pt. sp.1 (63.4%), followed by Ac. rustricatrix (39%) and Moechotypa suffusa (39%). In a significantly negative relationship between species richness and elevation (p > 0.05, R-2 = 0.04), the species richness pattern showed a hump-shaped curve that peaked at the middle elevation (501-1000 m asl). Regarding seasonal variation, most of the species occurred during the hot season (March-April) and peaked in early rainy season (May), while a low number of species were found during the mid-rainy (June-October) and cold season (November-February). Ordination analysis indicated that the distribution of most species was associated with regions and forest type, and most of the species correlated with forest located at middle and low elevation. The results of this study indicated the very high biodiversity of longhorn beetles in Thailand, which suggests that an understanding of their seasonal and elevational distribution will be of value to agriculture management and conservation.
   They also indicated that malaise traps are appropriate for the evaluation of biodiversity.

TI  - Neglected but Potent Dry Forest Players: Ecological Role and Ecosystem Service Provision of Biological Soil Crusts in the Human-Modified Caatinga
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) have been recognized as key ecological players in arid and semiarid regions at both local and global scales. They are important biodiversity components, provide critical ecosystem services, and strongly influence soil-plant relationships, and successional trajectories via facilitative, competitive, and edaphic engineering effects. Despite these important ecological roles, very little is known about biocrusts in seasonally dry tropical forests. Here we present a first baseline study on biocrust cover and ecosystem service provision in a human-modified landscape of the Brazilian Caatinga, South America's largest tropical dry forest. More specifically, we explored (1) across a network of 34 0.1 ha permanent plots the impact of disturbance, soil, precipitation, and vegetation-related parameters on biocrust cover in different stages of forest regeneration, and (2) the effect of disturbance on species composition, growth and soil organic carbon sequestration comparing early and late successional communities in two case study sites at opposite ends of the disturbance gradient. Our findings revealed that biocrusts are a conspicuous component of the Caatinga ecosystem with at least 50 different taxa of cyanobacteria, algae, lichens and bryophytes (cyanobacteria and bryophytes dominating) covering nearly 10% of the total land surface and doubling soil organic carbon content relative to bare topsoil. High litter cover, high disturbance by goats, and low soil compaction were the leading drivers for reduced biocrust cover, while precipitation was not associated Second-growth forests supported anequally spaced biocrust cover, while in old-growth-forests biocrust cover was patchy. Disturbance reduced biocrust growth by two thirds and carbon sequestration by half. In synthesis, biocrusts increase soil organic carbon (SOC) in dry forests and as they double the SOC content in disturbed areas, may be capable of counterbalancing disturbance-induced soil degradation in this ecosystem. As they fix and fertilize depauperated soils, they may play a substantial role in vegetation regeneration in the human-modified Caatinga, and may have an extended ecological role due to the ever-increasing human encroachment on natural landscapes. Even though biocrusts benefit from human presence in dry forests, high levels of anthropogenic disturbance could threaten biocrust-provided ecosystem services, and call for further, in-depth studies to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Setting the direction of sustainable restoration projects in peatlands considering ecosystem services: Case of Jambi and Sumatra Selatan, Indonesia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Conserving tropical forests and peatlands is considered a key strategy for international forest project cooperation and the promotion of carbon neutrality. Focusing on peatlands in the Sumatra Selatan and Jambi provinces in Indonesia, this study aimed to assess land-cover changes from 1992 to 2020 and associated ecosystem services to assist in the development of effective forest and peatland-related projects. This study first analyzed the historical land-cover changes as a baseline for establishing potential project scenarios. Carbon storage, habitat suitability, water yield, and crop production were selected as the key ecosystem services in the peatlands, and these were assessed for the current land cover and two possible project scenarios in 2050 - business-as-usual (BAU) and forest and wetland restoration (FOR) - using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) tool. In terms of land-cover changes, the area of forests and wetlands decreased, but that of agriculture, grassland, and built-up areas increased in the peatlands. Based on the land-cover scenarios, the carbon storage, habitat suitability, water yield, and crop production varied on 2.32-2,74 billion tC, 92.02-93.46 %, 16.45-16,91 billion m3, and 2.34-2.73 million ton, respectively. The total economic value of the ecosystem services for the current land cover was $75.41 billion, while that predicted for BAU and FOR was estimated to be $70.59 billion and $77.79 billion, respectively. Restoration plans have the environmental and economic benefit of provinciallevel assessment, so the development of appropriate projects for tropical forest and peatland conservation and restoration is necessary for international cooperation projects.

TI  - The potential of land-use systems for maintaining tropical forest butterfly diversity
T2  - TROPICAL RAINFORESTS AND AGROFORESTS UNDER GLOBAL CHANGE: ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC VALUATIONS
AB  - Globally, tropical rainforest species are under increasing threat due to ongoing deforestation. We summarize published studies on effects of forest disturbance and conversion on tropical butterfly assemblages with a focus on forest species. Additionally, we use existing faunal monographs to extract information on the habitat affiliations of tropical forest butterflies. Based on these data, we quantify the importance of human-modified habitats for the conservation of tropical butterflies inhabiting forests across all major tropical regions. Although studies on effects of land use and forest conversion are biased by several methodological problems, the emerging pattern clearly indicates that (old-grown) secondary forests represent an important habitat type for maintaining a large proportion of forest butterflies in all major tropical regions. In contrast, agroforestry systems are only capable of protecting a small proportion of mostly widespread forest species tolerant against strong disturbance. Extinction risk of forest butterflies depends on the utilization of certain plant growth types, while host plant specialization alone does not have significant effects. Specifically, butterflies using trees as larval host plants are more likely to be absent in logged forest, whereas species that tend to be more abundant in logged forest are those with larvae feeding on lianas and grasses. Greater resource requirements may be one reason for a higher extinction risk of larger butterflies after forest fragmentation although not all studies found a relationship between extinction risk and body size. Butterfly species with narrow geographic ranges are particularly prone to local and global extinction. While widespread species dominate species assemblages of highly modified land-use systems and agroforests, endemic butterflies are more commonly found in old-growth forests. Our analyses covering all four major tropical regions underline the severe effects of forest modification. Land-use systems are only of minor importance for protecting forest butterfly species. Furthermore, they may only represent ecological sinks for a substantial proportion of the few forest species that are reported to occur in this habitat type. The future of tropical forest butterflies in all four major tropical regions hence depends on the strict protection of remaining large blocks of natural forests.

TI  - The future of tropical forests under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
AB  - In September 2015, member states of the United Nations unanimously adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)-a set of 17 ambitions for the post-2015 global development agenda. The goals do not offer a prescriptive plan but establish levers of policy action that seek to improve the three pillars of sustainable development: society, environment, and the economy. To facilitate achieving the SDGs, it will be critical to identify context-specific opportunities and challenges for implementation. Tropical regions of the world currently host not only the highest levels of biodiversity but also some of the highest rates of urbanization and development globally. Moreover, tropical forest deforestation is a globally significant issue; it has adverse impacts on biodiversity, climate systems, and socioeconomic equality. Here, we provide a rapid overview and qualitative assessment of the academic and policy literature on development and tropical forests, using the framework of the SDGs to examine issues broadly relevant to both tropical forests and sustainable development. Our assessment gathers existing knowledge and reveals critical knowledge gaps. In doing so, we identify key synergies between SDGs and tropical forests. We also suggest potential pathways of influence to improve social, environmental, and economic conditions in these rapidly developing regions of the world.

TI  - Indigenous lands and conservation units slow down non-GHG climate change in the Cerrado-Amazon ecotone
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Preserving tropical forests by avoiding deforestation and forest degradation is essential for maintaining ecosystem services. Brazilian Conservation Units (CUs) and Indigenous Lands (ILs) have effectively prevented deforestation and supported climate regulation. However, these protected areas face increasing threats from forest fires and droughts across the Amazon and Cerrado biomes. This study assesses how disturbances affect climate regulating factors (surface temperature (LST), evapotranspiration (ET), and albedo) in Mato Grosso state, among different land uses (CUs, ILs, and multiple -use areas - MUs). To do so, we analyzed satellite data collected between 2001 and 2020. Results showed that MUs (outside protected areas) had lower ET (-10%), higher daytime LST (-1.5 degrees C), and higher albedo (-10%) than CUs and ILs in both biomes in 2001. Over the study period, MUs experienced a greater increase in LST (Amazon: -1.4 degrees C; Cerrado: -1.1 degrees C) and albedo (Amazon: -6%; Cerrado: -3%) compared to protected areas, regardless of the biome. In contrast, ILs and CUs showed smaller mean changes in LST (-0.2 degrees C), ET (-1.3%), and albedo (-1.3%). These changes were associated with native vegetation loss, forest fires, and water stress. Our results highlight the important role of protected areas in maintaining climate stability, with higher ET, lower LST, and lower albedo than other land uses. However, the long-term preservation of these services within protected areas depends on interventions in surrounding regions, particularly in the Amazon. Protecting and restoring these natural ecosystems is key for safeguarding ecosystem services and climate regulation in tropical regions.

TI  - Tropical forest and peatland conservation in Indonesia: Challenges and directions
T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
AB  - Tropical forests and peatlands provide important ecological, climate and socio-economic benefits from the local to the global scale. However, these ecosystems and their associated benefits are threatened by anthropogenic activities, including agricultural conversion, timber harvesting, peatland drainage and associated fire. Here, we identify key challenges, and provide potential solutions and future directions to meet forest and peatland conservation and restoration goals in Indonesia, with a particular focus on Kalimantan.
   Through a round-table, dual-language workshop discussion and literature evaluation, we recognized 59 political, economic, legal, social, logistical and research challenges, for which five key underlying factors were identified. These challenges relate to the 3Rs adopted by the Indonesian Peatland Restoration Agency (Rewetting, Revegetation and Revitalization), plus a fourth R that we suggest is essential to incorporate into (peatland) conservation planning: Reducing Fires.
   Our analysis suggests that (a) all challenges have potential for impact on activities under all 4Rs, and many are inter-dependent and mutually reinforcing, implying that narrowly focused solutions are likely to carry a higher risk of failure; (b) addressing challenges relating to Rewetting and Reducing Fire is critical for achieving goals in all 4Rs, as is considering the local socio-political situation and acquiring local government and community support; and (c) the suite of challenges faced, and thus conservation interventions required to address these, will be unique to each project, depending on its goals and prevailing local environmental, social and political conditions.
   With this in mind, we propose an eight-step adaptive management framework, which could support projects in both Indonesia and other tropical areas to identify and overcome their specific conservation and restoration challenges.

TI  - An Ecologically Based System for Sustainable Agroforestry in Sub-Tropical and Tropical Forests
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Forests in tropical and sub-tropical countries face severe pressures due to a combination of poverty and environment degradation. To be effective, measures to protect these forests must therefore consider both economic and ecological dimensions synergistically. The purpose of this paper was to synthesize our long-term work (1994-2015) on a Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba L.) agroforestry system and demonstrate its potential for achieving both goals, and discuss its wider application in tropical and sub-tropical countries. The performance of various ecological, economic, and social indicators was compared among five Ginkgo agroforestry systems. Two additional indicators, Harmony Degree (HD) and Development Degree (DD), were also used to show the integrated performance of these indicators. Ginkgo-Wheat-Peanut (G+W+P) and Ginkgo-Rapeseed-Peanut (G+R+P) are the best systems when compared to pure and mixed Ginkgo plantations, or pure agricultural crops. Results demonstrate that it is possible to achieve both economic development and environmental protection through implementation of sustainable agroforestry systems in sub-tropical regions.

TI  - Logging damage and injured tree mortality in tropical forest management
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCE MODELING
AB  - Using insights from the forest ecology literature, we analyze the effect of injured trees on stand composition and carbon stored in above-ground biomass and the implications for forest management decisions. Results from a Faustmann model with data for a tropical forest on Kalimantan show that up to 50% of the basal area of the stand before harvest can consist of injured trees. Considering injured trees leads to an increase in the amount of carbon in above-ground biomass of up to 165%. These effects are larger under reduced impact logging than under conventional logging. The effects on land expectation value and cutting cycle are relatively small. The results suggest that considering injured trees in models for tropical forest management is important for the correct assessment of the potential of financial programs to store carbon and conserve forest ecosystem services in managed tropical forests, such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and payment for ecosystem services. Recommendations for Resource Managers Considering the role of injured trees is important for managing tropical forests These trees can cover up to 50% of basal area and contain more than 50% of the carbon stored in above-ground biomass Reduced impact logging leads to a larger basal area of injured trees and more carbon stored in injured trees than conventional logging Injured trees play an important role when assessing the potential for carbon storage in the context of payment for forest ecosystem services.

TI  - A global meta-analysis of the biodiversity and ecosystem service benefits of coffee and cacao agroforestry
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - In tropical regions, the extent of agricultural land is rapidly increasing at the expense of natural forest with associated losses of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Agroforestry has long been proposed as a more sustainable agricultural system, conserving biodiversity and ecosystem services, while providing significant local livelihood. In this context, cacao and coffee agroforestry is often regarded as more compatible with conservation of ecosystem integrity than cacao and coffee plantations. Using meta-analytical techniques and mixed models on data from 74 studies conducted across Africa, Latin America and Asia, a global quantitative synthesis was performed to assess the impact on biodiversity and on ecosystem services of (i) the conversion of natural forest into cacao and coffee agroforestiy and (ii) the further intensification of agroforest into cacao and coffee plantation. Forest species richness and total species richness were significantly lower in the more intensively managed than in the more natural land use categories. Response ratios showed that the decline in total species richness was higher when comparing agroforest with plantation (-46%), than when comparing forest with agroforest (-11%). Biodiversity responses to intensification differed between Asia and Latin America, and between different species groups. Response ratios showed that management intensification decreased provision of ecosystem services with 37% when comparing forest with agroforest and with 27% when comparing agroforest with plantation. Our data suggest that species richness decline follows a concave yield function whereas ecosystem service decline follows a more convex yield function. Finally, we identified knowledge gaps related to a conspicuous lack of studies in Africa, and a general underreporting of ecosystem services and environmental variables related to agricultural intensification.

TI  - Animal-dispersed pioneer trees enhance the early regeneration in Atlantic Forest restoration plantations
T2  - NATUREZA & CONSERVACAO
AB  - Planting of native trees has been adopted in many tropical regions worldwide as a central forest restoration method, but little is known concerning the role that these planted species play in catalyzing forest regeneration beneath their canopies. We investigated the role of animal-dispersed tree species in catalyzing the regeneration of woody species in the understory of restoration plantings. We assessed both the density and richness of tree seedlings within plots located beneath the canopy of both animal-dispersed and abiotic-dispersed tree species planted in three riparian forest restoration sites with ages of five, six and eight years. The proportion of animal-dispersed tree seedlings increased with plantation age. The richness of animal-dispersed tree seedlings was higher beneath animal-dispersed trees in the eight-year-old planting. The density of animal-dispersed tree seedlings was higher under animal-dispersed trees when sites were analyzed altogether. The top three species in regeneration density beneath the canopy were animal-dispersed trees, and from the top ten, seven were animal-dispersed species. We suggest that animal-dispersed pioneer trees which facilitate natural regeneration and promote a high density and richness of woody species beneath their canopies should be considered as "framework" species for tropical forest restoration.

TI  - Economic evaluation of pollination services comparing coffee landscapes in Ecuador and Indonesia
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - Biodiversity conservation through land-use systems on private land is becoming a pressing environmental policy issue. Agroforestry, such as shade-coffee production, contributes to biodiversity conservation. However, falling coffee prices force many coffee growers to convert their sites into economically more attractive land uses. We performed an economic evaluation of coffee pollination by bees in two distinct tropical regions: an area of low human impact with forests neighboring agroforestry in Indonesia and an area of high human impact with little remaining forest in Ecuador. We evaluated bee pollination for different forest-destruction scenarios, where coffee yields depend on forests to provide nesting sites for bees. We used two novel approaches. First, we examined how coffee net revenues depend on the pollination services of adjacent forests by considering berry weight in addition to fruit set, thereby providing a comprehensive evaluation. Second, we determined the net welfare effects of land-use changes, including the fact that former forestland is normally used for alternative crops. In both regions, crop revenues exceeded coffee pollination values, generating incentives to convert forests, even if owners would be compensated for pollination services. The promotion of certified "biodiversity-friendly" coffee is a feasible option to maintain shade-coffee systems. This is of special importance in high-impact areas where only small forest fragments remain. We conclude that a comprehensive economic analysis is necessary to adequately evaluate rainforest preservation for the enhancement of ecosystem services, such as pollination.

T2  - STABILITY OF TROPICAL RAINFOREST MARGINS: LINKING ECOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONSTRAINTS OF LAND USE AND CONSERVATION
CP  - International Symposium on Stability of Tropical Rainforest Margins
AB  - The determination and evaluation of ecosystem services provides crucial information for a comprehensive strategy to preserve near natural habitats such as rainforest margins. We show results of an economic evaluation of coffee bee pollination services and pest control in two distinct tropical regions: a low human-impact area in Indonesia with continuous near natural forests neighboring agroforestry and a high-impact landscape in Ecuador with almost no forest fragments left. We evaluate bee pollination services comparing forest destruction scenarios, where coffee yields depend on forests providing nesting sites and foraging habitats for bees and present three novel approaches: first, we show how net coffee revenues depend on pollination services of adjacent forests considering berry weight in addition to fruit set, thereby providing a more comprehensive evaluation. Second, we combine our findings on pollination with an assessment of pest management affecting coffee production. Third, we determine net welfare effects of land-use changes including the fact that former forestland is normally used for alternative crops. In both regions, crop revenues exceed coffee pollination values, generating incentives to convert forest margins even if owners would be compensated for pollination services. The promotion of certified "biodiversity-friendly" coffee is a feasible option to maintain shade-coffee systems for conservation purposes. This is of special importance in high-impact areas where only small forest fragments remain. We conclude that a comprehensive economic analysis is necessary to adequately evaluate rainforest preservation for the enhancement of ecosystem services within a mosaic of competing land-use systems.

TI  - Trade-offs among forest value components in community forests of southwestern Amazonia
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - Contemporary conservation interventions must balance potential trade-offs between multiple ecosystem services. In tropical forests, much attention has focused on the extent to which carbon-based conservation provided by REDD+ policies can also mitigate biodiversity conservation. In the nearly one-third of tropical forests that are community owned or managed, conservation strategies must also balance the multiple uses of forest products that support local livelihoods. Although much discussion has focused on policy options, little empirical evidence exists to evaluate the potential for trade-offs among different tropical forest value components. We assessed multiple components of forest value, including tree diversity, carbon stocks, and both timber and nontimber forest product resources, in forest communities across the trinational frontier of Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia. We installed 69 0.5-ha vegetation plots in local communities, and we characterized 15 components of forest value for each plot. Principal components analyses revealed two major axes of forest value, the first of which defined a trade-off between diversity of woody plant communities (taxonomic and functional) versus aboveground biomass and standing timber volume. The second axis described abundance of commercial species, with strong positive loadings for density of timber and nontimber forest products, including Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) and copaiba oil (Copaifera spp.). The observed trade-off between different components of forest value suggests a potential for management conflicts prioritizing biodiversity conservation versus carbon stocks in the region. We discuss the potential for integrative indices of forest value for tropical forest conservation.

TI  - Perceptions of ecosystem services provided by tropical forests to local populations in Cameroon
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
AB  - In Central Africa, local populations are deeply dependent on tropical forests, which provide numerous ecosystem services (ES). For the first time in Central Africa, we assessed the perceptions of ES provided by tropical forests to local populations, considering three land allocation types: a protected area, a Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)certified logging concession, and three community forests. We conducted a questionnaire survey with 225 forest stakeholders in southeastern Cameroon, combining an open-ended question and 16 directed questions to evaluate the perceptions of ES significance and abundance, respectively. The ES most frequently reported as significant were provisioning (93% of respondents) and cultural & amenity services (68%), whereas regulating services were less mentioned (16%). Bushmeat provision was the only ES perceived as highly significant but not very abundant. There were slight variations of perceptions among forest land allocation types and respondents, suggesting a relative homogeneity in ES abundance. For further integrative ES assessment, we suggest quantifying ES with complementary ecological and economic approaches, such as meat provision, recreation, tourism, timber provision, spiritual experience, firewood provision, water quality regulation, and inspiration for culture. We also give three concrete recommendations for forest management, the most urgent being to provide sources of protein alternative to bushmeat.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of silvicultural interventions for increasing timber production and sustaining conservation values in natural tropical production forests. A systematic review protocol
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE
AB  - Background: Currently, about 400 million hectares of tropical moist forests worldwide are designated production forests, about a quarter of which are managed by rural communities and indigenous peoples. There has been a gradual impoverishment of forest resources inside selectively logged forests in which the volume of timber extracted over the first cutting cycle was mostly from large, old trees that matured over a century or more and grew in the absence of strong anthropological pressures. In forests now being logged for a second and third time, that volume has not been reconstituted due in part to the lack of implementation of post-logging silvicultural treatments. This depletion of timber stocks renders the degraded forests prone to conversion to other land uses. Although it is essential to preserve undisturbed primary forests through the creation of protected areas, these areas alone will not be able to ensure the conservation of all species on a pan-tropical scale, for social, economic and political reasons. The conservation of tropical forests of tomorrow will mostly take place within human-modified (logged, domesticated) forests. In this context, silvicultural interventions are considered by many tropical foresters and forest ecologists as tools capable of effectively conserving tropical forest biodiversity and ecosystem services while stimulating forest production. This systematic review aims to assess past and current evidence of the impact of silviculture on tropical forests and to identify silvicultural practices appropriate for the current conditions in the forests and forestry sectors of the Congo Basin, Amazonia and Southeast Asia.
   Methods: This systematic review will undertake an extensive search of literature to assess the relative effectiveness of different silvicultural interventions on timber production and the conservation value of forests, and to determine whether there is a relationship between sustainability of timber harvesting and the maintenance/conservation of other ecosystem services and biodiversity in production forests. Data will be extracted for meta-analysis of at least sub-sets of the review questions. Findings are expected to help inform policy and develop evidence-based practice guidelines on silvicultural practices in tropical forests.

TI  - What works in tropical forest conservation, and what does not: Effectiveness of four strategies in terms of environmental, social, and economic outcomes
T2  - CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
AB  - Tropical forests and their biodiversity are disappearing, despite decades of conservation efforts. Are we now in a position to understand whether some conservation strategies work better while others consistently fail in protecting tropical forests? We searched the literature to evaluate four mainstream strategies (forest certification and reduced impact logging, payments for ecosystem services, protected areas, community forest management) in terms of 35 environmental, social, and economic metrics. We evaluated whether applying the strategy improved, left unchanged, or worsened the conservation metrics and we created an interactive platform to view the data. We concluded that (a) the scientific literature on the effectiveness of conservation strategies in tropical forests is still vastly inadequate, due to poor design, lack of scope, and too few examples; (b) the effects of conservation on biodiversity and the economic outcomes of conservation are particularly understudied; and (c) all strategies fail at least some of the times, but all of them succeed at least some times. Our recommendation is that each new instance of implementing a given strategy should consider in detail, at the very least, the negative evidence on the given strategy, in order to avoid repeating the same mistakes. We introduce an interactive, dynamic platform to host various types of conservation effectiveness evidence.

TI  - Aboveground carbon loss in natural and managed tropical forests from 2000 to 2012
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Tropical forests provide global climate regulation ecosystem services and their clearing is a significant source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and resultant radiative forcing of climate change. However, consensus on pan-tropical forest carbon dynamics is lacking. We present a new estimate that employs recommended good practices to quantify gross tropical forest aboveground carbon (AGC) loss from 2000 to 2012 through the integration of Landsat-derived tree canopy cover, height, intactness and forest cover loss and GLAS-lidar derived forest biomass. An unbiased estimate of forest loss area is produced using a stratified random sample with strata derived from a wall-to-wall 30 m forest cover loss map. Our sample-based results separate the gross loss of forest AGC into losses from natural forests (0.59 PgC yr(-1)) and losses from managed forests (0.43 PgC yr(-1)) including plantations, agroforestry systems and subsistence agriculture. Latin America accounts for 43% of gross AGC loss and 54% of natural forest AGC loss, with Brazil experiencing the highest AGC loss for both categories at national scales. We estimate gross tropical forest AGC loss and natural forest loss to account for 11% and6% of global year 2012 CO2 emissions, respectively. Given recent trends, natural forests will likely constitute an increasingly smaller proportion of tropical forest GHG emissions and of global emissions as fossil fuel consumption increases, with implications for the valuation of co-benefits in tropical forest conservation.

TI  - Natural regeneration as a tool for large-scale forest restoration in the tropics: prospects and challenges
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - A major global effort to enable cost-effective natural regeneration is needed to achieve ambitious forest and landscape restoration goals. Natural forest regeneration can potentially play a major role in large-scale landscape restoration in tropical regions. Here, we focus on the conditions that favor natural regeneration within tropical forest landscapes. We illustrate cases where large-scale natural regeneration followed forest clearing and non-forest land use, and describe the social and ecological factors that drove these local forest transitions. The self-organizing processes that create naturally regenerating forests and natural regeneration in planted forests promote local genetic adaptation, foster native species with known traditional uses, create spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and sustain local biodiversity and biotic interactions. These features confer greater ecosystem resilience in the face of future shocks and disturbances. We discuss economic, social, and legal issues that challenge natural regeneration in tropical landscapes. We conclude by suggesting ways to enable natural regeneration to become an effective tool for implementing large-scale forest and landscape restoration. Major research and policy priorities include: identifying and modeling the ecological and economic conditions where natural regeneration is a viable and favorable land-use option, developing monitoring protocols for natural regeneration that can be carried out by local communities, and developing enabling incentives, governance structures, and regulatory conditions that promote the stewardship of naturally regenerating forests. Aligning restoration goals and practices with natural regeneration can achieve the best possible outcome for achieving multiple social and environmental benefits at minimal cost.

TI  - Jungle rubber facilitates the restoration of degraded soil of an existing rubber plantation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Conversion of forest to rubber plantation is one of the most common land-use change in the humid tropical region. It is one of the fastest expanding farms that lead to various socioenvironmental issues. We investigated the effect of this land-use change on soil physico-chemical properties by surveying different succession stage rubber plantations, including monoculture and a mixture derived by mixing jungle rubber and a reference tropical rainforest. We also assessed the impact on stoichiometric ratios and allocation relationships of soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). Our results demonstrated that conversion of tropical rainforest to rubber monoculture resulted in serious soil degradation, with a lower level of water content, water holding capacities, total porosity, pH, and soil nutrients, and a higher level of soil bulk density. However, after transforming a rubber monoculture into a jungle rubber, the concentrations of soil total C, N, P, Ca, and Mg significantly increased, by 28%, 24%, 23%, 17%, and 39%, respectively. Meanwhile, soil salinity declined by 15%. Jungle rubber also exerted some desirable effects on soil physical properties, such as decreased soil bulk density, increased field capacity and non-porosity by 6%, 2%, and 33%, respectively. Like other tropical regions, soils in the present study areas are mainly under P limitation, but jungle rubber increased soil P turnover and thereby increases P availability. In conclusion, jungle rubber correcting the soil degradation resulted from rubber plantation on tropical forest soil. Given the improvements in soil quality, constructing multiple-strata and multispecies rubber agroforestry (e.g., jungle rubber) can be a promising approach to facilitate the restoration of the existing monoculture rubber plantations.

TI  - Global potential for natural regeneration in deforested tropical regions
T2  - NATURE
AB  - Extensive forest restoration is a key strategy to meet nature-based sustainable development goals and provide multiple social and environmental benefits1. Yet achieving forest restoration at scale requires cost-effective methods2. Tree planting in degraded landscapes is a popular but costly forest restoration method that often results in less biodiverse forests when compared to natural regeneration techniques under similar conditions3. Here we assess the current spatial distribution of pantropical natural forest (from 2000 to 2016) and use this to present a model of the potential for natural regeneration across tropical forested countries and biomes at a spatial resolution of 30 m. We estimate that an area of 215 million hectares-an area greater than the entire country of Mexico-has potential for natural forest regeneration, representing an above-ground carbon sequestration potential of 23.4 Gt C (range, 21.1-25.7 Gt) over 30 years. Five countries (Brazil, Indonesia, China, Mexico and Colombia) account for 52% of this estimated potential, showcasing the need for targeting restoration initiatives that leverage natural regeneration potential. Our results facilitate broader equitable decision-making processes that capitalize on the widespread opportunity for natural regeneration to help achieve national and global environmental agendas.

TI  - Enhancing Ecosystem Services to Minimize Impact of Climate Variability in a Dry Tropical Forest with Vertisols
T2  - HYDROLOGY
AB  - Increased droughts and variable rainfall patterns may alter the capacity to provide ecosystem services, such as biomass production and clean water provision. The impact of these factors in a semi-arid region, especially on a dry tropical forest with Vertisols and under different land uses such as regenerated vegetation and thinned vegetation, is still unclear. This study analyzes hydrologic processes under precipitation pulses and intra-seasonal droughts, and suggests management practices for ecosystem services improvement. A local 43-year dataset showed a varying climate with a decrease in number of small events, and an increase in the number of dry days and in event rainfall intensity, in two catchments with different land use patterns and with Vertisols, a major soil order in semi-arid tropics. The onset of runoff depends on the expansive characteristics of the soil rather than land use, as dry spells promote micro-cracks that delay the runoff process. Forest thinning enhances groundcover development and is a better management practice for biomass production. This management practice shows a lower water yield when compared to a regenerated forest, supporting the decision of investing in forest regeneration in order to attend to an increasing water storage demand.

TI  - A universal airborne LiDAR approach for tropical forest carbon mapping
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is fast turning the corner from demonstration technology to a key tool for assessing carbon stocks in tropical forests. With its ability to penetrate tropical forest canopies and detect three-dimensional forest structure, LiDAR may prove to be a major component of international strategies to measure and account for carbon emissions from and uptake by tropical forests. To date, however, basic ecological information such as height-diameter allometry and stand-level wood density have not been mechanistically incorporated into methods for mapping forest carbon at regional and global scales. A better incorporation of these structural patterns in forests may reduce the considerable time needed to calibrate airborne data with ground-based forest inventory plots, which presently necessitate exhaustive measurements of tree diameters and heights, as well as tree identifications for wood density estimation. Here, we develop a new approach that can facilitate rapid LiDAR calibration with minimal field data. Throughout four tropical regions (Panama, Peru, Madagascar, and Hawaii), we were able to predict aboveground carbon density estimated in field inventory plots using a single universal LiDAR model (r (2) = 0.80, RMSE = 27.6 Mg C ha(-1)). This model is comparable in predictive power to locally calibrated models, but relies on limited inputs of basal area and wood density information for a given region, rather than on traditional plot inventories. With this approach, we propose to radically decrease the time required to calibrate airborne LiDAR data and thus increase the output of high-resolution carbon maps, supporting tropical forest conservation and climate mitigation policy.

AB  - In tropical regions where agricultural activities are limited, agroforestry is an alternative for both economic development and for the management and conservation of biodiversity. The potential role of different types of land use as reservoirs of dung beetle diversity in the wet tropical forest of the Pacific lowlands of Colombia is evaluated in three agroforestry systems that differ in canopy cover and the sowing density of crops associated with timber forest. Although total species richness was similar among land use types, differences related to the decrease in the abundance and biomass of the species were remarkable, and reflected in turn by the diversity and structure of the guilds. The general pattern observed was one in which the structure of the dung beetle assemblage of growing below a diversified and permanent tree cover was similar to that of the primary and secondary forest. Beetle diversity in management systems with less tree cover or a high sowing density of was lower and very similar to that of abandoned agricultural fields. This suggests that agroforestry systems can be viewed as valuable instruments for biodiversity management and conservation in the wet tropical forests of the Pacific lowlands and not just as substitutes for forest, though we must be aware that structural changes in the beetle community may in turn affect the ecological processes regulated by these insects in the agrosystems under study.

TI  - Payment for environmental services: Forest conservation and poverty alleviation in a tropical region of Mexico
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Payment for environmental services (PES) is a scheme that seeks to reduce human pressure on forest ecosystems by financially rewarding forest landowners for conserving their forests. However, in Mexico, the program is questioned because it prioritizes communities in the poorest regions over areas with a high risk of deforestation. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the PES program for forest cover conservation and poverty alleviation in a tropical region of Mexico. Deforestation and forest cover maintenance was determined by land use/cover change analysis using GIS. Effect on poverty alleviation was analyzed qualitatively in two communities. In the study area, 4738 ha of tropical and temperate forests were deforested during 2007-2017. The deforestation rate is similar in ejidos and private properties with and without PES. Most ejidos where deforestation occurred correspond to areas with higher economic development. Deforestation and the percentage of the population living in poverty are negatively correlated. Compared to other subsidies, the PES represents very low income, nevertheless, the social perception of the program is positive. Based on the lower percentage of deforestation avoided in the poorest areas and the minimal impact on livelihoods, the current PES approach is not highly effective.

TI  - Payments for Ecosystem Services as Incentives for Collective Action
T2  - SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES
AB  - The design and thriving of payments for ecosystem services (PES) have occurred as a response to the relative failure of integrated strategies for reconciling conservation and development. The most widespread definition of PES conceives these payments as markets to solve environmental externalities. This article analyzes the limitations of this Coasean approach using insights from transaction costs economics, and it pleads for looking at PES with different analytical lenses. It argues that PES should be seen as incentives for collective action. However, the extent to which incentives can contribute to the management of ES should not be taken for granted. The effects of monetary incentives are determined by their social meanings, which are context and culture dependent. The proposed conceptual shift has significant analytical and practical implications.

T2  - PATTERNS AND PROCESSES IN FOREST LANDSCAPES: MULTIPLE USE AND SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT
CP  - IUFRO Landscape Ecology Workshop
AB  - Understanding the extent and causes of savannah-forest dynamics in tropical regions is vital as small but widespread changes to tropical forests can have a major impact on global climate, biodiversity and human well-being. There is emerging evidence from aerial photography that an overall expansion of monsoon rainforests has occurred in northern Australia over the last few decades. Factors that may have driven the observed rainforest dynamics include the management of local scale disturbance events such as fire and buffalo numbers, as well as regional scale factors such as increases in rainfall and atmospheric CO2. Landscape ecology studies conducted in Kakadu National Park are provided as a case study as they together provide a cohesive methodology for investigating the consequences of management. The extent of boundary change at individual rainforest patches supported an effect of fire on the rainforest dynamics. The effect of historical buffalo impact was also supported by modelling analyses. However disturbance factors were unable to account for the overall expansion of rainforest. We conclude that fire and buffalo management have mediated the boundary dynamics. However, the overall boundary expansion is likely to have been primarily driven by factors that have shown similar increases during the study period, such as annual rainfall and atmospheric CO2. The methodology presented can be applied to forests in other regions and will contribute to 'adaptive management' programs, particularly with respect to fire management.

TI  - Wildlife conservation and reduced emissions from deforestation in a case study of Nantu Wildlife Reserve, Sulawesi: 2. An institutional framework for REDD implementation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB  - Climate change threatens ecosystems and human society, with tropical deforestation contributing a fifth of anthropogenic carbon emissions. The proposed REDD mechanism will provide compensation for tropical forest nations to reduce deforestation, and potentially also co-benefits for rural communities and biodiversity. The success of REDD implementation will be partially determined by domestic institutional conditions. These have not yet been well articulated, so we develop a systematic approach to assessing institutional capability for REDD implementation at both the local and national levels, based upon the definition of REDD as a payment for ecosystem services (PES). We demonstrate the utility of this framework using the case study of Indonesia and a protected area within it (Nantu). We find that many of the institutional requirements for REDD cannot currently be met on the national level. Yet at the local level, the existence of an ongoing conservation project has strengthened the institutional framework within which REDD could operate, leading to a more positive outlook. We suggest that our analytical framework could be helpful in highlighting the institutional issues that could impede the implementation of REDD across scales and thus be a useful tool in improving the viability of this crucial strategy.

TI  - Pests and diseases regulation in coffee agroecosystems by management systems and resistance in changing climate conditions: a review
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION
AB  - Coffea (Gentianales: Rubiaceae) is an economic plant considering its production income and the number of people that depend on it for their daily livelihoods. Tropical regions predicted to face severe challenges related to climate change impacts often grow coffee. Like other crops, coffee benefits from many ecosystem services, mainly regulating and supporting ecosystem services that play a role in production. Since the emergence of coffee pests and diseases, there have been two primary control techniques: pesticide application and crops management techniques. In most cases, chemical control is nearly ineffective and associated with pesticide resistance, environmental pollution, chemical hazards, and resurgence. This paper reviews management systems and coffee resistance. Studies show that management systems and plant resistance can maintain functional pest and disease regulatory ecosystem services within coffee plantations. We also evaluate how pest and disease regulation services can behave in climate change. The literature shows that managing coffee farms and plant resistance can mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on pest and disease regulation services. Therefore, they can maintain functional ecosystem services and help farmers in tropical areas adapt and be resilient to changing environmental conditions. It is crucial to update these ecological and environmentally friendly control techniques and understand how they will perform under future climate change. Based on the reviewed literature, we identify knowledge gaps and suggest three priority studies in this substantial area of future research. Finding solutions could enhance farmers' perception of interactions between regulation services and climate change and could support ensuring food security.

TI  - Woody plants diversity and the associated provisioning ecosystem services across three contrasting forest management regimes in Southwest Ethiopia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - Woody plants are a source of provisioning ecosystem services. Coffee management impacts forest composition, structure, and diversity. We studied the effect of coffee management intensification on woody plants and their associated provisioning ecosystem services under three contrasting forest management regimes in southwest Ethiopia. The study employed mixed approaches (vegetation assessment and ethnoecological study) to collect the data. Woody plants were collected from 189 plots and perceived local ecosystem services were identified by 136 individuals through an ethnoecological approach. The total number of woody plants recorded in the natural forest, coffee forest, and coffee agroforest was 971, 945, and 521 respectively. Species richness in natural forest, coffee forest, and coffee agroforest were 57, 54, and 53 respectively. The local people perceived 17 different provisioning ecosystem services collected from the three forest types. The result showed that there is a positive relationship between the diversity and use value of woody plants across the three forest management regimes. Coffee management intensification simplifies the stand structure, woody plant composition, and ecosystem services of the forest. Plant use value increases in coffee agroforests. Coffee agroforests can serve as repositories of diversity and ecosystem services in southwest Ethiopia.

TI  - Tropical forest restoration: Fast resilience of plant biomass contrasts with slow recovery of stable soil C stocks
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Due to intensifying human disturbance, over half of the world's tropical forests are reforested or afforested secondary forests or plantations. Understanding the resilience of carbon (C) stocks in these forests, and estimating the extent to which they can provide equivalent carbon (C) sequestration and stabilization to the old growth forest they replace, is critical for the global C balance. In this study, we combined estimates of biomass C stocks with a detailed assessment of soil C pools in bare land, Eucalyptus plantation, secondary forest and natural old-growth forest after over 50years of forest restoration in a degraded tropical region of South China. We used isotope studies, density fractionation and physical fractionation to determine the age and stability of soil C pools at different soil depths. After 52years, the secondary forests had equivalent biomass C stocks to natural forest, whereas soil C stocks were still much higher in natural forest (97.42t/ha) than in secondary forest (58.75 t/ha) or Eucalyptus plantation (38.99t/ha) and lowest in bare land (19.9t/ha). Analysis of C-13 values revealed that most of the C in the soil surface horizons in the secondary forest was new C, with a limited increase of more recalcitrant old C, and limited accumulation of C in deeper soil horizons. However, occlusion of C in microaggregates in the surface soil layer was similar across forested sites, which suggests that there is great potential for additional soil C sequestration and stabilization in the secondary forest and Eucalyptus plantation. Collectively, our results demonstrate that reforestation on degraded tropical land can restore biomass C and surface soil C stocks within a few decades, but much longer recovery times are needed to restore recalcitrant C pools and C stocks at depth. Repeated harvesting and disturbance in rotation plantations had a substantial negative impact on the recovery of soil C stocks. We suggest that current calculations of soil C in secondary tropical forests (e.g. IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories) could overestimate soil C sequestration and stabilization levels in secondary forests and plantations.

TI  - Beneath the Canopy: Tropical Forests Enrolled in Conservation Payments Reveal Evidence of Less Degradation
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Assessments of programs offering payments for forest conservation have largely focused on their contribution to avoiding deforestation but have overlooked degradation. We integrated remotely-sensed forest cover images, georeferenced landscape information, field-level forest inventories and face-to-face landowner surveys to quantify avoided deforestation and degradation within the context of Ecuador's Socio Bosque Program (PSB). We found the PSB prevented 9% of enrolled forest area in Ecuador's Amazon Basin from being deforested over the 2008-2014 period. This value is higher than previous assessments conducted in other Latin American nations. Inventory data suggest that forests within PSB-enrolled areas exhibited less evidence of degradation although statistical differences were only marginally significant On average, PSB-enrolled forests had between one and two more tree species per hectare than non-enrolled forests. These additional tree species'were twice as likely to be of commercial timber value and at greater threat of extinction. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of historical land use and recovery pathways on composition, structure, ecological function, and ecosystem services in a Caribbean secondary forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Regenerated secondary forests in the tropics are resilient ecosystems. Differences in land-use history and disturbance, abiotic and biotic site conditions, and successional pathways can influence secondary forest biodiversity, structure, ecological functions, and ecosystem services. However, studies assessing the supply of ecosystem services of secondary forests are limited. We examined trees in plots located across late successional stage secondary forest in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico with three combinations of historical canopy cover (circa 1936) and post-agricultural recovery pathways: (1) > 50% canopy cover and passive regeneration (>50 P), (2) < 50% canopy cover and passive regeneration (<50 P), and (3) < 50% canopy cover and assisted + passive regeneration (<50 A+P). Using i-Tree Eco methodology, we investigated if differences in historical cover and passive vs assisted natural regeneration resulted in differences in composition and structure, hydrological functions, and estimated regulating ecosystem services, and compared the results between native and non-native species. The <50 P plots had greater species richness than the >50 P and <50 A+P plots, while the <50 A+P plots had significantly greater DBH, height, basal area, aboveground biomass, and estimated quantities of evaporation and transpiration, carbon storage, and removal of airborne contaminants compared to the other recovery pathways. Differences among plot groups can be attributed to historical management actions in concert with successional trajectories characteristic of novel secondary forests. Native species dominated throughout these secondary forests and cumulatively exhibited services that were 1.3 to 3.5 times greater than those of non-native species. However, non-native trees contributed disproportionally to basal area and above-ground biomass, and thus to some ecosystem services. Both natives and non-natives exhibited service provision that varied significantly with diameter size class and service type, and large trees were observed to be dominant service providers irrespective of species origin. Our study marks the first landscape-scale quantitative assessment of forest composition, structure and ecological functioning that is explicitly linked to exploring regulating ecosystem services within the montane secondary forest in Puerto Rico and expands representation of this research from the Caribbean. The findings underscore the role of historical land use and recovery pathways in driving services of tropical forests and show how ecosystem functions can vary in accordance with dynamic structural attributes of individual trees. This research can provide a useful point of comparison for analysis of biomass accumulation, ecosystem service provision, and evaluating service tradeoffs associated with forest structure in other recovering and old-growth tropical landscapes.

TI  - Carbon stock corridors to mitigate climate change and promote biodiversity in the tropics
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
AB  - A key issue in global conservation is how biodiversity co-benefits can be incorporated into land use and climate change mitigation activities, particularly those being negotiated under the United Nations to reduce emissions from tropical deforestation and forest degradation(1,2). Protected areas have been the dominant strategy for tropical forest conservation and they have increased substantially in recent decades(3). Avoiding deforestation by preserving carbon stored in vegetation between protected areas provides an opportunity to mitigate the effects of land use and climate change on biodiversity by maintaining habitat connectivity across landscapes. Here we use a high-resolution data set of vegetation carbon stock to map corridors traversing areas of highest biomass between protected areas in the tropics. The derived corridors contain 15% of the total unprotected aboveground carbon in the tropical region. A large number of corridors have carbon densities that approach or exceed those of the protected areas they connect, suggesting these are suitable areas for achieving both habitat connectivity and climate change mitigation benefits. To further illustrate how economic and biological information can be used for corridor prioritization on a regional scale, we conducted a multicriteria analysis of corridors in the Legal Amazon, identifying corridors with high carbon, high species richness and endemism, and low economic opportunity costs. We also assessed the vulnerability of corridors to future deforestation threat.

TI  - Molecular-level insight into the effect of fertilization regimes on the chemodiversity of dissolved organic matter in tropical cropland
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Fertilization is a critical agronomic measure for croplands in tropical regions, owing to their low fertility. However, the effects of fertilization on the quantity and chemodiversity of latosolic dissolved organic matter (DOM) in tropical regions remain largely unknown. Therefore, in this study, the variations in latosol DOM concentrations and chemodiversity induced by inorganic fertilization and the co-application of inorganic fertilization with straw return, sheep manure, biochar, and vermicompost fertilizers at a molecular level were systematically investigated using multispectral techniques and ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry. In line with our expectations, the results showed that combined inorganic-organic fertilization improved soil quality by increasing soil organic carbon content compared to that under inorganic fertilization. However, as the most active and bioavailable organic carbon pool, dissolved organic carbonconcentrations between the fertilization treatments were not significantly different (p = 0.07). However, the dissolved organic carbon concentrations under combined inorganic-organic fertilization treatment (NPK plus straw return, 263.45 +/- 37.51 mg/kg) were lower than those under inorganic fertilization treatment (282.10 +/- 18.57 mg/kg). Spectral analysis showed that the DOM in the combined inorganic-organic fertilization treatments had a higher degree of humification and lower autogenetic contributions. Furthermore, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry analysis indicated that the combined inorganic-organic fertilization increased the chemodiversity of latosolic DOM and promoted the production of large, oxidized, and stable molecules, including lignin, aromatic, and tannin compounds, which potentially benefits soil carbon sequestration in tropical regions. This study could provide a theoretical basis for elucidating on the potentially relevant ecological functions and environmental effects of DOM under fertilization regimes.

TI  - Restoration of ecosystem services in tropical forests: A global meta-analysis
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - To reverse the effects of deforestation, tropical areas have expanded restoration efforts in recent years. As ecological restoration positively affects the structure and function of degraded ecosystems, understanding to what extent restoration recovers ecosystem services (ES) is an important step in directing large-scale restoration actions. We evaluated the effect of restoration in increasing the provision of ES in tropical forests. We performed a global meta-analysis of ecological indicators of the ES provided in restored areas, degraded areas and reference ecosystems. We tested for the effects of different restoration strategies, different types of degradation and for the effects of restoration over time. Overall, restoration actions contributed to a significant increase in levels of ecological indicators of ES (carbon pool, soil attributes and biodiversity protection) compared to disturbed areas. Among the restoration strategies, the natural regeneration was the most effective. Biodiversity protection and carbon recovered better than soil attributes. All other restoration strategies recovered ES to a substantially lesser degree, and reforestation with exotics decreased the ES of areas degraded by agriculture. In areas degraded by pasture, restoration was more effective in recovering the biodiversity protection, whereas in areas degraded by agriculture, the restoration recovered mainly the carbon pool. Our results show that by choosing the correct strategy, restoration can recover much of the ES lost by the degradation of tropical forests. These results should be considered for large-scale conservation and management efforts for this biome.

TI  - Economic valuation of forest conservation: insight from a current systematic literature review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
AB  - Forest conservation is vital for biodiversity, climate regulation and livelihoods. However, valuing its economic benefits is challenging. This review assesses and synthesizes current methodologies and findings on the economic valuation of forest conservation, focusing on non-market benefits and diverse valuation approaches. The study was reviewed from 2018 to 2023 using Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), and EconBiz, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework. Analyzing 37 articles, three themes were identified: Community and Socioeconomic Aspects (15 articles), Economic Valuation Techniques (16 articles), and Policy Implications (6 articles). Contingent valuation and choice modelling were found to be predominant, especially in tropical forests of developing countries, where higher WTP values than other regions highlight their importance in supporting conservation efforts. Though challenges such as data disparities and limitations persist, recent advancements, such as the use of remote sensing and ecosystem service modelling, have improved the precision of forest conservation valuations. Standardized methodologies and better data integration are required to improve the accuracy and comparability of economic valuations, ensuring more reliable data for policy-making and resource allocation in forest conservation. This review aids researchers, policymakers, and practitioners in enhancing forest conservation strategies through robust economic valuation.

TI  - Measuring the net benefits of payments for hydrological services programs in Mexico
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - A number of studies show that payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs contribute to reducing deforestation, but few have measured the impact on ecosystem service provision or compared economic benefits and costs of these programs. We integrate impact evaluation and ecosystem service measurement to examine the effects of PES programs in Veracruz, Mexico. We use quasi-experimental methods to measure the effect of enrolling in PES on forest cover. We link these changes in forest cover to field-calibrated measures of water regulation and carbon storage. After converting these changes in ecosystem services to monetary values we calculate the net benefits of the programs. We find that PES reduces losses of forest cover but that the additional gains in forest cover are small. However, these gains in forest lead to positive water regulation and carbon storage services. The net benefits of the PES programs over a 10-year period are as large as USD 3.2 million for watershed services and USD 4.9 million for water plus carbon storage. However, when there is no additionality in forest cover due to PES, the programs result in economic losses. Adopting this type of integrated modeling of PES impacts sheds light on the economic efficiency of these approaches.

TI  - Generalist birds promote tropical forest regeneration and increase plant diversity via rare-biased seed dispersal
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Regenerated forests now compose over half of the world's tropical forest cover and are increasingly important as providers of ecosystem services, freshwater, and biodiversity conservation. Much of the value and functionality of regenerating forests-depends on the plant diversity they contain. Tropical forest diversity is strongly shaped by mutualistic interactions between plants and fruit-eating animals (frugivores) that disperse seeds. Here we show how seed dispersal by birds can influence the speed and diversity of early successional forests in Puerto Rico. For two years, we monitored the monthly fruit production of bird-dispersed plants on a fragmented landscape, and measured seed dispersal activity of birds and plant establishment in experimental plots located in deforested areas. Two predominantly omnivorous bird species, the Northern Mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos) and the Gray Kingbird (Tyrannus dominicensis), proved critical for speeding up the establishment of woody plants and increasing the species richness and diversity of the seed rain in deforested areas. Seed dispersal by these generalists increased the odds for rare plant species to disperse and establish in experimental forest-regeneration plots. Results indicate that birds that mix fruit and insects in their diets and actively forage across open and forested habitats can play keystone roles in the regeneration of mutualistic plant-animal communities. Furthermore, our analyses reveal that rare-biased (antiapostatic) frugivory and seed dispersal is the mechanism responsible for increasing plant diversity in the early-regenerating community.

TI  - Could cattle ranching and soybean cultivation be sustainable? A systematic review and a meta-analysis for the Amazon
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
AB  - Tropical forests are being destroyed to make space for agricultural activities with the assumption that they are required to feed the growing global population. Consequently, more sustainable practices are needed to guarantee food security and environmental protection of highly threatened natural biodiversity hotspots like the Amazon rainforest. Cattle ranching and soybean cultivation are by far the greater drivers of land use change and deforestation in the Amazon region. We performed a systematic review of papers related to these two main drivers and a meta-analysis on the effects of sustainable practices on different ecosystem services. The results of the review highlight a large concern about the negative impacts of cattle ranching and soybean crops on the ecosystem dynamics and functionality of the Amazon biome, in addition to the clear relationship with deforestation. Another relevant finding is the large gap in empirical research concerning the effects of sustainable practices on different ecosystem services. Such a gap is evident since only 13 studies from the initial database met the requirements for a meta-analysis. Of the 171 comparisons between the ecosystem services provided in conventional land-uses and those adopting sustainable practices, the overall model indicated a non-significant effect, although the results were heterogeneous. Crop yield and herbage biomass were negatively affected, while livestock productivity, soil organic carbon, soil fertility and woody biomass were positively affected. Also, the six sustainable practices evaluated showed different outcomes, from a predominance of positive effects in silvopastoral systems, to a predominance of negative effects on agrosilvicultural systems. Our systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that cattle ranching and soybean cultivation can indeed be conducted in a more sustainable way, enhancing the provision of ecosystem services while avoiding deforestation. In turn, our results also highlight the lack of empirical data and the need to standardize the methodologies used to deeply assess the effects of such practices. In conclusion, we suggest a way to advance research into the real effects of sustainable practices aimed at reducing the negative impacts of cattle ranching and soybean crops in the Amazon.

TI  - Economic trade-offs between carbon sequestration, timber production, and crop pollination in tropical forested landscapes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY
CP  - International Workshop on Ecosystems Services - Solution for Problems of a Problem that neesd Solution
AB  - The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment distinguishes between supporting, regulating, provisioning, and cultural ecosystem services. We focus on three services, namely the provision of timber, the regulation of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and the supporting service of bee pollination for coffee production. Possible trade-offs between the different ecosystem services might result in a reduced attractiveness of afforestation projects when taking pollination services into account. We found that economic losses due to a limited reduction of tree density of a Cordia alliodora plantation can be overcompensated by generating pollination services to adjacent coffee agroforestry systems. Thus, for moderate silvicultural interventions such trade-offs do not necessarily occur. Including additional ecosystem services such as biological pest control or seed dispersal, which are also associated with the enhanced functional biodiversity in less dense tree plantations, might further emphasize the hump-shaped relationship between tree density and forest revenues.

TI  - Biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes of Mesoamerica: Past, present and future
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Mesoamerica provides a unique context for biodiversity conservation in managed landscapes because of its geography, history of human intervention, and present conservation and development initiatives. The long and narrow form of the Mesoamerican landmass, and its division by a central mountain range, has served as both a bridge and a barrier. Conservation efforts in Mesoamerica are unique for the emphasis they place on regional connectivity through the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor and on biodiversity conservation in managed landscapes. The emphasis on conservation in agricultural systems has fostered innovations in payment for ecosystem services, and provides novel insights on the functional role that biodiversity plays in the provisioning of ecosystem services. The increasing rate of economic development in the region and the advent of new payment for ecosystem service schemes have provided new opportunities for forest regeneration and restoration. However, the small scale of private landholdings and the diversity of land uses featured in the region, while contributing to biodiversity conservation due to their structural and floristic complexity, present challenges for biodiversity monitoring and management.

TI  - Chemical parameters of decomposing dung in tropical forest as indicators of feeding behaviour of large herbivores: A step beyond classical stoichiometry
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Feeding behavior of large herbivores determines the composition of their dung and together with environmental factors the intensity of decomposition processes leading to the recycling of nutrients in tropical forests. Large herbivore dung and its decomposition has so far been characterized by stoichiometric analyses of elements such as C and N. The objective of our study was to examine the suitability of biomarker analyses and analytical pyrolysis to infer large herbivore feeding behavior and the decomposition of their dung in different environments. Our conceptual approach included exposure of fresh dung of a grazing ruminant (gaur, Bos gaurus) and a non-ruminant mixed-feeder (the Asian elephant, Elephas maximus) in two tropical forest types (dry and moist) and analysis of dung biochemical composition in two seasons (dry and wet). To this end we characterized the dungs' lignin and carbohydrate (sugar) signatures and pyrolysis products before and after 28 days of exposure.
   Our results showed that stoichiometric as well as biomarker analyses were able to differentiate gaur and elephant dung independent of season and forest type, while analytical pyrolysis products did not differ between dung types. The lignin signature of fresh dung additionally indicated the forage preference of animals in different forest types and seasons. During decomposition, C and N contents decreased and the chemical composition of both dung types converged. The lignin signature of dung at the end of the experiment showed higher lignin decomposition in moist forest and wet season than dry forest and dry season. We conclude that detailed biochemical analyses can provide deeper insights into the main controls of large herbivore dung and its decomposition in tropical forests than stoichiometric analysis. In particular lignin may be a suitable indicator to investigate large herbivore feeding behavior and the environmental conditions of their habitat.

TI  - Towards accurate mapping of forest in tropical landscapes: A comparison of datasets on how forest transition matters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Tropical forests represent half of the Earth's remaining forest area, but they are shrinking at high rates, which poses a threat to their multiple ecosystem services. As a response, international environmental agreements and related programs require information about tropical forested landscapes. Despite the increasing quantity and quality of remote sensing-based data, the effective monitoring of forests in the tropics still faces operational challenges: (a) applicability at local levels, with lack of reference or cloud-free information; (b) overcoming geographical, ecological, or biophysical variability; (c): stratification, distinguishing forest categories related to functionality and disturbance history. We conducted an extensive ground verification campaign through 36 landscapes in 9 regions of Zambia, Ecuador and Philippines, which constitute a gradient of pantropical deforestation contexts or forest transitions. We collected over 16,000 ground control points and digitized over 18,000 ha with details on land use and forest disturbance history. We trained a random forest algorithm and generated high-resolution (30 m) binary forest maps covering ~15 Mha, building on 39 optical (Landsat-8), radar (Sentinel-1) and elevation bands, indices and textures. We validated the quality of the outputs across the studied deforestation gradient and compared them to (a): 3 national land cover maps used for international reporting, (b): 4 global forest datasets (Global Forest Change, Copernicus Land Cover, JAXA and TanDEM-X Forest/Non-Forest). Our method generated highly accurate (92%) forest maps for the studied regions when compared to the global datasets, which generally overestimated forest cover. We achieved accuracies similar to the national maps, following a standardized method for all countries. The difficulties in delineating forest increased in more advanced stages of deforestation, with recurring struggles to distinguish non-forest tree-based systems (e.g. perennials, palms, or agroforestry), shrublands and grasslands. Regrowth forests were repeatedly misclassified across contexts, countries and datasets, in contrast to reference or degraded forests. Our results highlight the importance of in situ verification as accompanying method to establish efficient forest monitoring systems, especially in areas with higher rates of forest cover change and in tropical regions of advanced deforestation or early reforestation stages. These are precisely the areas where current REDD+ or Forest Landscape Restoration initiatives take place.

TI  - Landscape structure mediates zoochorous-dispersed seed rain under isolated pasture trees across distinct tropical regions
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB  - ContextIsolated pasture trees play an important role in forest recovery within fragmented tropical landscapes by attracting seed dispersers and facilitating seedling growth. However, studies with conflicting results have led to confusion about what drives variation in zoochorous-dispersed seed rain patterns under isolated tree canopies.ObjectivesTo assess the role of landscape and biological factors impacting zoochorous-dispersed seed rain under isolated pasture trees across three tropical regions of the world.MethodsWe measured seed dispersal under 144 isolated pasture trees found in 12 fragmented tropical and sub-tropical landscapes in Australia, Colombia and Nigeria. Using linear mixed effect models, we modeled seed diversity, abundance, richness and evenness as functions of the biological features and landscape context of isolated trees.ResultsThroughout all regions, the amount of woody vegetation surrounding trees in pastures was negatively related to rainforest seed diversity, evenness and abundance. Seed diversity and evenness increased significantly with the distance of isolated trees to forest fragments in the Australian sub-tropics, but elsewhere, seed diversity and evenness tended to decline with distance to forest, though not significantly.ConclusionsOur results suggest that the tree composition of landscapes surrounding isolated pasture trees is important for influencing zoochorous-dispersed seed rain, regardless of the region studied. Our study highlights the prominent role of landscape-scale, rather than local-scale factors on seed dispersal to isolated pasture trees, while providing strong evidence that early stage successional processes involving isolated pasture trees are similar throughout global tropical regions.

TI  - Forest regeneration can positively contribute to local hydrological ecosystem services: Implications for forest landscape restoration
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Governments are increasingly committing to significant forest restoration. While carbon sequestration is a major objective, the case for restoration often includes benefits to local communities. However, the impacts of forest restoration on local hydrological services (e.g. flood and erosion risk, stream flow during dry periods) are surprisingly poorly understood. Particularly limited information is available on the impacts of passive tropical forest restoration following shifting cultivation.
   The outcome depends on the trade-off between the improved soil infiltration capacity (reducing overland flow and increasing soil and groundwater recharge) and greater evapotranspiration (diminishing local water availability).
   Using measurements from highly instrumented plots under three vegetation types in the shifting cultivation cycle in Madagascar's eastern rainforests (forest, tree fallow and degraded abandoned agricultural land), and infiltration measurements for the same vegetation types across the landscape, we explore the impacts of forest regeneration on the ecohydrological processes that underpin locally important ecosystem services.
   Overland flow was minimal for the tree fallow (similar to the forest) and much lower than for the degraded land, likely leading to a lower risk of erosion and flooding compared to the degraded land. Conversely, evapotranspiration losses were lower for the tree fallow than the forest, leading to a higher net recharge, likely resulting in more streamflow between rainfall events.
   These results demonstrate that young regenerating tropical forest vegetation can positively contribute to locally important hydrological ecosystem services. Allowing tree fallows to recover further is unlikely to further reduce the risk of overland flow but may, at least temporarily, result in less streamflow.
   Synthesis and applications. Encouraging natural regeneration is increasingly seen as a cost-effective way to deliver forest landscape restoration. Our data suggest that increasing the abundance of young secondary forest in the tropics, by increasing fallow lengths in the shifting cultivation cycle, could make a positive contribution to locally important hydrological ecosystem services (specifically reducing overland flow and therefore erosion and flooding, while maintaining streamflows). Such empirical understanding is needed to inform the models used for planning forest landscape restoration to maximize benefits to local communities.

TI  - Lessons Learned from the Water Producer Project in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Forest and landscape restoration (FLR) is a powerful strategy for large-scale tropical forest recovery, and payment for ecosystem services (PES) is used to support FLR programs and projects on privately-owned land. In this article, we discuss the lessons learned from the Water Producer Project, a pioneer, multiple-stakeholder, and PES-supported FLR project in the Atlantic Forest, south-eastern Brazil. The project was implemented in four landscapes located in two municipalities. Altogether, 41 PES contracts with landowners were signed, resulting in various FLR practices being implemented in a total of 342.4 ha (64.2 ha for riparian forest restoration, 90.8 ha for soil conservation, and 187.4 for forest conservation) of land, which represents 39% of the project goal. As of the end of the project, only 50% (USD 49,250) of the available PES funds had been spent. However, funds spent on project planning, implementation, communication, and monitoring were 12 times greater than those spent on PES. Several challenges restricted the progress and monitoring of the project. The main issue was landowner participation and/or engagement. In terms of lessons learned, we highlight that PES schemes are more complex than initially thought, and that sufficient funding does not guarantee the success of FLR projects. It is essential to promote landowner participation and engagement by considering them key players in FLR projects. Finally, acceptance from landowners was higher and implementation was easier for forest conservation practices that required no land-use changes. Thus, we suggest that similar future projects should focus on targeting private properties in marginal agricultural lands with a high probability of natural regeneration. Alternatively, future projects could focus on lands with remnant forest cover of high conservation value.

TI  - Modeling Aboveground Biomass in Tropical Forests Using Multi-Frequency SAR Data-A Comparison of Methods
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - In the context of climate change mitigation mechanisms for avoiding deforestation, i.e., reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), comprehensive forest monitoring, especially in tropical regions, is of high relevance. A precise determination of forest carbon stocks or above-ground biomass (AGB) for large areas is of special importance.
   This study analyzes and compares three different methods for retrieving AGB in Indonesia's peat swamp forests from multi-frequency SAR backscatter data. Field inventory AGB data were related to LiDAR measurements allowing plentiful accurate AGB estimations. These estimatedAGB data provided a powerful basis for SAR based AGB model calibration and validation. Multivariate linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) were examined for their performance to retrieve AGB on the basis of multi-temporal TerraSAR-X and ALOS PALSAR imagery.
   The MLR model resulted in lower coefficients of determination and higher error measures than the other two approaches and showed significant overestimations in the high biomass range. The SVR modeled AGB was more accurate than ANN modeled AGB in terms of independent validation, but showed less variation in the spatial distribution of AGB and saturated at approximately 260 t/ha. The ANN model showed a superior performance for modeling AGB up to 650 t/ha without a saturation in the lower biomass ranges.
   For the needs of REDD+, it is very important to know the possibilities, constraints and uncertainties of AGB retrieval based on satellite imagery.

TI  - Estimating the impacts of conservation on ecosystem services and poverty by integrating modeling and evaluation
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Scholars have made great advances in modeling and mapping ecosystem services, and in assigning economic values to these services. This modeling and valuation scholarship is often disconnected from evidence about how actual conservation programs have affected ecosystem services, however. Without a stronger evidence base, decision makers find it difficult to use the insights from modeling and valuation to design effective policies and programs. To strengthen the evidence base, scholars have advanced our understanding of the causal pathways between conservation actions and environmental outcomes, but their studies measure impacts on imperfect proxies for ecosystem services (e.g., avoidance of deforestation). To be useful to decision makers, these impacts must be translated into changes in ecosystem services and values. To illustrate how this translation can be done, we estimated the impacts of protected areas in Brazil, Costa Rica, Indonesia, and Thailand on carbon storage in forests. We found that protected areas in these conservation hotspots have stored at least an additional 1,000 Mt of CO2 in forests and have delivered ecosystem services worth at least $5 billion. This aggregate impact masks important spatial heterogeneity, however. Moreover, the spatial variability of impacts on carbon storage is the not the same as the spatial variability of impacts on avoided deforestation. These findings lead us to describe a research program that extends our framework to study other ecosystem services, to uncover the mechanisms by which ecosystem protection benefits humans, and to tie cost-benefit analyses to conservation planning so that we can obtain the greatest return on scarce conservation funds.

TI  - How Much Agroforestry Is Needed to Achieve Multifunctional Landscapes at the Forest Frontier?-Coupling Expert Opinion with Robust Goal Programming
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Agroforestry has been promoted as a key forest landscape restoration (FLR) option to restore ecosystem services in degraded tropical landscapes. We investigated the share and type of agroforestry selected in an optimized landscape, accounting for a mosaic of alternative forest landscape restoration options (reforestation and natural succession) and forest and common agricultural land-uses. We extend previous studies on multi-objective robust optimization and the analytic hierarchy process by a systematic sensitivity analysis to assess the influence of incorporating agroforestry into a landscape. This approach accounts for multiple objectives concurrently, yet data and computational requirements are relatively low. Our results show that experts from different backgrounds perceive agroforestry (i.e., alley cropping and silvopasture) very positively. Inclusion of large shares of agroforestry (41% share of landscape) in the FLR mix enhanced simulated ecosystem service provision. Our results demonstrate that landscapes with high shares of agroforestry may also comprise of high shares of natural forest. However, landscapes dominated by single agroforestry systems showed lower landscape multifunctionality than heterogeneous landscapes. In the ongoing effort to create sustainable landscapes, our approach contributes to an understanding of interrelations between land-covers and uncertain provisions of ecosystem services in circumstances with scarce data.

TI  - The critical importance of considering fire in REDD+ programs
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Fires are increasingly responsible for forest degradation in the humid tropics due to the expansion of fire-dependent agriculture, fragmentation, intensive logging practices and severe droughts. However, these forest fires have been largely overlooked by negotiations for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+). This paper examines how forest fires affect REDD+ schemes by compromising carbon permanence; undermining the potential of sustainable forest management and reforestation and regeneration activities in tropical countries; and threatening the additional benefits that can be accrued from REDD+, including biodiversity conservation and rural poverty alleviation. Narrowly focusing on avoiding deforestation, the sustainable management of forests or regeneration schemes will not always guarantee protection from fire occurrence, and investments in tropical forests may ultimately fail to achieve long-term emission reductions unless they also reduce the risk of forest fires. Integrating forest fire reduction into REDD+ presents many challenges, requiring: changes in agricultural practices that take place outside of the remaining forests; the monitoring and prediction of spatio-temporal patterns of forest fires across whole biomes; guarantees of additionality; avoiding leakage of fire-dependent agriculture; ensuring that responsibilities for fire management are fairly distributed; protection for rural livelihoods; and that any new activities result in positive outcomes for local people.

T2  - JURNAL MANAJEMEN HUTAN TROPIKA
AB  - Tropical forests play an important role in ecosystem services, yet anthropological activities have changed the ecological conditions. Thus, this research was designed to reveal the species richness and diversity in secondary forests, including the lifeform alteration. The 50 perpendicular plots were placed in both forests and distributed 25 for each. The study revealed that the secondary forest represents a stage of ecological succession in which species richness and diversity decreased. Additionally, the composition of life forms in the secondary forest changed, with dominant herbs indicating more dynamic vegetation due to shifting ecological conditions. Species classified as Threatened have disappeared due to human activities in the forest. However, the secondary forest has provided a habitat for certain species, including those with conservation status, such as Threatened or Extinct, to thrive and colonize, where approximately 15.7% of species exclusively thrive in secondary forests, including Antiaropsis uniflora C.C.Berg. Therefore, to promote sustainable forest management, this study suggests monitoring the species in secondary forests, particularly since the use of forests has traditionally been determined by local communities, including in restricted forest areas. Moreover, the local government could officially designate traditional forest use, thereby allowing restricted forests to be conserved as old-growth forests.

TI  - Payments for ecosystem services in Amazonia. The challenge of land use heterogeneity in agricultural frontiers near Cruzeiro do Sul (Acre, Brazil)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Amazonia became a target area for Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) initiatives in deforestation. We analysed the implementation of a PES scheme in Acre (Brazil) by taking into account land use heterogeneity in an agricultural frontier. Justified by the modernisation of deforestation control policies, the programme promotes agricultural intensification through fire-free practices. In this way, the PES tends to focus on long-established settlements, where farmers are wealthier and the landscape is dominated by pasture. Agricultural intensification may be adapted to foster reforestation. In order to curb deforestation a specific policy is needed for targeting remote areas where initial stages of deforestation usually take place. By promoting only land sparing, PES programmes in Amazonia may lose sight of their socio-economic and environmental objectives due to limited spatial targeting.

TI  - Bioeconomic Approaches to Sustainable Management of Natural Tropical Forests
T2  - TROPICAL FORESTRY HANDBOOK, 2ND EDITION
AB  - Bioeconomic models are idealized representations of human-nature interactions used to describe how the decisions that people make regarding the harvest of biological resources affect the future condition of resource stocks and the flow of net economic benefits. This modeling approach posits an assumed goal or objective that a decision-maker seeks to optimize subject to a set of biological constraints. The power of this method derives from its ability to evaluate a wide array of alternative policy or management innovations over timescales that are radically longer than the timescales considered in many other approaches to economic analysis. In this chapter, we review techniques and applications of two complementary classes of bioeconomic models that have been used to analyze alternative strategies for sustainable use of tropical forests. First, continuous-time bioeconomic models have been used to derive dynamic policy prescriptions for optimally balancing tropical timber production and tropical forest conservation over very long time scales. Second, discrete-time bioeconomic models have been used to evaluate alternative on-the-ground timber harvesting strategies. Emerging threats associated with climate change could be addressed with bioeconomic models that consider the resilience of tropical forests to potentially catastrophic changes.

T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - We tested the ability of an international Weed Risk Assessment (WRA) protocol to predict invasion status of 230 alien plant species introduced via a botanical garden to tropical rainforest in Tanzania. The reliability and accuracy of WRA in discriminating between invaders and non-invaders was independently assessed using field data on species demography and distribution. The WRA rejected 83% of known invaders, and accepted 74% of non-invaders. Only 1% of accepted species were known invaders at the site. WRA performance varied among different growth forms, and underestimated the risks arising from palm species. Among those species that had naturalised, the WRA was better at identifying invaders of open rather than forest habitats. The WRA score was significantly correlated with how widespread species had become at the site, suggesting some capacity to predict spatial spread at a landscape scale. Knowledge of propagule pressure and residence time did not increase explanatory power. These results indicate that the WRA was able to discriminate between invaders and non-invaders with accuracy comparable to similar assessments in temperate and sub-tropical regions. It could be made more effective by weighting traits important in tropical forests e.g. certain growth forms, shade tolerance etc. more heavily. Such a modified WRA could be used successfully elsewhere in the palaeotropics as a screening tool to identify the risk of invasion arising from plants introduced for agroforestry, horticulture or landscaping. Given the increasing pressures on tropical forests and importance of agroforestry to local economies, the WRA protocol represents a useful conservation tool. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Hunting pressure modulates the composition and size structure of terrestrial and arboreal vertebrates in Amazonian forests
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Overhunting is a leading contemporary driver of tropical forest wildlife loss. The absence or extremely low densities of large-bodied vertebrates disrupts plant-animal mutualisms and consequently degrades key ecosystem services. Understanding patterns of defaunation is therefore crucial given that most tropical forests worldwide are now "half-empty". Here we investigate changes in vertebrate community composition and size structure along a gradient of marked anthropogenic hunting pressure in the Medio Jurua region of western Brazilian Amazonia. Using a novel camera trapping grid design deployed both in the understorey and the forest canopy, we estimated the aggregate biomass of several functional groups of terrestrial and arboreal species at 28 sites along the hunting gradient. Generalized linear models (GLMs) identified hunting pressure as the most important driver of aggregate biomass for game, terrestrial, and arboreal species, as well as nocturnal rodents, frugivores, and granivores. Local hunting pressure affected vertebrate community structure as shown by both GLM and ordination analyses. The size structure of vertebrate fauna changed in heavily hunted areas due to population declines in large-bodied species and apparent compensatory increases in nocturnal rodents. Our study shows markedly altered vertebrate community structure even in remote but heavily settled areas of continuous primary forest. Depletion of frugivore and granivore populations, and concomitant density-compensation by seed predators, likely affect forest regeneration in persistently overhunted tropical forests. These findings contribute to a better understanding of how cascading effects induced by historical defaunation operate, informing wildlife management policy in tropical peri-urban, rural and wilderness areas.

TI  - Evidence Types and Trends in Tropical Forest Conservation Literature
T2  - TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
AB  - To improve the likelihood of conservation success, donors, policy makers, non-governmental-organizations (NGOs), and researchers are increasingly interested in making conservation decisions based on scientific evidence. A major challenge in doing so has been the wide variability in the methodological rigor of existing studies. We present a simple framework to classify different types of conservation evidence, which can be used to understand the strengths, weaknesses, and biases in the conservation effectiveness literature. We then apply this framework to evaluate the evidence for the efficacy of four important strategies in tropical forest conservation. Even though there has been an increase in methodologically rigorous studies over time, countries that are globally important in terms of their biodiversity are still heavily under-represented by any type of conservation effectiveness evidence.

TI  - Evaluating the Success of Conservation Actions in Safeguarding Tropical Forest Biodiversity
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - We reviewed the evidence on the extent and efficacy of conservation of tropical forest biodiversity for each of the classes of conservation action defined by the new International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classification. Protected areas are the most tested conservation approach, and a number of studies show they are generally effective in slowing deforestation. There is some documentation of the extent of sustainable timber management in tropical forest, but little information on other landscape-conservation tactics. The extent and effectiveness of ex situ species conservation is quite well known. Forty-one tropical-forest species now survive only in captivity. Other single-species conservation actions are not as well documented. The potential of policy mechanisms, such as international conventions and provision of funds, to slow extinctions in tropical forests is considerable, but the effects of policy are difficult to measure. Finally, interventions to promote tropical conservation by supporting education and livelihoods, providing incentives, and furthering capacity building are all thought to be important, but their extent and effectiveness remain poorly known. For birds, the best studied taxon, the sum of such conservation actions has averted one-fifth of the extinctions that would otherwise have occurred over the last century. Clearly, tropical forest conservation works, but more is needed, as is critical assessment of what works in what circumstances, if mass extinction is to be averted.

TI  - Cultural valuation and biodiversity conservation in the Upper Guinea forest, West Africa
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - The cultural valuation of biodiversity has taken on renewed importance over the last two decades as the ecosystem services framework has become widely adopted. Conservation initiatives increasingly use ecosystem service frameworks to render tropical forest landscapes and their peoples legible to market-oriented initiatives such as REDD+ and biodiversity offsetting schemes. Ecosystem service approaches have been widely criticized by scholars in the social sciences and humanities for their narrow focus on a small number of easily quantifiable and marketable services and a reductionist and sometimes simplistic approach to culture. We address the need to combine methods from each of the "three cultures" of natural science, quantitative social science, and qualitative social science/humanities in conceptualizing the relationship between cultural valuation and biodiversity conservation. We combine qualitative data with forest inventories and a quantitative index of cultural value to evaluate the relationship between cultural valuation and biodiversity conservation in Upper Guinea forest in Liberia, West Africa. Our study focuses on "sacred agroforests," spaces that are associated with Mande macro-language speaking groups such as the Loma. We demonstrate that sacred agroforests are associated with different cultural values compared with secondary forests. Although biodiversity and biomass are similar, sacred agroforests exhibit a different species composition, especially of culturally salient species, increasing overall landscape agro-biodiversity. Sacred agroforests are also shaped and conserved by local cultural institutions revolving around ancestor worship, ritual, and the metaphysical conceptual category "sal epsilon." We conclude that to understand the relationship between cultural valuation and biodiversity conservation, interpretivist approaches such as phenomenology should be employed alongside positivist ecosystem service frameworks.

TI  - The Functional Structure of Tropical Plant Communities and Soil Properties Enhance Ecosystem Functioning and Multifunctionality in Different Ecosystems in Ghana
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Plant functional traits are useful in tracking changes in the environment, and play an important role in determining ecosystem functioning. The relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem functioning remains unclear, although there is growing evidence on this relationship. In this study, we tested whether the functional structure of vegetation has significant effects on the provision of ecosystem services. We analysed plant trait composition (specific leaf area, leaf carbon and nitrogen ratio, isotopic carbon fraction, stem dry matter content, seed mass and plant height), soil parameters (nutrients, pH, bulk density) and proxies of ecosystem services (carbon stock, decomposition rate, invertebrate activity) in twenty-four plots in three tropical ecosystems (active restored and natural forests and an agroforestry system) in Ghana. For each plot, we measured above-ground biomass, decomposition rates of leaves and invertebrate activity as proxies for the provision of ecosystem services to evaluate (i) whether there were differences in functional composition and soil properties and their magnitude between ecosystem types. We further aimed to (ii) determine whether the functional structure and/or soil parameters drove ecosystem functions and multifunctionality in the three ecosystem types. For functional composition, both the leaf economic spectrum and seed mass dimension clearly separated the ecosystem types. The natural forest was more dominated by acquisitive plants than the other two ecosystem types, while the non-natural forests (agroforest and restored forest) showed higher variation in the functional space. The natural forest had higher values of soil properties than the restored forest and the agroforestry system, with the differences between the restored and agroforestry systems driven by bulk density. Levels of ecosystem service proxies and multifunctionality were positively related to the functional richness of forest plots and were mainly explained by the differences in site conditions. Our study demonstrated the effects of functional forest structure on ecosystem services in different forest ecosystems located in the semi-deciduous forest zone of Ghana.

TI  - Reversals of Reforestation Across Latin America Limit Climate Mitigation Potential of Tropical Forests
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Carbon sequestration through tropical reforestation and natural regeneration could make an important contribution to climate change mitigation, given that forest cover in many tropical regions increased during the early part of the 21st century. The size of this carbon sink will depend on the degree to which second-growth forests are permanent and protected from re-clearing. Yet few studies have assessed permanence of reforestation, especially not at a large spatial scale. Here, we analyzed a 14-year time series (2001-2014) of remotely sensed land-cover data, covering all tropical Latin America and the Caribbean, to quantify the extent of second-growth forest permanence. Our results show that in many cases, reforestation in Latin America and the Caribbean during the early 21st century reversed by 2014, limiting carbon sequestration. In fact, reversals of reforestation, in which some or all gains in forest cover in the early 2000s were subsequently lost, were ten times more common than sustained increases in forest cover. Had reversals of reforestation been avoided, forests could have sequestered 0.58 Pg C, over four times more carbon than we estimate was sequestered after accounting for impermanence (0.14 Pg), representing a loss of 75% of carbon sequestration potential. Differences in the prevalence of reforestation reversals across countries suggest an important role for socio-economic, political, and ecological context, with political transitions and instability increasing the likelihood of reversals. These findings suggest that national commitments to reforestation may fall short of their carbon sequestration goals without provisions to ensure long-term permanence of new forests.

TI  - Two decades of accelerated deforestation in Peruvian forests: a national and regional analysis (2000-2020)
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB  - The global tree cover has kept reducing in the last two decades, mainly in tropical forests, despite the global efforts to conserve biodiversity and the ecosystem services that provides. Considering South America is the region that had the highest rate of net forest loss (2000-2020), it is crucial to understand the deforestation dynamics of each country and their regions for the evaluation of effective national conservation actions. Here, we carried out a spatiotemporal analysis of the deforestation rates from 2000 to 2020 on a national and regional scale, including the forest loss inside protected areas, in Peru. It was found that Peru lost 3.4 million ha of forest between 2000 and 2020, mainly in the Not Flooded Rainforest region. National deforestation rates accelerated, while within protected areas rates showed a very small increase. Regional deforestation rates followed the national pattern with one exception-the Coast region. Our results evidence the success of the national conservation strategy based on protected areas to avoid deforestation in all regions, except in the Andean. Moreover, the increment in deforestation rates is aligned with the growth in road infrastructure; increments in anthropic activities; and the more frequent and intense natural extreme events that vary according to the region. Therefore, it is urgent to differentiate the drivers of deforestation that operate at the national versus the regional scale, consider the inclusion of all forest types in the monitoring system, and the strengthening of policies related to land use change at all scales.

TI  - Does biochar improve all soil ecosystem services?
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY
AB  - Biochar is considered to sequester C and deliver other soil ecosystem services, but an overview that synthesizes the current knowledge of biochar implications on all essential soil ecosystem services is difficult to find in the ample biochar literature. Most previous research and review articles on this topic focused on a single ecosystem service and did not integrate all essential soil ecosystem services. This overview paper (1) synthesizes the impacts of biochar on water and wind erosion, C sequestration, soil water, nutrient leaching, soil fertility, crop yields, and other soil ecosystem services based on published literature and (2) highlights remaining research areas. Literature indicates that, in addition to sequestering C, biochar can reduce N2O emissions, nitrate leaching, and runoff; increase soil microbial biomass, plant available water, and crop yields (particularly in tropical regions), and CO2 emissions; and have small or no effects on water and wind erosion. Biochar benefits can be in this order: C sequestration > N2O emissions > Nitrate leaching > Available water > Soil biology > Soil fertility > Crop yields > Runoff. However, literature also indicates that biochar does not always improve all ecosystem services. Its benefits depend on biochar feedstock, pyrolysis temperature, application rate, biochar properties, soil properties, climate, and other factors. For example, biochar can enhance crop yields more in degraded and low fertility soils than in highly fertile and fine-textured soils. Long-term (>3 years) field-scale studies under different soil types, management conditions, and climates are needed for a determination of optimum levels of application, comprehensive life-cycle analysis, and assessment of agronomic and environmental tradeoffs. Overall, biochar can improve most soil ecosystem services, but the extent of such improvement is highly dependent on biochar properties and soil and climatic conditions.

TI  - The economic value of tropical forests in meeting global climate stabilization goals
T2  - GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Non-technical summary
   Conserving tropical forests has many benefits, from protecting biodiversity, sustaining indigenous and local communities, and safeguarding climate. To achieve the ambitious climate goals of the Paris Agreement, forest protection is essential. Yet deforestation continues to diminish the world's forests. Halting this trend is the objective of the international framework for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+). While previous studies have demonstrated the contribution of tropical forests to mitigate climate change, here we show that tropical forest protection can 'flatten the curve' of the costs of transition to climate stability, estimating tens of trillions of dollars in policy cost savings.
   Technical summary
   The pledges made by parties under the Paris Agreement are insufficient to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees C relative to pre-industrial levels. We use a global climate-economic model to quantify the economic benefits from rapidly deploying programs for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and increased reforestation (REDD+) given current delays in the implementation of climate policies around the world. REDD+ has been shown to have substantial greenhouse gas emissions mitigation potential in the fight against climate change and can thus play a critical role in closing the emissions gap, thereby enabling the achievement of more ambitious climate targets. Under our principal scenario, we estimate that REDD+ can contribute up to US$36 trillion in net policy cost savings by mitigating the adjustment costs of reaching a greenhouse gas emissions trajectory consistent with ambitious global climate stabilization goals. Investment in REDD+ has a high benefit-cost ratio; one dollar invested in REDD+ yields about US$5.4 in net policy cost savings. Realizing the full estimated potential for REDD+ reduces the risk-adjusted carbon price in 2030 by US$45/tCO(2).

   Protecting tropical forests is crucial to achieve ambitious climate stabilization goals while saving trillions of dollars in economic value.

TI  - Managing watershed services of tropical forests and plantations: Can meta-analyses help?
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The watershed services provided by tropical natural and planted forests are critical to human well-being. An increasing number of valuation studies and experiences with payment for ecosystem services have dealt with the role of ecosystems in regulating the flow of water. However, several studies and experiences have been based on misconceptions about the role of forests and plantations in the hydrological cycle, despite the publication of many reviews by hydrologists. The objective of this paper is to evaluate whether meta-analyses applied to studies comparing water flows in tropical watersheds under natural or planted forests and non-forest lands can provide useful results for valuing watershed ecosystem services and making decisions. The meta-analyses show significantly lower total flows or base flows under planted forests than non-forest land uses. Meta-analyses conducted with subsamples of the data also show lower total flow and higher base flow under natural forests than non-forest land uses. However, the available studies were restricted to humid climates and particular forest types (Pinus and Eucalyptus planted forests and lowland natural forests). The small number of available Studies with sufficient original data is a major constraint in the application of meta-analyses. This represents a major technical challenge for valuation studies or payment for ecosystem services, especially in countries where financial resources for implementing field research are scarce.

TI  - Intercropping with Shrub Species That Display a 'Steady-State' Flowering Phenology as a Strategy for Biodiversity Conservation in Tropical Agroecosystems
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Animal species in the Neotropics have evolved under a lower spatiotemporal patchiness of food resources compared to the other tropical regions. Although plant species with a steady-state flowering/fruiting phenology are rare, they provide predictable food resources and therefore may play a pivotal role in animal community structure and diversity. I experimentally planted a supplemental patch of a shrub species with a steady-state flowering/fruiting phenology, Hamelia patens Jacq., into coffee agroforests to evaluate the contribution of this unique phenology to the structure and diversity of the flower-visiting community. After accounting for the higher abundance of captured animals in the coffee agroforests with the supplemental floral resources, species richness was 21% higher overall in the flower-visiting community in these agroforests compared to control agroforests. Coffee agroforests with the steady-state supplemental floral patch also had 31% more butterfly species, 29% more hummingbird species, 65% more wasps and 85% more bees than control coffee agroforests. The experimental treatment, together with elevation, explained 57% of the variation in community structure of the flower-visiting community. The identification of plant species that can support a high number of animal species, including important ecosystem service providers, is becoming increasingly important for restoration and conservation applications. Throughout the Neotropics plant species with a steady-state flowering/fruiting phenology can be found in all aseasonal forests and thus could be widely tested and suitable species used throughout the tropics to manage for biodiversity and potentially ecosystem services involving beneficial arthropods.

TI  - Evidence of time-lag in the provision of ecosystem services by tropical regenerating forests to coffee yields
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Restoration of native tropical forests is crucial for protecting biodiversity and ecosystem functions, such as carbon stock capacity. However, little is known about the contribution of early stages of forest regeneration to crop productivity through the enhancement of ecosystem services, such as crop pollination and pest control. Using data from 610 municipalities along the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (30 m spatial resolution), we evaluated if young regenerating forests (YRFs) (less than 20 years old) are positively associated with coffee yield and whether such a relationship depends on the amount of preserved forest in the surroundings of the coffee fields. We found that regenerating forest alone was not associated with variations in coffee yields. However, the presence of YRF (within a 500 m buffer) was positively related to higher coffee yields when the amount of preserved forest in a 2 km buffer is above a 20% threshold cover. These results further reinforce that regional coffee yields are influenced by changes in biodiversity-mediated ecosystem services, which are explained by the amount of mature forest in the surrounding of coffee fields. We argue that while regenerating fragments may contribute to increased connectivity between remnants of forest fragments and crop fields in landscapes with a minimum amount of forest (20%), older preserved forests (more than 20 years) are essential for sustaining pollinator and pest enemy's populations. These results highlight the potential time lag of at least 20 years of regenerating forests' in contributing to the provision of ecosystem services that affect coffee yields (e.g. pollination and pest control). We emphasize the need to implement public policies that promote ecosystem restoration and ensure the permanence of these new forests over time.

TI  - REDD plus -related activities in Kenya: actors' views on biodiversity and monitoring in a broader policy context
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Activities related to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD+) bear potential benefits for, and also pose risks to, the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES). Next to ecological, socioeconomic and technical factors, the priorities of key actors in REDD+ implementation shape the integration of biodiversity concerns. This study aimed to identify the views of key actors in the REDD+ implementation process in Kenya with regard to biodiversity conservation and monitoring in order to evaluate the degree to which biodiversity is likely to be considered in the (sub-) national REDD+ context. In Kenya, avoided deforestation in dry forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in different forest types are major REDD+ activities. Interviews with 34 (sub-) national and project level actors showed that the solving of socioeconomic issues was paramount for REDD+ implementation in general and for achieving additional conservation benefits. In REDD+ initiatives in dry forests, conservation objectives were primarily related to wildlife; actors stressed the importance of specific management measures to minimize human-wildlife conflicts. In initiatives to enhance forest carbon stocks, the sustained provision of timber, fuel wood and hydrological ES was regarded as a conservation priority and a prerequisite for project viability. The biodiversity indicators and monitoring schemes considered to be available by the actors were mostly related to particular species. In conclusion, integration of biodiversity concerns into REDD+ depends heavily on the resolution of socioeconomic and political issues. Increased collaboration between Kenyan actors can contribute to the development of monitoring schemes for detecting REDD+ impacts on biodiversity and ES on a landscape scale.

TI  - Leucaena macrophylla: An ecosystem services provider?
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Leucaena macrophylla, a tree native to southern Mexico's tropical dry forest, belongs to a genus that is popular worldwide as a component of agroforestry systems. However, despite appreciation by local communities, this species is poorly studied and has not been evaluated as a multipurpose tree in its native range. This work evaluated whether L. macrophylla has the qualities necessary to serve as a multipurpose tree for agroforestry systems and a provider of ecosystem services in its original distribution, specifically, in soil nutrient amelioration and recovery, fuelwood production, and provision of quality livestock fodder. Leaves contained high values of nitrogen and calcium, and litter decomposition was relatively rapid (similar to 50 % of mass lost over first 6 months). Despite somewhat low wood density, this species' high calorific value and low ash and moisture contents yielded a relatively high firewood value index (FVI = 2,594.65), suggesting high potential as a fuelwood. In terms of fodder quality, protein and digestible fiber contents were high and in vitro digestibility was adequate, as was condensed tannin concentration. It is important to mention, however, that L. macrophylla showed higher-than-ideal contents of lignin, both in fresh leaves and in litter. However, this apparently does not drastically reduce overall quality (i.e. decomposition rate and in vitro digestibility), and appropriate management techniques such as composting can mitigate its effects. Given its potential for providing a variety of ecosystem services, we recommend that L. macrophylla be installed in agroforestry systems in its native range to evaluate its effect on crop productivity.

TI  - Degradation of mangrove forests in the Sundarbans: An assessment based on perspectives of mangrove resource collectors using the DPSIR framework
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
AB  - Mangrove forests provide vital ecosystem services to communities in tropical countries, yet they are susceptible to degradation. The causes and effects of mangrove forest degradation in the Sundarbans of Bangladesh have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to explore these issues from the perspective of mangrove resource collectors (MRCs). Utilizing the DPSIR (Driver, Pressure, State, Impact, and Response) framework, data were collected through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with MRCs. The findings revealed that the drivers of mangrove degradation included reduced freshwater supply, increased demand for mangrove resources, climate change, and tourism. These drivers created pressures on the mangrove forests, manifesting through natural disasters, rising salinity levels, the establishment of the Farakka barrage, forest fires, coastal development, overexploitation, and pollution. Consequently, the forests experienced alterations in cover, a decline in mature trees, reduced stem density, and changes in species composition. The impacts of this degradation included biodiversity loss, diminished ecosystem services, and adverse effects on the livelihoods of communities dependent on mangroves. MRCs highlighted the necessity for support in generating alternative incomes, restoring freshwater supply, addressing the Farakka barrage issue collaboratively, enhancing forest management practices, and promoting mangrove afforestation and reforestation. These findings carry significant implications for policy reform, research, sustainable management, and conservation efforts for mangrove forests. They also underscore the need for developing alternative livelihood programs for communities living around the Sundarbans and other tropical regions facing similar challenges.

TI  - Disturbance sensitivity shapes patterns of tree species distribution in Afrotropical lowland rainforests more than climate or soil
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Understanding how tropical forests respond to abiotic environmental changes is critical for preserving biodiversity, mitigating climate change, and maintaining ecosystem services in the coming century. To evaluate the relative roles of the abiotic environment and human disturbance on Central African tree community composition, we employ tree inventory data, remotely sensed climatic data, and soil nutrient data collected from 30 1-ha plots distributed across a large-scale observational experiment in forests that had been differently impacted by logging and hunting in northern Republic of Congo. We show that the composition of Afrotropical plant communities at this scale responds to human disturbance more than to climate, with particular sensitivities to hunting and distance to the nearest village (a proxy for other human activities, including tree-cutting and gathering). These findings contrast neotropical predictions, highlighting the unique ecological, evolutionary, and anthropogenic history of Afrotropical forests.
   Posterior parameter estimates for the effect of environmental covariates on species counts and species correlation in their responses to environmental predictors show clustering into two general groups that represent a disturbance-tolerant pioneer community and disturbance-intolerant species.image

TI  - Land cover impacts on aboveground and soil carbon stocks in Malagasy rainforest
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Deforestation and forest degradation can impact carbon dynamics and, subsequently, ecosystem functioning and climate change. In this study, we surveyed the influence of such land cover changes on four land cover/uses including closed canopy forest, tree fallow, shrub fallow, and degraded land among 120 study sites. We assessed these changes on total carbon stocks including both aboveground biomass (AGB) and soil organic carbon (SOC) including both topsoil, 0-30 cm, and deep soil, 30-100 cm. The four land cover/uses were located within four regions (Andasibe, Didy, Anjahamana, and Lakato) in the Eastern humid tropical forest of Madagascar. Our results show that total carbon stocks, AGB and soil, average 166 +/- 57 Mg C ha(-1) in which 82% is stored in 0-100 cm of soil surface horizon (55% stored in the topsoil and 27% in deep soil) suggesting the importance of soil pools in the sequestration of atmospheric carbon. The total carbon stocks were significantly higher in closed canopy compared to the other land covers. In lower altitude regions, the total carbon stock was lower ranging from 143.5 Mg C ha(-1) to 163.7 Mg C ha(-1), relative to higher altitude areas where total C stock ranged from 170.6 Mg C ha(-1) to 186.1 Mg C ha(-1). The relative importance of AGB and SOC were reversed in these study sites, with AGB/ SOC ratios of 0.37 for Anjahamana, 0.17 for Lakato, 0.21 for Didy, and 0.17 for Andasibe. Climatic factor combined with soil properties could explain the SOC variations across the study regions. High SOC was related to lower precipitation, high clay content and high root development. These results provide an accurate assessment of carbon storage distribution in a tropical region and support the importance of forest conservation and effective land cover management in maintaining carbon storage in ecosystems as tools in climate change mitigation in tropical forests.

TI  - Beyond the Mirror: Tropical Forest Fragmentation and its Impact on Rural Livelihoods
T2  - GLOBAL FOREST FRAGMENTATION
AB  - Forest fragmentation is overwhelmingly the result of changes in land use and the development of infrastructures. It can be considered as the spatial manifestation of deforestation and degradation in a landscape. Forest fragmentation thus results in the same loss of ecosystem services as these other forms of land-cover change, but how does it affect livelihoods? We propose here an analysis of the livelihood impacts of tropical forest fragmentation, which will begin with a better definition of the spatial processes involved in fragmentation. As it is difficult to analyse the impacts of fragmentation without consideration of the associated impacts of the causes-or drivers-of forest fragmentation, we will analyse them in detail. Fragmentation results from a range of drivers that are categorized into five groups: (i) economic factors; (ii) governance factors; (iii) demographic factors; (iv) technological factors; and (v) cultural factors. Economic factors are prevalent in decisions, with forest conservation often being a luxury for wealthy people. Stakeholders who gain direct economic returns from deforestation - from logging, farming and facilitated access to markets - will also benefit globally from forest fragmentation, the benefits from these drivers by far outweighing the loss of ecosystem services. However, forest dwellers and isolated forest communities will often have to choose between 'modern' life or the cultural specificities that shaped their identity. Throughout the chapter, the forest-transition curve is used as a heuristic framework to understand the relationships between human development and the loss and fragmentation of forest cover.

TI  - Mainstreaming Ecosystem Services from Indonesia's Remaining Forests
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - With 120 million hectares of forest area, Indonesia has the third largest area of biodiversity-rich tropical forests in the world, and it is well-known as a mega-biodiversity country. However, in 2020, only 70 percent of this area remained forested. The government has consistently undertaken corrective actions to achieve Sustainable Development Goal targets, with a special focus on Goals #1 (no poverty), #2 (zero hunger), #3 (good health and well-being), #7 (affordable and clean energy), #8 (decent work and economic growth), #13 (climate action), and #15 (life on land). Good environmental governance is a core concept in Indonesia's forest management and includes mainstreaming ecosystem services as a framework for sustainable forest management. This paper analyzes efforts to mainstream Indonesia's remaining forest ecosystem services. We review the state of Indonesia's forests in relation to deforestation dynamics, climate change, and ecosystem service potential and options and provide recommendations for mainstreaming strategies regarding aspects of policy, planning, and implementation, as well as the process of the articulation of ecosystem services and their alternative funding.

TI  - Using citizen scientists to measure an ecosystem service nationwide
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - The decomposition of dung constitutes an ecosystem service of massive proportions. Previous studies addressing how it depends on individual invertebrate taxa have been focused on small spatial scales, neglecting the impact of large-scale factors like climate. Here, we use the concept of citizen science to quantify taxon-specific contributions to dung decomposition at the level of a nation. Young people across Finland manipulated the decomposer communities of cow pats, then measured changes in pat mass over the grazing season. In southern Finland most (90%) of the cattle dung hitting pastures decomposed in just two months, whereas 1100 km to the north the corresponding fraction was smaller (74%). Of the total invertebrate-caused decomposition (13% of dung pat mass, independent of latitude), large tunneling dor beetles in the genus Geotrupes account for 61%, hence removing dung twice as fast as do smaller dung-dwelling beetles and earthworms. Overall, this paper illustrates how ecologists may direct citizen scientists to implement massive ecological experiments. Compared to an approach based purely on professional scientists, we saved three-quarters of the costs. Ultimately, citizen science may offer a key tool for testing current ecological theories at relevant spatial scalesand for disseminating these theories in the process.

TI  - Seeding success: Integrating seed dispersal networks in tropical forest restoration
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - While the reassembly of fruit-frugivore interactions remains at the forefront of tropical forest restoration, seed dispersal networks emerge as a potential approach to enhance restoration success. This review explores the integration of seed dispersal networks in tropical forest restoration, with the aims of (1) synthesizing important findings in the literature, (2) detailing potential biases in utilizing network theory, and (3) addressing current knowledge gaps and future directions for the field. We first highlight the importance of combining phytocentric and zoocentric approaches when sampling for seed dispersal interactions, as different methodologies have varying effects on network measures, and combining approaches can foster a more comprehensive understanding of dispersal interactions. Furthermore, when integrating seed dispersal networks into restoration goals, we suggest a highly connected and species-rich network is desirable for earlier stages of forest succession where community turnover and transient interactions are pivotal. Nested patterns may emerge throughout varying stages of forest succession, and identifying generalist species that make up nested patterns may be useful for restoration practitioners in both early and later stages of forest regeneration. Modularity should be highest at later stages of succession to maintain community structure and stability, and connector species may play important roles in facilitating seed dispersal across temporal scales. Finally, we emphasize the importance of site-specific long-term datasets, chronosequences, and studies at large spatial scales to continue to understand network reassembly as a function of tropical forest succession and to develop effective strategies that enhance the recovery of tropical forest ecosystems.
   This review explores the potential of integrating seed dispersal networks in tropical forest restoration to enhance restoration outcomes. Combining zoocentric and phytocentric approaches when sampling for seed dispersal interactions can yield larger networks and foster a more comprehensive understanding of dispersal interactions. Identifying the functional traits of generalist species that contribute to nested patterns in seed dispersal networks may be useful for restoration practitioners focusing on species reintroductions or active restoration planting efforts. Through stages of forest succession, a highly connected and species-rich network is desirable for earlier stages of succession, while modularity and specialization should be highest at later successional stages. image

TI  - Evaluating climber cutting as a strategy to restore degraded tropical forests
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - A substantial share of the remaining tropical forest cover is represented by historically degraded fragments exposed to severe edge effects, where ruderal plants proliferate vigorously and may arrest succession. We tested climber plant cutting as strategy to restore a semideciduous tropical forest remnant that is dominated by ruderal climbers. We compared control (unmanaged) plots with plots subjected to climber cutting at 1-m height with recutting one (after 8 months) or three times (8, 24 and 36 months). We monitored: 1) tree and shrub biomass gain and canopy openness for three years; 2) tree and shrub growth and recruitment of regenerating seedlings for one year; and 3) planted seedling survival for two years. Climber cutting increased biomass gain by similar to 51% for smaller trees and shrubs (1.58 <= dbh < 5 cm) only, regardless of the number of re-cuts. Canopy openness increased following climber cutting, but recovered after ten months due to rapid growth of the tree canopies. Growth of regenerating seedlings, but not abundance, was favored by climber cutting. Initial cutting of climbers enhanced survival of enrichment plantings, but this benefit declined with canopy re-occupation by tree foliage. Although longer-term research is needed, cutting ruderal climbers in degraded forest remnants was shown to be a promising approach to enhance forest regeneration and carbon sequestration, justifying its consideration in the restoration agenda as a complementary activity to increasing forest cover in former agricultural lands.

TI  - Undertaking large-scale forest restoration to generate ecosystem services
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - The global community is seeking to substantially restore the world's forest cover to improve the supply of ecosystem services. However, it is not clear what type of reforestation must be used and there is a risk that the techniques used in industrial timber plantations will become the default methodology. This is unlikely to be sufficient because of the well-known relationship between biodiversity and ecological functioning. Restoration may be achieved through natural regeneration but this may not always occur at critical locations. Ecological restoration involving species-rich plantings might also be used but can be difficult to implement at landscape scales. I review here the consequence of planting more limited numbers of species and the effects of this on the delivery of ecosystem services. Evidence suggests many commonly sought ecosystem servicesthough not allmay be generated by the modest levels of species richness provided these species have appropriate traits. The literature also shows that the alpha diversity of restored forests is not the only driver of functionality and that the location and extent of any reforestation are significant as well; beta and gamma diversity may also affect functionality but these relationships remain unclear. Encouraging the adoption of even moderately diverse plantings at landscape scales and at key locations will require policies and institutions to balance the type, location, and scale of restoration and make the necessary trade-offs between national and local aspirations. New approaches and metrics will have to be developed to monitor and assess restoration success at these larger scales.

TI  - Rapid ant community reassembly in a Neotropical forest: Recovery dynamics and land-use legacy
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Regrowing secondary forests dominate tropical regions today, and a mechanistic understanding of their recovery dynamics provides important insights for conservation. In particular, land-use legacy effects on the fauna have rarely been investigated. One of the most ecologically dominant and functionally important animal groups in tropical forests are the ants. Here, we investigated the recovery of ant communities in a forest-agricultural habitat mosaic in the Ecuadorian Choco region. We used a replicated chronosequence of previously used cacao plantations and pastures with 1-34 years of regeneration time to study the recovery dynamics of species communities and functional diversity across the two land-use legacies. We compared two independent components of responses on these community properties: resistance, which is measured as the proportion of an initial property that remains following the disturbance; and resilience, which is the rate of recovery relative to its loss. We found that compositional and trait structure similarity to old-growth forest communities increased with regeneration age, whereas ant species richness remained always at a high level along the chronosequence. Land-use legacies influenced species composition, with former cacao plantations showing higher resemblance to old-growth forests than former pastures along the chronosequence. While resistance was low for species composition and high for species richness and traits, all community properties had similarly high resilience. In essence, our results show that ant communities of the Choco recovery rapidly, with former cacao reaching predicted old-growth forest community levels after 21 years and pastures after 29 years. Recovery in this community was faster than reported from other ecosystems and was likely facilitated by the low-intensity farming in agricultural sites and their proximity to old-growth forest remnants. Our study indicates the great recovery potential for this otherwise highly threatened biodiversity hotspot.

TI  - Analysis of the Structure and Ecological Function of an Extreme Landscape in a Tropical Region of West Java, Indonesia
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - An extreme landscape is a spatially heterogeneous area with unusual topography that is prone to natural disasters but still exhibits interrelated structures and functions. One of the important functions of an extreme landscape is its ecological function. This study aimed to determine the structure and reveal the ecological functions of an extreme landscape in a tropical region of West Java, with special reference to Rongga Sub-district. The method used was a combination of remote sensing techniques and geographic information systems, which were required to process, analyze, and interpret Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS data. The landscape structure was quantified by landscape metrics, after which an analysis of ecological functions was carried out based on the constituent elements of the landscape. The results showed that the landscape structure of Rongga Sub-district consists of various elements of agroforestry land, open fields, settlements, shrubs, plantations, and rainfed and irrigated rice fields. Additionally, secondary forest land acted as a landscape matrix where rivers crossed as natural corridors. The amount of each element varied; agroforestry land had the highest value, indicating that this element showed a high degree of human intervention. Each patch was adjacent to other patch types, and the landscape diversity was quite high. The extreme topography of Rongga Sub-district supports the landscape connectivity and consequently the presence of wild animals in this area. Therefore, Rongga Sub-district has an essential ecological function as a refuge for protected animals living in non-conservation areas.

TI  - New Tools to Identify the Location of Seagrass Meadows: Marine Grazers as Habitat Indicators
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB  - Seagrasses are hugely valuable to human life, but the global extent of seagrass meadows remains unclear. As evidence of their value, a United Nations program exists (http://data. unep-wcmc.org/datasets/7) to try and assess their distribution and there has been a call from 122 scientists across 28 countries for more work to manage, protect and monitor seagrass meadows (http://www. bbc.com/news/science-environment-37606827) . Emerging from the 12th International Seagrass Biology Workshop, held in October 2016, has been the view that grazing marine megafauna may play a useful role in helping to identify previously unknown seagrass habitats. Here we describe this concept, showing how detailed information on the distribution of both dugongs (Dugong dugon) and green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) obtained, for example, by aerial surveys and satellite tracking, can reveal new information on the location of seagrass meadows. We show examples of how marine megaherbivores have been effective habitat indicators, revealing major, new, deep-water seagrass meadows and offering the potential for more informed estimates of seagrass extent in tropical and sub-tropical regions where current information is often lacking.

TI  - Inventory of agroecosystem services and perceptions of potential implications due to climate change: A case study from Benin in West Africa
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW
AB  - Agricultural and Agroforestry play an important role in the economy of West African countries. They contribute to nearly 40% of the GDP and provide a large variety of ecosystem services to the local populations. However, the sustainability of agricultural and agroforestry systems in these countries is gradually jeopardised by climate change since these ecosystems are still predominantly rain-fed and therefore at the mercy of climatic hazards. For a developing country like Benin, there is still a lot of data gap in other to quantify the impact of climate change on agro-ecosystems. Thus, the current study focused on providing an inventory of the evolution and the monetary value of agro-ecosystem services in Benin with an analysis of the perceptions of the impact of climate change on these services. The data analysed showed, from 1975 to 2015, a reduction in forests and savannahs in favour of an increase in cultivated land. The areas of water bodies, swamps and floodplains have increased by almost 500% in the subequatorial climate regions and have remained almost unchanged in the tropical climate regions. The main uses of agroecosystems were agriculture, fishing, energy production, timber trade, and cultural rituals. A monetary estimate reveals that the value of agroecosystems services provided in the subequatorial regions (USD 3700/ha) is 2-3 times greater than that of the value of these services in the tropical regions (USD 1600/ha). The local population didn't perceive see climate hazards as a threat to community forests and planted forests. However, they felt that the establishment of sustainable management of agroecosystems through good agricul-tural practices and sustainable management of the landscape, would allow better regulation of the climate, conservation of specific and genetic biodiversity, and solve the problems of erosion and silting up of rivers.

TI  - Hawaiian native forest conserves water relative to timber plantation: Species and stand traits influence water use
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Tropical forests are becoming increasingly alien-dominated through the establishment of timber plantations and secondary forests. Despite widespread recognition that afforestation results in increased evapotranspiration and lower catchment yields, little is known of the impacts of timber plantations on water balance relative to native forest. Native forest trees have been claimed to use water conservatively and enhance groundwater recharge relative to faster-growing alien species, and this argument should motivate native forest preservation and restoration. However, data have been available primarily for leaf-level gas exchange rather than for whole-plant and stand levels. We measured sap flow of dominant tree and tree fern species over eight weeks in native Metrosideros polymorpha forest and adjacent alien timber plantations on the island of Hawai'i and estimated total stand transpiration. Metrosideros polymorpha had the lowest values of sap flux density and whole-tree water use (200 kg.m(-2) sapwood.d(-1), or 8 kg/d for trees of 35 cm mean diameter at breast height, D), substantially less than timber species Eucalyptus saligna or Fraxinus uhdei (33 and 34 kg/d for trees of 73 and 30 cm mean D, respectively). At the stand level, E. saligna and F. uhdei trees had three-and ninefold higher water use, respectively, than native M. polymorpha trees. Understory Cibotium tree ferns were most abundant in M. polymorpha-dominated forest where they accounted for 70% of water use. Overall, F. uhdei plantation had the highest water use at 1.8 mm/d, more than twice that of either E. saligna plantation or M. polymorpha forest. Forest water use was influenced by species composition, stem density, tree size, sapwood allocation, and understory contributions. Transpiration varied strongly among forest types even within the same wet tropical climate, and in this case, native forest had strikingly conservative water use. Comparisons of vegetation cover in water use should provide additional resolution to ecosystem valuation and land management decisions.

TI  - Towards productive landscapes: Trade-offs in tree-cover and income across a matrix of smallholder agricultural land-use systems
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - One of the main causes of tropical forest loss is conversion to agriculture, which is constantly increasing as a dominant land cover in the tropics. The loss of forests greatly affects biodiversity and ecosystem services. This paper assesses the economic return from increasing tree cover in agricultural landscapes in two tropical locations, West Java, Indonesia and eastern Bangladesh. Agroforestry systems are compared with subsistence seasonal food-crop-based agricultural systems. Data were collected through rapid rural appraisal, field observation, focus groups and semi-structured interviews of farm households. The inclusion of agroforestry tree crops in seasonal agriculture improved the systems' overall economic performance (net present value), even when it reduced understorey crop production. However, seasonal agriculture has higher income per unit of land area used for crop cultivation compared with the tree establishment and development phase of agroforestry farms. Thus, there is a trade-off between short-term loss of agricultural income and longer-term economic gain from planting trees in farmland. For resource-poor farmers to implement this change, institutional support is needed to improve their knowledge and skills with this unfamiliar form of land management, sufficient capital for the initial investment, and an increase in the security of land tenure.

TI  - Tropical forest remnants as shelters of avian diversity within a tourism development matrix in Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - Tropical forests have undergone extensive transformation because of increasing tourism development, in addition to historic clearing for agricultural and cattle grazing activities. Altogether, these activities have had an important effect on bird diversity, reducing the habitat available to many species. In this study, the role of tropical forest remnants located between different land use types was evaluated for species diversity, composition, and distribution of the bird community at Akumal region in Quintana Roo, Mexico. Point counts were used to quantify the avifauna by habitat, and Shannon's and Simpson's diversity index were used to determine bird diversity. Additionally, bird species were classified according to seasonality and trophic guild by type of habitat. A total of 160 species and 50 families was recorded, of which 100 species were permanent residents, 47 winter visitors and 11 transients. Mature tropical forest and tropical forest remnants had higher species richness than those of modified environments. This study supports the importance of tropical forest remnants as shelters for bird species in landscapes with tourism developments, and the relevance of these remnants to maintaining high bird diversity.

TI  - Forest Rehabilitation and Its Implication for Forest Transition Theory
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Forest transition theory bases its predictions of forest recovery in temperate regions primarily on macro-economic factors. In tropical countries, it is important to understand additional complex processes underlying forest recovery. Forest rehabilitation-meaning efforts to restore tree cover-is an important contributor to forest recovery in many tropical regions. Forest rehabilitation itself is subject to multiple factors that influence its scale, effectiveness and outcomes. This paper reviews forest rehabilitation in six countries-Brazil, China, Indonesia, Peru, Philippines and Vietnam. The cases reviewed suggest that globally, forest rehabilitation efforts can be understood in four time periods, or eras, each with distinct approaches to forest rehabilitation and outcomes. Various factors that influence forest rehabilitation outcomes evolved during these eras. Current outcomes of forest rehabilitation can only be adequately predicted if the historical processes influencing forest rehabilitation are understood. The paper suggests that forest transition in the tropics needs to be analyzed not only in terms of macro-economic factors, but also in terms of the factors that influence forest rehabilitation outcomes as well as other processes that affect forest cover increase.

TI  - Mixed policies give more options in multifunctional tropical forest landscapes
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Tropical forest landscapes face competing demands for conserving biodiversity, sustaining ecosystem services and accommodating production systems such as forestry and agriculture. Land-sparing and land-sharing have emerged as contrasting strategies to manage trade-offs between production and biodiversity conservation. Both strategies are evident in land-management policies at local-to-international scales. However, studies rarely report the impacts of these strategies, assessed for multiple stakeholders and multiple ecosystem services, particularly in real landscapes. Using a case study from a high-priority region for forest protection, restoration and rural development in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, we analysed the potential outcomes under 10 alternative policy scenarios, including land-sharing, land-sparing and mixed strategies. We used a novel optimization process integrating integer programming with conservation-planning software (Marxan with Zones) to identify production possibility frontiers (PPFs), highlighting the trade-off between smallholder agriculture and oil palm, subject to achievement of a set of carbon, timber and biodiversity conservation targets. All policy scenarios modelled proved to be capable of achieving all targets simultaneously. Most strategies resulted in an expansion of the PPF from the baseline, increasing the flexibility of land allocation to achieve all targets. Mixed strategies gave the greatest flexibility to achieve targets, followed closely by land-sparing. Land-sharing only performed better than the baseline when no yield penalties were incurred, and resulted in PPF contraction otherwise. Strategies assessed required a minimum of 29-37% to be placed in conservation zones, notably protecting the majority of remaining forest, but requiring little reforestation.Policy implications. Production possibility frontiers (PPFs) can evaluate a broad spectrum of land-use policy options. When using targets sought by multiple stakeholders within an ecosystem services framework, PPFs can characterize biophysical, socio-economic and institutional dimensions of policy trade-offs in heterogeneous landscapes. All 10 policy strategies assessed in our case study are biophysically capable of achieving all stakeholder objectives, provided at least 29-37% of the landscape is conserved for biodiversity. This novel methodological approach provides practical options for systematic analysis in complex, multifunctional landscapes, and could, when integrated within a larger planning and implementation process, inform the design of land-use policies that maximize stakeholder satisfaction and minimize conflict.

T2  - GLOBAL FOREST FRAGMENTATION
AB  - Under the current scenario of continuing human population growth, achieving high agricultural yield while conserving forest biodiversity is challenging scientists and policy makers alike. There is ongoing debate as to whether biodiversity should be integrated on the same land (land sharing) or separated from agriculture (land sparing). Here, we present examples of land-sharing practices (agroforestry systems and multipurpose forests) and demonstrate that forest biodiversity conservation does not necessarily compromise crop yield. There is no simple trade-off between biodiversity and yield, and the complexity of crop yield-biodiversity relationships has not yet been fully investigated, at either the habitat or the landscape scale. We argue that land-sparing management has to be considered at different spatial scales. Agriculture in large-scale land sparing (intensive agriculture separated from forest remnants) generally does not benefit much from ecosystem services mediated by forest biodiversity, but small forest remnants can enhance biodiversity in large agricultural and forestry plantations. Small-scale land sparing (intensive agriculture connected to forest remnants) promotes beneficial organisms and their associated ecosystem services. In such landscapes, wild beneficial organisms, e.g. a diversity of pollinators, can enhance and stabilize crop pollination in intensively managed fields due to spillover from forests into crop fields. Functional connectivity of forest remnants (single trees, treelines, hedgerows and forest patches) in high-input agricultural landscapes can enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services, but future research needs to consider connectivity at various land-sparing scales to evaluate their conservation effectiveness. Furthermore, landscape developments minimizing possible adverse consequences of forest conservation on crop production are currently often overlooked but need to be considered in future research and landscape planning. We argue that both land sharing and land sparing can promote biodiversity without compromising high yields, and that a combination of management strategies at different spatial scales, including the maintenance of forest connectivity, may most effectively safeguard both biodiversity and livelihood security.

TI  - Bird functional diversity and ecosystem services in tropical forests, agroforests and agricultural areas
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY
CP  - 25th International Ornithological Congress (IOC)
AB  - Although most bird species avoid agricultural areas, nearly a third of all birds regularly to occasionally use such habitats, often providing important ecosystem services like pest control, pollination, and seed dispersal. Combining literature review with large-scale analyses of the ecological characteristics of the world's birds, I compared tropical bird species that prefer forests, agricultural areas or both, with respect to body mass, diet, range and population size, frequency, conservation status, habitat and resource specialization. Compared to primary forests, species richness of large frugivorous and insectivorous birds (especially terrestrial and understorey species) often declines in agroforests. In contrast, nectarivores, small-to-medium insectivores (especially migrants and canopy species), omnivores, and sometimes granivores and small frugivores do better, frequently by tracking seasonal resources. However, changes in guild species numbers do not necessarily translate to changes in relative abundance, biomass or function, and more studies are needed to quantify these important measures. These findings indicate that the replacement of forests and agroforests with simplified agricultural systems can result in shifts towards less specialized bird communities with altered proportions of functional groups. These shifts can reduce avian ecosystem function and affect the ecosystem services provided by birds in agroforests and other agricultural landscapes.

TI  - Fostering a participatory process for ecological restoration of mangroves in Pantanos de Centla Biosphere Reserve (Tabasco, Mexico)
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS AND PEOPLE
AB  - Ecosystem restoration is becoming an urgent global priority to recover degraded areas, especially in tropical regions. Social participation is fundamental for the success of restoration processes, but it needs to be better documented. This article describes a participatory mangrove restoration process developed with two local communities inhabiting Pantanos de Centla Biosphere Reserve (PCBR) in Tabasco, Mexico. Both communities, El Palmar and Tembladeras, rely on numerous ecosystem services provided by mangroves, and the premise of the project was to closely involve them in all phases of the restoration process. During the planning phase, dialogue with PCBR authorities and the participating communities allowed us to: (1) assess local needs and interests to determine the project's viability; (2) perform social and ecological diagnostics; and (3) make decisions regarding restoration actions. With technical accompaniment, community members themselves executed restoration actions during the implementation phase. In El Palmar, people reforested an area equivalent to 160 ha with 17,038 propagules of Rhizophora mangle. In Tembladeras, they manually cleaned 4,942 m of natural channels to reestablish water flow dynamics across 34.7 ha. These activities were done in parallel with four training workshops for community members focusing on ecosystem services, ecological restoration processes, and monitoring techniques. With guidance from the project team, community members conducted initial monitoring of restoration actions four months after implementation. The local communities' participation in all stages was fundamental to promoting an integral and sustainable restoration process of the socio-ecosystem and fostering greater awareness of the full range of services mangroves provide.

TI  - Forest Plantations in Manabi (Ecuador): Assessment of Fragmentation and Connectivity to Support Dry Tropical Forests Conservation
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - In many tropical regions, national forests plantation programs have been promoted. Those plantations frequently contribute to habitat changes. However, the associated effects of forest plantations on habitat fragmentation and landscape connectivity are unclear. From 2008 to 2018, we examined land use changes, plantations, and deforestation of the Manabi province (Ecuador) provided by the Ecuadorian Ministry of the Environment. Four scenarios were created: (i) land uses in 2008, (ii) land uses in 2018, (iii) land uses in 2018 without deforestation, and iv) land uses in 2018 including reforestation. Fragmentation and connectivity metrics were analyzed using ArcGisPro and Graphad 2.6 software, respectively. Puma yagouaroundi was selected as the reference species. At regional scale, forest plantations had a significant effect on land uses changes and fragmentation during the study period. Forests decreased from 33.7% to 32.4% between 2008 and 2018, although other natural land uses, mostly those involving shrubs, increased by almost double (from 2.4% to 4.6%). Most of the deforestation affected native forests during this period, and most reforested areas in 2018 covered former agricultural land. Fragmentation decreased in the number of patches and increased in the average patch size. When considering reforestation, deforestation was higher than the reforested area (58 km(2) of difference), increasing the number of patches but with smaller size. Reforestation increased connectivity with a higher number of links and distance, particularly in central and extreme northeast areas of Manabi province. The scenario without deforestation also increased connectivity for Puma yagouaroundi in the west part of the Manabi province. Our findings suggest that forest plantations contribute to forest conservation by increasing the connectivity between fragmented patches.

TI  - LONG-TERM ASSESSMENT OF FIRE-INDUCED CARBON LOSS IN SOUTHEAST ATLANTIC FOREST
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
AB  - Fires threaten tropical forests such as Atlantic Forest in Brazil, compromising the ecosystem service of carbon stock. However, there is a literature gap regarding these studies in these ecosystems. Therefore, we conducted this analysis in different land use and land cover (LULC) classes, considering seasonality and topographic, hydrological, anthropogenic and fire variables correlations, during 2000-2020. The InVEST Carbon model was used, applied to carbon biomass pre-fire and pos-fire, based on field work and linear regression, weighted by pre- and post-fire NBR spectral index. The results, in 21 years, revealed a total loss after fire of 55.7GgC (43%), and of these, 79% is in old-growth Ombrophilous dense. In general, fire negatively impacts the carbon stock of native forests by an average of 38% (ranging from 19.9% to 69.1%, depending on phytophysiognomy and seasonality), Eucalyptus plantations by 87.1%, high- altitude grasslands by 79.5% and pasture in 90.4%. Burn frequency and severity as well as distance from rivers and roads were significantly correlated with carbon loss. A small portion of this biome has shown a high potential for fire-induced carbon loss, indicating a danger for the whole Atlantic Forest conservation and to international agreements commitments.

TI  - Agroforestry coffee production increased by native shade trees, irrigation, and liming
T2  - AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Agroforestry systems usually include a high density and diversity of shade trees. Such systems often have a large diversity of fauna and flora and provide local and regional ecosystem services. Shade trees are, however, being removed to increase crop production in many tropical regions. There is little knowledge on the effect of shade trees on crop production in the context of trade-offs with other management practices. We therefore compared the benefits of exotic versus native shade trees on coffee production. We evaluated the importance of shade tree management for crop production in the context of management practices. Management practices included fertilization, liming, coffee pruning, weeding, and irrigation in 113 coffee agroforests in Kodagu, India, over a wide range of shade tree density, tree species diversity, and shade cover. We studied, in particular, Grevillea and non-Grevillea shade trees, the latter including mostly native tree species. Results show that a rise of 100 non-Grevillea shade tree per hectare increased production of berries by 5.6 % and larger beans by 6.25 %. Irrigation and liming increased berry production respectively by 16 and 20 %. These management interventions are likely to offset the relatively small negative effect of reducing shade density of non-Grevillea trees on coffee production. Recommendations based on an understanding of shade tree management alone can be misleading with regard to crop production.

TI  - Consequences of actor level livelihood heterogeneity for additionality in a tropical forest payment for environmental services programme with an undifferentiated reward structure
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - Primary tropical forests provide crucial environmental services, including carbon storage and hydrological regulation. Options for promoting forest conservation include payments for environmental services (PES) programmes that provide financial incentives to local actors, in exchange for reduced forest clearance. The success of voluntary PES (defined in terms of avoided primary forest conversion) is contingent upon behavioural changes in enrolled actors. As both the degree of enrolment and likelihood of sustained behavioural change depend upon how PES compensation structures interact with existing actor economies, local heterogeneity in livelihood strategies may play a strong role in the ultimate success of PES programmes, particularly when compensation is not differentiated with respect to opportunity costs. We examined the influence of livelihood heterogeneity on the potential success of a deforestation-reduction PES with an undifferentiated reward structure. We collected socioeconomic and demographic data at the household and community levels across two large Amazonian extractive reserves where a spatially extensive PES programme (Bolsa Floresta) operates. We show that demographic and socioeconomic status varies widely across households and communities, and found that both households and communities that are most and least likely to convert primary forest receive similar financial incentives. Those households most engaged in manioc agriculture (the primary driver of local primary forest conversion) both benefitted from the highest annual incomes and incurred the greatest opportunity costs. We show that avoided primary forest conversion could be greatly increased with differentiated payment structures adjusted for local differences in opportunity costs and livelihood strategies, and present two metrics that could help to achieve that goal.

TI  - Woody species richness drives synergistic recovery of socio-ecological multifunctionality along early tropical dry forest regeneration
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Secondary tropical forests offer critical ecosystem services such as regulation of climate, soil and water resources, which are frequently traded off against the provision of forest products for human use or repeated clearing for agriculture. While some evidence also suggests potential synergies between regulating and material contributions of regenerating forests to people, the ecological mechanisms of multiple synergies remain poorly understood. We assess tradeoffs and synergies by testing for cascading effects of tropical dry forest age and vegetation drivers on key ecosystem properties that underpin multiple regulating, material and non-material contributions to people. To do so we first compiled published evidence to propose a conceptual framework of the causal dependence among variables. Then, we tested which direct or indirect effects of this a priori conceptual model are supported by structural equation models of measured data from a chronosequence of secondary tropical dry forest plots. We tested whether individual density, taxonomic or functional diversity, community-weighted mean in wood specific gravity, or composition of the woody vegetation best explained synergies or tradeoffs among multiple key ecosystem properties. We show a synergistic, positive effect of observed woody species richness on all four key ecosystem properties, including total basal area, litter layer carbon stocks, soil penetration resistance and availability and versatility of socioeconomically useful plants. A similar synergistic effect of linear age-dependent changes in species composition suggests that the simultaneous recovery of multiple functions is not only driven by absolute woody species accrual, but also by temporal woody species turnover as secondary succession proceeds. However, local farmers reported uses of only a small fraction of available plant biodiversity that has previously been documented in the literature to be socioeconomically useful. In synthesis, we found that observed woody species richness and successional turnover along tropical dry forest regeneration are synergistic drivers of biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and the availability and versatility of currently underutilized plant products in Western Mexico. Such observed synergy between a range of key regulating, material and non-material contributions to people highlights untapped socioecological potential for multifunctional tropical forest restoration through sustainable use.

TI  - RESEARCH DIRECTIONS IN TROPICAL FOREST RESTORATION
T2  - ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN
CP  - 63rd Annual Systematics Symposium of the Missouri Botanical Garden on Ecological Restoration in a Changing Biosphere
AB  - In the past few years, numerous global, national, and regional targets have been set to restore millions of hectares of tropical forest to achieve multiple goals, including carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, improvements in the quality and supply of water, and support of human livelihoods. To achieve these ambitious goals, restoration decision makers need guiding principles regarding how to invest limited resources for large-scale forest restoration. Research over the past two decades has shown that a host of abiotic and biotic factors can slow tropical forest recovery, but that the specific barriers to and rate of recovery are site specific. Hence, restoration strategies must be carefully selected considering the natural resilience of a given site, localized harriers to recovery, and the ecological and human goals of the project. Despite the substantial advances in our understanding of tropical forest regeneration and restoration, to date neither the scale of scientific studies nor the restoration projects being implemented have matched the ambitious forest landscape restoration plans that are being proposed. I discuss key ways to enhance the success of tropical forest restoration efforts, citing a range of examples to illustrate each point. Specifically, restoration projects need to be planned and evaluated at larger spatial scales and over longer time periods, which requires better integration of the science and practice of forest restoration. Ultimately, forest restoration success hinges on including multiple stakeholders, such as farmers, local communities, local government leaders, regional and national policymakers, and scientists, in the planning, implementation, and evaluation processes. Finally, efforts to improve knowledge sharing across restoration projects in different regions will enhance the likelihood of implementing successful tropical forest restoration projects at the desired scale.

TI  - Above-ground biomass storage potential in primary rain forests managed for timber production in Costa Rica
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Tropical forests play a fundamental role in mitigating climate change through storage of carbon in above-and below-ground biomass. Their mitigation potential is, however, affected by significant greenhouse gas emissions through tropical deforestation or forest degradation. Mitigating degradation caused by conventional logging is therefore an important challenge for silvicultural management, and various reduced impact logging techniques seek to reduce biomass loss and other logging impacts during forest logging activities. Little knowledge exists about the potential of sustainable management for maintaining and restoring the climate change mitigation capacity of tropical forests. Our research contributes to knowledge about this potential, as our aim is to evaluate the above-ground biomass (AGB) stock of tropical forests managed for sustainable timber production and compare it with that of intact primary forests. We also determine the environmental and spatial factors that influence AGB. We estimated the AGB of 141 permanent sampling plots in Costa Rican tropical forests (71 plots set up in areas managed for timber production forests and 70 plots set up in areas with intact primary forests) using data for the 2000-2015 period. We compared the AGB of timber production forests with that of primary forest using linear mixed models and examined the relationship between forest AGB and climate, soil fertility and spatial variables (PCNM eigenvalues) using variation partitioning (VARPART) and multiple linear regression in the mixed model framework. Mean AGB was higher in forest plots set up in areas managed for timber production than in plots set up in areas with intact primary forests. In VARPART, spatial variables had the strongest effect on AGB with a small but significant effect of soil fertility. Regression showed potassium levels in the soil to be positively related to AGB. There was no significant effect of climate, probably because of the short temperature and precipitation gradients. Sustainable forest management in these Costa Rican forests managed for timber production has enabled them to store as much carbon in biomass as primary forests, due to the low intensity logging and sustainability criteria stipulated by the country's forestry legislation. As a result, sustainable forest management, in addition to providing a sustainable timber ecosystem service, is also a natural climate solution, maintaining the mitigation potential of Costa Rica's tropical forests in the current climate context.

TI  - Seedling diversity in actively and passively restored tropical forest understories
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Alternative methods for restoring tropical forests influence the ecological processes that shape recruitment of understory species. In turn, the traits of species recruited will influence the ecological processes the forests provide now and over the long term. We assess the phylogenetic and functional structure of seedlings beneath monoculture plantations, mixed-species plantations (both active restoration) and regenerating selectively logged native forests (passive restoration), considering traits of specific leaf area (SLA, including within-species variation), leaf nitrogen and phosphorus content, life-form, potential plant height, and dispersal type. Monoculture plantations comprised seedlings that were more closely related then would be expected by chance (i.e., phylogenetically clustered), and regenerating forest contained species more distantly related then would be expected by chance (i.e., phylogenetically overdispersed). This suggests that seedlings beneath monocultures assemble through environmental filtering and through the dispersal limitation of predictable functional guilds. However, dispersal limitation is frequently overcome by human-assisted dispersal, increasing trait diversity. Comparing SLA values revealed that regenerating forests recruit seedlings with both high and low mean and variation of SLA, leading to higher overall diversity. Regenerating forest seedlings showed signs of environmental filtering, only based on within-species variation of SLA. Regenerating forest understories appear to favor species that show a high intraspecific variation in SLA values (e.g., Pterocarpus indicus Willd.) and at the same time provided habitat for later successional seedlings that show a lower intraspecific variation in SLA (e.g., Canarium luzonicum (Blume) A.Gray). This trait diversity suggests limiting similarity or competitive exclusion may be reduced because of niche differences, allowing species with different traits to coexist. Phylogenetic and functionally distinct species are restricted in their regeneration capacity, many of which are of conservation significance (under the IUCN Red List). Reforestation projects should maximize desired ecological services (including conservation value) by actively managing for the recruitment of species that are phylogenetically and functionally (including intraspecifically) distinct. This management aim will increase the probability of fulfilling a wider array of niche spaces and potentially increase the diversity of ecosystem services provided.

TI  - Landscape Context Mediates Avian Habitat Choice in Tropical Forest Restoration
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Birds both promote and prosper from forest restoration. The ecosystem functions birds perform can increase the pace of forest regeneration and, correspondingly, increase the available habitat for birds and other forest-dependent species. The aim of this study was to learn how tropical forest restoration treatments interact with landscape tree cover to affect the structure and composition of a diverse bird assemblage. We sampled bird communities over two years in 13 restoration sites and two old-growth forests in southern Costa Rica. Restoration sites were established on degraded farmlands in a variety of landscape contexts, and each included a 0.25-ha plantation, island treatment (trees planted in patches), and unplanted control. We analyzed four attributes of bird communities including frugivore abundance, nectarivore abundance, migrant insectivore richness, and compositional similarity of bird communities in restoration plots to bird communities in old-growth forests. All four bird community variables were greater in plantations and/or islands than in control treatments. Frugivore and nectarivore abundance decreased with increasing tree cover in the landscape surrounding restoration plots, whereas compositional similarity to old-growth forests was greatest in plantations embedded in landscapes with high tree cover. Migrant insectivore richness was unaffected by landscape tree cover. Our results agree with previous studies showing that increasing levels of investment in active restoration are positively related to bird richness and abundance, but differences in the effects of landscape tree cover on foraging guilds and community composition suggest that trade-offs between biodiversity conservation and bird-mediated ecosystem functioning may be important for prioritizing restoration sites.

TI  - Predation pressure by birds and arthropods on herbivorous insects affected by tropical forest restoration strategy
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Recovery of animal-dependent ecosystem functions is a key component of ecological restoration on degraded tropical forest lands. One of these functions, regulation of herbivorous insects by predators, shapes tropical communities through cascading trophic effects. An improved understanding of how predation pressure on herbivorous insects varies with reforestation strategy, management decisions, and landscape context would guide restoration practice. We measured predation pressure by birds and arthropods on dummy caterpillars in five forest types in Panama. These land covers represent natural and managed forest conditions: non-native monoculture plantation, native multispecies plantation, young natural forest succession, secondary gallery forest, and old-growth forest. We also placed dummy caterpillars in residential countryside, a heavily disturbed nonforest land cover. In three land covers, we surveyed bird communities to examine the relationship between predator abundance and predation pressure. Predation pressure from birds was lowest in the intensively managed plantations and highest in land covers with structurally complex vegetation: successional forest, gallery forest, and residential countryside. In the non-native plantation, bird predation increased with proximity to gallery forest. We found strong correspondence between bird abundance and bird attacks on dummy caterpillars. Arthropod predation pressure was highest in the native plantation but, unlike bird predation pressure, did not vary strongly by land cover. Our results suggest that ecosystem functions by insectivorous birds can be enhanced on reforestation lands by incorporating unmanaged areas and tolerating nonplanted understory vegetation. We recommend that, regardless of management objectives, forest managers adopt a holistic approach to reforestation to facilitate recovery of animal-dependent ecosystem functions.

TI  - Landscape context influences local management effects on birds and bats in Amazonian cacao agroforestry systems
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Agricultural expansion and intensification are major drivers of biodiversity loss, particularly in tropical regions. Cacao agroforestry systems can both support and benefit from high levels of biodiversity via associated pest control services from birds and bats, although their potential to do so likely depends on local management and the landscape context. However, how interactions between local-scale agroforestry practices and landscape-scale habitat features shape bird and bat communities in these systems remains poorly understood. We studied birds and bats in 28 smallholder cacao agroforests in the Peruvian Amazon, comparing two regions with contrasting levels of agricultural intensification. We analyzed how local tree diversity and canopy cover interact with surrounding landscape tree cover and regional agricultural intensity to influence species richness and community composition. Results showed that local tree diversity increased bird richness, but only in the intensively farmed region. Local canopy cover had contrasting effects: it negatively impacted bird richness, abundance, and bat activity in more open landscapes (<55 % tree cover), but positively in forested landscapes (>80 % tree cover). Notably, these interactions were significant when considering the landscape tree cover at small spatial scales (250 m), but not at 500 m or 1000 m. Our findings highlight the importance of adapting cacao agroforestry management to the surrounding landscape. Retaining high local canopy cover supports flying vertebrate diversity and associated ecosystem services in forested landscapes, while restoration of landscape tree cover could enhance bird and bat populations that may contribute to pest suppression services in deforested areas.

TI  - Forests as Capital: Financial Mechanisms for Tropical Forest Conservation
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
AB  - Tropical forest loss and degradation due to human activities have been persistent and intractable global problems. Model estimates suggest that current levels of finance for conservation and sustainable forest management (SFM) are insufficient and may need to increase by an order of magnitude in order to meet this challenge. This special issue presents select articles from the 2014 Yale International Society of Tropical Foresters (ISTF) Annual Conference, which explored diverse finance mechanisms such as REDD+, sustainability certification, ecological compensation, community forestry, and official development assistance. Each finance mechanism has advantages and disadvantages, which render them effective under specific circumstances. Comprehensive tropical forest conservation will require a diverse portfolio of finance strategies appropriate for local institutional and ecological conditions. Hybrid strategies combining elements of multiple schemes could bolster conservation and SFM efforts by leveraging their respective strengths. Clear and realistic targets and baselines, robust monitoring and measurement-reporting-verification, strong governance and institutions, and periodic evaluation can contribute to the successful application of forest conservation finance. Due to the potentially high damages, especially to the world's poorest communities from continuing current deforestation trends, substantially greater financing of tropical conservation and SFM is a sound global investment.

TI  - The Brazilian Forest Code and riparian preservation areas: spatiotemporal analysis and implications for hydrological ecosystem services
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB  - The Brazilian Forest Code (BFC) requires the preservation and restoration of forests in riparian preservation areas (RPAs). The total area in RPAs and the impacts of changes in the BFC on RPA requirements are uncertain due to lack of clarity about how RPAs are defined in practice. We reconstruct the history of the RPA rule, use a recent cadastral database (CAR) of the state of Rondonia to quantify the area of RPA by stream size and to document the impact of the 2012 changes in RPA requirements, and review the literature on hydrological ecosystem services (HES) in light of RPA rules. We find that most (64%) of the area in RPAs in the state of Rondonia was illegally deforested by 2017, and the 2012 regulations require restoration of only half of that cleared area. Most of the RPA is located along small streams (< 10 m wide) that were typically missing in previous assessments. As of 2017, 66% of the RPA along small streams was deforested, while most (70-95%) RPA along large streams (> 200 m wide) was forested. Current restoration requirements (5 m regardless of stream width) for very small properties (< 60 ha) are likely inadequate to restore HES. Preservation of forest along large streams remains important, but policy and management should also emphasize the preservation and restoration of forest along small streams because they account for most of the riparian preservation area, with important implications for humans and ecosystems.

TI  - Economic Feasibility of Tropical Forest Restoration Models Based on Non-Timber Forest Products in Brazil, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Peru
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Mobilizing funds is a major challenge to achieve scalable Forest Landscape Restoration projects. While pure ecological restoration may not be a feasible investment from the private perspective, combining native species with non-timber forest products (NTFP) species may be a solution for reaching large scale and financially sustainable forest restoration. This study addresses potential species combinations for 12 restoration models, three models being based in pure ecological restoration and nine models being based on agroforests with NTFP, their economic costs, and benefits in tropical forests in Brazil, Peru, Cambodia, and Indonesia. A total of 12 semi-structured interviews were conducted to capture the models' productivity and prices. As for the prices that the producers did not know, specialized stores were consulted in the cities of the collection. The starting investment to restore 01 hectare (ha(-1)) of tropical forest ranged between US $104 and $7736, with an average of $1963 ha(-1) and a standard deviation of $2196 ha(-1), considering the 12 cases evaluated in 2018 and 2019. From nine restoration models that had economic purposes, financial indicators showed a median net present value (NPV) of $1548 ha(-1), and a median internal rate of return of 22%, considering a discount rate of 10%. The NPV varied between $-685 ha(-1) and $55,531 ha(-1). Costs of pure ecological restoration were on average 42% lower than agroforestry systems, but did not produce direct income from NTFP, therefore yielding negative NPV. The study demonstrated the economic feasibility of seven of nine models that had economic objective, showing that there are promising business cases for private investment in tropical forest restoration.

TI  - How payments for ecosystem services can undermine Indigenous institutions: The case of Peru?s Ampiyacu-Apayacu watershed
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Payments for ecosystem services have come to dominate international policies for addressing tropical deforestation. Political ecologists, degrowth scholars, and Indigenous activists have critiqued these approaches on the grounds that by centering economic growth, they can disrupt local conservation systems and compromise forestdwelling communities' ability to protect forests and live well. Meanwhile, Indigenous groups have developed positive alternatives to 'green growth' strategies, including buen vivir (good living) in Latin America. In Peru, the National Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) serves as the state's flagship initiative to address tropical deforestation in Indigenous communities by paying communities for demonstrated reductions in deforestation, so long as they invest those funds according to an agreed up on management plan. We analyzed how the NFCP has interacted with quality-of-life plans, Indigenous planning tools rooted in buen vivir. Our findings suggest that the NFCP has eroded local systems for conservation, including the minga, an Amazonian tradition of mutual aid and shared labor for subsistence livelihoods, pushing communities to replace these systems with commodity production and employer-employee relationships. We argue that instead of imposing onerous conditions and steering communities towards evermore commodity production, conservation initiatives should support the implementation of quality-of-life plans. We suggest that climate justice organizers, political ecologists, and degrowth scholars explore and advocate for such initiatives.

TI  - The role of forest provisioning ecosystem services in coping with household stresses and shocks in Miombo woodlands, Zambia
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
AB  - This paper investigates the use of forest provisioning ecosystem services (FPES) in coping with stresses and shocks in rural households of Miombo woodland systems. It assesses the influence of socioeconomic factors (wealth and gender) in households coping decisions. The study employs a mixed methods approach by combining focus groups meetings, in-depth interviews, and interviews of 244 households stratified by household wealth classes and gender of household heads in Copperbelt Pt ovince, Zambia. The results show that households face multiple shocks and that FPES are the most widely used coping strategy used by households facing idiosyncratic shocks, by households, followed by kinship. A higher proportion of poor and intermediate households rely on FPES to cope with various shocks than their wealthier counterparts. When stratified by gender, more male-headed households used FPES than female headed households. With respect to coping with household food stresses, charcoal production and sale is the most widely used strategy, followed by off-farm activities and remittances, in designing forest management strategies aimed at reconciling forest conservation and rural development, such as reduction of emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) schemes, it is vitally important that alternate coping strategies are made available to rural households to reduce pressure on forests.

TI  - Social and ecological factors associated with the use of non-timber forest products by people in rural Borneo
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Supply of non-timber Forest Products (NTFPs) is an important provisioning ecosystem service. It is often argued that forest conservation contributes to poverty alleviation through provisioning of NTFPs to the poor. However, implicit assumptions of the argument that NTFPs are more intensively utilized by poor who lack alternative subsistence options, and that NTFP supplies are limited by forest cover, have rarely been critically examined. This study investigated social and environmental factors affecting NTFP uses in rural areas of Borneo, using a land cover map and socio-economic dataset collected from 1596 households in 87 villages. The NTFPs examined were wild boars, sambar deer, wild fruits, firewood, wild vegetables, and wild mushrooms. To explain the variations in NTFP uses among households, four village and nine household characteristics were considered using generalized linear mixed models. We found that forest cover and collection pressure limit the use of some NTFPs, supporting the second assumption. On the other hand, the first assumption was supported only for firewood, and animals and wild fruits were more frequently used by wealthier households, contrary to this assumption. Other factors (education, age and sex of householder and agricultural activities) were also related to the use of one or more NTFPs. This study demonstrates the complexity of the process by which forest cover and other factors affect the ecosystem services people receive. Evaluation of ecosystem services is an important and urgent research subject today, but it is also necessary to pay attention to who receives the benefits, and who does not. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Potential native timber production in tropical forest restoration plantations
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Restoring tropical forests still relies on expensive tree planting. Timber production from native trees offers a promising opportunity to make restoration financially viable, but species growth data are lacking. We assessed the potential of tropical forest restoration plantations for producing native timber in the Atlantic Forest. For that we inventoried a chronosequence of unmanaged restoration plantation sites with ten commercial native tree species. Then we developed growth models and used the Growth-Oriented Logging (GOL) method to inform targeted management decisions, including an optimized timber-focused scenario, based on growth and bole quality assessment. Usually, growth-rate classes for saw wood production would be defined according to the time necessary for achieving 35 cm in DBH. Harvesting age was markedly reduced using GOL for species of fast-growth (from <50 to <25 years), intermediate-growth (from 50 to 70 to 25-50 years), slow-growth (from >70 to 50-75 years). Following GOL, basal area was 42 +/- 30% larger at harvest (taking 35 +/- 23% more time) or 60 +/- 16.5% smaller (taking 66 +/- 16% less time). The optimized scenario speeded tree-size achievement and anticipated harvesting in an average of 58 years. Species selection, individualization, and silvicultural management are critical for producing timber in forest restoration programs.

TI  - Design of tropical forest conservation contracts considering risk of deforestation
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Payments for Forest Conservation (PFC) programs financially compensate forest owners to maintain and increase the provision of ecosystem services. Nonetheless, their effectiveness and additionality in preventing deforestation and degradation remain contested. The design of PFC contracts can influence landowner participation and in-turn a program's prospects for additionality. We examined preferences for select PFC contractual attributes among over 200 private forest owners in Ecuador's Amazon basin using a discrete choice experiment. Forest owners at high-risk of deforestation, as compared to others of lower risk, were almost eight-times more likely to select contracts that allowed timber harvest under a management plan, about three-times more likely to select contracts managed by local municipalities or international NGOs, and showed stronger preferences for long-term contracts. To increase enrollment of forest lands at higher risk of deforestation and degradation PFC contracts might need to reconsider the benefits of increasing financial incentives, pursue administration through local municipalities or international NGOs, allow sustainable timber harvesting, and seek permanent agreements.

TI  - Biodiversity and ecosystem services in forest ecosystems: a research agenda for applied forest ecology
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Given the substantial contributions of forest biodiversity and ecosystem services to society, forest sciences have a large potential to contribute to the integrity and sustainability of our future. This is especially true when the roles of biodiversity for sustaining ecosystem services are considered. The rapid expansion of sustainable forest management (SFM) has resulted in the adoption of various forest management frameworks intended to safeguard biodiversity. Concurrently, the importance of forest ecosystem services has been increasingly recognized. Although some initiatives aimed at conserving both biodiversity and ecosystem services are emerging, knowledge gaps still exist about their relationships and potential trade-offs in forests. Given recent advancements, increasing opportunities and some lags in forest ecology, further research on biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services will play substantial roles in the development of SFM practices. Here, we identified key issues including (i) relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function as a foundation of ecological integrity, (ii) resilience thinking to better prepare for and adapt to environmental changes, (iii) social-ecological perspectives that facilitate real-world conservation and management and (iv) theory-driven restoration that bridges science and practice. Thus, we illustrate priorities and future possibilities in applied ecology studies in forests, which will help society and ecosystems to build capacity and resilience to face uncertainty in the changing environment.Synthesis and applications. Under substantial human influences, forests are highly likely to be largely altered, potentially leading to the emergence of novel ecosystems or alternative stable states. Management thus needs more flexible, novel measures to address the significant uncertainty this generates. Resilience-based approaches are important to respond adaptively to future changes and cope with surprises, potentially providing multiple options. Although challenges exist, theory should play an important role in managing, conserving and restoring forest ecosystems. The issues discussed here should receive further attention in the context of the multiple goals of sustainable forest management.

TI  - A Contemporary Assessment of Change in Humid Tropical Forests
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - In recent decades the rate and geographic extent of land-use and land-cover change has increased throughout the world's humid tropical forests. The pan-tropical geography of forest change is a challenge to assess, and improved estimates of the human footprint in the tropics are critical to understanding potential changes in biodiversity. We combined recently published and new satellite observations, along with images from Google Earth and a literature review, to estimate the contemporary global extent of deforestation, selective logging, and secondary regrowth in humid tropical forests. Roughly 1.4% of the biome was deforested between 2000 and 2005. As of 2005, about half of the humid tropical forest biome contained 50% or less tree cover. Although not directly comparable to deforestation, geographic estimates of selective logging indicate that at least 20% of the humid tropical forest biome was undergoing some level of timber harvesting between 2000 and 2005. Forest recovery estimates are even less certain, but a compilation of available reports suggests that at least 1.2% of the humid tropical forest biome was in some stage of long-term secondary regrowth in 2000. Nearly 70% of the regrowth reports indicate forest regeneration in hilly, upland, and mountainous environments considered marginal for large-scale agriculture and ranching. Our estimates of the human footprint are conservative because they do not resolve very small-scale deforestation, low-intensity logging, and unreported secondary regrowth, nor do they incorporate other impacts on tropical forest ecosystems, such as fire and hunting. Our results highlight the enormous geographic extent of forest change throughout the humid tropics and the considerable limitations of the science and technology available for such a synthesis.

TI  - Persistent Effects of Landscape Context on Recruitment Dynamics During Secondary Succession of Tropical Forests
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Large-scale reforestation is promoted as an important strategy to mitigate climate change and biodiversity loss. A persistent challenge for efforts to restore ecosystems at scale is how to accelerate ecological processes, particularly natural regeneration. Yet, despite being recognized as an important barrier to the recovery of diverse plant communities in tropical agricultural landscapes, the impacts of dispersal limitation on natural regeneration in secondary forests-and especially how this changes as these forests grow older-are still poorly studied. In a region where animals have been shown to be the dominant seed dispersers, we evaluate the impacts of proximity to a connected network of narrow streamside strips of forest (SSF) on recruitment in 1-40-year-old secondary forests. We used 8 years of annual census data from 45 sites with paired plots, one directly adjoining an SSF and the other further uphill (henceforth "landscape context"), and a null model approach to test the effects of proximity to SSFs and basal area, while accounting for variation in soil, topography, and distance between plots and stand structure. In general, we found that landscape context affects multiple aspects of recruitment, including species diversity and the proportion of rarer and less-widely distributed species among the recruits. Unexpectedly, this effect did not weaken over time, despite a fast increase in stand basal area and diversity. This suggests that forest development over the first decades of succession may not be sufficient to attract the animals that disperse rarer tree species. Our results provide empirical evidence to guide restoration initiatives in agricultural landscapes in tropical regions, principally prioritizing the restoration of forest corridor networks along streams, while also highlighting the knowledge gap about restoring animal dispersers in secondary forests.

TI  - Edge effects and human disturbance influence soil physical and chemical properties in Sacred Church Forests in Ethiopia
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Aims Tropical forests are increasingly threatened by edge effects as forest degradation and deforestation continues, compromising soil integrity, seedling regeneration capacity, and ecosystem services. Ninety-three percent of the last remaining forests of northern Ethiopia, which number 1022 in the South Gondar region of our study, are <16 ha and are protected because they have a Tewahido Orthodox Christian church at their center. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of human disturbance, forest size, distance from population center and other factors on the soil properties and nutrient status of sacred church forests. We also compared forest soil physical and chemical properties across land cover types in these forests. Methods We assessed the soil physical (water content and bulk density) and chemical (total carbon and nitrogen, available phosphorus, ammonium) properties of 40 sacred church forests across three spatial scales: within individual forests; among forests; and across land cover type (forest, forest edge-exterior,Eucalyptusplantation). We used distance from the edge within each forest to examine edge effects on soil nutrients. Results We found that nutrients and carbon decreased significantly from the interior to the outer edge of these forests and with forest size. Further, the soil ofEucalyptusplantations and areas outside of the forest were largely indistinguishable; both had significantly lower nutrient concentrations than sacred church forest soil. Conclusion Our research highlights the insidious impacts of edge effects and human disturbance on forest soils and the need for an integrated soil management program in the region that balances local needs with forest conservation. The conservation of these sacred church forests is important for maintaining regional soil nutrient status relative to agricultural lands andEucalyptusplantations.

TI  - Tropical Forest Landscape Restoration in Indonesia: A Review
T2  - LAND
AB  - Indonesia has the second-largest biodiversity of any country in the world. Deforestation and forest degradation have caused a range of environmental issues, including habitat degradation and loss of biodiversity, deterioration of water quality and quantity, air pollution, and increased greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. Forest restoration at the landscape level has been conducted to balance ecological integrity and human well-being. Forest restoration efforts are also aimed at reducing CO2 emissions and are closely related to Indonesia's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) from the forestry sector. The purpose of this paper is to examine the regulatory, institutional, and policy aspects of forest restoration in Indonesia, as well as the implementation of forest restoration activities in the country. The article was written using a synoptic review approach to Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR)-related articles and national experiences. Failures, success stories, and criteria and indicators for forest restoration success are all discussed. We also discuss the latest silvicultural techniques for the success of the forest restoration program. Restoration governance in Indonesia has focused on the wetland ecosystem such as peatlands and mangroves, but due to the severely degraded condition of many forests, the government has by necessity opted for active restoration involving the planting and establishment of livelihood options. The government has adapted its restoration approach from the early focus on ecological restoration to more forest landscape restoration, which recognizes that involving the local community in restoration activities is critical for the success of forest restoration.

TI  - A Review of Global Policy Mechanisms Designed for Tropical Forests Conservation and Climate Risks Management
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Deforestation and forest degradation of tropical forests are major global concerns due to their ecological, social, and economic roles. In the wake of climate change and its diverse global effects, fragmentation and degradation of tropical forests have jeopardized their ability to support livelihoods and regenerate climate regulating services. Concerted efforts by local, national, and international players, which are primarily scientific, technological, or economic, have borne minimal results in safeguarding these forests from destruction, necessitating a more integrated and inclusive approach. The Rio Earth Summit (1992) brought together world leaders to set targets and priorities on the global sustainability agenda and laid a strong foundation for international policy cooperation in the future. This study employed a systematic review of articles published between 1992 and 2020 to establish how various policy mechanisms have been developed and evolved to bridge forests and climate change discourse in tropical forests while highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. The initial search of peer-reviewed publications and gray literature yielded 2622 records, which were subjected to inclusion and exclusion criteria based on The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta Analyses guidelines, resulting in a final list of 65 records for in-depth qualitative analysis. The study establishes that the mechanisms in place have contributed mainly to more coordination and incentives to manage climate risks, primarily through tropical forests conservation. However, hurdles such as inadequate participation and involvement of the local and indigenous people, insufficient national and local policy frameworks and bureaucracies around emissions monitoring, measuring, reporting, and verification processes continue to slow tropical forest conservation. Thus, there is a need for more integrated, multilevel, and diverse stakeholder engagement to achieve the set global targets effectively.

TI  - Global benefits and local costs - The dilemma of tropical forest conservation: A review of the situation in Madagascar
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Deforestation is one of the most important conservation problems in tropical developing countries, even though cost-benefit analyses consistently show that forest conservation is economically beneficial. In Madagascar, deforestation continues at alarming rates despite numerous initiatives of international donors to increase incentives for local households to support forest conservation. In this literature review, we contrast cost-benefit analyses for forest conservation with: (1) the actual burdens and (2) the actual gains of forest conservation for rural households, generated mainly in the context of conservation projects. We show that approaches to generating direct benefits deliver less value than expected for rural communities; the benefit transfer mechanisms are insufficient as the majority of benefits are captured by other stakeholders, and increased benefit transfer is limited by structural and institutional limitations in local communities, valuation chains and in terms of governance failure at higher levels.

TI  - Tropical and Boreal Forest Atmosphere Interactions: A Review
T2  - TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY
AB  - This review presents how the boreal and the tropical forests affect the atmosphere, its chemical composition, its function, and further how that affects the climate and, in return, the ecosystems through feedback processes. Observations from key tower sites standing out due to their long-term comprehensive observations: The Amazon Tall Tower Observatory in Central Amazonia, the Zotino Tall Tower Observatory in Siberia, and the Station to Measure Ecosystem-Atmosphere Relations at Hyytiala in Finland. The review is complemented by short-term observations from networks and large experiments.
   The review discusses atmospheric chemistry observations, aerosol formation and processing, physiochemical aerosol, and cloud condensation nuclei properties and finds surprising similarities and important differences in the two ecosystems. The aerosol concentrations and chemistry are similar, particularly concerning the main chemical components, both dominated by an organic fraction, while the boreal ecosystem has generally higher concentrations of inorganics, due to higher influence of long-range transported air pollution. The emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds are dominated by isoprene and monoterpene in the tropical and boreal regions, respectively, being the main precursors of the organic aerosol fraction.
   Observations and modeling studies show that climate change and deforestation affect the ecosystems such that the carbon and hydrological cycles in Amazonia are changing to carbon neutrality and affect precipitation downwind. In Africa, the tropical forests are so far maintaining their carbon sink.
   It is urgent to better understand the interaction between these major ecosystems, the atmosphere, and climate, which calls for more observation sites, providing long-term data on water, carbon, and other biogeochemical cycles. This is essential in finding a sustainable balance between forest preservation and reforestation versus a potential increase in food production and biofuels, which are critical in maintaining ecosystem services and global climate stability. Reducing global warming and deforestation is vital for tropical forests.

TI  - Direct comparisons of logging and agroforestry influence on tropical mammals in Sarawak, Borneo
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Tropical regions are undergoing rapid land use change, with major implications for global biodiversity. Selective logging and agroforestry are particularly widespread across tropical forests, often occurring in close proximity. But while a number of studies have addressed their impacts separately, few have directly compared how they influence forest vertebrates. Here, we assessed the occurrence of medium- to large-bodied mammals in logged forest, unlogged forest, and agroforestry areas in three study areas in interior Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo. We detected 34 species across 99 camera trap locations and used multi-species occupancy models to estimate species-specific occurrence while accounting for imperfect detectability, spatial autocorrelation, natural habitat heterogeneity, and metrics of site accessibility (distance to human infrastructure) as proxies for potential hunting pressure. We found that species occurrences were unaffected by the distance to the nearest road or village and only responded to elevation and the distance to the nearest river in a single species each. Detection rates tended to vary with micro-habitat characteristics such as the size of tree stumps and the prevalence of trees and rattan palms, which are often not considered in camera-based occupancy studies. Occurrence rates of five species varied across habitat types but were not detectably lower in agroforestry sites than in unlogged forest for any species. Our results indicate that without unsustainable hunting, agroforestry and logged forest provide usable habitat for some, though not all, rainforest mammals. We also suggest that camera trap studies may benefit from the incorporation of fine-scale habitat information into detectability estimation. Abstract in Malaysian is available with online material.

TI  - Ecological restoration success is higher for natural regeneration than for active restoration in tropical forests
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB  - Is active restoration the best approach to achieve ecological restoration success (the return to a reference condition, that is, old-growth forest) when compared to natural regeneration in tropical forests? Ourmeta-analysis of 133 studies demonstrated that natural regeneration surpasses active restoration in achieving tropical forest restoration success for all three biodiversity groups (plants, birds, and invertebrates) and five measures of vegetation structure (cover, density, litter, biomass, and height) tested. Restoration success for biodiversity and vegetation structure was 34 to 56% and 19 to 56% higher in natural regeneration than in active restoration systems, respectively, after controlling for key biotic and abiotic factors (forest cover, precipitation, time elapsed since restoration started, and past disturbance). Biodiversity responses were based primarily on ecological metrics of abundance and species richness (74%), both of which take far less time to achieve restoration success than similarity and composition. This finding challenges the widely held notion that natural forest regeneration has limited conservation value and that active restoration should be the default ecological restoration strategy. The proposition that active restoration achieves greater restoration success than natural regeneration may have arisen because previous comparisons lacked controls for biotic and abiotic factors; we also did not find any difference between active restoration and natural regeneration outcomes for vegetation structure when we did not control for these factors. Future policy priorities should align the identified patterns of biophysical and ecological conditions where each or both restoration approaches are more successful, cost-effective, and compatible with socioeconomic incentives for tropical forest restoration.

TI  - Socioeconomic and Environmental Basis for the Development of Small Scale Forestry in a Highly Degraded Watershed in the Venezuelan Andes
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
AB  - In the last 20 years, the Mocoties watershed in the Venezuelan Andes has experienced an intense process of land-use change, with natural forests being replaced by "sun grown coffee" (Coffea arabica) monocultures in sites of high slope, increasing risk conditions and the vulnerability of people living in lower parts of the watershed. Using a local-scale approach, 37 productive units (10% of total) in the San Isidro micro-watershed (51.85 km(2)) were assessed in order to evaluate local socioeconomic conditions and perceptions of ecosystem services, and how both are affected by human activity. Almost 65% of residents work in small farms of less than 5 ha, while family ownership remains the most important form of management. A significant lack of financial support was detected, support which is required to improve coffee productivity and improve conservation practices. Severe soil loss was detected in 45% of the area, associated with cultivation on steep slopes and the use of chemical fertilizers. Agroforestry and tree planting are well-regarded, as locals tend to recognize soil protection and climate change mitigation as two of the most important ecosystem services. Using a small-scale forestry approach, it is believed that current land management could be greatly improved to: (1) progressively introduce tree cover into coffee monocultures; (2) restore degraded areas where forest cover is lost and (3) reduce deforestation. Recommended policies and actions include institutional strengthening, decentralization and the development of community-based forest enterprises. The general principles presented in this work could provide a preliminary basis for basin-wide land restoration.

TI  - Wildfires and carbon budget of certain seasonally dry forests in India
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Globally, the increasing fire events in addition to climate change due to the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) as well as other greenhouse gases exerts huge pressure on natural resources and their management. This phenomenon is more severe in the tropical region due to increasing population, urbanization, industrialization, existing pressures, and limiting conditions. In the present study, carbon (C) stock, carbon sequestration (C-seq), CO2 mitigation potential, C budget, and C flux of the seasonally dry forest ecosystem of Chhattisgarh under the influence of wildfire in the protected area and its proximity were evaluated. Four sites namely, high fire zone (HFZ), medium fire zone (MFZ), low fire zone (LFZ), and non-fire zone (NFZ) were selected and marked based on fire return intervals (frequency) and extent of damage. The present work is a novel approach that assesses the impact of different fire frequencies on C dynamics of fire-affected zones. The stratified sampling technique was used within a permanent plot of 1 hectare. Forest stands on each site were analyzed using 10 randomly placed quadrats (each 10 x 10 m in size) and data were collected from each site. Across the sites higher tree density was observed at NFZ and the lowest at HFZ.Total tree biomass ranged between 116.0 and 358.4 t ha(-1) across the fire regimes. Total vegetation C stock ranged between 59.1 and 169.5 t ha-1 in different sites. The C mitigation and C-seq potential ranged between 186.2 and 575.3 t ha(-1), and 7.1 and 15.9 t ha(-1), respectively being highest in NFZ and lowest in HFZ. The species such as Anogeissus latifolia, Buchanania lanzan, Shorea robusta, Lannea coromandelica, Lagerstroemia parviflora, Ougeinia oojeinensis, Terminalia chebula, Terminalia tomentosa are the major contributor in biomass, C stock, C mitigation, and Cseq potential in different fire regimes. Thus, our findings would be highly useful in the restoration process of fire-affected zones through the plantation of selective plant species. Therefore, the aforementioned species could be effectively utilized while going for an afforestation/reforestation program, and will be helpful in climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies under different fire zones.

TI  - Efficiency of different planted forests in recovering biodiversity and ecological interactions in Brazilian Amazon
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - In tropical forests, several reforestation programs have been created to recover biological diversity in deforested environments. However, most of these studies have focused on the loss of species and ignored the loss of ecological interactions and ecosystem services that these species provide in their natural environment. Here, we assess how reforestation (including both native and exotic species) and the distance from the forest matrix could recover the following parameters: richness, composition, and ant-plant interactions in the southern Brazilian Amazon. For this, we collected data in five different agroforestry landscapes: primary and secondary forests, reforestations of teak and fig, and pasture. In general, we observed that the distance from the forest matrix was not an important factor for the recovery of ant-plant interactions at the scale of this study. Ant plant interactions were more specialized in the pasture, possibly due to the low richness and high dominance in pastures, which generates a high ant-plant dependency. Moreover, none of the strategies employed for the recovery of diversity (teak and fig reforestation) increased the recovery rate of the studied parameters: richness, composition, and the patterns of ant plant interactions, when compared to primary forests. These results indicate that regardless of species richness and composition, secondary forests and reforestation lands are functionally different from pastures. In conclusion, our results represent a valuable tool to conservation planners, mainly because we show that secondary forests created by natural regeneration can be an efficient and economical method for restoring the disruption of ant plant interactions in tropical forests.

TI  - Remotely sensed vegetation greening along a restoration gradient of a tropical forest, Kibale National Park, Uganda
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Restoration has now emerged as a global priority, with international initiatives such as the "UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030)". To fulfill the large-scale global restoration ambitions, an essential step is the monitoring of vegetation recovery after restoration interventions. This study aimed to evaluate the utility of remotely sensed vegetation indices, using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), to monitor the progress of forest regeneration across a tropical forest restoration project area in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Using the chronosequence approach, results indicated non-linear patterns in NDVI and EVI across the first 25 years of recovery. Both NDVI and EVI increased for the first 10 years of forest regeneration. This 'greening' phase could be used as the indicator of the successful onset of forest recovery. In particular, the decline of elephant grass, and the consequent arrival of shrubs and trees, can be detected as an increase in NDVI. Primary forests differed from the 25-year-old regenerating forests based on the unique combination of low mean and low seasonal variation in EVI. Our results, therefore, suggest that the long-term success of forest restoration could be monitored by evaluating how closely the combination of mean, and degree of seasonal variation in EVI, resembles that observed in the primary forest.

TI  - Predicting pan-tropical climate change induced forest stock gains and losses-implications for REDD
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Deforestation is a major threat to tropical forests worldwide, contributing up to one-fifth of global carbon emissions into the atmosphere. Despite protection efforts, deforestation of tropical forests has continued in recent years. Providing incentives to reducing deforestation has been proposed in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Bali negotiations in 2007 to decelerate emissions from deforestation (REDD-reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation). A number of methodological issues such as ensuring permanence, establishing reference emissions levels that do not reward business-as-usual and having a measuring, reporting and verification system in place are essential elements in implementing successful REDD schemes. To assess the combined impacts of climate and land-use change on tropical forest carbon stocks in the 21st century, we use a dynamic global vegetation model (LPJ DGVM) driven by five different climate change projections under a given greenhouse gas emission scenario (SRES A2) and two contrasting land-use change scenarios. We find that even under a complete stop of deforestation after the period of the Kyoto Protocol (post-2012) some countries may continue to lose carbon stocks due to climate change. Especially at risk is tropical Latin America, although the presence and magnitude of the risk depends on the climate change scenario. By contrast, strong protection of forests could increase carbon uptake in many tropical countries, due to CO2 fertilization effects, even under altered climate regimes.

TI  - Tropical forest birds after 20 years of the establishment of a reservoir: Extinction, colonization, and recolonization events
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Reservoirs are fundamental for human well-being but can cause landscape changes (e.g., habitat fragmentation and loss), altering biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, we know little about reservoir long-term effects on bird communities of tropical rainforests at different temporal scales. We assessed species richness and composition changes in four consecutive periods in a reservoir area in the Colombian Tropical Andes. After 20 years of monitoring avifauna within the reservoir, we recorded 360 bird species along with 47 local extinction and 184 colonization events. We found that species richness increased by 42% during the first 11 years after reservoir establishment. After that, changes in species bird composition were largely explained by species turnover. Eighty-two percent of the expected species in the region were recorded within the reservoir area. Also, forests surrounding the reservoir are a habitat for several threatened bird species. Bird community changes observed can be explained by secondary succession, changes in vegetation cover (i.e., increase in forest area), the transformation of aquatic ecosystems, forest protection, and restoration programs focused on biodiversity conservation. Long-term systematic bird sampling in tropical forests is key to understanding biodiversity dynamics and the effectiveness of conservation actions.

TI  - Impacts of fire and prospects for recovery in a tropical peat forest ecosystem
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Uncontrolled fires place considerable burdens on forest ecosystems, compromising our ability to meet conservation and restoration goals. A poor understanding of the impacts of fire on ecosystems and their biodiversity exacerbates this challenge, particularly in tropical regions where few studies have applied consistent analytical techniques to examine a broad range of ecological impacts over multiyear time frames. We compiled 16 y of data on ecosystem properties (17 variables) and biodiversity (21 variables) from a tropical peatland in Indonesia to assess fire impacts and infer the potential for recovery. Burned forest experienced altered structural and microclimatic conditions, resulting in a proliferation of nonforest vegetation and erosion of forest ecosystem properties and biodiversity. Compared to unburned forest, habitat structure, tree density, and canopy cover deteriorated by 58 to 98%, while declines in species diversity and abundance were most pronounced for trees, damselflies, and butterflies, particularly for forest specialist species. Tracking ecosystem property and biodiversity datasets over time revealed most to be sensitive to recurrent high - intensity fires within the wider landscape. These megafires immediately compromised water quality and tree reproductive phenology, crashing commercially valuable fish populations within 3 mo and driving a gradual decline in threatened vertebrates over 9 mo. Burned forest remained structurally compromised long after a burn event, but vegetation showed some signs of recovery over a 12 - y period. Our findings demonstrate that, if left uncontrolled, fire may be a pervasive threat to the ecological functioning of tropical forests, underscoring the importance of fire prevention and long - term restoration efforts, as exemplified in Indonesia.

AB  - Reducing atmospheric CO2 is an international priority. One way to assist stabilising and reducing CO2 is to promote secondary tropical forest regrowth on abandoned agricultural land. However, relationships between above- and belowground carbon stocks with secondary forest age and specific soil nutrients remain unclear. Current global estimates for CO2 uptake and sequestration in secondary tropical forests focus on aboveground biomass and are parameterised using relatively coarse metrics of soil fertility. Here, we estimate total carbon stocks across a chronosequence of regenerating secondary forest stands (40-120 years old) in Panama, and assess the relationships between both above- and belowground carbon stocks with stand age and specific soil nutrients. We estimated carbon stocks in aboveground biomass, necromass, root biomass, and soil. We found that the two largest carbon pools - aboveground biomass and soil - have distinct relationships with stand age and soil fertility. Aboveground biomass contained similar to 61-97 Mg C ha(-1) (24-39% total carbon stocks) and significantly increased with stand age, but showed no relationship with soil nutrients. Soil carbon stocks contained similar to 128-206 Mg C ha(-1) (52-70% total stocks) and were unrelated to stand age, but were positively related to soil nitrogen. Root biomass carbon stocks tracked patterns exhibited by aboveground biomass. Necromass carbon stocks did not increase with stand age, but stocks were held in larger pieces of deadwood in older stands. Comparing our estimates to published data from younger and older secondary forests in the surrounding landscape, weshowthat soil carbon recovers within 40 years of forest regeneration, but aboveground biomass carbon stocks continue to increase past 100 years. Above- and belowground carbon stocks appear to be decoupled in secondary tropical forests. Paired measures of above- and belowground carbon stocks are necessary to reduce uncertainty in large-scale models of atmospheric CO2 uptake and storage by secondary forests. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Emerging Evidence on the Effectiveness of Tropical Forest Conservation
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The PLOS ONE Collection "Measuring forest conservation effectiveness" brings together a series of studies that evaluate the effectiveness of tropical forest conservation policies and programs with the goal of measuring conservation success and associated co-benefits. This overview piece describes the geographic and methodological scope of these studies, as well as the policy instruments covered in the Collection as of June 2016. Focusing on forest cover change, we systematically compare the conservation effects estimated by the studies and discuss them in the light of previous findings in the literature. Nine studies estimated that annual conservation impacts on forest cover were below one percent, with two exceptions in Mexico and Indonesia. Differences in effect sizes are not only driven by the choice of conservation measures. One key lesson from the studies is the need to move beyond the current scientific focus of estimating average effects of undifferentiated conservation programs. The specific elements of the program design and the implementation context are equally important factors for understanding the effectiveness of conservation programs. Particularly critical will be a better understanding of the causal mechanisms through which conservation programs have impacts. To achieve this understanding we need advances in both theory and methods.

TI  - How Changes in Legally Demanded Forest Restoration Impact Ecosystem Services: A Case Study in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - The recent change in Brazilian laws reduced the amount of area that is set aside for native vegetation restoration in rural private properties. However, we lack estimates of its impacts on the provisioning of key ecosystem services at local scales. Therefore, in a microwatershed in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest hot spot, we quantified the impact of the change from the Forest Code (1965) to the Native Vegetation Protection Law in Brazil (2012) on future native forest cover, biomass carbon stocks, and soil loss and sedimentation. We analyzed three scenarios: (a) the land use and cover as of 2016, (b) the Forest Code, 1965, and (c) the Native Vegetation Protection Law, 2012. In each scenario, we modeled soil loss and sedimentation (InVEST, Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) and calculated the carbon stocks. The 2012 law implementation would increase forest cover (15.6%), decrease soil sedimentation (1.12%) and loss (1.13%), and increase carbon stock (5.4%). However, compared to the Forest Code, it would reduce the area for restoration and the potential for native forest cover growth, increase soil loss and sedimentation potential, and limit increases in carbon stocks at the landscape level. In both restoration scenarios, the potential percent increase in forest cover in the microwatershed owing to the laws is higher than the percent decrease in soil loss and sedimentation. These findings have the potential to elucidate the effect of laws on ecosystem services and be useful to those planning the creation, modification, and implementation of laws for forest restoration in private properties.

TI  - Above-Ground Biomass and Tree Species Diversity in the Anap Sustainable Development Unit, Sarawak
T2  - ANTHROPOGENIC TROPICAL FORESTS: HUMAN-NATURE INTERFACES ON THE PLANTATION FRONTIER
AB  - With rapid deforestation and forest degradation ongoing in tropical regions, the maintenance of biodiversity and high biomass/carbon stocks can bring additional benefits to the sustainable management of natural forests along with sustainable timber production. However, the measures for improving the maintenance of biodiversity and high biomass are not well evaluated. For this study, we established vegetation plots in the Anap Sustainable Development Unit (ASDU) in Bintulu, Sarawak, including the Anap-Muput Forest Management Unit (AMFMU), in order to investigate the distribution of above-ground biomass and tree species diversity. Using a Landsat image, we mapped the distribution of above-ground biomass all over the ASDU as of 2009. This distribution of above-ground biomass inside the AMFMU was not well correlated with the time that had elapsed since the last cycle of logging. The topography of the area may in fact be a more important factor. In total, 986 tree species were recorded in 70 plots (covering 8.3 ha in total). The species richness was not obviously different between recently harvested forests and primary forests, demonstrating that it is not severely affected by logging activity. As the above-ground biomass and tree species richness cannot be predicted by the years after harvesting alone, adaptive management with continuous monitoring is necessary to maintain the benefits of sustainable forest management.

TI  - Tropical forest conservation: Attitudes and preferences
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper applies contingent valuation to assess public awareness of tropical deforestation, to investigate the willingness to pay (WTP) to conserve tropical forests, and to determine the impact of the payment vehicle on the stated WTP of a sample of about 500 individuals in Geneva, Switzerland. About 3/4 of respondents state that they have already heard about tropical deforestation and biodiversity. People rank carbon storage as the most important contribution of tropical forests, followed by biodiversity and support to local communities. The mean stated WTP is about CHF 110.- per year. All other things being equal, the stated WTP is about 24% higher for a tax payment vehicle compared to a voluntary payment. Education and income have a positive impact on WTP. WTP is also higher when the respondents judge that the main contribution of tropical forests is towards biodiversity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ethnobotany, rattan agroforestry, and conservation of ecosystem services in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Rattan agroforestry is an important land use system in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, providing a wide range of products for subsistence communities. The ethnobotanical importance of rattan includes heritage values reflecting traditional ecological knowledge. This traditional forestry practice is consistent with necessary conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services currently threatened by expansion of oil palm plantations. We examined species composition and morphology (including life stages) of vegetation associated with rattan agroforests in the Katingan district, Central Kalimantan. An examination of harvested rattan plots revealed 101 species of vegetation of which 90% are considered to be useful (food, construction materials, medicines) and most (97%) were native species, typical of lowland tropical forest vegetation. Vegetation in the rattan agroforests was dominated by trees (in terms of species richness). There were 80 species of trees, representing 79% of the plants surveyed. Vitex pubescens (kaluan) had the highest importance value as it occupied more space, was represented by more individuals and was most frequently found in rattan gardens. These trees in general have a relatively open canopy with strong branches; properties considered ideal to support rattan. Canopy forming species are actively managed to provide for growth of useful understory vegetation (including rattan) important in the livelihoods of village communities. Rattan agroforests also provide cultural services reflecting traditional use (e.g. a sense of belonging and ancestral linkages for local forest-dependent communities). The importance of ethnobotanical approaches to rattan cultivation includes the socio-economic evaluation of land use and the promotion of sustainable land use policies in Indonesia. This is important in the context of oil palm expansion which has a demonstrably adverse impact on ecosystem services.

TI  - Temporal and environmental correlates of carbon stocks in a regenerating tropical forest
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
AB  - Questions Carbon dynamics in tropical forests is influenced by a variety of biotic and abiotic factors that act over temporal and spatial scales. At the local scale, carbon stock and dynamics can be determined by the environment and ecosystem diversity. Also, during forest regeneration, which is a temporal process, it is expected that those factors that influence carbon also change over time. Here we examine how carbon stock and dynamics are influenced by forest age, environment and functional diversity during forest regeneration. Using the relative effects of the different drivers of carbon dynamics, we attempt to discern the mechanisms (mass effect or niche complementarity) that explain those processes.
   Location We carried out this study in Atlantic Forest of different ages during natural regeneration in southern Brazil.
   Methods We measured environmental characteristics (soil physical and chemical attributes and canopy openness), estimated functional diversity and above-ground carbon and its dynamics over time. We examined univariate and multivariate predictors of carbon stock and dynamics using structural equation models.
   Results We found that age had the strongest influence on carbon stock, while environmental characteristics, functional and taxonomic diversities were much less important or unimportant. Our results suggest that the influence of time on tropical forest carbon dynamics overlaps and outweighs the effects due to environmental limits and mechanisms mediated by diversity (mass effects, niche complementarity).
   Conclusions Natural regeneration can be an effective strategy for restoring carbon sequestration and methods that use manipulation of regenerating forests with the hope of improving the process are unlikely to bring additional advantage in terms of carbon sequestration.

TI  - Ecological responses to El Nino-induced surface fires in central Brazilian Amazonia: management implications for flammable tropical forests
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
CP  - Annual Meeting of the Association-for-Tropical-Biology-and -Conservation
AB  - Over the past 20 years the combined effects of El Nino-induced droughts and land-use change have dramatically increased the frequency of fire in humid tropical forests. Despite the potential for rapid ecosystem alteration and the current prevalence of wildfire disturbance, the consequences of such fires for tropical forest biodiversity remain poorly understood. We provide a pan-tropical review of the current state of knowledge of these fires, and include data from a study in a seasonally dry terra firme forest of central Brazilian Amazonia. Overall, this study supports predictions that rates of tree mortality and changes in forest structure are strongly linked to burn severity. The potential consequences for biomass loss and carbon emissions are explored. Despite the paucity of data on faunal responses to tropical forest fires, some trends are becoming apparent; for example, large canopy frugivores and understorey insectivorous birds appear to be highly sensitive to changes in forest structure and composition during the first 3 years after fires. Finally, we appraise the management implications of fires and evaluate the viability of techniques and legislation that can be used to reduce forest flammability, prevent anthropogenic ignition sources from coming into contact with flammable forests and aid the post-fire recovery process.

TI  - The potential ecological costs and cobenefits of REDD: a critical review and case study from the Amazon region
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - The United Nations climate treaty may soon include a mechanism for compensating tropical nations that succeed in reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, source of nearly one fifth of global carbon emissions. We review the potential for this mechanism [reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD)] to provoke ecological damages and promote ecological cobenefits. Nations could potentially participate in REDD by slowing clear-cutting of mature tropical forest, slowing or decreasing the impact of selective logging, promoting forest regeneration and restoration, and expanding tree plantations. REDD could also foster efforts to reduce the incidence of forest fire. Potential ecological costs include the accelerated loss (through displaced agricultural expansion) of low-biomass, high-conservation-value ecosystems, and substitution of low-biomass vegetation by monoculture tree plantations. These costs could be avoided through measures that protect low-biomass native ecosystems. Substantial ecological cobenefits should be conferred under most circumstances, and include the maintenance or restoration of (1) watershed functions, (2) local and regional climate regimes, (3) soils and biogeochemical processes, (4) water quality and aquatic habitat, and (5) terrestrial habitat. Some tools already being developed to monitor, report and verify (MRV) carbon emissions performance can also be used to measure other elements of ecosystem function, making development of MRV systems for ecological cobenefits a concrete possibility. Analysis of possible REDD program interventions in a large-scale Amazon landscape indicates that even modest flows of forest carbon funding can provide substantial cobenefits for aquatic ecosystems, but that the functional integrity of the landscape's myriad small watersheds would be best protected under a more even spatial distribution of forests. Because of its focus on an ecosystem service with global benefits, REDD could access a large pool of global stakeholders willing to pay to maintain carbon in forests, thereby providing a potential cascade of ecosystem services to local stakeholders who would otherwise be unable to afford them.

TI  - Termite assemblage collapse along a land-use intensification gradient in lowland central Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Termites are major decomposers in tropical regions and play an important role in soil processes. This study measured the impact of land-use intensification on the termite assemblage of lowland rain forest in Jambi Province, on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Termite composition was assessed in seven land-use types along a disturbance gradient, from primary forest, through different silvicultural systems, to grassland and cultivated land without trees. A range of environmental variables was also measured.
   2. Termite species richness and relative abundance declined as follows: primary forest > selectively logged forest > mature 'jungle rubber' (a diverse agro-forest dominated by rubber trees) > mature rubber plantation > young Paraserianthes falcataria plantation (a softwood tree) > Imperata cylindrica grassland > cassava garden. Termite richness fell from 34 species in the primary forest to one species in the cassava garden. The relative abundance of soil-feeding termites showed a significantly greater decline along the gradient than did wood-feeding termites.
   3. Of the environmental variables, woody plant basal area was most strongly correlated with termite species richness (r = 0.973) and relative abundance (r = 0.980). This reflects the response of forest-adapted termites to progressive simplification of the physical structure of the habitat, resulting in the reduction of canopy cover and alteration in microclimate, and the loss of feeding and nesting sites.
   4. Synthesis and applications . Comparisons with other studies show that the decline in termite species richness and relative abundance seen at Jambi is a general trend that occurs elsewhere when forests are converted to other land uses. To help mitigate the loss of termites when forests are disturbed, we recommend the following management practices: the use of reduced-impact logging techniques, maximizing forest patch size and connectivity, minimizing length of forest edges, and leaving dead wood to decay in situ .

TI  - Conditions associated with protected area success in conservation and poverty reduction
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Protected areas are the dominant approach to protecting biodiversity and the supply of ecosystem services. Because these protected areas are often placed in regions with widespread poverty and because they can limit agricultural development and exploitation of natural resources, concerns have been raised about their potential to create or reinforce poverty traps. Previous studies suggest that the protected area systems in Costa Rica and Thailand, on average, reduced deforestation and alleviated poverty. We examine these results in more detail by characterizing the heterogeneity of responses to protection conditional on observable characteristics. We find no evidence that protected areas trap historically poorer areas in poverty. In fact, we find that poorer areas at baseline seem to have the greatest levels of poverty reduction as a result of protection. However, we do find that the spatial characteristics associated with the most poverty alleviation are not necessarily the characteristics associated with the most avoided deforestation. We show how an understanding of these spatially heterogeneous responses to protection can be used to generate suitability maps that identify locations in which both environmental and poverty alleviation goals are most likely to be achieved.

TI  - Successional changes in vegetation and litter structure in traditional Lacandon Maya agroforests
T2  - AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - The Lacandon Maya is an indigenous group who live in Chiapas, Mexico. Their traditional lifeways involve swidden, sequential agroforestry management that mimics ecological disturbance and modifies succession. Lacandon farmers use fire to clear small plots for polyculture milpa agroforests, which they subsequently fallow. They actively manage all stages of their agroforests to provide ecosystem services and facilitate site recovery. However, it is unclear whether or how quickly the ecosystem structure of Lacandon agroforests matches that of a mature forest. Therefore, this study quantified canopy cover, basal area, ground cover, and litter layers and depth to empirically evaluate successional trends in vegetation and litter structure. Our results show that the Lacandon agroforest structure typically recovers to mature forest levels, but the speed and nature of this recovery vary by metric. They also indicate Lacandon traditional agroforestry is predicated on nuanced understanding of tropical forest successional dynamics, as illustrated by Lacandon farmers' recognition of successional stages that correspond to patterns in vegetation and leaf litter structure. As such, Lacandon ecological knowledge has the potential to facilitate the restoration of degraded tropical forests in Chiapas, Mexico. However, our findings also demonstrate that shortening fallow periods will undermine the ecological integrity of this traditional agricultural system.

TI  - Successional dynamics of nitrogen fixation and forest growth in regenerating Costa Rican rainforests
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Regenerating tropical forests have an immense capacity to capture carbon and harbor biodiversity. The recuperation of the nitrogen cycle following disturbance can fuel biomass regeneration, but few studies have evaluated the successional dynamics of nitrogen and nitrogen inputs in tropical forests. We assessed symbiotic and asymbiotic nitrogen fixation, soil inorganic nitrogen concentrations, and tree growth in a well-studied series of five tropical forest plots ranging from 19 yr in age to old-growth forests. Wet-season soil inorganic nitrogen concentrations were high in all plots, peaking in the 29-yr-old plot. Inputs from symbiotic nitrogen fixation declined through succession, while asymbiotic nitrogen fixation peaked in the 37-yr-old plot. Consequently, the dominant nitrogen fixation input switched from symbiotic fixation in the younger plots to asymbiotic fixation in the older plots. Tree growth was highest in the youngest plots and declined through succession. Interestingly, symbiotic nitrogen fixation was negatively correlated with the basal area of nitrogen-fixing trees across our study plots, highlighting the danger in using nitrogen-fixing trees as a proxy for rates of symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Our results demonstrate that the nitrogen cycle has largely recuperated by 19 yr following disturbance, allowing for rapid biomass regeneration at our site. This work provides important insight into the sources and dynamics of nitrogen that support growth and carbon capture in regenerating Neotropical forests.

TI  - Ecological Structure of a Tropical Urban Forest in the Bang Kachao Peninsula, Bangkok
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Rapid urbanization has changed the structure and function of natural ecosystems, especially floodplain ecosystems in SE Asia. The ecological structure of vegetation stands and the usefulness of satellite images was investigated to characterize a disturbed tropical urban forest located in the Chao Phraya River lower floodplain, Thailand. Nine sample plots were established on the Bang Kachao Peninsula (BKP) within 4 tropical forest types in an urban area: rehabilitation forest, home-garden agroforestry, mangrove and park. The tree habitats were beach forest, swamp forest, moist evergreen forest, dry evergreen forest, mangrove forest and abandoned orchard or home-garden. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values obtained from Landsat 7 satellite images were correlated with plant structure from field surveys. NDVI had the highest relationship with stand factors for number of families, number of species, Shannon-Weiner index and total basal area. Linear regression predicted well the correlation between NDVI and stand factors for families and basal area. NDVI trends reflected urban tropical forest typing and biodiversity, being high in rehabilitation and mangrove forests, moderate in home-gardens and low in parks. We suggest that the application of NDVI for assessments can be useful for future planning, monitoring and management of the BKP and hence may contribute for increasing biodiversity and complexity of these urban forests.

TI  - An Operational Framework for Defining and Monitoring Forest Degradation
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - Forest degradation is broadly defined as a reduction in the capacity of a forest to produce ecosystem services such as carbon storage and wood products as a result of anthropogenic and environmental changes. The main causes of degradation include unsustainable logging, agriculture, invasive species, fire, fuelwood gathering, and livestock grazing. Forest degradation is widespread and has become an important consideration in global policy processes that deal with biodiversity, climate change, and forest management. There is, however, no generally recognized way to identify a degraded forest because perceptions of forest degradation vary depending on the cause, the particular goods or services of interest, and the temporal and spatial scales considered. Here, we suggest that there are types of forest degradation that produce a continuum of decline in provision of ecosystem services, from those in primary forests through various forms of managed forests to deforestation. Forest degradation must be measured against a desired baseline condition, and the types of degradation can be represented using five criteria that relate to the drivers of degradation, loss of ecosystem services and sustainable management, including: productivity, biodiversity, unusual disturbances, protective functions, and carbon storage. These criteria are not meant to be equivalent and some might be considered more important than others, depending on the local forest management objectives. We propose a minimum subset of seven indicators for the five criteria that should be assessed to determine forest degradation under a sustainable ecosystem management regime. The indicators can be remotely sensed (although improving calibration requires ground work) and aggregated from stand to management unit or landscape levels and ultimately to sub-national and national scales.

TI  - The impact of multiple driving factors on forest ecosystem services in karst desertification control
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - In the fragile karst desertification ecosystem, forests are the providers of eco-multifunctionality. And the ecosystem service (ES) supply capacity of forests is directly or indirectly affected by various driving factors. The aim of this study is to explore the driving role of forest spatial structure, species diversity, and functional diversity on ecosystem services. In this study, four forest types, namely, broad-leaved monoculture forest (planted economic forest) (F1), broad-leaved mixed forest (F2), coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest (F3), and coniferous mixed forest (F4), were investigated in karst plateau mountain (KPM), karst plateau canyon (KPC), and karst mountain canyon (KMC) landforms. Variance analysis, correlation analysis and redundancy analysis were used to compare the differences of spatial structure, species diversity, functional diversity, and ES of different forest types and to clarify the driving role of spatial structure, species diversity, and functional diversity on ES. The results showed that the wood supply service of F3 was at least 4.27% higher than that of other forest types; carbon sequestration and oxygen release are at least 4.57 and 3.89% higher; the water holding capacity of litter and soil is higher by 6.24 and 2.26%, respectively; the soil OC, TN, TP, and TK were higher than 6.01, 1.22, 25.55, and 13.34%, respectively. The coniferous mixed forest and broadleaved mixed forest with a more complete spatial structure has a higher level of diversity, which can generate more wood and provide more soil nutrient sources, as well as stronger regulation capacity. Spatial structure affects plant productivity through interspecific relationships; soil fertility is restricted by the level of diversity; gas and water regulation are influenced by both spatial structure and diversity levels. There is a progressive driving relationship among spatial structure, diversity, and ES. In forest management, it is helpful to improve the forest ecosystem's functioning by adjusting the forest structure using close-to-natural management measures.

TI  - Multicriteria spatial model to prioritize degraded areas for landscape restoration through agroforestry
T2  - METHODSX
AB  - Reconciling the restoration of ecosystem services within agricultural landscapes is an effort that has been advancing within degraded areas restoration through agroforestry systems. However, to contribute to the effectiveness of these initiatives, it is essential to integrate landscape vulner-ability and local demands to better highlight in which areas the implementation of agroforestry systems should be prioritized. Thus, we developed a spatial hierarchization methodology as a de-cision support tool as an active strategy for agroecosystem restoration. The proposed method con-stitutes a spatial indicator of priority areas to guide agroforestry interventions, including resource allocation and public policies for payment for environmental services. The methodology consists of Multicriteria Decision Analysis implemented in GIS software by combining input datasets based on biophysical conditions, environmental and socioeconomic aspects, that integrated promotes an assessment of the environment fragility, the pressures and responses to land use dynamic; a strategy for landscape restoration and conservation of the natural habitats, and multiple specific scenarios for decision making regarding the agricultural and the local actors demands. The output of the model provides the spatial distribution of areas suitable for the implementation of agro-forestry systems, sorted into four priority levels (Low, Medium, High, and Extreme priority). The method is a promising tool proposal for territorial management and governance and subsidizes future research on the flows of ecosystem services.

TI  - Tree legume enhances livestock performance in a silvopasture system
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
AB  - Silvopastoral systems (SPSs) can increase overall productivity and long-term income due to the simultaneous production of trees, forage, and livestock. This 2-yr study evaluated animal performance and herbage responses in C-4-grass monoculture or in SPS in the subhumid tropical region of Brazil. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with three replications. Treatments were: Urochloa decumbens (Stapf.) R. Webster (Signalgrass) + Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth (SPS-mimosa), Signalgrass + Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth ex Walp (SPS-gliricidia), and signalgrass monoculture (SM). Response variables included herbage and livestock responses. Cattle were managed under continuous stocking with variable stocking rate. There was a treatment x month interaction for herbage mass. Green herbage accumulation rate ranged from 20 to 80 kg dry matter ha(-1) d(-1) across months, with SPS-mimosa presenting lower rates. Average daily gain was greater in SPS-gliricidia, followed by SM and SPS-mimosa (0.77, 0.56, and 0.23 kg d(-1), respectively), varying across months. Stocking rate ranged from 0.86 to 1.6 AU ha(-1). Total gain per area during the experimental period was greater for SPS-gliricidia (423 kg body weight [BW] ha(-1)), followed by signalgrass in monoculture (347 kg BW ha(-1)) and SPS-mimosa (50 kg BW ha(-1)). Silvopasture systems using signalgrass and gliricidia enhanced livestock gains compared with signalgrass in monoculture, and mimosa trees outcompeted signalgrass, reducing livestock gains. Silvopasture systems with tree legumes have the potential to provide numerous ecosystem services and to reduce the C footprint of livestock systems in the tropics; however, the choice of tree species is key and is determined by which ecosystem service is prioritized.

TI  - Tailor-made biochar systems: Interdisciplinary evaluations of ecosystem services and farmer livelihoods in tropical agro-ecosystems
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Organic matter management is key to sustain ecosystem services provided by soils. However, it is rarely considered in a holistic view, considering local resources, agro-environmental effects and harmonization with farmers' needs. Organic inputs, like compost and biochar, could represent a sustainable solution to massive current challenges associated to the intensification of agriculture, in particular for tropical regions. Here we assess the potential of agricultural residues as a resource for farmer communities in southwestern India to reduce their dependency on external inputs and sustain ecosystem services. We propose a novel joint evaluation of farmers' aspirations together with agro-environmental effects of organic inputs on soils. Our soil quality evaluation showed that biochar alone or with compost did not improve unilaterally soils in the tropics (Anthroposol, Ferralsol and Vertisol). Many organic inputs led to an initial decrease in water-holding capacities of control soils (-27.3%: coconut shell biochar with compost on Anthroposol). Responses to organic matter inputs for carbon were strongest for Ferralsols (+33.4% with rice husk biochar), and mostly positive for Anthroposols and Vertisols (+12.5% to +13.8% respectively). Soil pH responses were surprisingly negative for Ferralsols and only positive if biochar was applied alone (between -5.6% to +1.9%). For Anthroposols and Vertisols, highest increases were achieved with rice husk biochar + vermicomposts (+7.2% and +5.2% respectively). Our socio-economic evaluation showed that farmers with a stronger economical position showed greater interest towards technology like biochar (factor 1.3 to 1.6 higher for farmers cultivating Anthroposols and/or Vertisols compared to Ferralsols), while poorer farmers more skepticism, which may lead to an increased economical gap within rural communities if technologies are not implemented with long-term guidance. These results advocate for an interdisciplinary evaluation of agricultural technology prior to its implementation as a development tool in the field.

TI  - Atlantic forest tree species responses to silvicultural practices in a degraded pasture restoration plantation: From leaf physiology to survival and initial growth
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Deforestation has led to ecosystem degradation in many tropical regions. Re-establishment of native tree species on degraded land presents challenges due to environmental stressors such as water and nutrient limitations, particularly from weed competition. Ecophysiological studies can help assess responses of native tree species to silvicultural practices and improve our understanding of processes that influence their establishment and growth. Silvicultural treatments borrowed from commercial tree plantations such as greater nutrient applications and complete weed control can improve best silvicultural practices in forest restoration. Two contrasting silvicultural treatments, "traditional" based on common management practices for reforestation of native trees and "intensive" based on commercial plantation silviculture, were evaluated based on tree mortality, biomass, photosynthesis, chlorophyll content, soluble proteins, and nutritional status of 20 native Brazilian species, 2.5 years after planting. Intensive silviculture increased tree survival by 20%, showed higher aboveground biomass from 13% to 7-fold and increased photosynthesis of similar to 20% from 15.8 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) to 18.7 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), compared to traditional silviculture. Total soluble proteins were 14% higher with 6.7 mu g cm(-2) in intensive silviculture compared to 5.9 mu g cm(-2) under traditional silviculture. Eighty percent of trees showed greater N content, with a 13% higher average than under traditional silviculture (2.60 g m(-2) versus 2.92 g m(-2)). Average values of chlorophyll A, B, and total were similar to 8% higher under intensive silviculture, but not significantly different between treatments. Overall, intensive silviculture provided a positive impact on the restoration plantation. During the initial years of plantation establishment, intensive silviculture methods were effective in leading to significant increases in growth and survival. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Responses of transplanted native tree species to invasive alien grass removals in an abandoned cattle pasture in the Lacandon region, Mexico
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - We tested the early performance of 16 native early-, mid-, and late-successional tree species in response to four intensities of grass removal in an abandoned cattle pasture dominated by the introduced, invasive African grass, Cynodon plectostachyus, within the Lacandon rainforest region, southeast Mexico. The increase in grass removals significantly improved the performance of many species, especially of early-and mid-successional species, while performance of late-successional species was relatively poor and did not differ significantly among treatments. Good site preparation and at least one additional grass removal four months after seedling transplant were found to be essential; additional grass removals led to improved significantly performance of saplings in most cases. In order to evaluate the potential of transplanting tree seedlings successfully in abandoned tropical pastures, we developed a "planting risk index", combining field performance measurements and plantation cost estimations. Our results showed a great potential for establishing restoration plantings with many early-and mid-successional species. Although planting risk of late-successional species was considered high, certain species showed some possibilities of acclimation after 18 months and should be considered in future plantation arrangements in view of their long-term contributions to biodiversity maintenance and also to human welfare through delivery of ecosystem services. Conducting a planting risk analysis can help avoid failure of restoration strategies involving simultaneous planting of early-, mid-, and late-successional tree species. This in turn will improve cost-effectiveness of initial interventions in large-scale, long-term restoration programs.

TI  - Exploring livelihood dependency on provisioning ecosystem services in a protected tropical forest area of eastern India: keys to sustainable forest management
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The tropical dry deciduous forest in eastern India is well-known for its numerous ecosystem services (ES), which contribute to the regional and national economies. However, a comprehensive evaluation of forest ES (FES) has not been performed in this region. Therefore, we endeavored to assess the provisioning FES (PFES) and the degree of dependence of the local people on it and identified the resource extraction techniques to access the desired goods and services. This study was conducted through a semi-structured questionnaire survey spanning 16 villages in the Medinipur forest division in Eastern India. The level of dependency was estimated through the pebble distribution scoring method and livelihood dependence index (LDI). The study documented 16 distinct PFES, of which 10 were the most commonly collected. Overall, our study revealed that the dependency was primarily salient on fuelwood, timber, fodder, and leaves throughout the study area. Additionally, significant differences in the dependence on PFES were established among the villages and a substantial dependency was observed majorly in the post-monsoon seasons. The primary strategies for extracting resources for gathering the required PFES were collection, lopping, and cutting along with unsustainable resource extraction practices like fire. Although there is a strong relationship between forests and livelihood, therefore, the notion of FES must be considered by environmental sustainability and human welfare and comprehend the connection underlying the notions of FES and livelihood, in the establishment of evidence-based policy. Thus, our study yields insights that are useful to policymakers in maintaining and enhancing the FES supply.

TI  - Afforestation and avoided deforestation in a multi-regional integrated assessment model
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - A model is developed to estimate the potential role, and spatial allocation, of afforestation and avoided deforestation in climate policy. The model extends the RICE-2010 model, a multi-regional integrated assessment model of the climate and the economy. Incorporating these forest strategies in global climate policy is important, especially under stringent temperature targets. Under a 2 degrees C temperature target, emission reductions from avoided deforestation quickly achieve their full potential, whereas afforestation is capable of substantially reducing emissions in both the medium and long run. The analysis shows that the most significant reductions in emissions from avoided deforestation and afforestation can be achieved by focusing policy efforts on tropical forests.

TI  - Reducing natural vegetation loss in Amazonia critically depends on the formal recognition of indigenous lands
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - The Brazilian Amazon contains the world's largest tract of tropical forest, about 22 % of which is within demarcated indigenous territories. Formal governmental recognition of these traditional territories is often a critical deterrent to deforestation, but the relative conservation performance of Indigenous Lands (ILs) under different legal categories and geographic contexts remains poorly understood. We used 30-m resolution LANDSAT satellite imagery to quantitatively assess the land cover status and annual rates of natural vegetation loss be-tween 1985 and 2020 for 381 indigenous territories amounting to-115 million hectares. Using a comprehensive set of environmental and socio-economic covariates and a mixed-modelling approach, we found that all stages of formal IL recognition consistently inhibit natural vegetation loss throughout the Brazilian Amazon compared to adjacent unprotected areas. Formal physical demarcation and distance from roads were the main proximate drivers of avoided natural vegetation loss inside ILs. Forest loss associated with road access is substantially curbed by ILs, showing the importance of frontier expansion when assessing indigenous reserve performance in counteracting natural vegetation loss. Because loss of natural forest and savannah areas associated with agri-business frontiers and infrastructure projects are likely to intensify, the importance of ecosystem services pro-vided by ILs is expected to increase across the Brazilian Amazon. Cultural profile and human density exerted no impacts on IL effectiveness in precluding natural vegetation loss. Given widespread encroachment of timber extraction and agribusiness, formal recognition of indigenous territories is a critical factor in decelerating pri-mary habitat conversion across the Amazon.

TI  - A Critical Comparison of Conventional, Certified, and Community Management of Tropical Forests for Timber in Terms of Environmental, Economic, and Social Variables
T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
AB  - Tropical forests are crucial in terms of biodiversity and ecosystem services, but at the same time, they are major sources of revenue and provide livelihoods for forest-dependent people. Hopes for the simultaneous achievement of conservation goals and poverty alleviation are therefore increasingly placed on forests used for timber extraction. Most timber exploitation is carried out unsustainably, which causes forest degradation. Two important mechanisms have emerged to promote sustainable forest management: certification and community-based forest management (CFM). We synthesize the published information about how forest certification and CFM perform in terms of environmental, social, and economic variables. With the caveat that very few published studies meet the standards for formal impact evaluation, we found that certification has substantial environmental benefits, typically achieved at a cost of reduced short-term financial profit, and accompanied by some improvement to the welfare of neighboring communities. We found that the economic and environmental benefits of CFM are understudied, but that the social impacts are controversial, with both positive and negative changes reported. We identify the trade-offs that likely caused these conflicting results and that, if addressed, would help both CFM and certification deliver the hoped-for benefits.

TI  - Economical and ecological realization of Joint Forest Management (JFM) for sustainable rural livelihood: a case study
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - In India, Joint Forest Management (JFM) programme was first introduced in the year 1972 at Arabari forest range in West Bengal with the collaboration of local community and forest department for the protection of reserve forest and improvement of rural livelihood. Subsequently, in 1990 the JFM programme was further extended at nearby Bhadutola forest range of Paschim Medinipur (West Bengal, India). The evaluation of this programme with respect to ecological and economic indicators has not been done. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of JFM scheme in two sites and also assess the ecological impacts of such programs. Applying relevant research methods like focus group discussion (FGD), standard of living index (SLI), livelihood dependence index (LDI) and measurement of forest dependency, the effectiveness of JFM project has been assessed for the sustainable forest management. The ecological impacts were calculated using the value coefficient method through implied for ecosystem service functions. The results showed that the forest dwellers of Arabari forest range are getting more benefits like different non-timber forest products (NTFP) than Bhadutola forest range community. It is stated that around 85% respondents are highly satisfied with the implementation of JFM project. In the recent years, the standard of living index (SLI) of almost sixteen villages under JFM project has been significantly improved. The ecological impact for both the forest ranges clearly shows a positive effect on the ecosystem service values through food production, raw materials, genetic resources, climatic regulation and soil erosion control strategies. The Arabari forest range has shown more positive changes in ecological services function than the Bhadutola forest range. Therefore, this model needs to be applied effectively in different vulnerable forest ranges of tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world for sustainable forest resource conservation as well as improvement of livelihood of forest dwellers.

TI  - Landscape conservation as a strategy for recovering biodiversity: Lessons from a long-term program of pasture restoration in the southern Atlantic Forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Although ecological restoration has entered the global agenda to reverse different anthropogenic disturbances, we still know little about how this solution interacts with other conservation strategies, to avoid the progressive loss of species and ecosystem services. Here we evaluate one of the pioneering restoration programs in the southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest, where the combination of conservation and restoration efforts has been carried out for 20 years. Specifically, we tested how landscape characteristics, restoration strategies and environmental characteristics affect the results of the restoration of pastures. We established 65 circular plots (total 4.0 ha) along restoration areas (3-10 years) and sampled trees and shrubs composing the canopy (DBH >= 5 cm) and understorey (DBH < 5 cm, height > 1.3 m). We analysed the landscape metrics (proportion of old-growth forests in 200, 500 and 1,000 m buffers around each plot; and area and distance of the nearest-neighbouring old-growth forests). We explored the multiple effects of landscape, restoration strategy (reforestation, natural regeneration) and environmental variables (soil, pasture grass types) on the species composition and multiple diversity metrics of restoration areas. The species composition was very similar among restoration ages and restoration strategies. We found positive and strong effects of old-growth forest (200 m buffer) proportion on the species richness and Shannon diversity (canopy and understorey), above-ground biomass (canopy) and functional diversity (understorey) of restoration areas. The restoration strategies affected forest structure, and, in general, the reforestation strategy increased above-ground biomass, Shannon, functional and phylogenetic diversities (in canopy), and percentage of endemic species and biomass (understorey), when compared to natural regeneration. The 20-year experience in the southern Atlantic Forest showed that programs focused on landscape conservation associated with a mixture of restoration strategies (i.e. natural regeneration in larger areas and active restoration in more disturbed sites), can be an efficient strategy to ensure biodiversity and ecosystem services in tropical landscapes. Synthesis and applications. To manage degraded tropical lands and achieve global targets for biodiversity and ecosystem services, it is necessary to first ensure the conservation of natural remnants and then use multiple restoration strategies in less resilient areas.

TI  - Leaf-cutting ants negatively impact the regeneration of the Caatinga dry forest across abandoned pastures
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - The mechanisms affecting forest regeneration in human-modified landscapes are attracting increasing attention as tropical forests have been recognized as key habitats for biodiversity conservation, provision of ecosystem services, and human well-being. Here we investigate the effect of the leaf-cutting ants (LCA) Atta opaciceps on regenerating plant assemblages in Caatinga dry forest. Our study encompassed 15 Atta opaciceps colonies located in landscape patches with a gradient of forest cover from 8.7% to 87.8%, where we monitored regenerating individuals (seedlings and saplings of woody and herbaceous plants) in different habitats (nests, foraging areas, and control areas) over one year. We recorded 2,977 regenerating plant individuals, distributed among 55 species from 23 families. Herbaceous plants represented 82.1% and 58.2% of the total number of individuals and species, respectively. Species richness of both the whole and herbaceous plant assemblages increased along the forest cover gradient, but without difference between the habitats. Total plant abundance was highest in control areas followed by foraging areas and nests and this pattern held for both woody and herbaceous plants. Although forest cover did not influence the abundance of herbaceous plants and the whole plant assemblage, it positively affects woody plant abundance across control areas. Forest cover and habitat changed species composition of both the entire regenerating and the herbaceous assemblages. These results together indicate that LCA negatively impact regenerating plant assemblages, particularly in those sites with increased forest cover. As LCA proliferate in human-modified landscapes, they may prevent plant regeneration of disturbed areas.

TI  - Divergent rates of change between tree cover types in a tropical pastoral region
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB  - ContextForest cover change analyses have revealed net forest gain in many tropical regions. While most analyses have focused solely on forest cover, trees outside forests are vital components of landscape integrity. Quantifying regional-scale patterns of tree cover change, including non-forest trees, could benefit forest and landscape restoration (FLR) efforts.ObjectivesWe analyzed tree cover change in Southwestern Panama to quantify: (1) patterns of change from 1998 to 2014, (2) differences in rates of change between forest and non-forest classes, and (3) the relative importance of social-ecological predictors of tree cover change between classes.MethodsWe digitized tree cover classes, including dispersed trees, live fences, riparian forest, and forest, in very high resolution images from 1998 to 2014. We then applied hurdle models to relate social-ecological predictors to the probability and amount of tree cover gain.ResultsAll tree cover classes increased in extent, but gains were highly variable between classes. Non-forest tree cover accounted for 21% of tree cover gains, while riparian trees constituted 31% of forest cover gains. Drivers of tree cover change varied widely between classes, with opposite impacts of some social-ecological predictors on non-forest and forest cover.ConclusionsWe demonstrate that key drivers of forest cover change, including topography, road distance and historical forest cover, do not explain rates of non-forest tree cover change. Consequently, predictions from medium-resolution forest cover change analyses may not apply to finer-scale patterns of tree cover. We highlight the opportunity for FLR projects to target tree cover classes adapted to local social and ecological conditions.

TI  - Growth responses of Tectona grandis plantations to local and global climatic conditions in the Peruvian Amazon
T2  - NATIVA
AB  - Tropical forests, crucial for climate regulation and biodiversity, face challenges due to deforestation and climate change. Tectona grandis, a species valued for its wood, is studied to assess its growth response to local and global climatic conditions in the Peruvian Amazon. Dendrochronological methods were used to analyze the growth rings of T. grandis at two study sites, considering variables such as precipitation and temperature. The results show that, although no significant relationship with local climate was found, the growth of T. grandis is influenced by sea surface temperature anomalies in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Specific correlation patterns were identified, suggesting that global climatic factors affect its development. The presence of false rings, influenced by environmental variations, highlights the complexity of interpreting growth data. This study contributes to the understanding of the growth dynamics of T. grandis and its potential for reforestation in tropical contexts, highlighting the importance of sustainable forest management that integrates global climatic factors.

TI  - Land use and land cover change, trade-offs, and synergies between ecosystem services in a dry Afromontane Forest
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
AB  - The role of tropical forests in satisfying various human demands is growing, leading to increasing conflicts, particularly between forest conservation and usage. This creates a challenge for forest managers and decision makers. While conservation mitigates global climate change, utilization is crucial for local subsistence. This competition often results in trade-off relationships between ecosystem services, which are exacerbated by land use change. In this context we studied the spatial and temporal land use and land cover change in the Desa'a forest, a dry Afromontane Forest in norther Ethiopia, from 1985 to 2020 and analyzed trade-off and synergy relationships between one provisioning (food supply) and two regulating ecosystem services (soil conservation, carbon storage) using ArcGIS Pro and R software. Dense forest, constituting 23% of the study area, remained constant throughout the study period. Farmland and bare land decreased by 3% and 13% respectively, while open forest, constituting more than 50% of the area, increased by 16%. The trade-off and synergy analysis revealed ecosystem services relationship fluctuations in the magnitude of the relationships during the studied period. In conclusion, our study has revealed that the trade-offs and synergies of ecosystem services display variations in their timing, geographical distribution, and intensity, much like the ecosystem services hubs and land use/land cover changes. These three interrelated aspects hold significant implications for management decisions and therefore, must be given due consideration. Our findings help in understanding ecosystem services dynamics and can support sustainable forest management and conservation strategies. Incorporating a temporal dimension to trade-off and synergy analyses can reveal how past decisions on the use of land and its resources impact today's ecosystem services and their interactions.

TI  - Shade-Grown Coffee in Colombia Benefits Soil Hydraulic Conductivity
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Secondary tropical forests and coffee agroforestry systems contain fewer trees than native forests but can positively impact soil hydrological functions, such as water infiltration compared to the pasture land that they replace. However, for both land uses it remains in how far the soil hydraulic characteristics are comparable to that of native forest. Therefore, we investigated the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) and some hydrophysical soil attributes in four land-use types: (i) a shade-grown coffee; (ii) a natural regenerated forest 15 years ago; (iii) a pasture; and (iv) a reference forest, in the municipality of La Jagua de Ibirico, Cesar department, Colombia. We determined historical land use and conducted soil sampling, using the Beerkan method to determine the K-s values. We also measured canopy cover, vegetation height, diameter at breast height and total number of trees in the forest covers. Our results indicate that K-s values were similar for the coffee and the reference forest, reflecting the positive effect of trees on soil hydrological functioning in agroforestry systems. Our results suggest that 15 years of forest regeneration after land abandonment in Sub-Andean Forest, can improve the soil hydraulic attributes. Additionally, soil water repellency was observed for the reference forest soil.

TI  - Biodiversity and Carbon Sequestration in Chakra-Type Agroforestry Systems and Humid Tropical Forests of the Ecuadorian Amazon
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Currently, there are several studies related to climate change, carbon sequestration, and floristic composition in different scenarios and land uses. In this context, the objective of this research is: (a) to characterize biodiversity based on ecological indicators and diversity indices and (b) to evaluate carbon sequestration in different components of chakra-type agroforestry systems and secondary tropical humid forests of the Ecuadorian Amazon. For this, temporary sampling plots of 1600 m2 are established on the properties to be investigated. The study found that the structural characteristics and floristic composition vary according to the forest arrangement and the management system. Secondary forests are the most diverse, according to the Shannon (3.49), Simpson (0.96), and Margaleft (9.34) diversity indices, in addition to having the largest carbon stores with 233 (Mg C ha-1), followed by agroforestry systems in association with timber trees (TAFS) and fruit trees (FAFS) with 97.8 and 95.1 (Mg C ha-1) respectively, and cocoa monoculture (CMC) with 90.4 (Mg C ha-1). These results demonstrate the importance of conserving the remnants of tropical forests that still remain, due to the diversity of species, ecosystem services, and the total carbon they contain, as well as the agroforestry systems (AFS), systems analogous to forests, which are gradually becoming important management systems, especially if they are associated with potential species to sequester carbon, such as those documented in this and several other studies that seek solutions to global climate change.

TI  - Patterns of biodiversity response along a gradient of forest use in Eastern Amazonia, Brazil
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - The preservation of tropical forests is increasingly at risk, including forests located within human-modified landscapes that retain high conservation value. People modify and interact with these landscapes through a wide range of uses. However, our knowledge of how different forest uses affect biodiversity is limited. Here, we analyse the responses of different taxa to four distinct categories of forest management, namely old-growth forest, Brazil nut extraction areas, reduced impact logging areas, and eucalyptus plantations. Within six independent replicates of each category, we sampled three taxa (fruit-feeding butterflies, dung beetles, and trees) in eastern Amazonia. Forests under moderate use (Brazil nut extraction and reduced-impact logging) had similar, albeit slightly lower, diversity levels relative to old-growth forests, while communities in plantations were significantly less diverse. Only 4%, 20%, and 17%, of the sampled butterfly, dung beetle, and tree species, respectively, were restricted to old-growth forests. This study provides further empirical evidence of the importance of old-growth forest conservation in the context of human-modified landscapes. It also suggests that landscape matrices integrating forest uses at varying intensities are well positioned to reconcile biodiversity conservation with the production of goods that support local livelihoods.

TI  - Decentralization, forests and livelihoods: Theory and narrative
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - This paper discusses the theory of decentralized forest management, the associated narrative and the underlying hypotheses. That discussion informs the assessment of whether decentralization can lead to forest conservation. The paper argues that the ideal model of democratic decentralization described in the literature is unlikely to be implemented given the governance constraints present in many tropical forest countries. Even if that model could be implemented, it is shown that decentralization cannot be expected to necessarily lead to forest conservation. The policies required to complement the current decentralization model are discussed, including financial incentives and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION IN MEXICO: INSIGHTS ON THE PROJECT PLANNING PHASE
T2  - BOTANICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Background: A deep discussion of the phases of planning by all stakeholders will help to identify the challenges faced by countries that are embarking on large-scale restoration actions to comply with international agreements.
   Question: Was the planning phase of restoration projects done according to international guidance? We evaluated six of the eight aspects of the international guidance for the planning phase of restoration projects carried out in Mexico between 1979 and 2016.
   Methods: The information about the restoration projects was compiled using a digital survey composed of 137 questions.
   Results: Seventy-five projects with a total area of 1,556,840 hectares were analyzed, mainly in temperate, humid, and deciduous forest. More projects measured the baseline with biotic than with abiotic variables, and social variables were seldom evaluated. Most projects aimed to recover biodiversity or ecosystem services, and they identified a reference ecosystem. Planned budgets included mainly field work.
   Conclusions: To promote the integration of ecological, social, and economic priorities, landscape restoration is suggested, since it is done at a scale which maximizes the benefits for nature and people. The inclusion of only field work in the budgets may decrease the total cost, but it may jeopardize project success due to poor planning. Careful and detailed planning of a national strategy constructed by all stakeholders that includes restoration of original ecosystems, agroforestry systems (which facilitate social participation and increase land productivity) and patches under natural succession, and investing in highly trained human resources will allow successful compliance with international restoration commitments.

TI  - Contribution of woody habitat islands to the conservation of birds and their potential ecosystem services in an extensive Colombian rangeland
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - In agricultural landscapes, patches of natural or semi-natural habitat are crucial for the survival of plant and animal populations, which in turn are essential to maintain ecosystem functioning. Species composition and diversity of trees and birds among woody habitat islands were compared in a Colombian rangeland to assess how habitat characteristics influence bird community composition, bird species traits and their potential ecosystem services. Bird and tree diversity was higher in gallery forest fragments compared to hedgerows and isolated tree islands within rangelands. Forest fragments shared over 50% of their bird and tree species with tree islands and hedgerows, yet communities differed markedly. Tree islands and hedgerows had relatively more endozoochorous and small-seeded tree species and hosted birds of forest, savanna and shrubland, while forest fragments had more synzoochorous and large-seeded tree species and primarily hosted forest birds. Hedges and tree islands contribute to the conservation of forest bird and tree biodiversity in rangeland, but gallery forests are essential for the conservation of less tolerant forest species. The savanna rangeland acts as an ecological filter between the gallery forests and the hedges and tree islands, which in turn facilitate the spillover of tolerant forest birds and their ecological functions, including tree seed dispersal, into the rangeland, and thus support regional forest conservation and restoration.

TI  - Insect diversity across an afro-tropical forest biodiversity hotspot
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
AB  - Tropical forests host a remarkable proportion of global arthropod diversity. Yet, arthropod communities living in tropical forests are still poorly studied, particularly for dry forests of Eastern Africa. The aim of this study was to analyse community structures, species richness and relative abundances of insects across a heterogeneous forest consisting of various forest types. We collected insects in the lower canopies with light traps across the Arabuko Sokoke forest, part of the East African coastal forest biodiversity hotspot in southeast Kenya. Sampling was conducted across three forest types and along the forest edge. In total we collected > 250,000 individuals. We grouped these individuals into orders, and beetles into (sub)families. Representatives of the taxonomically well-known beetle families Cerambycidae, Tenebrionidae and Scolytinae were further determined to species level. We subsequently classified these groups into guilds according to their ecological requirements and life-histories. Relative abundances of arthropods strongly differed among taxonomic groups and forest types. Evenness was highest in the heterogeneous natural Brachystegia forest type. The mixed forest type and the forest edges showed intermediate degrees of evenness, while the structurally homogenous Cynometra forest showed comparatively low degrees of evenness. Implications for insect conservation We found that taxonomic and guild compositions strongly differed among the forest types. Our findings reveal that structural heterogeneity of a forest is the major driver of insect diversity, community composition, and relative abundance. Our study underlines that the preservation of all three forest types is crucial to maintain the complete diversity of arthropods across all taxonomic groups.

TI  - CTFS-ForestGEO: a worldwide network monitoring forests in an era of global change
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Global change is impacting forests worldwide, threatening biodiversity and ecosystem services including climate regulation. Understanding how forests respond is critical to forest conservation and climate protection. This review describes an international network of 59 long-term forest dynamics research sites (CTFS-ForestGEO) useful for characterizing forest responses to global change. Within very large plots (median size 25ha), all stems 1cm diameter are identified to species, mapped, and regularly recensused according to standardized protocols. CTFS-ForestGEO spans 25 degrees S-61 degrees N latitude, is generally representative of the range of bioclimatic, edaphic, and topographic conditions experienced by forests worldwide, and is the only forest monitoring network that applies a standardized protocol to each of the world's major forest biomes. Supplementary standardized measurements at subsets of the sites provide additional information on plants, animals, and ecosystem and environmental variables. CTFS-ForestGEO sites are experiencing multifaceted anthropogenic global change pressures including warming (average 0.61 degrees C), changes in precipitation (up to +/- 30% change), atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and sulfur compounds (up to 3.8g Nm(-2)yr(-1) and 3.1g Sm(-2)yr(-1)), and forest fragmentation in the surrounding landscape (up to 88% reduced tree cover within 5km). The broad suite of measurements made at CTFS-ForestGEO sites makes it possible to investigate the complex ways in which global change is impacting forest dynamics. Ongoing research across the CTFS-ForestGEO network is yielding insights into how and why the forests are changing, and continued monitoring will provide vital contributions to understanding worldwide forest diversity and dynamics in an era of global change.

TI  - Deforestation and timber production in Congo after implementation of sustainable forest management policy
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Over 400 million hectares of tropical forests are managed for timber production, comprising more than half of the remaining global permanent tropical forest estate. A growing proportion of tropical production forests are managed under Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) principles. The objective of SFM is to achieve multiple benefits, including forest protection, biodiversity conservation and income enhancement. However, the outcomes resulting from the implementation of SFM in tropical forest ecosystems have seldom been examined rigorously. In this paper, we present a methodological approach to assess broad-scale impacts of SFM policy in tropical forest ecosystems. As a case study, we investigated deforestation and timber production in logging concessions in the Republic of Congo after the implementation of its SFM-based forestry law in 2000. Compliance with the forestry law was incomplete, allowing a unique opportunity to compare deforestation and legal timber production outcomes in concessions that implemented SFM-based policy compared to those that did not. Quasi-experimental matching analysis indicated that deforestation in matched parcels in compliant concessions was up to 2-times higher than matched parcels in non-compliant concessions, equivalent to 67 km(2) of forest loss for the period 2005-2010. Annual deforestation data demonstrated that deforestation was stable or increased in all six concessions following the respective date of compliance in each concession. Legal timber production increased (by 5%, from 0.18 to 0.19 CBM/ha/yr) and became more stable, in compliant compared to non-compliant concessions. Our results suggest that the presence of SFM in a concession does not immediately lead to less deforestation. Rather, SFM policy may be associated with higher deforestation, because SFM is also associated with higher legal timber production, foreign capital, and international timber demand. Our findings measure short-term associations between SFM and deforestation in the Congo, and underscore the need for empirical evaluation of long-term impacts of SFM in tropical forest ecosystems worldwide.

TI  - The importance of native trees for forest bird conservation in tropical farmland
T2  - ANIMAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Trees in farmland provide valuable ecosystem services that enhance agricultural productivity and income, as well as supporting biodiversity such as birds. A better understanding of the benefits of farmland trees for birds, specifically the relative value of native and exotic trees, is essential in developing effective management options, particularly within tropical regions with intense cultivation pressure. In farmland in central Uganda, neither total bird species richness nor richness of forest visitors (non-forest dependent) were related to any measures of tree cover, whereas richness of forest-dependent bird species showed a positive relationship with the number of native tree species. The density of 10 out of 17 forest-dependent bird species within farmland showed at least one significant relationship with measures of tree cover; variables relating to native trees typically had more, and stronger, positive effects on bird density than exotic trees. The combined density of 17 forest-dependent bird species on farmland was positively related to both the total number of native trees and number of large native trees. Increasing the density of forest-dependent bird species by 1 birdha-1 within a farmland site is predicted to require c. one to two large native trees, or c. 30 native trees of all sizes, per ha. Despite comprising c. 40% of all trees, exotics exerted little positive influence on forest birds, possibly because these offer poorer resources in terms of foraging, nesting and shelter. While numerous previous studies in the tropics have considered the value, for birds, of tree cover in farmland, few have focused on tree size or species composition. This study suggests that the retention or planting of native trees is an important tool for conserving forest birds within farmland, will provide additional ecosystem services, and should be encouraged through, for example, agricultural development schemes, extension advice and demonstration farms.

TI  - Payments for Pioneers? Revisiting the Role of External Rewards for Sustainable Innovation under Heterogeneous Motivations
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Acknowledging the diversity of preferences, goals and motivations of individuals is key to promote the effectiveness of incentive-based conservation interventions. This paper analyses the heterogeneity of motivations to adopt silvopastoral practices, a social-ecological innovation for soil conservation and carbon emission reduction. We use Qmethodology to identify smallholders' views with regard to these practices in a community in the forest frontier in Chiapas (Mexico). The analysis uncovers three main perspectives: self-sufficient pioneers, environmentally-conscious followers and payment-dependent conservatives. We discuss these perspectives around three topics: smallholders' predisposition to adopt silvopastoral practices, their views about needing external payments to sustain their livelihood and the diffusion of innovative sustainable practices. We relate these perspectives with livelihood characteristics and with observed adoption levels under a pilot programme to promote silvopasture. Our findings suggest that incentives other than payments may be more appropriate for those more likely to adopt, and that payments could encourage rent-seeking strategies and not necessarily promote permanent behavioural change. We suggest ways for designing more effective and adaptive environmental conservation programmes to foster adoption and continuation of social-ecological innovations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Post-fire forest restoration in the humid tropics: A synthesis of available strategies and knowledge gaps for effective restoration
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Humid tropical forests are increasingly exposed to devastating wildfires. Major efforts are needed to prevent fire-related tipping points and to enable the effective recovery of fire-affected areas. Here, we provide a synthesis of the most common forest restoration strategies, thereby focusing on post-fire forest dynamics in the humid tropics. A variety of restoration strategies can be adopted in restoring humid tropical forests, including natural regeneration, assisted natural regeneration (i.e. fire breaks, weed control, erosion control, topsoil replacement, peatland rewetting), enrichment planting (i.e. planting nursery-raised seedlings, direct seeding) and commercial restoration ( i.e. plantation forests, agroforestry). Our analysis shows that while natural regeneration can be effective under favourable ecological conditions, humid tropical forests are often ill-adapted to fire, and therefore less likely to recover unassisted after a wildfire event. Active restoration practices may be more effective, but can be costly and challenging to implement. We also identify gaps in knowledge needed for effective restoration of humid tropical forests after fire, hereby taking into account the ecosystems and socio-economic conditions in which these fires occur. We suggest to incorporate fire severity in future studies, to better understand and predict post-fire ecosystem responses. In addition, as fire poses a recurring and intensifying threat throughout the recovery process, more emphasis should be placed on post- restoration management and the prevention of fire throughout the different phases of the restoration process. Furthermore, as tropical wildfires are increasing in scale, establishing collaborative capacity and setting priorities for efficient resource allocation should become a major priority for restoration practitioners in the humid tropics. Finally, as global fire regimes are changing and expected to intensify in the context of climate change, land use and land cover change, we suggest to put continuous effort into fire monitoring and modelling to inform the development of effective restoration strategies in the long-run.

TI  - A Small-Scale Forestry Perspective on Constraints to Including REDD in International Carbon Markets
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
AB  - In this article the authors contend that the constraints to including reduced emissions from avoided tropical forest deforestation and degradation in international carbon markets stem from problems associated with: (1) correctly measuring emissions savings from avoided tropical forest deforestation and degradation; (2) the permanence and 'leakage' of tropical forest conservation regimes; (3) ensuring economic incentives for the avoidance of tropical forest deforestation and degradation are sufficiently effective; (4) the exclusion of reduced emissions from avoided tropical forest deforestation and degradation from critical international climate change policy agreements; and (5) the behaviour of investors in carbon markets. Case analysis of the 'Emissions Biodiversity Exchange Project for the 21st Century' (EBEX21) program of Landcare Research New Zealand is used to examine how a government-supported market-based forest conservation initiative can be used to address these constraints, particularly in the context of small-scale forestry conservation.

TI  - Intensive tree planting facilitates tropical forest biodiversity and biomass accumulation in Kibale National Park, Uganda
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The extensive area of degraded tropical land and the calls to conserve forest biodiversity and sequester carbon to offset climate change demonstrate the need to restore forest in the tropics. Deforested land is sometimes replanted with fast-growing trees; however, the consequences of intensive replanting on biomass accumulation or plant and animal diversity are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to determine how intensive replanting affected tropical forest regeneration and biomass accumulation over ten years. We studied reforested sites in Kibale National Park, Uganda, that were degraded in the 1970s and replanted with five native tree species in 1995. We identified and measured the size of planted versus naturally regenerating trees, and felled and weighed matched trees outside the park to calculate region-specific allometric equations for above-ground tree biomass. The role of shrubs and grasses in facilitating or hindering the establishment of trees was evaluated by correlating observed estimates of percent cover to tree biomass. We found 39 tree species naturally regenerating in the restored area in addition to the five originally planted species. Biomass was much higher for planted (15,675 kg/ha) than naturally regenerated trees (4560 kg/ha), but naturally regenerating tree regrowth was an important element of the landscape. The establishment of tree seedlings initially appeared to be facilitated by shrubs, primarily Acanthus pubescens and the invasive Lantana camara; however, both are expected to hinder tree recruitment in the long-term. Large and small-seeded tree species were found in the replanted area, indicating that bird and mammal dispersers contributed to natural forest restoration. These results demonstrate that intensive replanting can accelerate the natural accumulation of biomass and biodiversity and facilitate the restoration of tropical forest communities. However, the long-term financial costs and ecological benefits of planting and maintaining reforested areas need to be weighed against other potential restoration strategies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Agroforestry stand age influence physical and chemical soil parameters
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
AB  - The role of agroforestry in improving soil parameters is well known. However, there is debate as to how age of agroforestry practice affects physical and chemical parameters especially in the tropical region of Sub-Saharan Africa where adoption of the practice is fairly recent. To understand those effects, a study was conducted using soil samples taken in farms adopting/non adopting agroforestry practises, selected using a stratified, random sampling strategy. Soil was sampled from adopters and non-adopters using soil auger. At least five subsamples were collected from each location and the soil mixed to get an integrated soil sample for analysis. The physical (sand, clay, silt and bulk density), chemical properties (pH, total nitrogen [TN], total phosphorus [TP], total organic carbon [TOC], carbon nitrogen ratio [C/N] and carbon to phosphorus ratio [C/P]) were analyzed in the soil. The exchangeable bases (K, Ca, Mg and Na) as well as micronutrients (Mn, Cu, Fe and Zn) were also analyzed. The results indicated that sand was significantly (P < 0.05) higher among non-adopters compared to adopters while silt and bulk density was significantly (P < 0.05) higher among the adopters compared to the nonadopters. Sand levels decreased while silt and bulk density significantly increased with increasing agroforestry stand age. The TN, TOC and C/P ratio were significantly (P < 0.05) higher among adopters and increased consistently with age of adoption, while C/N was higher among non-adopters and decreased with increasing age of agroforestry stand. The trend in exchangeable bases and micro-nutrients in the soil were similar, where higher concentrations occurred among adopters and displayed an increase with regard to age of agroforestry stand. Our results support the hypothesis that age of agroforestry practice affects soil in parameter-specific patterns.

TI  - Drivers of functional diversity in small-bodied mammals across a deforestation frontier in the Southern Brazilian Amazon
T2  - MAMMAL RESEARCH
AB  - Deforestation remains the most pervasive driver of biodiversity erosion across tropical forests. Understanding how species can cope with such habitat changes is particularly important along the rapidly expanding agricultural frontiers. To do so, we used a functional perspective examining small mammal responses to habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation across the 'Arc of Deforestation' in the Southern Brazilian Amazon. Small mammals were surveyed using a combination of conventional and pitfall traps across 20 forest fragments-ranging from 42 to 4743 ha-in addition to two relatively continuous forest sites (> 7000 ha). These fragments lie isolated by a cattle pasture matrix of varying grazing intensity. We then analysed taxonomic and functional diversity patterns-represented by Simpson Diversity and Rao Quadratic entropy indices-in Generalised Linear Models containing local- to landscape-scale predictors of variation. Further, we used a functional trait composition approach based on community-weighted mean trait values to depict and predict small mammal functional variations across this degradation gradient. From a total of 847 individuals recorded belonging to 24 taxa, functional responses tended to follow the taxonomic diversity, both increasing with fragment area. The functional dimension further was promoted by low fire-related disturbance. Functional trait composition was mainly driven by habitat quality, represented by tree density, arthropod biomass, and fire-related disturbance. Our results reinforce that small forest fragments sustain depauperate small mammal assemblages both taxonomically and functionally. Accounting for habitat quality further allows for boosting the persistence across functional groups. Our findings can be used to improve the efficiency of management practices thereby maximising the multiple dimensions of small mammal diversity and their associated ecosystem services across tropical deforestation frontiers.

TI  - Major forest increase on the Loess Plateau, China (2001-2016)
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The Loess Plateau in China is prone to widespread land degradation (soil erosion, deforestation, and water loss), and therefore, ecological restoration programmes aiming to re-establish the ecosystem by revegetation have been implemented during recent decades. Consequently, a widespread increase in vegetation cover has been reported, but the state and dynamics of forests remain largely unknown. Here, we used field and satellite data to produce annual forest probability scores at 250 x 250 m between 2001 and 2016. We classified the forest dynamics into three types: net gain, net loss, and fluctuation. Assuming that an increasing probability score reflects forest growth, we categorised the annual forest areas into different growing stages indicating the transition between planting and mature forest. In total, the area of forest increase was 48,786 km(2), and the percentage of forested areas of the region changed from 8.19% to 15.82% within 16 years. In areas of forest net gain, there was a clear transition from low- to high-probability forest areas, providing evidence that a general forest transition is occurring on the Loess Plateau. The method developed for continuous monitoring of forest probability scores offers a benchmarking for further decision making on ecological restoration of the region and for mapping of afforestation projects elsewhere. The findings on major forest increases demonstrate that land degradation is in fact reversible, with implications for many ecosystem services (e.g., carbon storage and provisioning of forest products).

TI  - Fragmentation increases wind disturbance impacts on forest structure and carbon stocks in a western Amazonian landscape
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Tropical second-growth forests could help mitigate climate change, but the degree to which their carbon potential is achieved will depend on exposure to disturbance. Wind disturbance is common in tropical forests, shaping structure, composition, and function, and influencing successional trajectories. However, little is known about the impacts of extreme winds on second-growth forests in fragmented landscapes, though these ecosystems are often located in mosaics of forest, pasture, cropland, and other land cover types. Indirect evidence suggests that fragmentation increases risk of wind damage in tropical forests, but no studies have found such impacts following severe storms. In this study, we ask whether fragmentation and forest type (old vs. second growth) were associated with variation in wind damage after a severe convective storm in a fragmented production landscape in western Amazonia. We applied linear spectral unmixing to Landsat 8 imagery from before and after the storm, and combined it with field observations of damage to map wind effects on forest structure and biomass. We also used Landsat 8 imagery to map land cover with the goals of identifying old-and second-growth forest and characterizing fragmentation. We used these data to assess variation in wind disturbance across 95,596 ha of forest, distributed over 6,110 patches. We find that fragmentation is significantly associated with wind damage, with damage severity higher at forest edges and in edgier, more isolated patches. Damage was also more severe in old-growth than in second-growth forests, but this effect was weaker than that of fragmentation. These results illustrate the importance of considering landscape context in planning tropical forest restoration and natural regeneration projects. Assessments of long-term carbon sequestration potential need to consider spatial variation in disturbance exposure. Where risk of extreme winds is high, minimizing fragmentation and isolation could increase carbon sequestration potential.

TI  - Potential of agroforestry orchards as a conservation set-aside initiative in industrial rubber tree and oil palm plantations for avian biodiversity
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - At the expense of irreversible biodiversity loss, industrial modern agriculture is expanding in tropical regions. The conversion of forests to large scale monoculture plantations has fragmented and reduced habitat complexity, and altered biotic communities. However, the establishment of agroforestry orchards as a part of a conservation set-aside programme may aid biodiversity by providing a wider range of ecological niches to support more diverse bird fauna within industrial monoculture plantations. Thus, in this study, we compared avian biodiversity assemblages (species richness, abundance, and functional bird groups) between two types of agricultural production (agroforestry orchards and agriculture monocultures) in Peninsular Malaysia with the aim of assessing the applicability of the conservation set-aside. We measured 14 predictor variables consisting of habitat attributes, vegetation health, and insect food availability, to determine the key ecological drivers for avian biodiversity in tropical agriculture matrices. Across the study area, we recorded 6,284 birds from 110 species (42 families) via point count sampling. Our results revealed that agroforestry orchards were able to support greater avian biodiversity assemblages in terms of species richness and abundance compared to monoculture plantations. Bird species richness and abundance were driven by 10 out of 14 predictor variables, with arthropod order richness, vegetation health, land-use type and season having significant influence on both models. Bird functional groups were attributed to 11 predictor variables with vegetation health, land-use type and season having the most influence over all bird groups. Our findings highlight the potential of agroforestry orchards as conservation set-aside for avian biodiversity in industrialised monoculture plantation landscapes.

TI  - Impacts of shaded agroforestry management on carbon sequestration, biodiversity and farmers income in cocoa production landscapes
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB  - PurposeConversion of shaded agroforests to unshaded monocultures endangers the resilience of tropical landscapes. Landscape-scale impacts of alternative shade managements have rarely been assessed. This study explored plantation- and landscape-level impacts of different shade management strategies on aboveground biomass, functional group diversity, and economic potential of cocoa production in northern Ecuador.MethodsWe simulated several cocoa shade management scenarios, using the dynamic forest model LANDIS-II: (i) baseline' projections representing the current mosaic of traditional agroforests, planted agroforests, and unshaded monoculture plantations; (ii) traditional' agroforestry shaded by native fruit and timber trees; (iii) planted' agroforests shaded by planted fruit trees; and (iv) monoculture' unshaded plantations. The impacts of setting aside 20, 30, and 40% of cocoa plantations for natural regeneration was tested for the monoculture scenario.ResultsTraditional agroforests shaded by native trees stored up to 7% more aboveground biomass and had higher abundances of rare functional groups compared to monocultures after 50years of simulation. Smaller effects were found for planted agroforests. Shaded plantations and land set aside for natural regeneration reduced forest fragmentation at the landscape level. The estimated yield gap for monoculture and shaded plantations could not be compensated by additional revenues for carbon storage at current carbon market price.ConclusionsImproving payment-for-ecosystem services and certification schemes are needed to incentivize smallholders to maintain substantial non-cocoa tree cover that may provide an environmental-friendly way to improve economic potential and food security for smallholders, while supporting biomass and functional group diversity at the landscape level.

TI  - Nutrient availability and stoichiometry mediate microbial effects on soil carbon sequestration in tropical forests
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - The persistence of soil organic carbon (SOC) is primarily driven by microbial metabolic activities; however, how microbial effects on SOC sequestration are affected by soil nutrient status remains unclear. Here, we conducted a one-year-long in situ soil incubation experiment using mesh bags (with a mesh size of 38 mu m, allowing bacterial colonization and fungal hyphal penetration while preventing root penetration). This experiment involved incubating fertile sugarcane soil and infertile sand across an elevational gradient, characterized by diverse climatic and biotic conditions within a tropical forest. Biomarkers, such as phospholipid fatty acids, carbon-, nitrogen-, and phosphorus-acquiring hydrolases, glomalin-related proteins, and amino sugars, were measured to characterize the production and accumulation of microbial biomass, exo-enzymes, extracellular glycoproteins, and microbial necromass. These measurements aimed to elucidate their respective contribution to the sequestration of SOC. We found that Gram-negative bacteria dominated the microbial community composition in fertile soil, and the higher nutrient availability was related to the production and accumulation of microbial necromass via promoting microbial biomass turnover, thus enhancing the accumulation of SOC in fertile soil. This process was negatively associated with phosphorus availability and carbon-and phosphorus-acquiring enzyme activities in fertile soil. In contrast, the SOC accumulation was positively correlated with nitrogen availability and stoichiometry (including C:N and C:P), as well as moisture content in infertile sand. However, more resources were preferentially allocated to stress-tolerant fungi and Gram-positive bacteria under nutrient deficiency in infertile sand used for microbial biomass maintenance, nutrient acquisition, and environmental adaption which further aggravated the consumption of SOC, resulting in SOC loss after one year of field incubation. Our results suggest that microbial effects on SOC persistence are highly context-dependent and nutrient availability-induced changes in microbial communities and microbial resource-allocation strategies are key processes for understanding and predicting the fate of carbon in tropical forest soils.

TI  - Greening the blue Pacific: Lessons on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD plus )
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Across the Pacific, deforestation and forest degradation are driving the loss of ecosystem services. Increasing recognition of the need for mechanisms that can bridge economic development and environmental sustainability has led to the emergence of the broad concept of Nature-based Solutions (NbS), including Payments for Environmental Services (PES) such as 'reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation' (REDD+) of forested areas. REDD+ projects are being piloted in the region, but the scale of adoption remains limited raising doubts about whether the concept has much appeal beyond small-scale government-supported initiatives. Although a relatively simple concept, it is proving difficult to translate into an appealing practice that is widely understood and adopted by rural land managers. We conducted a review of the achievements and challenges of REDD+ projects in Melanesia while drawing on global and regional lessons. Most projects are reaping the benefits of enhanced community development, employment, capacity building, and stronger governance. Perverse incentives, lack of systematic assessments of carbon offsets, poor stakeholder engagement, insufficient feedback mechanisms, marginalisation of women, and the lack of prosperous and sustainable alternative livelihoods remain key challenges. This suggests the need for developing policy mixes, understanding the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation, addressing equity concerns, strengthening tenure security, removing perverse incentives, and ensuring financially competitive conservation incentives for enhancing the appeal of REDD+ to rural communities, policymakers, and the private sector, so its reach across the Pacific can be extended.

TI  - Difficulties in tracking the long-term global trend in tropical forest area
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - The long-term trend in tropical forest area receives less scrutiny than the tropical deforestation rate. We show that constructing a reliable trend is difficult and evidence for decline is unclear, within the limits of errors involved in making global estimates. A time series for all tropical forest area, using data from Forest Resources Assessments (FRAs) of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, is dominated by three successively corrected declining trends. Inconsistencies between these trends raise questions about their reliability, especially because differences seem to result as much from errors as from changes in statistical design and use of new data. A second time series for tropical moist forest area shows no apparent decline. The latter may be masked by the errors involved, but a "forest return" effect may also be operating, in which forest regeneration in some areas offsets deforestation (but not biodiversity loss) elsewhere. A better monitoring program is needed to give a more reliable trend. Scientists who use FRA data should check how the accuracy of their findings depends on errors in the data.

TI  - How Can Remote Sensing Help Monitor Tropical Moist Forest Degradation?-A Systematic Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - In the context of the climate and biodiversity crisis facing our planet, tropical forests playing a key role in global carbon flux and containing over half of Earth's species are important to preserve. They are today threatened by deforestation but also by forest degradation, which is more difficult to study. Here, we performed a systematic review of studies on moist tropical forest degradation using remote sensing and fitting indicators of forest resilience to perturbations. Geographical repartition, spatial extent and temporal evolution were analyzed. Indicators of compositional, structural and regeneration criteria were noted as well as remote sensing indices and metrics used. Tropical moist forest degradation is not extensively studied especially in the Congo basin and in southeast Asia. Forest structure (i.e., canopy gaps, fragmentation and biomass) is the most widely and easily measured criteria with remote sensing, while composition and regeneration are more difficult to characterize. Mixing LiDAR/Radar and optical data shows good potential as well as very high-resolution satellite data. The awaited GEDI and BIOMASS satellites data will fill the actual gap to a large extent and provide accurate structural information. LiDAR and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) form a good bridge between field and satellite data. While the performance of the LiDAR is no longer to be demonstrated, particular attention should be brought to the UAV that shows great potential and could be more easily used by local communities and stakeholders.

TI  - Grasslands to tree plantations: Forest transition in the andes of Ecuador
T2  - ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS
AB  - Over the past four decades the establishment of pine plantations in high altitude paramo grasslands has been a growing land use change in Ecuador. As a result, plantation forestry has transformed some highland landscapes from grasslands to ones dominated by exotic trees. This transformation is analyzed in the context of forest transition theory, which provides a framework for explaining scenarios of increasing forest cover. Forest transition theory predicts that reforestation and afforestation, encompassing the establishment of secondary forests and plantations, respectively, occur when economic development leads to the abandonment of agricultural land or when forest scarcity prompts increases in plantation establishment. This research demonstrates that projected forest scarcity has played an important role in paramo to pine transitions. However, it also indicates that, in Ecuador, afforestation has been seen as a potential means to economic development rather than a consequence of it. Furthermore, this case brings into question some of the assumptions of forest transition theory with respect to the environmental benefits of transition. The evidence presented indicates that, in the case of paramo to pine transitions, the biophysical response includes a loss of soil carbon, nitrogen, and water retention capacity, implying important trade-offs between the ecosystem services provided by paramos and those provided by pine plantations. These results suggest that both the existing land cover prior to forest transition and the type of forest cover established during transition merit more attention in forest transition theory.

TI  - Ecosystem Service Multifunctionality: Decline and Recovery Pathways in the Amazon and Choco Lowland Rainforests
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The balance between the supply of multiple ecosystem services (ES) and the fulfillment of society demands is a challenge, especially in the tropics where different land use transition phases emerge. These phases are characterized by either a decline (from intact old-growth to logged forests) or a recovery of ES (successional forests, plantations, and agroforestry systems). This highlights the importance of ecosystem service multifunctionality (M) assessments across these land use transition phases as a basis for forest management and conservation. We analyzed synergies and trade-offs of ES to identify potential umbrella ES. We also evaluated the impact of logging activities in the decline of ES and M, and the influence of three recovery phases in the supply of ES and M. We installed 156 inventory plots (1600 m(2)) in the Ecuadorian Central Amazon and the Choco. We estimated indicators for provisioning, regulating, supporting services and biodiversity. M indicator was estimated using the multifunctional average approach. Our results show that above-ground carbon stocks can be considered as an umbrella service as it presented high synergetic relations with M and various ES. We observed that logging activities caused a decline of 16-18% on M, with high impacts for timber volume and above-ground carbon stocks, calling for more sustainable practices with stricter post-harvesting control to avoid a higher depletion of ES and M. From the recovery phases it is evident that, successional forests offer the highest level of M, evidencing high potential to recover multiple ES after human disturbance.

TI  - Managing and Reforesting Degraded Post-Mining Landscape in Indonesia: A Review
T2  - LAND
AB  - Tropical forests are among the most diverse ecosystems in the world, completed by huge biodiversity. An expansion in natural resource extraction through open-pit mining activities leads to increasing land and tropical forest degradation. Proper science-based practices are needed as an effort to reclaim their function. This paper summarizes the existing practice of coal mining, covering the regulatory aspects and their reclamation obligations, the practices of coal mining from various sites with different land characteristics, and the reclamation efforts of the post-mining landscapes in Indonesia. The regulations issued accommodate the difference between mining land inside the forest area and outside the forest area, especially in the aspect of the permit authority and in evaluating the success rate of reclamation. In coal-mining practices, this paper describes starting from land clearing activities and followed by storing soil layers and overburden materials. In this step, proper handling of potentially acid-forming materials is crucial to prevent acid mine drainage. At the reclamation stage, this paper sequentially presents research results and the field applications in rearranging the overburden and soil materials, controlling acid mine drainage and erosion, and managing the drainage system, settling ponds, and pit lakes. Many efforts to reclaim post-coal-mining lands and their success rate have been reported and highlighted. Several success stories describe that post-coal-mining lands can be returned to forests that provide ecosystem services and goods. A set of science-based best management practices for post-coal-mine reforestation is needed to develop to promote the success of forest reclamation and restoration in post-coal-mining lands through the planting of high-value hardwood trees, increasing trees' survival rates and growth, and accelerating the establishment of forest habitat through the application of proper tree planting technique. The monitoring and evaluation aspect is also crucial, as corrective action may be taken considering the different success rates for different site characteristics.

TI  - Impacts of tropical forest cover on water quality in agricultural watersheds in southeastern Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Tropical forests are under continued threat due to deforestation and fragmentation, mainly because of clear cutting for agriculture and cattle ranching, and it can lead to water quality degradation. However, there is a need for understanding the role of forest areas as an indicator of water quality in the current diverse landscape in tropical watersheds. Thus, this study aims at evaluating forest cover as an indicator of stream health in tropical agricultural watersheds. We selected six watersheds of low-order streams in Southeastern Brazil with different percentages of forest cover, where water samples were collected to obtain the following water quality parameters: dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity (NTU), total suspended solids (TSS), inorganic suspended solids (ISS), organic suspended solids (OSS), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total coliforms (TC), and fecal coliforms (FC). A land use/land cover (LULC) map was used to extract the LULC pattern of each watershed, and a distance metric was applied to explore the differences between them. The water quality parameters were analyzed by the yearly mean, data variation and the correlation between them. We compared forested (55% of forest cover or more) and degraded (35% or less) watersheds using MANOVA and PCA. Degraded watersheds showed high values of solids, turbidity, nutrients, and coliforms. The most forested watershed showed the best water quality, whereas the watershed mainly covered by agriculture presented the poorest water quality and the greatest temporal variation. The forested watersheds showed significant difference with degraded watersheds, which presented higher value of all the parameters, excepted of DO. NTU, solids, and TP were correlated, showing that turbidity and solids represent the particles in the water, and they carry adsorbed phosphorus. Those parameters also responded to the streamflow variation. The results indicated that the pollution came from the agricultural and residential areas, whereas the tropical forest was important to keep water clean. Thus, tropical forest cover is a good indicator of water quality, and plays an important role in minimizing the impacts of human activities on ecosystem services in agricultural watersheds. Nevertheless, better soil management practices and basic sanitation implementation are still needed to improve water quality.

TI  - Beyond the blame game: a restoration pathway reconciles ecologists' and local leaders' divergent models of seasonally dry tropical forest degradation
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - An understanding of ecosystem dynamics under different scenarios of degradation is required to reverse ecological degradation and identify restoration priorities. Such knowledge can be the result of scientific investigation, but important insight can also reside in observant local land managers. In seasonally dry tropical forests in southern Ecuador, recent decades have seen important advances in the knowledge of the biodiversity values of these forests, but the available data have not yet been integrated and translated into tools that support managers in deciding restoration measures. One powerful framework to organize and communicate information about ecosystem degradation and recovery dynamics is the state-transition model. We generated such a model by combining ecologist and local knowledge obtained through an adaptation of the Stanford/SRI expert elicitation protocol. Through this information, we identified five forest states with specific attributes of vegetation, human pressures, and restoration needs. Ecologists and locals agreed on the restoration actions but partially disagreed on the causes of degradation. Whereas ecologists considered that grazing management, often introduced with or after logging, was the catalyst for a transition to degraded states, locals attributed those transitions to the effects of logging alone. Importantly, however, both ecologists and locals considered that exclusion of livestock grazing was a necessary action to promote ecological recovery. A forward-looking strategy focusing on objectives for ecosystem recovery and ecosystem management for biodiversity and human well-being might be more successful than strategies that emphasize or seek to attribute responsibility for degradation.

TI  - Forest ecosystem services at landscape level - Why forest transition matters?
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Forests in the humid tropics contribute to a wide range of globally demanded forest ecosystem services (FES) and are also beneficial to local communities, which are often highly dependent on natural resources. Approximately one-third of these forests are threatened by resource extraction, logging, and the expanding agricultural frontier. As a result of these developments, forest landscapes are shaped by a transition gradient representing areas with a high forest cover to locations resembling agricultural-forest mosaics. These transition gradients are often char-acterized by different types of forests and successional stages. We used inventory data from 331 plots collected in 24 landscapes in Ecuador and the Philippines, representing five forest-based land-use types. We used mixed linear effect models to analyze how the landscape transition gradient and forest type affect various forest ecosystem services. Additionally, we identified stand structure and landscape transition gradients that influence changes in these FES. Results show country and forest type specific reactions for different FES. For example, aboveground carbon, non-timber forest products, biodiversity, and timber volume in natural forests are not only affected by logging but also decline along the landscape transition gradient. This includes the risk of extinction of high conservation species and long-term depletion of timber resources. We show that tree-based secondary land-use systems may partially compensate for the loss of some FES, especially timber supply, but found evidence for increased nutrient depletion in agroforestry systems. Our results highlight the importance of connected forest landscapes and structurally diverse forest stands in early transition landscapes. We suggest conservation and restoration stra-tegies sensitive to the transition context for FES and to make better use of the various benefits of tropical forests in a sustainable manner.

TI  - Evolving protected-area impacts in Panama: impact shifts show that plans require anticipation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Protected areas (PAs) are the leading forest conservation policy, so accurate evaluation of future PA impact is critical in conservation planning. Yet by necessity impact evaluations use past data. Here we argue that forward-looking plans should blend such evaluations with anticipation of shifts in threats. Applying improved methods to evaluate past impact, we provide rigorous support for that conceptual approach by showing that PAs' impacts on deforestation shifted with land use. We study the Republic of Panama, where species-dense tropical forest faces real pressure. Facing variation in deforestation pressure, the PAs' impacts varied across space and time. Thus, if shifts in pressure levels and patterns could be anticipated, that could raise impact.

TI  - Understanding the importance of primary tropical forest protection as a mitigation strategy
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Given the short time-frame to limit global warming, and the current emissions gap, it is critical to prioritise mitigation actions. To date, scant attention has been paid to the mitigation benefits of primary forest protection. We estimated tropical forest ecosystem carbon stocks and flows. The ecosystem carbon stock of primary tropical forests is estimated at 141-159 Pg C (billion tonnes of carbon) which is some 49-53% of all tropical forest carbon, the living biomass component of which alone is 91-103% of the remaining carbon budget to limit global warming to below 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Furthermore, tropical forests have ongoing sequestration rates 0.47-1.3 Pg C yr(-1), equivalent to 8-13% of annual global anthropogenic CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions. We examined three main forest-based strategies used in the land sector-halting deforestation, increasing forest restoration and improving the sustainable management of production forests. The mitigation benefits of primary forest protection are contingent upon how degradation is defined and accounted for, while those from restoration also depend on how restoration is understood and applied. Through proforestation, reduced carbon stocks in secondary forests can regrow to their natural carbon carrying capacity or primary forest state. We evaluated published data from studies comparing logged and unlogged forests. On average, primary forests store around 35% more carbon. While comparisons are confounded by a range of factors, reported biomass carbon recovery rates were from 40 to 100+ years. There is a substantive portfolio of forest-based mitigation actions and interventions available to policy and decision-makers, depending on national circumstances, in addition to SFM and plantation focused approaches, that can be grouped into four main strategies: protection; proforestation, reforestation and restoration; reform of guidelines, accounting rules and default values; landscape conservation planning. Given the emissions gap, mitigation strategies that merely reduce the rate of emissions against historic or projected reference levels are insufficient. Mitigation strategies are needed that explicitly avoid emissions where possible as well as enabling ongoing sequestration.

TI  - Potentials of Bamboo-Based Agroforestry for Sustainable Development in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Review
T2  - AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
AB  - There is widespread assertion among scientists, government and development experts that bamboo agroforestry could contribute to sustainable rural development in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, there are limited available data to verify the suitability of the system in the region. In addition, the current state of knowledge and adoption of agroforestry in SSA offers very little guidance as to which type of agroforestry systems bamboo could be integrated. Here, we reviewed the potential socioeconomic and environmental benefits of bamboo agroforestry and accentuate implications on sustainable rural development in SSA. In addition, we analysed potential research areas that could be intensified, so that future developments and scaling-up of bamboo agroforestry can be rooted in robust scientific findings rather than the intuitions of governments and development actors.

TI  - Effects of seed traits on the success of direct seeding for restoring southern Thailand's lowland evergreen forest ecosystem
T2  - NEW FORESTS
AB  - The success of direct seeding, as a low-cost approach to forest restoration, varies with tree species and seed characteristics. A system to predict which tree species are likely to be suitable for direct seeding would therefore be useful for improving forest restoration projects. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effects of seed traits on the success of direct seeding to restore tropical forest in southern Thailand. Seeds of 19 indigenous lowland tropical forest tree species were collected, from both the east and west sides of the Thailand peninsular and the following parameters measured: seed size, shape, coat thickness and moisture content. Field trials were established to determine seed germination rates and to calculate a "direct seeding suitability score" for each species, which combined seedling establishment and growth rates. Seed size, shape and moisture content were associated with germination percentage. Species with higher seedling survival tended to have large or intermediate-sized seeds, round or oval seeds and seeds with low or medium moisture content. Only seed coat thickness was significantly correlated with the suitability score (r = 0.65, p < 0.01). Seed coat thickness > 0.4 mm coincided with higher rank suitability score. These conditions successfully predicted the success or failure of direct seeding for 15 out of 19 species tested. Eight tree species are recommended as suitable for restoring lowland evergreen forest ecosystems in southern Thailand, by direct seeding.

TI  - The invasive tree Piper aduncum alters soil microbiota and nutrient content in fallow land following small scale slash-and-burn farming in tropical lowland forest in Papua New Guinea
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Piper aduncum, a tree species native to the Neotropics, has been introduced to other tropical regions and successfully invades secondary forest in fallow land after small scale slash-and-burn agriculture in Papua New Guinea (PNG). However, the effect of P. aduncum invasion on soil chemical properties as well as soil biota remains poorly understood. To fill this knowledge gap, we compared soil chemistry, soil microbiota and soil fauna between sites invaded by P. aduncum and sites with secondary native vegetation, where P. aduncum absent. Soils under P. aduncum had significantly lower P content at 0-5 cm depth, lower NO3- at 5-10 cm depth and lower N and C content at both depths compared to soil under secondary vegetation where P. aduncum absent. Sites invaded by P. aduncum also harbored lower microbial biomass measured by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, especially at 5-10 cm depth. The composition of microbial communities, based on PLFA and amplicon sequencing methods, also differed between soils invaded and uninvaded by P. aduncum, while soil macrofauna did not show any significant difference in the density of various faunal groups between invaded and uninvaded sites. Furthermore, we studied soil chemistry and foliar nitrogen in food gardens established after clearing of secondary vegetation in sites where P. aduncum had been experimentally excluded for five years. These gardens did not differ in soil chemistry compared to the control gardens where P. aduncum was not cleared. However, P. aduncum removal was associated with a higher N content in the leaves of sweet potatoes (Ipomoea batatas), but not bananas (Musa spp.). Our results suggest that P. aduncum has negative effect on soil microbiota and may slowdown nutrient turnover and availability as well as growth of plants on invaded soil. This finding requires further attention and may have practical implication for food gardening in tropical rainforests.

TI  - Reconstructing long term annual deforestation dynamics in Para and Mato Grosso using the Landsat archive
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Remote sensing based monitoring of deforestation in the tropics is crucial to better understand global land use change and related changes in ecosystem service provision and to inform governments and civil society on the effectiveness their forest protection policies. In Brazil, deforestation has been closely coupled to the expansion of grazing and cropping systems primarily in the tropical forest, but no spatially explicit high resolution database on deforestation exists that captures tropical forest clearing prior to 2000. The open Landsat archive provides > 45 years of imagery and is well suited for wall-to-wall assessments of historic deforestation dynamics which are valuable to policy development and environmental impact assessments. Image analysis procedures for reconstructing long-term deforestation dynamics over large areas need to cope with regions and time periods for which the archive contains heterogeneous data densities on a yearly and decadal basis. We create for the first time yearly 30 m maps of long term, annual deforestation dynamics (LTAD) covering the period from 1984 to 2014 for Path and Mato Grosso, two Brazilian federal states that cover much of the Brazilian arc-of-deforestation. Our results provide valuable insights into historic deforestation trends, with annually increasing deforestation from 1990 to 1999 for both Para and Mato Grosso. Peak deforestation occurred in 2004 after which deforestation leveled off - with a more pronounced decrease in Mato Grosso than in Path. Contrary to Mato Grosso, Para again experienced increasing annual forest clearing in recent years. For the time period after 2000, we provide an indepth comparison with two widely used products, the Brazilian PRODES and the Global Forest Change maps (GFC, Hansen et al., 2013). Our deforestation estimates (407,000 +/- 42,000 km(2) at 95% confidence level) are above those provided by PRODES, while GFC results are closer to our estimates for the comparison period. Recent PRODES estimates are consistently below our and the GFC results. Overall, our results exemplify the potential of open image archives for multi-decadal, wall-to-wall and fine grain reconstruction of forest change. The presented approach prototypes similar assessments of tropical forest dynamics globally faced with issues of data scarcity.

TI  - Contributions of a global network of tree diversity experiments to sustainable forest plantations
T2  - AMBIO
AB  - The area of forest plantations is increasing worldwide helping to meet timber demand and protect natural forests. However, with global change, monospecific plantations are increasingly vulnerable to abiotic and biotic disturbances. As an adaption measure we need to move to plantations that are more diverse in genotypes, species, and structure, with a design underpinned by science. TreeDivNet, a global network of tree diversity experiments, responds to this need by assessing the advantages and disadvantages of mixed species plantations. The network currently consists of 18 experiments, distributed over 36 sites and five ecoregions. With plantations 1-15 years old, TreeDivNet can already provide relevant data for forest policy and management. In this paper, we highlight some early results on the carbon sequestration and pest resistance potential of more diverse plantations. Finally, suggestions are made for new, innovative experiments in understudied regions to complement the existing network.

TI  - Positive site selection bias in meta-analyses comparing natural regeneration to active forest restoration
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB  - Several recent meta-analyses have aimed to determine whether natural regeneration is more effective at recovering tropical forests than active restoration (for example, tree planting). We reviewed this literature and found that comparisons between strategies are biased by positive site selection. Studies of natural forest regeneration are generally conducted at sites where a secondary forest was already present, whereas tree planting studies are done in a broad range of site conditions, including non-forested sites that may not have regenerated in the absence of planting. Thus, a level of success in forest regeneration is guaranteed for many studies representing natural regeneration, but not for those representing active restoration. The complexity of optimizing forest restoration is best addressed by paired experimentation at the same site, replicated across landscapes. Studies that have taken this approach reach different conclusions than those arising from meta-analyses; the results of paired experimental comparisons emphasize that natural regeneration is a highly variable process and that active restoration and natural regeneration are complementary strategies.

TI  - Resprouting drives successional pathways and the resilience of Caatinga dry forest in human-modified landscapes
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Tropical forest regeneration has gained renewed interest in recent years as secondary forests have being considered biodiversity repositories and a key source for globally relevant ecosystem services as climate regulation and carbon sequestration and storage. Here, we address the regeneration of a Caatinga dry forest in the context of slash-and-burn agriculture and chronic anthropogenic disturbance by examining forest regeneration mechanisms and a comprehensive set of community-level plant diversity measures (i.e., taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic) in regenerating (4 to 70-yr old) and old-growth forest stands. Resprouting from root suckers was the predominant regeneration mechanism across recently abandoned crop fields. Overall, regenerating forests were similar to old-growth forests in terms of taxonomic and functional composition, and functional and phylogenetic diversity. Moreover, except for the taxonomic diversity, community-level plant diversity measures were not related to forest age or soil properties. Our results suggest that Caatinga dry forest covering sandy soils is particularly resilient due to regeneration driven by resprouting. The same set of plant species dominates the entire regeneration process, including old-growth forest stands. Accordingly, Caatinga dry forest regeneration may follow an initial composition model, rather than following a directional and deterministic trajectory associated with species replacements. This initial composition model probably results from a combination of three factors: (1) early regeneration driven by resprouting rather than seed arrival and seedling recruitment; (2) biomass accumulation mostly due to growth by early colonizers and by those species able to resprout after chronic anthropogenic disturbance and during forest regeneration; and (3) the co-occurrence of functionally distinct plant species. Accordingly, resprouting can guarantee some level of resilience, and hence, the services provided by secondary forests. Nevertheless, forest dynamics in landscapes inhabited by forest-dependent people are affected to a great extent by the nature of the imposed pressures and the ecological profile of the remaining flora.

TI  - Linking imaging spectroscopy and LiDAR with floristic composition and forest structure in Panama
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Landsat and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) imagery have recently been used to identify broad-scale floristic units in Neotropical rain forests, corresponding to geological formations and their edaphic properties. Little is known about the structural and functional variation between these floristic units, however, and Landsat and SRTM data lack the spectral and spatial resolution needed to provide this information. Imaging spectroscopy and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) have been used to measure canopy structure and function in a variety of ecosystems, but the ability of these technologies to measure differences between compositionally-distinct but otherwise uniform tropical forest types remains unknown. We combined 16 tree inventories from central Panama with imaging spectroscopy and LiDAR elevation data from the Carnegie Airborne Observatory to test our ability to identify patterns in plant species composition, and to measure the spectral and structural differences between adjacent closed-canopy tropical forest types. We found that variations in spectroscopic imagery and LiDAR data were strong predictors of spatial turnover in plant species composition. We also found that these compositional, chemical, and structural patterns corresponded to underlying geological formations and their geomorphological properties. We conclude that imaging spectroscopy and LiDAR data can be used to interpret patterns identified in lower resolution sensors, to provide new information on forest function and structure, and to identify underlying determinants of these patterns.

TI  - Analysing land and vegetation cover dynamics during last three decades in Katerniaghat wildlife sanctuary, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
AB  - The change in the tropical forests could be clearly linked to the expansion of the human population and economies. An understanding of the anthropogenic forcing plays an important role in analyzing the impacts of climate change and the fate of tropical forests in the present and future scenario. In the present study, we analyze the impact of natural and anthropogenic factors in forest dynamics in Katerniaghat wildlife sanctuary situated along. the Indo-Nepal border in Uttar Pradesh state, India. The study site is under tremendous pressure due to anthropogenic factors from surrounding areas since last three decades. The vegetation cover of the sanctuary primarily comprised of Shorea robusta forests, Tectona grandis plantation, and mixed deciduous forest; while the land cover comprised of agriculture, barren land, and water bodies. The classification accuracy was 83.5%, 91.5%, and 95.2% with MSS, IKONOS, and Quickbird datasets, respectively. Shorea robusta forests showed an increase of 16 km(2); while Tectona grandis increased by 63.01 km(2) during 1975-2010. The spatial heterogeneity in these tropical vegetation classes surrounded by the human dominated agricultural lands could not be addressed using Landsat MSS data due to coarse spatial resolution; whereas the IKONOS and Quickbird satellite datasets proved to advantageous, thus being able to precisely address the variations within the vegetation classes as well as in the land cover classes and along the edge areas. Massive deforestation during 1970s along the adjoining international boundary with Nepal has led to destruction of the wildlife corridor and has exposed the wildlife sanctuary to interference like grazing and poaching. Higher rates of forest dynamics during the 25-year period indicate the vulnerability of the ecosystem to the natural and anthropogenic disturbances in the proximity of the sanctuary.

AB  - Agricultural intensification can decrease biodiversity and ecosystem services they deliver to agroecosystems. Diverse trees-shaded coffee is structurally and functionally complex and has biodiversity adequate for sustainable production of coffee and mitigation of biodiversity loss due to deforestation. However, shade tree simplification is intense in coffee agroforests worldwide, threatening their economic and environmental targets. In south India, native trees have been replaced by silver oak (Grevillea robusta) trees. Native trees-shaded coffee is floristically complex and diverse than oak-shaded coffee. We hypothesize that the natural prey removal fares better in native trees-shaded coffee than in oak-shaded coffee. Artificial caterpillar models of three colors were installed rotationally on leaves, stems, and branches of coffee plants in native trees-shaded- and oak-shaded coffee, and assessed the predation rates for fruiting and leaf-flushing periods of coffee to test this. Forty-four percent of the caterpillars were predated. Arthropods, and in particular the ants, were the predominant predators. Lizards followed by birds, and mammals were second, third, and fourth important predators of coffee agroforests. Overall, predation rates did not differ with the shade diversity, but lizard predation rates were higher in diverse trees-shaded coffee than in oak-shaded coffee. The predation rates were slightly higher in the fruiting season of coffee. Predation rates of any predator taxa were higher for the caterpillars placed on stems and branches than on leaves. The study does not support the hypothesis that the natural predation rates might be higher in floristically complex coffee agroforests, but highlights the biocontrol potential of lizards in diverse-shaded coffee.

TI  - Under what conditions do payments for environmental services enable forest conservation in the Amazon? A realist synthesis
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Payments for environmental services (PES) have been widely studied as one possible way to counter deforestation and support livelihoods. Given the high rates of deforestation in the Amazon region, it is important to study under which conditions PES have positive environmental and social outcomes. We contribute to this debate through a systematic review based on the Realist Evaluation framework. First, we review case studies to identify configurations of social-ecological factors (context), PES design and implementation (resource mechanisms), people's responses (reasoning mechanisms), and the results in terms of forest conservation and people's livelihoods (outcomes). Second, we develop a middle-range theory of how, for whom, and under what conditions PES in the Amazon achieve these results. After screening 972 articles in the SCOPUS, Scielo, and WorldCat databases, we reviewed 13 articles in-depth that contained all the elements (context-mechanism-outcomes) needed to identify these configurations. Our results show that PES in the Amazon generate positive environmental and social outcomes when they: (a) combine cash and in-kind incentives, (b) raise environmental awareness through capacity building, (c) engage socially and ethnically diverse stakeholders through equitable and inclusive approaches, (d) apply transparent spatial targeting, (e) guarantee strong conditionality through robust monitoring of compliance, and (f) guarantee stable delivery of payments.

TI  - Improving Planting Stocks for the Brazilian Atlantic Forest Restoration through Community-Based Seed Harvesting Strategies
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - High-diversity reforestation can help jumpstart tropical forest restoration, but obtaining viable seedlings is a major constraint: if nurseries do not offer them, it is hard to plant all the species one would like. From 2007 to 2009, we investigated five different seed acquisition strategies employed by a well-established tree nursery in southeastern Brazil, namely (1) in-house seed harvesters; (2) hiring a professional harvester; (3) amateur seed harvesters; or (4) a seed production cooperative, as well as (5) participating in a seed exchange program. In addition, we evaluated two strategies not dependent on seeds: harvesting seedlings from native tree species found regenerating under Eucalyptus plantations, and in a native forest remnant. A total of 344 native tree and shrub species were collected as seeds or seedlings, including 2,465 seed lots. Among these, a subset of 120 species was obtained through seed harvesting in each year. Overall, combining several strategies for obtaining planting stocks was an effective way to increase species richness, representation of some functional groups (dispersal syndromes, planting group, and shade tolerance), and genetic diversity of seedlings produced in forest tree nurseries. Such outcomes are greatly desirable to support high-diversity reforestation as part of tropical forest restoration. In addition, community-based seed harvesting strategies fostered greater socioeconomic integration of traditional communities in restoration projects and programs, which is an important bottleneck for the advance of ecological restoration, especially in developing countries. Finally, we discuss some of the limitations of the various strategies for obtaining planting stocks and the way forward for their improvement.

TI  - Wealth and the distribution of benefits from tropical forests: Implications for REDD
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Interventions to strengthen forest conservation in tropical biomes face multiple challenges. Insecure land tenure and unequal benefit sharing within forest user groups are two of the most important. Using original household level survey data from 130 villages in six countries, we assess how current wealth inequality relates to tenure security and benefit flows from forest use. We find that villages with higher wealth inequality report lower tenure security and more unequal flows from forest income and externally sourced income. Furthermore, we find that wealthier individuals within villages capture a disproportionately larger share of the total amount of forest benefits available to each village, while external income often benefits poorer individuals more. These findings suggest that unless future forest conservation interventions actively work to mitigate inequalities linked to existing forest benefit flows, there is a risk that these interventions-including those associated with REDD + activities reproduce or even aggravate pre-existing socioeconomic inequalities within user groups, potentially undermining both their conservation and economic objectives.

TI  - Effects of chronic anthropogenic disturbance and rainfall on the specialization of ant-plant mutualistic networks in the Caatinga, a Brazilian dry forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Anthropogenic disturbance and climate change might negatively affect the ecosystem services provided by mutualistic networks. However, the effects of such forces remain poorly characterized. They may be especially important in dry forests, which (1) experience chronic anthropogenic disturbances (CADs) as human populations exploit forest resources, and (2) are predicted to face a 22% decline in rainfall under climate change.
   2. In this study, we investigated the separate and combined effects of CADs and rainfall levels on the specialization of mutualistic networks in the Caatinga, a seasonally dry tropical forest typical of north-eastern Brazil. More specifically, we examined interactions between plants bearing extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) and ants. We analysed whether differences in network specialization could arise from environmentally mediated variation in the species composition, namely via the replacement of specialist by generalist species.
   3. We characterized these ant-plant networks in 15 plots (20x20m) that varied in CAD intensity and mean annual rainfall. We quantified CAD intensity by calculating three indices related to the main sources of disturbance in the Caatinga: livestock grazing (LG), wood extraction (WE) and miscellaneous resource use (MU). We determined the degree of ant-plant network specialization using four metrics: generality, vulnerability, interaction evenness and H-2'.
   4. Our results indicate that CADs differentially influenced network specialization: we observed positive, negative, and neutral responses along LG, MU and WE gradients, respectively. The pattern was most pronounced with LG. Rainfall also shaped network specialization, markedly increasing it. While LG and rainfall were associated with changes in network species composition, this trend was not related to the degree of species specialization. This result suggests that shifts in network specialization might be related to changes in species behaviour, not species composition.
   5. Our study highlights the vulnerability of such dry forest ant-plant networks to climate change. Moreover, dry forests experience highly heterogeneous anthropogenic disturbances, creating a geographic mosaic of selective forces that may shape the co-evolution of interactions between ants and EFN-bearing plants.

TI  - Beyond hectares: four principles to guide reforestation in the context of tropical forest and landscape restoration
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - New climate change agreements emerging from the 21st Conference of the Parties and ambitious international commitments to implement forest and landscape restoration (FLR) are generating unprecedented political awareness and financial mobilization to restore forests at large scales on deforested or degraded land. Restoration interventions aim to increase functionality and resilience of landscapes, conserve biodiversity, store carbon, and mitigate effects of global climate change. We propose four principles to guide tree planting schemes focused on carbon storage and commercial forestry in the tropics in the context of FLR. These principles support activities and land uses that increase tree cover in human-modified landscapes, while also achieving positive socioecological outcomes at local scales, in an appropriate contextualization: (1) restoration interventions should enhance and diversify local livelihoods; (2) afforestation should not replace native tropical grasslands or savanna ecosystems; (3) reforestation approaches should promote landscape heterogeneity and biological diversity; and (4) residual carbon stocks should be quantitatively and qualitatively distinguished from newly established carbon stocks. The emerging global restoration movement and its growing international support provide strong momentum for increasing tree and forest cover in mosaic landscapes. The proposed principles help to establish a platform for FLR implementation and monitoring based on a broad set of socioenvironmental benefits including, but not solely restricted, to carbon mitigation and wood production.

TI  - Challenges and opportunities for large-scale reforestation in the Eastern Amazon using native species
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Reforestation and forest restoration are recognized as an effective means of halting biodiversity loss and increasing the performance of ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and the protection and maintenance of water resources. The objective of this review is to describe the main challenges and opportunities for large-scale forest restoration and reforestation using native species in the Amazon, focusing on Para state and the Itacaiunas watershed. Large-scale forest restoration and reforestation in the Eastern Amazon may contribute to meeting national and global restoration commitments and reducing/eliminating the actual forest deficit caused by noncompliance with the Brazilian Native Vegetation Protection Law, concomitantly mitigating impacts on climate change, enhancing ecosystem services (e.g., protection of water resources and reduction of soil erosion) and maintaining biodiversity. The selection of active and passive reforestation approaches depends on land-use history, landscape context and reforestation targets, and the promotion of natural regeneration reduces implementation costs. To measure the ecological and socioeconomic success of forest restoration and reforestation, a large number of on-the-ground and remote indicators are available, and the use of a combination of both methods can reduce the monitoring cost. The socioeconomic benefits of reforestation include financial gains from restoration and carbon programs; furthermore, the commercialization of timber and non-timber products and their use for subsistence may improve livelihoods and farm incomes. Nevertheless, implementation of large-scale reforestation in the Eastern Amazon requires research regarding the selection and the nutritional demands of native species and the development of adequate soil management strategies that promote the growth of native species and yields. The insufficient availability of seeds and seedlings is a major bottleneck for large-scale forest restoration and reforestation with native species. Thus, increasing the availability, diversity and quality of seedlings and seeds of native species to supply the demand for planting activities, as well as the registration of producers in the National Register of Seeds and Seedlings, is necessary to achieve compliance with national legislation and international commitments. Competition between reforestation and the expansion of agricultural and cattle ranching frontiers combined with a lack of markets for commercial products from restored areas constrains the socioeconomic viability of large-scale reforestation. To outweigh deforestation incentives, regulation and effective implementation of markets and programs such as REDD+, CDM and PES is thus paramount. To enhance the integration of human well-being, socioeconomic enhancements and ecological functionality, forest and landscape restoration concepts offer promising tools for the region.

TI  - Smallholder reforestation and livelihoods in the humid tropics: a systematic mapping study
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Systematic mapping studies provide a snapshot of the literature based on systematic literature searches. In this systematic mapping study, the original research that links reforestation and livelihoods in the tropics was mapped and analysed to identify the trends, biases and gaps in the literature. In total, 339 papers from 92 journals were identified. Agroforestry Systems was the journal in which articles were most frequently published, and Cameroon and Indonesia the most frequently studied countries. The greatest number of authors came from the USA, and authors were most commonly affiliated with ICRAF. A limited collaboration between research groups in the tropical regions was identified. Anthropology and Social Sciences were the most frequent areas of research, especially in Africa. Latin America had more technical studies and more publications discussing payment for environmental services than the other regions. Based on the temporal analysis of the main terms in abstracts of the publications included, it was found that agriculture-related terms and terms related to the human component in the landscape were consistently prevalent in the literature relating reforestation and livelihoods throughout time. Agroforestry systems were especially important in small-scale reforestation and livelihoods. Trends, biases and gaps were discussed. Broader cooperation between tropical regions and between clusters of authors would be beneficial for research and practice.

TI  - Fair payments for effective environmental conservation
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Global efforts for biodiversity protection and land use -based greenhouse gas mitigation call for increases in the effectiveness and efficiency of environmental conservation. Incentive -based pol- icy instruments are key tools for meeting these goals, yet their effectiveness might be undermined by such factors as social norms regarding whether payments are considered fair. We investigated the causal link between equity and conservation effort with a randomized real -effort experiment in forest conservation with 443 land users near a tropical forest national park in the Vietnam- ese Central Annamites, a global biodiversity hotspot. The experi- ment introduced unjustified payment inequality based on luck, in contradiction of local fairness norms that were measured through responses to vignettes. Payment inequality was perceived as less fair than payment equality. In agreement with our preregistered hypotheses, participants who were disadvantaged by unequal payments exerted significantly less conservation effort than other participants receiving the same payment under an equal distribu- tion. No effect was observed for participants advantaged by in- equality. Thus, equity effects on effort can have consequences for the effectiveness and efficiency of incentive -based conservation instruments. Furthermore, we show that women exerted substan- tially more conservation effort than men, and that increasing pay- ment size unexpectedly reduced effort. This emphasizes the need to consider social comparisons, local equity norms, and gender in environmental policies using monetary incentives to motivate behavioral change.

TI  - Biodiversity and carbon storage co-benefits of coffee agroforestry across a gradient of increasing management intensity in the SW Ethiopian highlands
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Agroforestry has been proposed as a way to reconcile biodiversity conservation, food production and the delivery of other ecosystem services in tropical landscapes. One such a key ecosystem service, especially in the light of climate change mitigation, is carbon storage. Increasing human disturbance and management intensification, however, are known to affect the carbon storage potential of forests. Here we assessed how the above- and belowground carbon stocks in Ethiopian moist evergreen Afromontane forest co-varied with their biodiversity, and with increasing agroforestry management intensity for the production of Arabica coffee (Coffea arabica L.). We assessed above- and belowground carbon storage in 60 plots across a gradient of agricultural intensification ranging from natural forest, over two different coffee agroforestry systems, to intensified shade plantations. We quantified the diversity of ground beetles and woody plants in the same plots. Carbon stocks in natural forests (413 +/- 55.6 S.E. Mg ha(-1)) and in the most extensively managed agroforestry systems (387 +/- 50.0 Mg ha(-1)) were significantly higher than those in the more intensified agroforest system (258 +/- 39.4 Mg ha(-1)) and in shade plantations (219 +/- 22.8 Mg ha(-1)). Diversity of woody plants, but not of ground beetles, declined with increasing management intensity and decreasing carbon stocks. Overall, this study demonstrates that extensive coffee farming in Ethiopian moist Afromontane forests is able to deliver important co-benefits in terms of woody plant species conservation and carbon storage. Given the associated coffee yield cost, it is most likely, however, that supporting payments from certification or policy mechanisms such as REDD+ are required to keep these extensive coffee agroforestry systems economically viable, which is required to avoid management intensification and associated carbon and biodiversity losses.

TI  - Ecological disturbance regimes caused by agricultural land uses and their effects on tropical forest regeneration
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
AB  - AimsAcross tropical regions, large forest areas have been converted to different agricultural land uses. These uses impose ecological disturbances affecting forest regeneration potential after field abandonment. Finding ways to identify those agricultural land uses limiting forest regeneration is a critical issue for conserving biodiversity in human-modified landscapes. Here, we developed a fast and inexpensive index, useful for quantifying ecological disturbance regimes associated with agricultural land uses, and tested its power to predict forest regeneration potential.
   LocationMunicipality of Marques de Comillas, southeast Mexico.
   MethodsInterviews were conducted with local farmers to quantify disturbance components (size, duration and severity) associated with agricultural land uses. The scaled values of these disturbance components were added in a simple ecological disturbance index (EDI). In each one of nine recently abandoned fields representing a wide range of EDI values, two 10-m(2) plots, one close to and one far from nearby forest remnants, were established. On each plot, all woody plants of 10-100m in height were counted, identified and measured in four 1-m(2) subplots, at the time of field abandonment and 2yr later. In addition, at each plot, 18 site condition (microclimate and soil) attributes were quantified at the time of abandonment. Plant density, biomass, species richness and species diversity were used as regeneration variables, and EDI and site condition attributes as independent ones.
   ResultsTwo years after abandonment, most regeneration variables declined exponentially with EDI. Biomass was not explained by EDI but changed positively with light availability. EDI was strongly correlated to vapour pressure deficit, which also predicted regeneration potential (except biomass).
   ConclusionsEDI is a cheap and easy tool for quantifying the ecological disturbance produced by a wide range of agricultural land uses. The index predicted several regeneration variables as well as or better than direct measurements of the site condition at the time of abandonment. EDI can be used to identify biodiversity-friendly agricultural land uses in human-modified landscapes.

TI  - Ecoagricultural landscapes in the dieng mountains of central Java; A study of their evolution and dynamics
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Arable lands and biodiversity hotspots overlap in many places, resulting in conflicts between actors involved in agricultural development and those promoting biodiversity conservation. In Java, high population density complexifies these conflicts. The challenge for local agricultural systems is to provide for adequate means to meet the food needs of the increasing population while the intensifying urbanization exerts pressure on agrosystems and the remaining natural ecosystems. In this context, this article seeks to evaluate to which extent rural communities and natural biodiversity can cohabit harmoniously within Javanese landscapes. To this end, interviews were conducted with farmers living within three different landscapes located in the Dieng Mountains of Central Java. Visual assessments of the agricultural environment were also carried out. The ecoagriculture approach framework, which integrates the objectives of agricultural development, biodiversity conservation and social development while promoting appropriate governance, was used for the analysis.
   All three landscapes exhibit somewhat harmonious relationships between communities, agricultural systems and the surrounding ecosystems, but to different extends. Vegetable crops are relatively beneficial as a result of their high market value and their nutritional qualifies, but they also generate more agricultural pollution when compared to agroforestry systems. These latter provide substantial incomes, require less care and help preserve several essential ecosystem services. However, the institutional capacity sustaining the three studied landscapes is considerably defective and represents their main handicap. Even though this case study is specific to Java, it represents a key example of the evolution of ecoagricultural landscapes in a context of high population density. Indeed, the study shows that natural and semi-natural areas responsible for essential ecosystem services can thrive in tropical regions with very high population density. This study also shows that Javanese ecoagricultural landscapes can still act as a sanctuary for the island's remaining biodiversity, and outside of officially protected areas and of the conflicts that they can generate. Finally, the study shows that agriculture remains a highly important security net for Javanese rural households, and even in a time when the income of these households is becoming more and more diversified. But the fate of the studied landscapes remains uncertain in a globalizing world facing an environmental crisis. Closer collaboration between governmental institutions and local communities might be necessary to insure the preservation of such landscapes.

TI  - Degradation of Ecosystem Services and Deforestation in Landscapes With and Without Incentive-Based Forest Conservation in the Ecuadorian Amazon
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Anthropogenic activities such as logging or forest conversion into agricultural lands are affecting Ecuadorian Amazon forests. To foster private and communal conservation activities an economic incentive-based conservation program (IFC) called Socio Bosque was established. Existing analyses related to conservation strategies are mainly focused on deforestation; while degradation and the role of IFC to safeguard ecosystem services are still scarce. Further on, there is a lack of landscape-level studies taking into account potential side effects of IFC on different forest types. Therefore we assessed ecosystem services (carbon stocks, timber volume) and species richness in landscapes with and without IFC. Additionally, we evaluated potential side-effects of IFC in adjacent forest types; hypothesizing potential leakage effects of IFC. Finally, we tested if deforestation rates decreased after IFC implementation. Forest inventories were conducted in 72 plots across eight landscapes in the Ecuadorian Central Amazon with and without IFC. Plots were randomly selected within three forest types (old-growth, logged and successional forests). In each plot all individuals with a diameter at breast height greater than 10 cm were measured. Old-growth forests in general showed higher carbon stocks, timber volume and species richness, and no significant differences between old-growth forests in IFC and non-IFC landscapes were found. Logged forests had 32% less above-ground carbon (AGC) and timber volume in comparison to old-growth forests. Surprisingly, logged forests near IFC presented higher AGC stocks than logged forests in non-IFC landscapes, indicating positive side-effects of IFC. Successional forests contain 56% to 64% of AGC, total carbon and timber volume, in comparison to old-growth forests, and 82% to 87% in comparison to logged forests. Therefore, successional forests could play an important role for restoration and should receive more attention in national climate change policies. Finally, after IFC implementation deforestation rate decreased on parish level. Our study presents scientific evidence of IFC contribution to conserving ecosystem services and species richness. In addition IFC could help indirectly to reduce degradation effects attributed to logging, indicating potential compatibility of conservation aims with forest activities at a landscape level.

TI  - Enhancing feasibility: Incorporating a socio-ecological systems framework into restoration planning
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB  - Forest restoration is the counterforce to deforestation. In many parts of the world it mitigates forest loss and degradation, but success rates vary. Socio-political variables are important predictors of effectiveness of restoration activities, indicating that restoration strategies need to be locally adapted. Yet, contextual assessments of the biophysical, social and political characteristics of forest restoration are rare. Here, we integrate a social-ecological systems framework with systematic decision-making to inform forest restoration planning. We illustrate this approach through a prioritization analysis in a community-based forest restoration context in Paser District, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. We compare the solutions of our integrated framework with those identified on the basis of biophysical criteria alone. We discover that incorporating a socio-political context alters the selection of priority areas. While the social feasibility and political permissibility can be enhanced, ecological benefits are likely to be reduced and/or opportunity costs of alternative land uses are to be increased. Our conceptual framework allows the appraisal of potential trade-offs between social and ecological outcomes of alternative options, and has the potential to evaluate the efficiency of existing policies. Empirical testing in a range of contexts is required to ensure broad applicability and transferability of our conceptual framework. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Therefore, mangrove ecosystems mapping and monitoring is a crucial objective, especially for tropical regions. Thai Binh province is one of the most important mangrove ecosystems in Vietnam. The mangrove ecosystem in this province has faced threats of deforestation from urban development, land reclamation, tourism activities, and natural disasters. Recently, to maintain the fundamental functions of the ecosystems, a large mangrove area was planted in Thai Binh. The aim of this research is to detect the change in the mangrove areas and to create an aboveground biomass map for mangrove forests in Thai Binh province. Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite images from 1998 to 2018 were analysed using the supervised classification method to detect mangrove area change. Mangrove Aboveground Biomass (AGB) was estimated using linear regression between vegetation indices and field AGB survey. The accuracy assessment for the classified images of 1998, 2003 and 2007, 2013 and 2018 are 93%, 86%, 96%, 94% and 91% respectively with kappa of 0.8881, 0.7953, 0.9357, 0.9114 and 0.8761. The mangrove cover in the study area was estimated at 5874.93 ha in 1998. This figure decreased significantly to 4433.85 ha in 2007, before recovery began to take place in the study area, which was estimated at 6587.88 ha in 2018. In 1998, the average AGB in this study area was 22.57 ton/ha, and in 2018 it was 37.74 ton/ha with a standard error of 12.41 ton/ha and the root mean square error (RMSE) was +/- 12.08 ton/ha.

TI  - The Structure, Distribution, and Biomass of the World's Forests
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY, EVOLUTION, AND SYSTEMATICS, VOL 44
AB  - Forests are the dominant terrestrial ecosystem on Earth. We review the environmental factors controlling their structure and global distribution and evaluate their current and future trajectory. Adaptations of trees to climate and resource gradients, coupled with disturbances and forest dynamics, create complex geographical patterns in forest assemblages and structures. These patterns are increasingly discernible through new satellite and airborne observation systems, improved forest inventories, and global ecosystem models. Forest biomass is a complex property affected by forest distribution, structure, and ecological processes. Since at least 1990, biomass density has consistently increased in global established forests, despite increasing mortality in some regions, suggesting that a global driver such as elevated CO2 may be enhancing biomass gains. Global forests have also apparently become more dynamic. Advanced information about the structure, distribution, and biomass of the world's forests provides critical ecological insights and opportunities for sustainable forest management and enhancing forest conservation and ecosystem services.

TI  - Integrating Conservation and Development in the Peruvian Amazon
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - Recent studies have critiqued integrated conservation and development projects for failing to attain either of their two major goals. This paper evaluates one such project in Peru's Pacaya Samiria National Reserve, which entailed community-based natural resource-management plans for palm and aquatic resources. We conducted semistructured interviews with reserve inhabitants (n=57) during May 2007, as well as key-informant interviews with state and non-governmental organization (NGO) staff. Monitoring data and reports from NGOs were important secondary sources in this study. The intervention has improved the status of targeted species and has improved the well-being of participants. This project worked well for a number of reasons, including the long-term commitment of the implementing organization, the social capital and legitimacy provided by participation in management groups, and the fact that local knowledge was incorporated into resource-management techniques.

TI  - Ecological characterization of tree species for guiding forest management decisions in seasonally dry forests in Lomerio, Bolivia
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - When the goal of natural forest management is to maintain the biodiversity and ecological integrity of the forest while harvesting timber, the silvicultural systems employed must promote timber production and reduce negative impacts on non-timber resources. To foster development of such a system in a seasonally dry tropical forest in Lomerio, Bolivia, we classified tree species according to their relative timber value, importance as food for vertebrate frugivores, and vulnerability to population declines when subjected to logging. We used this classification to identify a management system appropriate for the commercial species and to evaluate the compatibility of the system with the regeneration requirements of tree species that produce important food for mammalian wildlife. About half of the tree species in the site are commercially valuable for their timber and a similar proportion are considered of value as food for wildlife. A tree species rating for vulnerability to disturbance appeared to be independent of both timber and wildlife values. A silvicultural system that includes even-aged groups of trees within an uneven-aged matrix appears more suitable to the multiple goals of management in this forest than either an even-aged or uneven-aged (single tree selection) management system.

TI  - Ecosystem-level carbon storage and its links to diversity, structural and environmental drivers in tropical forests of Western Ghats, India
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Tropical forests are rich in biodiversity with great potential for carbon (C) storage. We estimated ecosystem-level C stock using data from 70 forest plots in three major forest types: tropical dry deciduous (TDD I and TDD II), tropical semi-evergreen (TSE I and TSE II) and tropical evergreen forests (TEF I, TEF II and TEF III) of Kanyakumari Wildlife Sanctuary, Western Ghats, India. The average C stock in these forests was 336.8 Mg C/ha, of which 231.3, 3.0, 2.4, 15.2 and 84.9 Mg C/ha were stored in woody vegetation, understorey, litter, deadwood and soil respectively. The live vegetation, detritus and soil contributed 65.5%, 5.5% and 29% respectively to the total ecosystem-level C stock and distributed in forest types in the order: TEF III>TEF II>TEF I>TSE I>TDD II>TSE II>TDD I. The plant diversity, structural attributes and environmental factors showed significant positive correlations with C stocks and accounted for 6.7, 77.2 and 16% of variance. These findings indicate that the tropical forests in the Western Ghats store large amount of C, and resulting data are invaluable for planning and monitoring forest conservation and management programs to enhance C storage in tropical forests.

TI  - Sequestering carbon in tropical forests: Experiments, policy implications, and climatic change
T2  - SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES
AB  - This article outlines the contribution of tropical deforestation to global warming and assesses the prospects for changes in tropical forest cover trends that would slow climate change. Deforestation releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and reforestation removes them by sequestering carbon. An end to deforestation, coupled with reforestation, could become an important component in near-term strategies for mitigating climate change. To assess the likelihood of this scenario, this article reviews the effectiveness of recent efforts to conserve or create forests in tropical countries. These efforts could mark the beginning of a transition from deforestation to reforestation. A tropical forest transition could achieve substantial amounts of carbon sequestration if elites press for multiple means of conservation, the land productivity of agriculture improves, and nonfarm economic sectors absorb surplus rural labor.

TI  - Mapping the economic costs and benefits of conservation
T2  - PLOS BIOLOGY
AB  - Resources for biodiversity conservation are severely limited, requiring strategic investment. Understanding both the economic benefits and costs of conserving ecosystems will help to allocate scarce dollars most efficiently. However, although cost-benefit analyses are common in many areas of policy, they are not typically used in conservation planning. We conducted a spatial evaluation of the costs and benefits of conservation for a landscape in the Atlantic forests of Paraguay. We considered five ecosystem services ( i.e., sustainable bushmeat harvest, sustainable timber harvest, bioprospecting for pharmaceutical products, existence value, and carbon storage in aboveground biomass) and compared them to estimates of the opportunity costs of conservation. We found a high degree of spatial variability in both costs and benefits over this relatively small (similar to 3,000 km(2)) landscape. Benefits exceeded costs in some areas, with carbon storage dominating the ecosystem service values and swamping opportunity costs. Other benefits associated with conservation were more modest and exceeded costs only in protected areas and indigenous reserves. We used this cost-benefit information to show that one potential corridor between two large forest patches had net benefits that were three times greater than two otherwise similar alternatives. Spatial cost-benefit analysis can powerfully inform conservation planning, even though the availability of relevant data may be limited, as was the case in our study area. It can help us understand the synergies between biodiversity conservation and economic development when the two are indeed aligned and to clearly understand the trade-offs when they are not.

TI  - Trade-offs between ecosystem services and alternative pathways toward sustainability in a tropical dry forest region
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - The design of strategies aimed at sustainable resource management requires an understanding of the trade-offs between the ecosystem services at stake, to determine appropriate ways in which to navigate them. We assess trade-offs between forage production for cattle ranching and the maintenance of carbon stocks or tree diversity in a Mexican tropical dry forest. Trade-offs between pairs of services were assessed by identifying their efficiency frontiers at both site and landscape scales. We also estimated service outcomes under current and hypothetical land-management conditions. We found stark trade-offs between fodder and carbon stocks and between fodder and tree species richness at the site scale. At the landscape scale, the efficiency frontier was concave, with a much less pronounced trade-off in the fodder-species richness case. Our estimates of current service supply levels showed a reduction of 18-21% for C stock and 41-43% for fodder biomass, relative to the maximum feasible values along the efficiency frontier. Choice of the optimum management strategy to reduce such inefficiency depended on deforestation level: secondary forest regeneration was most suitable when deforestation is low, whereas increased fodder productivity in the pastures is best when deforestation is high. Pasture enrichment with forage trees and secondary forest growth are potential management alternatives for achieving sustainability given the range of enabling ecological factors and to balance ecological and social sustainability given the requirements and preferences of local stakeholders. Given that analogous trade-offs are found across the tropics, this work contributes to reconciling tropical forest maintenance and its use for sustainable rural livelihoods.

TI  - Natural Regeneration After Gold Mining in the Peruvian Amazon: Implications for Restoration of Tropical Forests
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Context: Gold mining is the most destructive activity in the natural forests of the Madre de Dios region in the southeastern Peruvian Amazon. Understanding the natural regeneration process of these degraded areas is necessary to develop forest restoration projects in such conditions.
   Aims: We aimed to evaluate forest recovery and identify the successional and structure patterns of vegetation governing natural regeneration over time.
   Methods: Structure, composition, richness, diversity, and successional status were evaluated in abandoned artisanal gold mine areas in Madre de Dios, southeastern Peru. Vegetation data were recorded in 61 plots of 250 m(2) established in five sites varying from 1 to 19 years of abandonment. Vegetation in abandoned areas was compared with six undisturbed forests evaluated in previous inventories.
   Results: In the mining lands, tree density and basal area recovered quickly, while species richness and composition were slow. Forest recovery is an initial stage of transition from pioneer to early secondary species until at least 19 years after abandonment. The most abundant and frequent species were the fast-growing species Ochroma pyramidale and Cecropia engleriana. These species could be considered potential candidates to promote restoration plans. Pioneer species represented 63% of the number of species in plots of 1-4 years, 57% in plots of 5-7 years, and 50% in plots of 8-19 years. Early and late secondary species represented 34 and 16%, respectively, of the number of species in plots of 8-19 years. Abandoned mining and reference plots present less than 5% of species in common.
   Conclusion: Our results highlight a slow natural regeneration process in areas for up to 19 years after gold mining. Species from different successional statuses were identified as potential candidates for recovering vegetation in such areas. Our findings may have important implications for further research focusing on the ecological restoration in tropical forests severely degraded by gold mining.

TI  - Bee landscape relations in changing contexts, implications for stingless bee management
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB  - Giventhe pollinator global crisis and its relation to human activities, it is important to understand how regional landscapes affects pollinators, especially those of ecological, cultural, and economic importance. In the tropics, managed stingless bees (Meliponini) depend on plant resources surrounding hives, in what can be regarded as the bee landscape. As socioecological processes converge shaping landscapes regionally, human-modified landscapes affect resources at the bee landscape level. Through geospatial analyses, we assessed how variables like ecosystem integrity, landscape composition, and land use type affect ecosystem services such as pot-honey production. Based on the case study of Veracruz, Mexico, a state with a long history of land use and land cover change, we found that stingless beekeeping thrives in diverse landscape configurations. In this study, bee landscapes of Scaptotrigona mexicana, an important managed stingless bee species, are mostly agricultural landscapes with patches of tropical forests. The patchy distribution of natural vegetation mixed with the extensive distribution of agriculture related to cattle management and agroforestry systems, result in non-linear relationships between land use composition, land use type, and ecosystem integrity. Multivariate analysis showed that pot-honey harvest benefits from heterogeneous landscapes, although ecosystem integrity and proportion of land use cover were not found to be good predictors of pot-honey production. On the other hand, regional characteristics in interaction with beehive density affect positively the average harvest rate. These findings suggest that beekeeping with S. mexicana is affected by socioecological contexts of complex agricultural landscapes. Given the relevance of stingless bees in tropical areas and the ecological services they provide, this study alleges for integrating bee requirements with development plans in tropical landscapes.

TI  - Monitoring and estimating tropical forest carbon stocks: making REDD a reality
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation in developing countries is of central importance in efforts to combat climate change. Key scientific challenges must be addressed to prevent any policy roadblocks. Foremost among the challenges is quantifying nations' carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, which requires information on forest clearing and carbon storage. Here we review a range of methods available to estimate national-level forest carbon stocks in developing countries. While there are no practical methods to directly measure all forest carbon stocks across a country, both ground-based and remote-sensing measurements of forest attributes can be converted into estimates of national carbon stocks using allometric relationships. Here we synthesize, map and update prominent forest biomass carbon databases to create the first complete set of national-level forest carbon stock estimates. These forest carbon estimates expand on the default values recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guidelines and provide a range of globally consistent estimates.

TI  - Conceptual Links between Landscape Diversity and Diet Diversity: A Roadmap for Transdisciplinary Research
T2  - BIOSCIENCE
AB  - Malnutrition linked to poor quality diets affects at least 2 billion people. Forests, as well as agricultural systems linked to trees, are key sources of dietary diversity in rural settings. In the present article, we develop conceptual links between diet diversity and forested landscape mosaics within the rural tropics. First, we summarize the state of knowledge regarding diets obtained from forests, trees, and agroforests. We then hypothesize how disturbed secondary forests, edge habitats, forest access, and landscape diversity can function in bolstering dietary diversity. Taken together, these ideas help us build a framework illuminating four pathways (direct, agroecological, energy, and market pathways) connecting forested landscapes to diet diversity. Finally, we offer recommendations to fill remaining knowledge gaps related to diet and forest cover monitoring. We argue that better evaluation of the role of land cover complexity will help avoid overly simplistic views of food security and, instead, uncover nutritional synergies with forest conservation and restoration.

TI  - Assessing the impact of forest conversion to plantations on soil degradation and forest water conservation in the humid tropical region of Southeast Asia: Implications for forest restoration
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - The deterioration of soil and water resources resulting from tropical rainforest (TR) conversion to monoculture plantations (e.g., rubber monoculture; RM) could be restrained and restored through intercropping. However, the response of soil properties and forest water conservation function to forest conversion, i.e., the conversion of RM to rubber rainforest (RR: derived from the invasion of wild native plants in abandoned RM), is still unclear. We involved four forests types, TR, RM, rubber-tea agroforestry (RTA), and RR, as transitional steps of forest conversion through a space-for-time substitution approach to examine the dynamic of soil physical, hydrological and chemical properties during the forest conversion (from TR to RM, RM to RTA, RTA to RR, and retransformation into TR). The results show that SOC, TN, TP, and TK decreased in the order of TR > RR > RTA > RM, which was followed by the trend of soil hydrological and physical properties among these forest types. The interrelation between soil physical and chemical properties was mediated by water flow behaviours. High macroporosity and related low Ks in TR favoured the occurrence of water flow behaviours. Water flow behaviours not only influenced the distribution of soil chemical elements but also played a crucial role in forming appropriate conditions for nutrient turnover. The co-occurrence of preferential and matrix flow was more prevalent in the rainy season than dry season due to the higher frequency and higher amount of rainwater. The preferential flow promoted the soil water flow in the water flow paths and enhanced water storage in the soil pores. In short, the soil properties and soil water supply decreased in the following order: TR > RR > RTA > RM, suggesting that the severe soil degradation that occurred after TR conversion to RM can be restored back to the extent of TR after a period of succession. The results provided new insights for understanding the forest water conservation function and soil properties in response to forest conversion and highlighted that the RR appeared as a transitional stage during the course of forest restoration from RM to TR under low rubber demand. These findings improve the current knowledge of the relationship among soil physical, hydrological and chemical properties in the rubber-growing humid tropical region of Southeast Asia.

TI  - Vertical stratification of insect abundance and species richness in an Amazonian tropical forest
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Tropical forests are among the most biodiverse biomes on the planet. Nevertheless, quantifying the abundance and species richness within megadiverse groups is a significant challenge. We designed a study to address this challenge by documenting the variability of the insect fauna across a vertical canopy gradient in a Central Amazonian tropical forest. Insects were sampled over two weeks using 6-m Gressitt-style Malaise traps set at five heights (0 m-32 m-8 m intervals) on a metal tower in a tropical forest north of Manaus, Brazil. The traps contained 37,778 specimens of 18 orders of insects. Using simulation approaches and nonparametric analyses, we interpreted the abundance and richness of insects along this gradient. Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Coleoptera had their greatest abundance at the ground level, whereas Lepidoptera and Hemiptera were more abundant in the upper levels of the canopy. We identified species of 38 of the 56 families of Diptera, finding that 527 out of 856 species (61.6%) were not sampled at the ground level. Mycetophilidae, Tipulidae, and Phoridae were significantly more diverse and/or abundant at the ground level, while Tachinidae, Dolichopodidae, and Lauxaniidae were more diverse or abundant at upper levels. Our study suggests the need for a careful discussion of strategies of tropical forest conservation based on a much more complete understanding of the three-dimensional distribution of its insect diversity.

TI  - Silvicultural intensification has a limited impact on tree growth in forest restoration plantations in croplands
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Investigating the impact of silvicultural practices on tropical forest restoration plantations is highly relevant, as there is a growing global demand for large-scale ecological restoration. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that native trees respond positively to the intensification of fertilization and weed control in a forest restoration plantation on a site previously used as cropland in the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. We carried out a study with 22 native tree species, 11 of which were classified as shade species and the other 11 classified as diversity species. We implemented a randomized experimental design in a split-plot design, with six replicates of four treatments: intensive weed control (glyphosate spraying every 3 months) with and without fertilization, and non-intensive control (mechanical control every 6 months), with and without fertilization. We performed fertilization by supplying the site with 53 kg ha(-1) of nitrogen, 35 kg ha(-1) of phosphorus, and 51 kg ha(-1) of potassium. We evaluated individual tree crown areas and increments in basal diameter and height 16 months after planting. In general, growth varied more among species than in weed control and fertilization treatments. Overall, the method of controlling weeds did not influence tree growth, but interacted with species for all growth variables. Fertilization increased tree diameter increment, and interacted with species, leading to diameter and height increments; however, most of the species did not respond to fertilization. Contrary to our expectations and previous findings, silvicultural intensification did not promote higher overall tree growth, probably because the restoration planting was conducted on a cropland with decades of intensive management, which increased soil fertility and reduced weed abundance through periodical maintenance prior to restoration planting. Our results highlight the importance of considering local and historical conditions to decide whether and when management intensification is required to accelerate tree growth in tropical forest restoration plantations.

TI  - How agroforestry systems influence soil fauna and their functions-a review
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Background Agroforestry systems have enhanced diversity of cultivated plants compared to monocultures, and are expected to affect associated biodiversity. Despite a growing body of literature on the importance of soil fauna, the known effects of different agroforestry types on soil fauna communities and functions have not yet been synthesized. Scope We scanned publications on soil fauna in agroforestry systems. Our aim was to give an overview of strengths and weaknesses of the existing data, in terms of spatial coverage and representation of diverse agroforestry types and soil fauna groups and functions. Conclusions Our database includes sixty-seven articles, mostly focusing on tropical regions and perennial crop agroforestry systems. Soil macrofauna are the most studied fauna group. The most common question addressed is the comparison of the effect of land use types on communities. Effects on fauna abundance and diversity are mainly positive when agroforestry is compared to cropland, and neutral or negative when compared to forests. Few publications actually measure soil fauna functions, or characterize their interactions and evolution in time and space depending on system design and management. Further work on soil fauna in agroforestry should harness ecological theory and address questions of spatial structure and scale, temporal dynamics and ecological interaction networks and how they determine ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Can dung beetles (Scarabaeinae) indicate the status of Amazonia's ecosystems? Insights integrating anthropogenic disturbance with seasonal patterns
T2  - ANIMAL BIOLOGY
AB  - Temporal and spatial variation in dung beetles abundances is a pattern observed in many tropical forests. The present study evaluated the seasonal patterns of dung beetles in a range of increasingly disturbed ecosystems of the state of Para, northern Brazil, to identify valuable disturbance indicators. The areas included native forest, agriculture, pasture for extensive livestock grazing and secondary forests. Fieldwork was carried out encompassing the complete range of environmental conditions encountered during the year. In total, 13,649 individuals were captured within 23 genera and 99 species but with pronounced differences among ecosystems and seasons. The obtained results seem to demonstrate that dung beetles can be used to help identify ecosystems under very complex and variable environmental conditions. The ecological drift observed also demonstrates the possibility of using dung beetles as ecological indicators of disturbance in Amazonia.

TI  - Soil Fungal Community Composition Correlates with Site-Specific Abiotic Factors, Tree Community Structure, and Forest Age in Regenerating Tropical Rainforests
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
AB  - Simple Summary: Regenerating forests represent over half of all tropical forests. While regeneration processes of trees and animal groups have been studied, there is surprisingly little information about how the diversity and community composition of fungi and other microorganisms change and what ecological roles play in tropical forest regeneration. In this study, we compared the diversity and community composition of trees and soil fungi among primary forests and regenerating forests of different ages in two sampling areas in southern Costa Rica. Our study shows that while forest age has a significant influence, environmental factors, such as mesoclimate and soil chemistry, have stronger effects on both fungal and tree communities. Moreover, we observed that the more dissimilar tree communities are between any two sites, the more dissimilar the composition of fungal communities. The results presented here contribute to a better understanding of the successional processes of tropical forests in different regions and inform land use and forest management strategies, including, but not limited to, conservation, restoration, and sustainable use.
   Successional dynamics of plants and animals during tropical forest regeneration have been thoroughly studied, while fungal compositional dynamics during tropical forest succession remain unknown, despite the crucial roles of fungi in ecological processes. We combined tree data and soil fungal DNA metabarcoding data to compare richness and community composition along secondary forest succession in Costa Rica and assessed the potential roles of abiotic factors influencing them. We found a strong coupling of tree and soil fungal community structure in wet tropical primary and regenerating secondary forests. Forest age, edaphic variables, and regional differences in climatic conditions all had significant effects on tree and fungal richness and community composition in all functional groups. Furthermore, we observed larger site-to-site compositional differences and greater influence of edaphic and climatic factors in secondary than in primary forests. The results suggest greater environmental heterogeneity and greater stochasticity in community assembly in the early stages of secondary forest succession and a certain convergence on a set of taxa with a competitive advantage in the more persisting environmental conditions in old-growth forests. Our work provides unprecedented insights into the successional dynamics of fungal communities during secondary tropical forest succession.

TI  - Southeast Asian rainforest lost biodiversity during the range expansion to ice-age Sunda Shelf
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
AB  - The capability of tropical forest to recover from extensive land-use remains a matter of debate, despite its importance for guiding conservation and restoration policies. This is especially the case for Southeast Asia. Fortunately, the Sunda Shelf was extensively exposed during the Last Glacial Maximum sea-level lowstand, providing a unique window to study the long-term and landscape-scale development of tropical forest in new accommodation spaces that may be analogous to those emerge after the cessation of human activities. Here we conduct pollen analyses on three sediment cores from the southern South China Sea - two located in front of the Sunda Shelf paleo-river mouths and one close to the northern Borneo - in order to evaluate the similarity/difference between the "primary" and "secondary" tropical forest of Southeast Asia. The assemblages of major pollen taxa and the life-form composition of identified plant types are found to be quite similar among the sites, indicating that well-structured rainforest should have expanded to the Sunda Shelf despite the sandy and potentially saline, nutrient-poor soils. The plant biodiversity, however, was obviously lower on the Sunda Shelf than on Borneo as inferred from the pollen richness. This indicates a loss of biodiversity during large-scale range expansions. Our findings suggest the potential of reforestation in the lowlands of Southeast Asia, but unfortunately the incapability of restoring biodiversity to pre-disturbance levels through natural regeneration alone. Moreover, the old forests in the mountainous northern Borneo appears to be irreplaceable and thus a priority of conservation efforts.

TI  - GHG mitigation potential, costs and benefits in global forests: A dynamic partial equilibrium approach
T2  - ENERGY JOURNAL
AB  - This paper reports on the global potential for carbon sequestration inforest plantations, and the reduction of carbon emissions from deforestation, in response to six carbon price scenarios from 2000 to 2100. These carbon price scenarios cover a range typically seen in global integrated assessment models. The world forest sector was disaggregated into ten regions, four largely temperate, developed regions: the European Union, Oceania, Russia, and the United States; and six developing, mostly tropical, regions: Africa, Central America, China, India, Rest of Asia, and South America. Three mitigation options-long- and short-rotation forestry, and the reduction of deforestation-were analyzed using a global dynamic partial equilibrium model (GCOMAP). Key findings of this work are that cumulative carbon gain ranges from 50.9 to 113.2 Gt C by 2100, higher carbon prices early lead to earlier carbon gain and vice versa, and avoided deforestation accounts for 51 to 78% of modeled carbon gains by 2100. The estimated present value of cumulative welfare change in the sector ranges from a decline of $158 billion to a gain of $81 billion by 2100. The decline is associated with a decrease in deforestation.

TI  - Assessing economic preferences for biological diversity and ecosystem services at the Central Sulawesi rainforest margin - a choice experiment approach
T2  - STABILITY OF TROPICAL RAINFOREST MARGINS: LINKING ECOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONSTRAINTS OF LAND USE AND CONSERVATION
CP  - International Symposium on Stability of Tropical Rainforest Margins
AB  - Recognition of the importance of economically sound conservation strategies is one of the foundations of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Because of their exceptional contribution to global biological diversity, the conservation of the Central Sulawesi (Indonesia) rainforests is a particularly important case for a successful application of such strategies. One of the obstacles to the design and implementation of economically sound conservation strategies is the lack of knowledge on the economic value of non-market benefits generated by tropical forest ecosystems and the agricultural land use systems that replace them.
   In this paper, we identify and quantify economically relevant preferences towards biological diversity at the rainforest margin that operate at the regional level around Lore Lindu National Park in Central Sulawesi. For economic valuation, choice experiments (CE) were used. We focused on indirect use benefits generated from different local and regional ecosystem functions. An ecosystem service approach was applied to avoid problems of respondent unfamiliarity with ecosystem functioning. One CE study covers preferences for the conservation of the endemic dwarf buffalo anoa, the preponderance of shading trees in cacao plantations, and the availability of water and of rattan. It was conducted in 12 villages across the entire project region (n=249). A second CE was conducted in three selected villages in the Kulawi subdistrict investigating preferences for protection against soil erosion, flooding and - to our knowledge, for the first time ever - for protection against uncertain future environmental threats (preferences for "ecosystem health"; n=585).
   The results indicate substantial economic preferences for all biodiversity and ecosystem goods and services studied. Preference variations can be explained by attitudes of and perceptions on the human-environment relation. In particular, (i) several attitudinal variables from Protection Motivation Theory explain preference heterogeneity; (ii) preferences for ecosystem health depend on stated respect for Katawua - a normative principle on harmony between humans, supreme beings, and the environment. For an optimistic resource and biodiversity protection scenario, total aggregated mean WTP in the project region is 1.6 billion IDR/yri similar to 136,000 (sic)/yr). This local demand for the studied environmental non-market services does not suffice to compensate financial benefits from rainforest conversion or agroforestry intensification that accrue to individual households.

TI  - Forests and trees for social adaptation to climate variability and change
T2  - WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE
AB  - Ecosystems provide important services that can help people adapt to climate variability and change. Recognizing this role of ecosystems, several international and nongovernmental organizations have promoted an ecosystem-based approach to adaptation. We review the scientific literature related to ecosystem-based adaptation (EBA) with forests and trees, and highlight five cases in which forests and trees can support adaptation: (1) forests and trees providing goods to local communities facing climatic threats; (2) trees in agricultural fields regulating water, soil, and microclimate for more resilient production; (3) forested watersheds regulating water and protecting soils for reduced climate impacts; (4) forests protecting coastal areas from climate-related threats; and (5) urban forests and trees regulating temperature and water for resilient cities. The literature provides evidence that EBA with forests and trees can reduce social vulnerability to climate hazards; however, uncertainties and knowledge gaps remain, particularly for regulating services in watersheds and coastal areas. Few studies have been undertaken on EBA specifically, but the abundant literature on ecosystem services can be used to fill knowledge gaps. Many studies assess the multiple benefits of ecosystems for human adaptation or well-being, but also recognize trade-offs between ecosystem services. Better understanding is needed of the efficiency, costs, and benefits, and trade-offs of EBA with forests and trees. Pilot projects under implementation could serve as learning sites and existing information could be systematized and revisited with a climate change adaptation lens.

TI  - What policies improve forest cover? A systematic review of research from Mesoamerica
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - Despite many studies of the drivers of deforestation, few syntheses have been conducted of the effect of public policies on forest cover. This is problematic because policy is the primary tool that society can use to change outcomes, yet we lack information on the conditions which lead to successful policies. To address this deficiency, we conduct a meta-analysis of case studies of the impact of public policy on deforestation and reforestation in Central America and Mexico, drawing on a set of 159 studies. This region has recently experienced high rates of forest cover change and is well studied, providing a strong sampling frame. For each study, we record the reported change in forest cover, along with the scale and location of the study, the types of policy evaluated, and other relevant information. Some policy types are strongly associated with positive or negative forest impacts, though important gaps remain in our understanding. Nearly all studies of payment for ecosystem services indicate an association between payments and improvements in forest cover (88% of cases), however this evidence derives from only two countries (Mexico and Costa Rica), both of which. have more clearly defined property rights and stronger governmental institutions than other countries in the region, raising questions about generalizability. Community-based management is associated with positive impacts on forest cover in 81% of cases, whereas protected areas are associated with positive impacts in 66% of cases. Studies of social and agricultural policies were rarer and more likely to be associated with negative outcomes. Agricultural subsidies were associated with negative forest outcomes in 86% of cases, raising the possibility that reducing agricultural subsidies could be an effective strategy for improving forest cover. Most studies do not adequately identify either causal effects or the mechanisms associated with policy change, and few studies examine interactions between policy types. The results of this review imply that, while some policies are more likely to make positive contributions than others, policymakers should remain cautious about the body of evidence supporting the effectiveness of policies for reducing deforestation.

TI  - Guidance for successful tree planting initiatives
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - A growing number of initiatives at global, regional and national scales propose to plant millions, billions or even trillions of trees as a simple solution to resolve complex environmental problems. However, tree planting is much more complicated than it seems. We summarize the multifaceted decision-making process needed and offer guidelines to increase the success of the proposed ambitious efforts to increase tree cover world-wide. Given the varied definitions of and motivations for tree planting, it is critical that stakeholders work together to clearly define the biophysical and socioeconomic goals of each project. Then a series of questions must be addressed about where and how (e.g. planting trees vs. allowing for natural forest regrowth) to most effectively achieve these goals and minimize unintended negative consequences, as well as how, when and by whom success of efforts will be evaluated. Key guidelines to successfully increase tree cover include: (a) first addressing the underlying drivers of deforestation; (b) integrating decision-making across scales from local to global; (c) tailoring tree planting strategies to clearly stated project goals and planning, adaptively managing and evaluating success over a sufficiently long timeframe; (d) focusing on the forest ecosystem as a whole, and not just the trees; (e) coordinating different land uses and (f) involving stakeholders at all stages of the planning process. Synthesis and applications. Tree planting, along with other strategies to increase tree cover in appropriate locations and contexts, can make a valuable contribution to ensuring the ecological and social well-being of our planet in coming decades, but only if these efforts are considered as one component of multifaceted solutions to complex environmental problems and are carefully planned, implemented and monitored over a sufficiently long time-scale with stakeholder engagement and broader consideration of socio-ecological complexities.

TI  - Resilience of a peatland in Central Sumatra, Indonesia to past anthropogenic disturbance: Improving conservation and restoration designs using palaeoecology
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Tropical peatlands, which provide important functions such as biodiversity provisioning and carbon (C) storage, are currently threatened by land-use conversions. Thus, conservation and restoration efforts are needed to maintain their functions. Conservation concepts aiming to separate human from ecosystems are no longer conceivable. Therefore, understanding peatland resilience to human disturbance, that is the ability of peatland ecosystems to maintain their structure and function despite perturbations and to return to their predisturbance states, can assist with integrating human needs into conservation strategies and improving restoration effectiveness. Understanding ecosystem resilience is often impeded by a lack of long-term data, which can be obtained from palaeoecological studies. Located close to the archaeological remains of the Malayu Empire, the Sungai Buluh peatland in Sumatra, Indonesia provides an opportunity to study the resilience of a tropical peatland to past human disturbance. We subjected a 250-cm-long peat core to palynological, charcoal and C content analyses to delineate the anthropogenic impact on the peatland and the ecosystem's response. The results revealed that extensive human activities in Sungai Buluh such as logging, grazing/cut-and-carry, and wild-harvesting started soon after humans occupied the vicinity of the peatland c. 1,000cal yr bp. Even without fire use and cultivation, these activities were able to alter vegetation composition and decrease the peatland's C sequestration capacity. Following site abandonment after the demise of the Malayu Empire at c. 600cal yr bp, the palaeoecological record suggests that the Sungai Buluh peatland recovered in terms of both floristic composition and C sink function, with the latter recovering faster (c. 60years) than the former (c. 170years).Synthesis. The palaeoecological record from Sungai Buluh provides the first evidence of tropical peatland recovery following human disturbance, which can help improve present peatland conservation/restoration strategies. The design of peatland wise-use strategies can mimic the resilience-friendly human activities identified in this study. Consideration should also be given to selecting rapidly regenerating taxa for cost-and-effort-efficient restoration strategies. Additionally, the 170-year recovery time of the Sungai Buluh peatland suggests that the 60-year timeframe currently allocated in most tropical peatland restoration projects may be insufficient.

TI  - Degradation of soil nutrients and slow recovery of biomass following shifting cultivation in the heath forests of Sarawak, Malaysia
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Heath forests which are tropical forests on sandy soils are widely distributed in Borneo and provide many ecosystem services, such as carbon storage and non-timber forest products. Over the past several decades, such forests have been disturbed by non-traditional shifting cultivation, which is usually conducted in unsuitable land with short fallow duration. Anthropogenic disturbances in forests growing on sandy soils that have low nutrient retention capacities may promote further reductions in soil fertility. Long-term monitoring of soil nutrients and biomass accumulation is rare in degraded tropical rainforests growing on sandy soils despite the known negative effects of non-traditional shifting cultivation practices on soil fertility, vegetation and biomass recovery, and the growth of trees planted to rehabilitate forests. The objective of the current study was therefore to elucidate changes in soil fertility and biomass recovery potential in degraded forests on sandy soils in Borneo. We monitored soil nutrients and chemical properties in fifty-four 12 x 12 m plots located on different topographical positions along upper and lower slopes. Samples were collected in plots aged 7 and 14 years after abandonment of shifting cultivation. The biomass of secondary forest trees in all plots 12 years after the abandonment was also measured to determine the relationship between biomass accumulation and changes in soil nutrients. We found that soil pH and cation exchange capacity, and the concentrations of most nutrients, including nitrogen, magnesium, and phosphorus, had decreased significantly 7-14 years after abandonment; biomass accumulation in the plots was also limited 12 years after abandonment ( < 0.8 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)). These changes in soil traits within the study plots were similar regardless of topographical position, and the changes were not related to the amount of biomass. Soil nutrients in the plots may have leached out as a result of removal of thick root mats in the surface soil, high sand content, and large amounts of rainfall in the area rather than uptake by recovering trees. These results indicate that it may be difficult to recover soil fertility on steep slopes in sandy soil conditions because of high leaching rates and erosion when the soil surface layer is destroyed by shifting cultivation. It is therefore important to carefully manage shifting cultivation practices in tropical forests on sandy soils in Borneo.

TI  - Opportunities for Integrating Social Science into Research on Dry Forest Restoration: A Mini-Review
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Seasonally dry tropical forest ecosystems have been greatly reduced in areas through conversions to alternate land uses such as grazing and crop production. The U.N. Decade on Restoration has focused attention on both restoration globally, and also regional attention on tropical dry forests, as they are excellent candidates for regeneration and reforestation. As such, the science of how we restore dry forests is advancing; however, few studies of dry forest restoration include collaborations with social scientists. This is unfortunate, because restoration projects that embrace a people-centered approach have the highest chances of success. Here, I review recent studies that have incorporated aspects of social science and human dimensions into the study and design of dry forest restoration practices. I focus on three key topics that merit a closer integration of restoration research and practice and social science: (1) recognizing that local people are central to project success, (2) cost benefit or effectiveness analyses that evaluate the relative costs of alternative management strategies, and (3) identification of land-use tradeoffs, synergisms and priority mapping. I conclude that closer collaborations among dry forest restoration researchers and a wider group of partners including social scientists, local communities, environmental educators, and geographers will increase the value of restoration research and the likelihood that such projects achieve multiple ecological and societal benefits.

TI  - On the forest cover-water yield debate: from demand- to supply-side thinking
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Several major articles from the past decade and beyond conclude the impact of reforestation or afforestation on water yield is negative: additional forest cover will reduce and removing forests will raise downstream water availability. A second group of authors argue the opposite: planting additional forests should raise downstream water availability and intensify the hydrologic cycle. Obtaining supporting evidence for this second group of authors has been more difficult due to the larger scales at which the positive effects of forests on the water cycle may be seen. We argue that forest cover is inextricably linked to precipitation. Forest-driven evapotranspiration removed from a particular catchment contributes to the availability of atmospheric moisture vapor and its cross-continental transport, raising the likelihood of precipitation events and increasing water yield, in particular in continental interiors more distant from oceans. Seasonal relationships heighten the importance of this phenomenon. We review the arguments from different scales and perspectives. This clarifies the generally beneficial relationship between forest cover and the intensity of the hydrologic cycle. While evidence supports both sides of the argument trees can reduce runoff at the small catchment scale at larger scales, trees are more clearly linked to increased precipitation and water availability. Progressive deforestation, land conversion from forest to agriculture and urbanization have potentially negative consequences for global precipitation, prompting us to think of forest ecosystems as global public goods. Policy-making attempts to measure product water footprints, estimate the value of ecosystem services, promote afforestation, develop drought mitigation strategies and otherwise manage land use must consider the linkage of forests to the supply of precipitation.

TI  - An alternative approach for mapping burn scars using Landsat imagery, Google Earth Engine, and Deep Learning in the Brazilian Savanna
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The Cerrado biome in Brazil is characterized by a mosaic of vegetation types similar to African savanna and has one of the highest levels of biodiversity in the world. Wildfires have historically contributed to shaping the natural vegetation and are now being used in the establishment and management of agricultural systems and pastures. Consequently, the fire regime has been changing over the last few decades and increasingly affecting native vegetation, natural habitats, and ecosystem services in tropical regions. Mapping fire dynamics and spatial distribution are crucial to assess impacts on ecosystems and to define and enforce strategies and measures of fire control and prevention. In this study, we developed an alternative approach for mapping burned areas in the Cerrado biome in Brazil, using Landsat imagery and Deep Learning algorithm, implemented on the Google Earth Engine and on Google Cloud Storage platform. We compared our mapping results with two Burned Area products developed by INPE (30 m resolution) and MODIS MCD64A1 Burned Area Product (500 m resolution). Additionally, we assessed the accuracies of these three mapping products using 2,200 validation points within the study area. By comparing our mapping result with MCD64A1 and INPE burn scar products, we estimated an average agreement of 34% for both. We observed that most mapping disagreements were mainly because of the effects of clouds/shadow conditions that affected the ability for spectral observations, differences in methodologies, and spatial resolution of each remotely sensed datasets used for mapping burned areas. Our validation results indicated an overall accuracy of 97% of our methodological approach for mapping burned areas and, therefore, it can be successfully applied across savanna regions. Our results showed that 202,230 km(2) was affected by fires within the Cerrado biome in 2017, in which 31% overlapped cropping lands (agricultural fields and pastures) and 67% overlapped various types of native vegetation (forest, savanna and grassland). Our proposed methodological approach and its results can be useful to enforce environmental command and control policies and to estimate carbon emissions, analyses interactions between climate and ecological drivers of fire, develop predictive models of fire risk dynamics, and providing spatial information that can help public policies and fire management/prevention actions for the Cerrado conservation.

Policies to conserve the forests depend on being able to demonstrate their economic value and on social measures involving local community participation. Research to calculate the total economic value of the forests has involved estimating the direct use value of forest products, the indirect values from environmental benefits and services, and option and existence values. Threats to the forest have endangered the social and economic welfare of many indigenous groups; their survival and the conservation of the forests can often be achieved by reinforcing traditional systems of land tenure and environmental management.

TI  - A Synthesis of the Available Evidence to Guide the Design of Mixed-Species Forest Plantings for Smallholder and Community Forestry
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
AB  - There is growing interest in using multi-species plantation systems when undertaking reforestation for timber production. Such plantations can have ecological and socio-economic advantages over those of traditional monocultures. Despite increasing evidence about the functional advantages of increasing species richness in reforestation, there are few silvicultural guidelines to assist in the design and management of multi-species plantings. This paper presents the results of a systematic assessment of previous studies of mixed-species plantings with a particular focus on their advantages and disadvantages for meeting the needs of rural smallholders and communities in tropical regions. Research on mixed-species plantations has increased in recent years. Many earlier studies were concerned with the capacity of mixed-species plantings to improve productivity or the nutritional impacts of mixtures. Many of these studies emphasised young plantations and mixtures of a few relatively fast-growing Acacia, Eucalyptus and Pinus species. More recent studies have explored a wider range of outcomes arising from using mixtures including on the supply of ecosystem services. Issues deserving further study concern the economic advantages or disadvantages of mixed-species plantations, how these plantations might be designed to suit various environmental and socio-economic situations, and how to manage older mixed-species plantations where the interactions between species may be different to those in younger plantations. There is also a need to explore how increased species richness may affect the capacity of new plantations to withstand damage from insect pests or disturbances such as storms or wildfire.

TI  - Relationship of bioclimatic and topographic variation on species-biomass distribution in tropical forest reserve
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Forests are essential for the ecological functioning providing critical habitats for biodiversity and hold large biomass, which are affected by bioclimatic and topographical variables. This study investigated the topographic factor (elevation) that play an important role in forest diversity and biomass distribution. The present study examined the relationship between topographical (viz. elevation, slope, aspects) and Bioclimatic variables (temperature/ precipitation) with measured biomass of Tropical forests. The study area selected is Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR), a tropical forest with high conservation priorities with fewer disturbances. Earth observation datasets such as ALOS-PALSAR, SRTM, and GEDI aboveground biomass density (AGBD) are retrieved in the Cloud computing platform (GGE) to generate outcomes. The study also utilized Bioclimatic variables such as maximum, minimum and mean temperature during warmest/coldest month and warmest, coldest, wettest, driest Quarters. GEDI derived mean biomass was observed to be 1.3 to 95 Mg/ha +/- (0.68-5.88 SD). The data was statistically analyzed using correlation coefficient (R) for topographic and bioclimatic variables. Results specified six Biodiversity indices (BDI), and six bioclimatic variables during analysis. Correlation coefficient (R) indicated strong positive relationship of three biodiversity indices with elevation for Shannon - Weiner index (R = 0.71) followed by Margalef richness index (R = 0.65) and reciprocal Simpson index (R = 0.61). While Buzas and Gibson Index (R=-0.45), Berger dominance index (R=-0.27), and Menhinick index (R=-0.51) showed negative correlation with elevation. Overall, topographic and bioclimatic variables are governed by elevation for biomass and carbon stocks (with r=-0.41). Similarly, correlation coefficient (R) of elevation against max temperature during Warmest month (MTMW), Warmest Quarter (MTWarQ) and Wettest Quarter (MTWetQ) indicated strong negative correlation with R value of -0.88, -0.88, and - 0.87 respectivelry. It is followed by MTColdest Quarter (R=-0.85) and MinTCM (R=-0.84). while lowest correlation was shown by Min Temp during Driest Quarter with R=-0.23. Outcomes showed declining trends of biomass stocks ranged from 129.44 mg/t to 7.07 mg/t with significantly increasing trends till mid elevation and thereafter decreasing trends of tree biomass with increasing elevation. Highest biomass of 95 mg/t (GEDI derived) and Field measured Biomass of 129.44 mg/t was observed at intermediate elevation of 530 m after that showed decline in biomass distribution. Elevation can act as a dominant determinant for AGB in tropical forest for several reasons, such as topographic variations, temperature variations, precipitation patterns, soil nutrient availability, species adaptation, disturbance regimes, and most influencing one is human activities. Therefore, elevation can be a crucial predictor in conjunction with other factors to influence biomass at undisturbed places with high slopes and controlled species richness, distribution and biomass accumulation in tree species.

TI  - Strong but taxon-specific responses of termites and wood-nesting ants to forest regeneration in Borneo
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Land use change is accelerating globally at the expense of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Invertebrates are numerically dominant and functionally important in old growth tropical rain forests but highly susceptible to the adverse effects of forest degradation and fragmentation. Ants (Formicidae) and termites (Blattodea: Termitoidae) perform crucial ecosystem services. Here, the potential effects of anthropogenic disturbance on ant and termite communities in dead wood are investigated. Community composition, generic richness, and occupancy rates of ants and termites were compared among two old growth sites (Danum Valley and Maliau Basin) and one twice-logged site (the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems' (SAFE) Project), in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Occupancy was measured as the number of ant or termite encounters (1) per deadwood items, and (2) per deadwood volume, and acts as surrogates for relative abundance (or generic richness). Termites had a lower wood-occupancy per volume in logged forest. In contrast, there were more ant encounters, and more ant genera, in logged sites and there was a community shift (especially, there were more Crematogaster encounters). The disruption of soil and canopy structure in logged forest may reduce both termite and fungal decay rates, inducing increased deadwood residence times and therefore favoring ants that nest in dead wood. There is an anthropogenic-induced shift of dead wood in ants and termites in response to disturbance in tropical rain forests and the nature of that shift is taxon-specific.

TI  - Spatially explicit estimates of forest carbon emissions, mitigation costs and REDD plus opportunities in Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Carbon emissions from the conversion and degradation of tropical forests contribute to anthropogenic climate change. Implementing programs to reduce emissions from tropical forest loss in Southeast Asia are perceived to be expensive due to high opportunity costs of avoided deforestation. However, these costs are not representative of all REDD+ opportunities as they are typically based on average costs across large land areas and are primarily for reducing deforestation from oil palm or pulp concessions. As mitigation costs and carbon benefits can vary according to site characteristics, spatially-explicit information should be used to assess costeffectiveness and to guide the allocation of scarce REDD+ resources. We analyzed the costeffectiveness of the following REDD+ strategies in Indonesia, one of the world's largest sources of carbon emissions from deforestation: halting additional deforestation in protected areas, timber and oil palm concessions, reforesting degraded land and employing reduced-impact logging techniques in logging concessions. We discover that when spatial variation in costs and benefits is considered, low-cost options emerged even for the two most expensive strategies: protecting forests from conversion to oil palm and timber plantations. To achieve a low emissions reduction target of 25%, we suggest funding should target deforestation in protected areas, and oil palm and timber concessions to maximize emissions reductions at the lowest cumulative cost. Low-cost opportunities for reducing emissions from oil palm are where concessions have been granted on deep peat deposits or unproductive land. To achieve a high emissions reduction target of 75%, funding is allocated across all strategies, emphasizing that no single strategy can reduce emissions cost-effectively across all of Indonesia. These findings demonstrate that by using a spatiallytargeted approach to identify high priority locations for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, REDD+ resources can be allocated cost-effectively across Indonesia.

TI  - Accelerating tropical forest restoration through the selective removal of pioneer species
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Demand for tropical forest restoration has grown rapidly as the potential role of recovering secondary forests in sequestering carbon and enhancing biodiversity has been recognised. Active forest management is often prescribed to accelerate natural regeneration, but evidence for the efficacy of interventions is scarce for tropical forests. In this study we examine the hypothesis that the selective removal of abundant pioneers in the understory of recovering selectively logged forests can improve the composition of forest stands and accelerate succession. Four selective thinning treatments of increasing intensity were implemented in 8.75 ha compartments and replicated six times. Within each compartment, three monitoring plots were established and measured immediately after thinning and one year later to assess implementation of thinning treatments, growth and survival of stems, and changes in stand composition. Canopy openness was measured using hemispherical photography. Thinning treatments substantially reduced the abundance of pioneers, but there was only a slight increase in canopy openness (3.7-4.3%) relative to the control (1.8%) 8 months after implementation. Canopy openness increased dramatically across all treatments in the follow year due to the 2015-16 El Nino event and increased more in thinning treatments. Large (>10 cm dbh) and small (2-10 cm dbh) late-successional stems showed enhanced growth only in the low intensity thinning treatment, whereas the growth of small pioneer stems increased across the thinning intensity gradient. The cost of implementing thinning treatments was $US80 per ha or approximately 10% of the cost of planting treatments in the same forest. Our findings suggest that selective thinning of understory pioneer stems is a practical option for manipulating stand composition and potentially accelerating natural regeneration. Continued monitoring of the experiment should reveal the long-term impact and cost-effectiveness of treatments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The impact of a run-of-the-river hydroelectric dam on a non-volant small-mammal assemblage in Brazilian Amazonia
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
AB  - There are few scientific studies evaluating the impact of the loss of wetlands on the banks of tropical rivers on assemblages of small non-flying mammals. To understand the possible deleterious effects of hydroelectric construction in tropical forests on this group of mammals, we used data from 2 years of monitoring carried out during the period before the filling of a hydroelectric plant reservoir in the Brazilian Amazon, and related them to vegetation, soil and topography. We captured 659 individuals of 20 small-mammal species. The species assemblage composition in the flooded areas was a subset of species that occurred in both floodable and non-floodable areas, and only one species was captured exclusively in the flooded area. Species composition was influenced by the proportion of sand, by soil nutrient concentration and distance from water bodies. We conclude that there is no evidence that the flooding of low-lying areas along the Madeira River would negatively affect the assemblage of non-flying small mammals in the short term because the remaining areas have similar assemblages of small mammals as those destined for flooding. Whether the area lost will be important for population dynamics will depend on the conservation of the remaining areas.

TI  - Climate change mitigation potential of Atlantic Forest reforestations
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - International agendas focus on limiting unchecked climate change through extensive mitigation. Worldwide, several reforestation initiatives strive to achieve ambitious goals and promote carbon sequestration on land. The greatest potential for reforestation lies within the tropics, and the Atlantic Forest is among the protagonists. However, little is known about the potential of these reforestations to mitigate climate change. Here, we assessed the carbon sequestration potential of Atlantic Forest reforestations, both in the field and in the available scientific literature. We demonstrate that the Atlantic Forest reforestations provide valuable contributions to climate change mitigation. Even at young age, reforestations have astonishing potential, with much higher carbon sequestration rates than un-assisted natural regeneration of later successional stages. Although with lesser potential, un-assisted natural regeneration remnants can also be a valuable strategy to aid climate mitigation, especially when close to reforestations or old-growth forests. We found far greater potential of sequestration in all types of forests inside protected areas than unprotected ones, highlighting the noteworthy benefits of conservation that buffers degradation. Climate action is urgent, and the Atlantic Forest certainly is a great contributor to the achievement of such ambitious goals.

TI  - Climate benefits of Amazon secondary forests-recent advances and research needs
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - A quarter of the deforested Amazon has regrown as secondary tropical forest and yet the climatic importance of these complex regenerating landscapes is only beginning to be recognised. Advances in satellite remote-sensing have transformed our ability to detect and map changes in forest cover, while detailed ground-based measurements from permanent monitoring plots and eddy-covariance flux towers are providing new insights into the role of secondary forests in the climate system. This review summarises how progress in data availability on Amazonian secondary forests has led to better understanding of their influence on global, regional and local climate through carbon and non-carbon climate benefits. We discuss the climate implications of secondary forest disturbance and the progress in representing forest regrowth in climate models. Much remains to be learned about how secondary forests function and interact with climate, how these processes change with forest age, and the resilience of secondary forest ecosystems faced with increasing anthropogenic disturbance. Secondary forests face numerous threats: half of secondary forests in the Brazilian legal Amazon were 11 years old or younger in 2023. On average, 1%-2% of Amazon secondary forests burn each year, threatening the permanence of sequestered carbon. The forests that burn are predominantly young (in 2023, 55% of burned secondary forests were <6 years old, <4% were over 30 years old). In the context of legally binding international climate treaties and a rapidly changing political backdrop, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of encouraging tropical forest restoration to mitigate anthropogenic climate change. Amazon secondary forests could make a valuable contribution to Brazil's Nationally Determined Contribution provided there are robust systems in place to ensure permanence. We consider how to improve communication between scientists and decision-makers and identify pressing areas of future research.

TI  - Forest Carbon Sequestration and Global Change
T2  - PARADIGM OF FORESTS AND THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST
AB  - Forests contain 70-80 percent of terrestrial carbon (C) and represent a global C sink, despite of continued deforestation. On the other hand, forests and land-use change (LUC) account for the largest uncertainties within the global C balance. The future role of forests is even more uncertain within the context of global change. The question if forests will shift from C sinks to sources is fundamental for conservation and management. We aim to synthesize current knowledge on the role of the major forest biomes in the global C cycle. Furthermore, we evaluate management options, based on their potential to maximize greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation and other benefits from forest ecosystems. Whereas boreal and temperate forests currently act as net sinks, there is a potential for increased insect outbreaks, fires, and droughts. Pressure from infrastructure development and the demand for biomass fuels is increasing. Tropical forests account for the largest gross C sink, but face deforestation and degradation. The future role of tropical forests depends mostly on LUC dynamics. Uncertainties persist about deforestation rates and impacts from global change. It is clear, however, that changes in the C balance of tropical forests will affect atmospheric CO2 levels on a global scale. In managed temperate and boreal forests, aboveground carbon (AGC) can be maximized by optimizing rotation cycles in even-aged stands. Mixed-species stands may increase productivity and resilience to disturbances. Research is needed on the impacts of silvicultural activities on soil organic carbon (SOC). In the tropics, reforestation and deforestation avoidance are the most important GHG mitigation pathways. Lessons learnt from REDD (reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) pilot projects may help to establish GHG mitigation strategies in the future. The majority of timber harvest in the tropics is unsustainable and could be improved by extending rotation cycles, reduced impact logging, and long-term management planning. International support is needed to ensure capacity building and strong institutions, and to create incentives for global markets. The extension of planted forests is growing worldwide. Plantations sequester important amounts of C, although afforestation may initially lead to SOC losses, and AGC storage over multiple rotation cycles is low, compared to natural forests. Conservation of old-growth forests is the most effective way to secure C storage.

TI  - The conservation of saproxylic insects in tropical forests: a research agenda
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
AB  - Invariably, insects are overlooked when tropical forest management issues are discussed, because there are so many species, they are taxonomically intractable and so poorly known. Often people take the view that if you look after the vegetation and vertebrates, the insects will look after themselves. This may be true for some functional groups, but for saproxylic insects, this seems unlikely. Their study deserves high priority, since they are dependent on the very resource - wood - whose removal from the ecosystem is the usual object of forest management. Given the current international effort to develop 'criteria and indicators' to monitor sustainable forest management for biodiversity values, there is a window of opportunity for sound ecological research on saproxylic insects to influence the formulation of forest policy such that their needs can be taken into account. There is already a large body of knowledge on temperate and boreal region saproxylic insects, and on the effects that logging has on them, but knowledge of the tropical forest situation lags far behind. This paper proposes a research agenda to enable the needs of saproxylic insects to be taken into account in natural forest management in the tropics. Basic questions, such as whether logging has so far had an impact on tropical saproxylic insects, and whether there are workable sampling techniques to investigate this, still remain to be addressed and deserve high priority. The links between the responses of saproxylic insects and more 'charismatic' study species need to be investigated. We also need to know whether there is a correlation between the intensity of logging and the response of saproxylic insects, and, critically, whether we would be justified in measuring some surrogate aspects of forest structure (as potential habitat for saproxylic insects) rather than the saproxylic insects themselves, and modelling this to determine likely impacts of different management regimes. We consider such an ambitious research agenda as justified given the scale of impact that forest use and management is likely to have on tropical forest insects in the future.

TI  - Recovery of litter inhabiting beetle assemblages during forest regeneration in the Atlantic forest of Southern Brazil
T2  - INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY
AB  - 1. As mature tropical forests disappear, secondary forests with their potential to conserve mature tropical forest species are increasingly of interest in a conservation context.
   2. We investigated the recovery of litter inhabiting beetle diversity and composition during natural forest regeneration in the coastal submontane forest of Southern Brazil, using chronosequences on two different soil types: cambisol and gleysol. Secondary forests, ranging in ages from 5 to 50 years, as well as old-growth forests were studied. Beetles were sifted from leaf litter and extracted using the Winkler technique.
   3. Young secondary forests had a very low species density and a significantly different and heterogeneous species composition compared to old-growth forests. During forest regeneration, species density greatly increased and the species composition of older secondary forests was similar to that of old-growth forests. The recovery pattern of species density and composition differed between soil types; nonetheless, they showed the same tendencies generally. Thus, mature secondary forests of about 35-50 years can be assumed to contribute substantially to the maintenance of forest beetle species.
   4. Litter quantity was not only significantly correlated with species density; but, even reflected the density pattern of both soil types. Thus, litter quantity is an important factor for maintaining or recovering high beetle densities. The composition of beetle assemblages was strongly affected by soil type. Thus, soil type should be considered in regional biodiversity monitoring and conservation actions.

TI  - Unmanned aerial vehicle and artificial intelligence revolutionizing efficient and precision sustainable forest management
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - The ecological value of tropical forests in water conservation district has been of great interest because of their rich vegetation types and higher biomass density than any other land cover types, it is urgent to evaluate the ecological value of tropical forests in water conservation district. However, the monitoring of tropical forests in water conservation district is faced with many problems, such as high forest density, complexity and diversity of the forest structure, complex topography and climate conditions, and the difficulty of access for investigators. In order to solve the above difficulties, this study combined 3D point cloud reconstruction based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle - Structure from Motion (UAV-SfM) technology with forest type classification based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method, combined with a small amount of forest permanent sample plot survey data, to accurately evaluate the forest biomass distribution and forest biodiversity in water conservation district. The results show that the overall classification accuracy of the 20 forest types in water conservation district based on the CNN method is 0.61, the overall Kappa coefficient is 0.59, and the conditional Kappa coefficient is concentrated in the range of 0.43-0.85. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the plane measurement of UAV-SfM technology is 0.432 m, and the RMSE of the elevation measurement is 0.989 m, the effect of this UAV technology in tropical forest monitoring is superior. Using the techniques mentioned above, this study can effectively and accurately monitor and evaluate the biomass distribution and biodiversity of tropical forests in the water conservation district. Based on the precision forest ecological monitoring data, this study can develop a scientific and reasonable sustainable forest management plan for the water conservation district according to the distribution of forest biomass and biodiversity. The combination of UAV-SfM technology and the CNN method is an innovative attempt, and the integration of UAV and artificial intelligence technology solves practical problems faced by sustainable forest management. UAV and artificial intelligence will also provide an important foundation for forest ecological environment sustainability assessment research.

TI  - Species Richness, Forest Structure, and Functional Diversity During Succession in the New Guinea Lowlands
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Much of the world's tropical forests have been affected by anthropogenic disturbance. These forests are important biodiversity reservoirs whose diversity, structure and function must be characterized across the successional sequence. We examined changes in structure and diversity along a successional gradient in the lowlands of New Guinea. To do this, we measured and identified all stems 5cm diameter in 19 0.25ha plots ranging in age from 3 to >50yr since disturbance. We also measured plant functional traits related to establishment, performance, and competitive ability. In addition, we examined change in forest structure, composition, species diversity, and functional diversity through succession. By using rarefaction to estimate functional diversity, we compared changes in functional diversity while controlling for associated differences in stem and species density. Basal area and species density increased with stand age while stem density was highest in intermediate secondary forests. Species composition differed strongly between mature and secondary forests. As forests increased in basal area, community-weighted mean wood density and foliar carbon increased, whereas specific leaf area and proportion of stems with exudate decreased. Foliar nitrogen peaked in medium-aged forests. Functional diversity was highest in mature forests, even after accounting for differences in stem and species diversity. Our study represents one of the first attempts to document successional changes in New Guinea's lowland forest. We found robust evidence that as succession proceeds, communities occupy a greater range of functional trait space even after controlling for stem and species density. High functional diversity is important for ecological resiliency in the face of global change.

TI  - Impact of a native invasive weed (Microstegium ciliatum) on regeneration of a tropical forest
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
AB  - Infestations of invasive plants can hinder forest regeneration in biodiversity hotspots in tropical Asia. Microstegium ciliatum is a native grass in parts of tropical and subtropical Asia. To assess impacts of Microstegium on secondary forest succession in its native range, a field experiment was undertaken in abandoned agricultural settlements in Cuc Phuong National Park, Vietnam from 2016 to 2018. Plots were established across 6 sites under low, medium and high tree canopy levels. In manipulated plots, M. ciliatum was killed with a grass-specific herbicide and invading vines were cut in a subset of plots; control plots were untreated. The results show that in its native range Microstegium can be invasive with impacts on forest restoration. Application of herbicide reduced the cover of M. ciliatum from 85 to 3% and increased the diversity and number of tree seedlings within the 2 years of the experiment. There was no difference in tree seedling abundance between the herbicide and herbicide + vine cutting treatments, but the number of tree seedling species was significantly higher in the latter in the 2nd year after treatments were applied under the medium canopy. The overstory influenced forest regeneration in the manipulated plots as there was a greater number of tree seedlings and species in plots under medium and high-density canopies. The results suggest that management of the native invasive grass under tree canopies will facilitate forest restoration after disturbance from agriculture and lead to the early recruitment of mid and late successional forest species.

TI  - Logging roads in tropical forests: Synthesis of literature written in French and English highlights environmental impact reduction through improved engineering
T2  - BOIS ET FORETS DES TROPIQUES
AB  - Logging roads are considered to be a major cause of forest degradation because of their direct and indirect impacts on ecosystem functioning and biodiversity. Given the prevalence of logging in tropical forests around the world, effective road management is of crucial importance to reduce both logging-related environmental impacts and the costs of logging operations. Through a review of the literature, our study analysed how logging roads have been addressed in scientific articles to date. We compared studies published over the past 65 years in the Bois et Forets des Tropiques journal (BFT), mostly written in French, with a range of more recent articles from the Scopus and Web of Knowledge databases. Half of the articles in BFT were published before 1972, while the more generalist databases show a steady increase in publications on the subject since then, up to the current peak number. From the entire body of literature, we selected 126 articles dealing with impacts and management of logging roads in tropical forests around the world for critical appraisal. The BFT articles were characterized by a strong focus on practical issues in forest road engineering, while the focus of many publications written in English was on the identification of road impacts on forest ecosystems. Road-related environmental impacts stem from the loss of forest cover during construction, the increase in edge effects, soil erosion and interference with wildlife, as well as from the resulting easier access to the forest for hunting and agricultural colonization. Based on this review, we present a list of recommended measures to reduce these impacts. We conclude that, despite the continuing attention given to the subject of logging roads, little is known about how they evolve in the forest landscape over the long term.

TI  - Tree Diversity Increases Carbon Stocks and Fluxes Above-But Not Belowground in a Tropical Forest Experiment
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - International commitments advocate large-scale forest restoration as a nature-based solution to climate change mitigation through carbon (C) sequestration. Mounting evidence suggests that mixed compared to monospecific planted forests may sequester more C, exhibit lower susceptibility to climate extremes and offer a broader range of ecosystem services. However, experimental studies comprehensively examining the control of tree diversity on multiple C stocks and fluxes above- and belowground are lacking. To address this gap, we leverage data from the Sardinilla experiment in Panama, the oldest tropical tree diversity experiment, which features a gradient of one-, two-, three- and five-species mixtures of native tree species. Over 16 years, we measured multiple above- and belowground C stocks and fluxes, ranging from tree aboveground C, over leaf litter C production, to soil organic carbon (SOC). We show that tree diversity significantly increased aboveground C stocks and fluxes, with a 57% higher gain in aboveground tree C in five-species mixtures compared to monocultures (35.7 +/- 1.8 vs. 22.8 +/- 3.4 Mg C ha(-1)) 16 years after planting. In contrast, we observed a net reduction in SOC (on average -11.2 +/- 1.1 Mg C ha(-1) across diversity levels) and no significant difference in SOC3 stocks (the predominantly tree-derived, i.e., C-3 plant-derived SOC fraction) between five-species mixtures and monocultures (13.0 +/- 0.9 vs. 15.1 +/- 1.3 Mg C ha(-1)). Positive tree diversity effects persisted despite repeated climate extremes and strengthened over time for aboveground tree growth. Structural equation models showed that higher tree growth in mixtures enhanced leaf litter and coarse woody debris C fluxes to the soil, resulting in a tightly linked C cycle aboveground. However, we did not observe significant links between above- and belowground C stocks and fluxes. Our study elucidates the mechanisms through which higher tree diversity bolsters the climate mitigation potential of tropical forest restoration. Restoration schemes should prioritize mixed over monospecific planted forests.

TI  - Predictive model for sustaining biodiversity in tropical countryside
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Growing demand for food, fuel, and fiber is driving the intensification and expansion of agricultural land through a corresponding displacement of native woodland, savanna, and shrubland. In the wake of this displacement, it is clear that farmland can support biodiversity through preservation of important ecosystem elements at a fine scale. However, how much biodiversity can be sustained and with what tradeoffs for production are open questions. Using a well-studied tropical ecosystem in Costa Rica, we develop an empirically based model for quantifying the "wildlife-friendliness" of farmland for native birds. Some 80% of the 166 mist-netted species depend on fine-scale countryside forest elements (<= 60-m-wide clusters of trees, typically of variable length and width) that weave through farmland along hilltops, valleys, rivers, roads, and property borders. Our model predicts with similar to 75% accuracy the bird community composition of any part of the landscape. We find conservation value in small (<= 20 m wide) clusters of trees and somewhat larger (<= 60 m wide) forest remnants to provide substantial support for biodiversity beyond the borders of tropical forest reserves. Within the study area, forest elements on farms nearly double the effective size of the local forest reserve, providing seminatural habitats for bird species typically associated with the forest. Our findings provide a basis for estimating and sustaining biodiversity in farming systems through managing fine-scale ecosystem elements and, more broadly, informing ecosystem service analyses, biodiversity action plans, and regional land use strategies.

TI  - Aliens in the Arc: Are Invasive Trees a Threat to the Montane Forests of East Africa?
T2  - PLANT INVASIONS IN PROTECTED AREAS: PATTERNS, PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES
AB  - Although plant invasions are often regarded as a significant threat to global biodiversity, current understanding of the vulnerability of tropical forests to invasion or the factors that lead to alien species becoming invasive in the tropics remains limited. Here, we synthesise available information on plant invasions in protected areas for the most ecologically important montane forests of East Africa. We undertake a hierarchical analysis to explore patterns across the entire mountain chain with those within an individual mountain block down to a single nature reserve. A common feature of the occurrence of alien trees in the Eastern Arc Mountains is the overwhelming importance of propagule pressure in the representation of species found colonising forests. The patterns observed emphasise the need for scientifically sound advice regarding not only the potential impact of an alien species on native biodiversity but also an assessment of which mitigation strategies might be most appropriate and highlights the research, control and social challenges of managing invasive agroforestry trees in the tropics.

TI  - Trade-offs between tree cover, carbon storage and floristic biodiversity in reforesting landscapes
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB  - This study explores the relationships between an increase in tree cover area (i.e., natural and planted-tree land covers) and changes in forest carbon storage and the potential of a landscape to provide habitat for native floristic biodiversity. Four areas experiencing an increase in tree cover were analyzed. We developed a metric estimating the potential to support native biodiversity based on tree cover type (plantation or natural forests) and the landscape pattern of natural and anthropogenic land covers. We used published estimates for forest and plantation carbon stocks for each region. Focus regions in northwestern Costa Rica, northern Vietnam, southern Chile and highland Ecuador all showed an increase in tree cover area of 390 %, 260 %, 123 % and 418 %, respectively. Landscapes experiencing increases in natural secondary forest also experienced an increase in carbon stored above and below ground, and in the potential to support native floristic biodiversity. Study landscapes in Chile and Ecuador experiencing an expansion of exotic plantations saw their carbon stock decrease along with their potential to support native floristic biodiversity. This study shows that an increase in forest area does not necessarily imply an increased provision of ecosystem services when landscapes are reforesting with monoculture plantations of exotic tree species. Changes in the support of native biodiversity and the carbon stored in pulp rotation plantations, along with other ecosystem services, should be fully considered before implementing reforestation projects.

TI  - Variability of soil surface characteristics in a mountainous watershed in Valle del Cauca, Colombia: Implications for runoff, erosion, and conservation
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB  - Understanding catchment sediment or solute transport frequently relies on understanding of soil nutrient conditions and physical properties. This study investigates hydropedological patterns in a tropical catchment by understanding soil nutrient and soil surface changes. Soil nutrient concentrations and hydraulic properties were measured from the La Vega micro watershed in the southwestern Colombian Andes at 16 distributed locations in four elevation ranges (between 1450 and 1700 m a.s.l.). The site is a part of a conservation partnerships which implements programs and monitor impacts. Soil samples were analyzed for total nitrogen (TN), Bray II-available phosphorus, exchangeable cations, pH, organic matter, and texture. Soil hydraulic conductivities at two depths (0-5 cm and 5-10 cm) were determined in conservation implementation areas (enclosures and natural regrowth). In the upper elevation range, regrowth of natural vegetation was found on deep soils (similar to 3 m) with moderate infiltration (26 cm hr(-1)), the lowest bulk density (0.92 g cm(-3)), and the highest TN (0.4%). The lowest elevation (mixed land use of grazing and riparian forests with deep profiles) had the lowest infiltration (4 cm hr(-1)), highest bulk density (1.02 g cm(-3)), and the lowest TN (0.26%). In the middle elevation ranges, conserved tropical forest vegetation were located on shallow soil depths with high organic matter (similar to 6%) and high infiltration (86 cm hr(-1)). The lowest infiltration rate average (2.3 cm hr(-1)) exceeded the estimated erosive regional precipitation intensity (similar to 2.5 cm hr(-1)) about 60% of the time, while the median infiltration rate (10 cm hr(-1)) exceeded rainfall intensities 94% of the time, indicating that infiltration excess and saturation excess runoff mechanisms are both present. Coupling data with sediment concentration and solute concentration patterns can help discern correlations between scales and will help to monitor effectiveness of conservation programs aimed at sustaining ecosystem services.

TI  - Restoring tropical forests on lands mined for bauxite: Examples from the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Restoring self-sustaining tropical forest ecosystems on surface mined sites is a formidable challenge that requires the integration of proven reclamation techniques and reforestation strategies appropriate to specific site conditions, including landscape biodiversity patterns. Restorationists working in most tropical settings are usually hampered by lack of basic information on the wide variety of native tree species that characterize the pre-disturbance forests, as well as insufficient understanding of the ecology of disturbance and natural recovery to design effective restoration programs. A notable exception to this is the forest restoration program developed since the early 1980s by a Brazilian bauxite mining company operating at Trombetas in Para State in central Amazonia. A systematic nursery and field research strategy was used to develop a reforestation program based on mixed plantings of mon than 70 native old-growth forest tree species. This technique has been used to replant about 100 ha of deforested minelands each year over the past 15 years. Research in recent years has evaluated this approach and other, generally simpler, reforestation methods used at a smaller scale at this site. Post-plantation biodiversity development and other indicators of restoration success or sustainability were recorded. The results of these studies have shown the overwhelming importance of careful site preparation and topsoil handling/replacement practices in determining both future productivity and biodiversity of the redeveloping forests, irrespective of the complexity of the planting design used. The inclusion of a wide variety of forest species, particularly later successional species, was very important for long-range restoration owing to limitations on natural recovery processes that inhibit seed dispersal and subsequent colonization of many old-growth forest species. Many of the: lessons learned at this site an applicable to improve the design of mineland rehabilitation and forest restoration programs worldwide. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ensemble Machine Learning for Mapping Tree Species Alpha-Diversity Using Multi-Source Satellite Data in an Ecuadorian Seasonally Dry Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The increased variety of satellite remote sensing platforms creates opportunities for estimating tropical forest diversity needed for environmental decision-making. As little as 10% of the original seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) remains for Ecuador, Peru, and Colombia. Remnant forests show high rates of species endemism, but experience degradation from climate change, wood-cutting, and livestock-grazing. Forest census data provide a vital resource for examining remote sensing methods to estimate diversity levels. We used spatially referenced trees >= 5 cm in diameter and simulated 0.10 ha plots measured from a 9 ha SDTF in southwestern Ecuador to compare machine learning (ML) models for six alpha-diversity indices. We developed 1 m tree canopy height and elevation models from stem mapped trees, at a scale conventionally derived from light detection and ranging (LiDAR). We then used an ensemble ML approach comparing single-and combined-sensor models from RapidEye, Sentinel-2 and interpolated canopy height and topography surfaces. Validation data showed that combined models often outperformed single-sensor approaches. Combined sensor and model ensembles for tree species richness, Shannon's H, inverse Simpson's, unbiased Simpson's, and Fisher's alpha indices typically showed lower root mean squared error (RMSE) and increased goodness of fit (R-2). Pielou's J, a measure of evenness, was poorly predicted. Mapped tree species richness (R2 = 0.54, F = 27.3, p = < 0.001) and Shannon's H' (R-2 = 0.54, F = 26.9, p = < 0.001) showed the most favorable agreement with field validation observations (n = 25). Small-scale model experiments revealed essential relationships between dry forest tree diversity and data from multiple satellite sensors with repeated global coverage that can help guide larger-scale biodiversity mapping efforts.

TI  - The Effects of Disturbance Intensity on Tropical Forest Bird Communities and Vegetation Structure after Two Decades of Recovery
T2  - BIRDS
AB  - Simple Summary A large portion of tropical forests around the world have been impacted by human disturbances such as clearcutting or selective logging. Impacts from these disturbances may remain long after the trees grow back, as other aspects of forest structure may have changed. Forests that are recovering from disturbances still play an important role for wildlife, though their conservation value compared to undisturbed forests is not well understood. To examine how different types of human disturbance impact tropical forest birds, we surveyed and compared bird communities in three different forest habitats: undisturbed primary forest, selectively logged forest (low disturbance), and forest replanted on abandoned agricultural fields (high disturbance). Our surveys occurred 19 years after any logging or agriculture, allowing our forest sites time to regrow. We found that while bird communities at low-disturbance sites were similar to undisturbed sites, high-disturbance sites had fewer bird species, with ant-following birds being particularly underrepresented. We related these results to vegetation structure measurements, which suggested that reducing tree density and vegetation ground cover in high-disturbance forests may improve these areas as tropical forest bird habitats.Abstract As tropical forests are frequently impacted by human disturbance, forests in various stages of disturbance recovery are increasingly important for maintaining biodiversity. However, much remains unclear regarding the impacts of prior disturbance intensity on wildlife in regenerating forests. Here, we used mist net capture data to compare bird communities in three tropical forest habitats representing various disturbance intensities: undisturbed primary forest, selectively logged forest (low disturbance), and secondary forest regenerating on abandoned agricultural fields (high disturbance). We found that after a 19-year recovery period, low-disturbance sites contained similar bird communities to undisturbed sites. High-disturbance sites, however, had lower species richness and distinct bird communities, with fewer insectivores and more nectarivores than other sites. Structural equation models revealed that the impacts of disturbance intensity on bird communities were partially explained by changes in vegetation structure: ant-following insectivore abundance declined with disturbance intensity as ground cover vegetation increased, and nectarivore abundance increased with disturbance intensity as tree density decreased. Our results suggest that selectively logged forests can regain pre-disturbance bird diversity and vegetation structure within two decades, provided that they are protected from further disturbance and located near source species pools. Increasing tree density and decreasing ground-level vegetation in secondary forests may improve these areas as habitats for forest-interior birds.

TI  - Comparison of the coexistence pattern of mangrove macrobenthos between natural and artificial reforestation
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - The abandoned pond-to-mangrove restoration project provides greater advantages than tidal flats afforestation in restoring mangrove ecosystem services and will be the primary method for mangrove restoration in the future. The existing methods for abandoned pond-to-mangrove restoration include artificial restoration through 'dike-breaking, filling with imported soil and tree planting' and natural restoration through 'dike-breaking and natural succession'. However, little is known about which restoration strategy (natural or artificial restoration) provides more benefits to the biodiversity of mangrove macrobethos. Given a prevailing view suggested that artificial restoration should be the preferred approach for accelerating recovery of biodiversity and vegetation structure in tropical regions, we hypothesised higher macrobenthic biodiversity and more complex community structure in artificial restoration than in natural restoration. To test this hypothesis, macrobenthic biodiversity and ecological processes were monitored in a typical abandoned pond-to-mangrove area of Dongzhaigang Bay, China, where artificial and natural restoration methods were used concurrently. Differences in macrobenthic biodiversity, community structure and ecological processes were compared using diversity indices, complex network analysis and null models. Similar species composition and ecological niche overlap and width among macrobenthos were observed at artificial and natural restoration sites. The biotic heterogeneity and interaction among macrobenthos were higher at the natural restoration sites than at the artificial restoration sites. Macrobenthos community assembly at natural and artificial restoration sites was both determined by deterministic processes, with environmental filtering dominating, which explained 52% and 54% of the variations in macrobenthic community structures respectively. Although our findings did not validate the research hypothesis, higher biotic heterogeneity and species interaction among macrobenthos could support natural restoration as the primary method for abandoned pond-to-mangrove projects, because it is a nature-based solution for mangrove restoration.

TI  - A common framework to model recovery in disturbed tropical forests
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB  - 1. Despite their exceptional biodiversity and carbon stocks, more than 80% of tropical forests are disturbed. However, a lot of interrogations remain around the ability of vegetation attributes in tropical forests to recover from the various anthropogenic disturbances coexisting in many tropical landscapes. While these different disturbances are usually studied separately, this work provides, for the first time, a common modelling framework of vegetation attribute recovery in differently disturbed forests.2. We develop an original Bayesian hierarchical model of recovery trajectories, considering disturbed forests in a common framework, through a disturbance intensity gradient. As a case study, we test our modelling approach on data from two long-term experiments, Tirimbina (Costa Rica) and Paracou (French Guiana), where forest permanent sample plots have been set up following selective logging (63.25 ha), agriculture (4 ha), and clearcutting+fire (6.25 ha).3. We build a modelling framework that stands out by: (i) its interpretability, with model parameters having a clear ecological meaning; (ii) its robustness, allowing to compare parameter values amongst ecological systems to ensure that predictions are ecologically sound; (iii) its versatility to consider disturbance intensity through postdisturbance changes in a structural variable, either as input data, or as a transformed parameter without requiring pre-disturbance monitoring; (iv) its flexibility to explicitly consider, and test, the effects on forest recovery of various disturbance types, along an intensity gradient, in a single integrative model.4. First conclusions drawn from our common framework underline the strongest above-ground biomass and diversity recovery rate offered by selective logging, compared to agriculture and clearcutting+fire, as well as the strong effect of disturbance intensity on taxonomic composition recovery.5. Considering disturbed forests in a common framework might help managers to know which disturbance types need to be firmly avoided, which intensity range makes human activities sustainable in forested environments, and where inexpensive natural regeneration should be favoured over active restoration, such as tree planting. Testing this framework with various monitoring tools to estimate disturbance intensity and model vegetation attribute recovery, i.e., with forest monitoring or remote sensing data, will be the next step to make it widely applicable.

TI  - How to enhance Atlantic Forest protection? Dealing with the shortcomings of successional stages classification
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - The Atlantic Forest is a global biodiversity hotspot and a significant provider of ecosystem services to 65% of the Brazilian population. Due to being highly threatened, it is protected by federal law 11,428/2006, which establishes forest use restrictions based on native vegetation successional stages in the Atlantic Forest, with more advanced stages receiving more protection. The classification parameters are established at the state level. However, the parameters employed to classify forest fragments in different successional stages are subjective and imprecise, negatively impacting environmental permitting and related offset policies. Here, we critically assessed the major limitations in applying the 11,428/2006 law and presented alternatives for establishing a more transparent, applicable, legally safe, and effective protocol for identifying the conservation value of forest fragments. We also highlight problems related to sampling, indicators, and methodologies and present guidelines for revising the parameters for applying the Atlantic Forest law and associated state -level resolutions. We suggest an inclusive two-step analysis based on vegetation structure, forest cover history, biodiversity, ecosystem services (social), and landscape indicators. By employing a more technological approach and transferring part of the assessment responsibility to the state -level environmental agencies instead of allowing self -declared reports by landowners, our proposal focuses on the potential for evaluating ecological integrity among different successional classes by forest types. As nearly 90% of the remaining Brazilian Atlantic Forest is located within private lands, improving this legal instrument is essential for protecting the vulnerable biodiversity of this unique and threatened biome.

AB  - Since the early 2000s, there has been a resurgence in shade coffee production on the island of Puerto Rico. The newly restored specialized shade canopy consists of four native tree species, three of which are nitrogen fixers, and is intended to provide 30% shade cover once the trees are matured. Though much is known about the benefits of rustic and traditional shade plantations to coffee production, there is little information available for specialized shade plantations. Here, we investigate the ways in which fruit set, seed predation, bean weight, proportion of peaberries (i.e., malformed fruits), and beverage quality differ between sun and specialized shade plantations of Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora. Additionally, to assess whether coffee plants were pollen limited, we conducted a pollen supplementation experiment in which we compared pollen deposition and berry production on hand-pollinated branches to those of naturally, open-pollinated ones. We found that there was no evidence of pollen limitation on fruit set between sun and specialized shade plantations of C. arabica or C. canephora. We found that specialized shade benefits the proportion of C. arabica fruit set, without compromising bean weight or the proportion of peaberries produced. In comparison, C. canephora showed no improvement in the proportion of fruits set with specialized shade; however, beans from open-pollinated flowers weighed more in specialized shade than sun. Beverage quality was marginally better under shade, and for hand-pollinated flowers. Our results add to the limited body of work investigating the benefits of specialized shade coffee plantations on ecosystem services.

TI  - Removal of non-native trees fosters but alone is insufficient for forest regeneration in Hawai'i
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Across the globe, non-native plant species have become abundant in many tropical forests, resulting in altered patterns of biological diversity and species composition, and impacting important ecosystem functions. However, long-term experimental research on the efficacy of non-native tree removal for tropical forest restoration remains limited. We investigated the removal of non-native tree species in a mesic tropical forest in Hawai'i, where rates of endemism and endangerment of plant species is high and multiple non-native tree species are abundant. As a collaboration between resource managers and researchers, we tested the effects of non-native tree removal on overstory and understory metrics of restoration using three restoration approaches: "total cut " (cutting all non-native trees); "girdle " (girdle of all non-native trees); and "selective cut " (cutting approximately 50% of nonnative trees). Prior to removal, we established permanent plots (four 10 x 10 m plots per restoration treatment, with 10 1 x 1 m subplots in each), then monitored them over 10 years. Across all treatments, canopy openness increased significantly post restoration, peaked after three years, then decreased to pre-treatment levels or lower. The increase was largest for the total cut treatment, but there was large variation within treatments. By the end of the experiment, the total cut and girdle treatments performed similarly for all our metrics of restoration, including survival, growth, density, and basal area of native trees; density and richness of native species in the understory; and total weed biomass. The selective treatment performed worse, showing lower relative gains in basal area of native trees and density of native understory individuals. Overall, tree removal was effective in restoring a native canopy. However, understory native species richness and density remained at pre-treatment levels, likely due to limited seed dispersal, seed predation by non-native rodents, and continued competition from non-native herbaceous species. Nonetheless, subplots with the best starting conditions performed the best. More intensive and longer-term weeding of non-native species in the understory, focused on areas with the best starting conditions and combined with out-planting of native seeds, seedlings and/or saplings, is likely necessary to foster effective native species regeneration. Overall, our research shows that removal of non-native trees using the total cut and girdle techniques can foster native forest restoration in the mesic forests of HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, but that ongoing long-term management in the understory is critical.

TI  - Effects of logging on landscape-level tree diversity across an elevational gradient in Bornean tropical forests
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Logging has caused a substantial loss of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. Therefore, it is important to examine how logging affects biodiversity on a landscape scale to plan responsible management of a tropical forest. Although a number of plot-based studies have shown the effect of logging on local tree species richness (alpha diversity), the effect on species turnover along environmental gradients (beta diversity) remains largely unknown. In this study, we evaluated how logging disturbance affects alpha and beta diversity along an elevational gradient on the eastern slope of Mount Trus Madi in Borneo. We further investigated how pioneer and latesuccessional tree species differed in the habitat range to clarify the mechanism underlying the beta diversity pattern. We selected 90 plots, each with a radius of 20 m, with a range of disturbance intensity (five classes from highly degraded forests to pristine forests) in lower (285-600 m asl) and higher elevation areas (600-1105 m asl). The remaining above-ground biomass, which is an indicator of past disturbance intensity, strongly varied across the plots (5.4-570.6 and 3.1-771.6 Mg ha(-1) in lower and higher elevation areas, respectively). Diameter at breast height (DBH) and species name were recorded for all trees with a DBH larger than 10 cm. We calculated the species number per 20 individual trees for each plot to represent alpha diversity. Beta diversity along the elevational gradient was calculated as the slope of the relationship between standardized compositional dissimilarity (beta deviation) and the elevational difference. Alpha diversity decreased in higher (17.3-12.3 species per 20 trees) and lower areas (16.8-11.3 species per 20 trees) with increasing logging intensity. Beta diversity along the elevational gradient also decreased to almost zero in highly disturbed areas. Pioneer tree species had a wider elevational range than late-successional species. These results suggest that the shift in dominant tree species after logging (from late-successional to pioneer species) was the main driver of the decline in beta diversity along the elevational gradient. We conclude that preserving and restoring beta diversity are important to sustain tropical production forests.

TI  - Importance of bistatic SAR features from TanDEM-X for forest mapping and monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Deforestation and forest degradation are one of the important sources for human induced carbon dioxide emissions and their rates are highest in tropical forests. For man-kind, it is of great importance to track land-use conversions like deforestation, e.g. for sustainable forest management and land use planning, for carbon balancing and to support the implementation of international initiatives like REDD + (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation). SAR (synthetic aperture radar) sensors are suitable to reliably and frequently monitor tropical forests due to their weather independence. The TanDEM-X mission (which is mainly aimed to create a unique global high resolution digital elevation model) currently operates two X-band SAR satellites, acquiring interferometric SAR data for the Earth's entire land surface multiple times. The operational mission provides interferometric data as well as mono- and bistatic scattering coefficients. These datasets are homogenous, globally consistent and are acquired in high spatial resolution. Hence, they may offer a unique basic dataset which could be useful in land cover monitoring.
   Based on first datasets available from the TanDEM-X mission, the main goal of this research is to investigate the information content of TanDEM-X data for mapping forests and other land cover classes in a tropical peatland area. More specifically, the study explores the utility of bistatic features for distinguishing between open and closed forest canopies, which is of relevance in the context of deforestation and forest degradation monitoring. To assess the predominant information content of TanDEM-X data, the importance of information derived from the bistatic system is compared against the monostatic case, usually available from SAR systems. The usefulness of the TanDEM-X mission data, i.e. scattering coefficients, derived textural information and interferometric coherence is investigated via a feature selection process. The resulting optimal feature sets representing a monostatic and a bistatic SAR dataset were used in a subsequent classification to assess the added value of the bistatic TanDEM-X features in the separability of land cover classes. The results obtained indicated that especially the interferometric coherence significantly improved the separability of thematic classes compared to a dataset of monostatic acquisition. The bistatic coherence was mainly governed by volume decorrelation of forest canopy constituents and carries information about the canopy structure which is related to canopy cover. In contrast the bistatic scattering coefficient had no significant contribution to class separability. The classification with coherence and textural information outperformed the classification with the monostatic scattering coefficient and texture by more than 10% and achieved an overall accuracy of 85%. These results indicate that TanDEM-X can serve as a valuable and consistent source for mapping and monitoring tropical forests. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

TI  - Impacts of forest conservation on local agricultural labor supply: Evidence from the Indonesian forest moratorium
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Tropical forest conservation is critical for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and maintaining global ecosystems. Understanding the channels through which conservation affects agricultural activities and livelihoods in these regions is key to designing effective policies and promoting sustainable development. To this end, we use labor supply data from Indonesia in 2007 and 2015 combined with a matching strategy to estimate the impacts of a national forest conservation policy, the forest moratorium, on local agricultural labor. Consistent with the predictions of our theoretical model, we find robust empirical evidence that the moratorium increased local agricultural employment and slowed structural transformation away from the agricultural sector. We provide corresponding evidence of decreased household expenditure due to the moratorium. Despite the moratorium, we find significant deforestation and forest degradation within the boundaries of the moratorium-targeted areas, suggesting that increases in local agricultural employment may partly dampen the conservation policy's effectiveness. Our work offers new insights into evaluating existing conservation policies and designing future policies for Indonesia and other resource-dependent economies that face similar challenges in balancing economic growth with conservation.

TI  - INFLUENCE OF TREE COVER ON DIVERSITY, CARBON SEQUESTRATION AND PRODUCTIVITY OF COCOA SYSTEMS IN THE ECUADORIAN AMAZON
T2  - BOIS ET FORETS DES TROPIQUES
AB  - Cocoa production in the Ecuadorian Amazon is an important source of income for the local population. There is a wide variety of cocoa production systems, from enriched primary forests to traditional agroforestry systems and monoculture. This study assesses the relationship between tree diversity, carbon stocks, agricultural productivity and forest use potential under three land use systems in the Ecuadorian Amazon: cocoa-based agroforestry (Cocoa AFS), cocoa monoculture (Monoculture) and primary forest (PF). Understanding and quantifying the tradeoffs between different ecosystem services related to cocoa production systems can contribute to the conservation of primary forests and help to optimize income for local people. Species richness, beta-diversity, carbon stocks (above-and below-ground biomass, necromass and soil), and cocoa and timber production were determined for each system in 1,600 m(2) study plots (n=28). The results show that beta diversity, species richness and carbon stocks were significantly higher in PF and Cocoa AFS, whereas cocoa production was 1.5 times higher in the Monoculture than in Cocoa AFS. In both cocoa systems, species richness, beta diversity and total C were negatively correlated with cocoa productivity. Although our results show that cocoa monoculture was more profitable than Cocoa AFS for the farmers, a monetary payment based on carbon credits for avoided deforestation could be a viable strategy to support the implementation of Cocoa AFS, which would help conservation efforts and climate change mitigation while sustaining commercial cocoa production in the area.

TI  - Stretching the Habitat Envelope: Insectivorous Bat Guilds Can Use Rubber Plantations, but Need Understorey Vegetation and Forest Buffers
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - Effects of land-cover change on insectivorous bat activity can be negative, neutral or positive, depending on foraging strategies of bats. In tropical agroforestry systems with high bat diversity, these effects can be complex to assess. We investigated foraging habitat use by three insectivorous bat guilds in forests and rubber plantations in the southern Western Ghats of India. Specifically, we monitored acoustic activity of bats in relation to (1) land-cover types and vegetation structure, and (2) plantation management practices. We hypothesized that activity of open-space aerial (OSA) and edge-space aerial (ESA) bat guilds would not differ; but narrow-space, flutter-detecting (NSFD) bat guild activity would be higher, in structurally heterogeneous forest habitats than monoculture rubber plantations. We found that bat activity of all guilds was highest in areas with high forest cover and lowest in rubber plantations. Higher bat activity was associated with understorey vegetation in forests and plantations, which was expected for NSFD bats, but was a surprise finding for OSA and ESA bats. Within land-cover types, open areas and edge-habitats had higher OSA and ESA activity respectively, while NSFD bats completely avoided open habitats. In terms of management practices, intensively managed rubber plantations with regular removal of understorey vegetation had the lowest bat activity for all guilds. Intensive management can undermine potential ecosystem services of insectivorous bats (e.g., insect pest-control in rubber plantations and surrounding agro-ecosystems), and magnify threats to bats from human disturbances. Low-intensity management and maintenance of forest buffers around plantations can enable persistence of insectivorous bats in tropical forest-plantation landscapes.

TI  - Reflecting on species diversity and regeneration dynamics of scientific forest management practices in Nepal
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Implementation of sustainable forest management approaches, balancing mass timber production and intact ecosystem services through maintaining species diversity, has ever been the challenges for policy makers and practitioners in tropical forestry. Scientific forest management (SciFM) is a popular management approach that is increasingly adopted in Sal (Shorea robusta) dominated forests of Nepal, aiming to accelerate timber production and to improve forest condition. Being based on specific management plan, SciFM practices involve application of various silvicultural practices to manipulate forest composition and stand structure referring to the whole rotation period of a particular forest stand. Of the various aspects of SciFM, we aim to quantify the effect of SciFM on species diversity and regeneration dynamics, and compare diversity indices and regeneration attributes between managed and unmanaged forest stand in lowlands of Nepal, through establishment of permanent sample plots and its measurement in 2014 and 2018. Data collection about plant species and regeneration attributes was carried out in 50 sample plots of size 10 m x 10 m, established by stratified random sampling using quadrat method. Data analysis was done by using various diversity indices and compared through paired t-test. We also carried out correlation and regression analysis of diversity indices with predictor variables; such as canopy cover, number of individuals ha(-1), basal area ha(-1) and site productivity index. Our study found that plant diversity is significantly decreased but the concentration of dominance is significantly increased in managed forest blocks. Diversity indices were found to have a higher degree of relationship with number of individuals ha(-1) and canopy cover as compared to site productivity index and basal area ha(-1). Similarly, seedling density and sapling density is found to be increased in managed blocks, ensuring the production and productivity of forest stand sustainably. Based on our analysis, we argue that opening of canopy through regeneration felling is important in promoting regeneration establishment and growth but further research is needed to balance the species diversity along with the practice of intensive management interventions.

TI  - Taxonomic and community composition of epigeal arthropods in monoculture and mixed tree species plantations in a deciduous forest of Ghana
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
AB  - Tropical forests provide several ecosystem services and functions and support approximately two-thirds of the world's biodiversity but are seriously threatened by deforestation. Approaches to counteract this menace have revolved around afforestation with several or a single tree species. We thus investigated how plantation forests with either a single or several tree species influenced arthropod taxonomic and community composition using pitfall traps to sample selected groups of epigeal arthropods (Araneae, Coleoptera, Orthoptera and Hymenoptera) and with environmental variables assessed simultaneously. Our results revealed 54 taxonomic groups with significantly higher taxonomic richness, activity density, and diversity in the mixed stands than in the monoculture stands. The significant differences in community composition were mainly driven by families including Lycosidae, Formicidae, Staphylinidae, Scotylidae, Hydrophilidae, Gryllidae and Scarabaeidae and were explained by distinct habitat characteristics (canopy openness, litter depth, deadwood volume, and tree height). While the diverse tree communities and heterogeneous vegetation structure offered food and habitat resources for diverse arthropod groups, the allelopathic nature coupled with homogenous stand characteristics of the Tectona grandis stands in the monoculture suppressed the growth of understorey vegetation that could otherwise serve as food and habitat resources for arthropods, which might have led to limited activities and diversity of arthropods in the monoculture plantation stands. The findings thus highlight the need to promote mixed tree plantations in degraded tropical areas, especially when restoring biodiversity is the prime management focus.

TI  - Effects of air pollution on carbon sequestration potential in two tropical forests of West Bengal, India
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Tropical forests store more carbon in their above ground biomass than other forest habitats. Species and site specific allometric equations are desired to evaluate precise and dependable results of tree biomass. This study, therefore, aims to assess and compare the carbon sequestration potential (CSP) between two forests (Barjora forest, Bankura and Ballavpur Wildlife Sanctuary (BWLS), Bolpur, West Bengal), having different air pollution levels, by using a non-destructive sampling method. In the present study, it was observed that the CSP varied with different species and diameter class. Shorea robusta Gaertn. has a maximum CSP with 30284.8 kg ha(-1) and 261004.3 kg ha(-1) at Barjora forest and BWLS respectively among all the other measured tree species. The results indicated that all the tree species, with diameter at breast height (DBH) > 30 cm, contributed about 40.89% and 69.97% CSP at Barjora and BWLS, respectively. Independent samples t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were undertaken to check the significant difference between the CSP of different species, different diameter classes and different pollutant loads of the two forests. A statistically significant difference was found in carbon sequestration values and the levels of O-3, PM2.5, PM10 between BWLS and Barjora forest (p = < 0.05). Multiple linear regression model revealed that CSP decreased with increasing levels of air pollutants (NO2, O-3, PM10 and PM2.5). The results indicated that air pollution played an important role in the reduction of CSP of tropical forest located at polluted site. It was found that among the 8 common tree species, Shorea robusta Gaertn., with maximum CSP, followed by Acacia auriculiforrnis Benth., Eucalyptus globulus Labill., and Madhuca indica J.F. Gmel. may be recommended for afforestation programmes in the polluted site to reduce air pollution levels. The study could also be used for implementing Shorea robusta Gaertn. as an indicator species in tropical forest ecosystems in future.

TI  - Harvestmen in an Atlantic forest fragmented landscape: Evaluating assemblage response to habitat quality and quantity
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Despite the importance of considering arthropods in monitoring programs and conservation planning given their diversity in terrestrial ecosystems and potential in revealing environmental disturbances, most studies on the effects of habitat disturbances in tropical forests focused on vertebrates, plants and a few arthropod groups. By sampling 16 sites evenly distributed in four habitat categories (continuous mature and secondary forest and large and small secondary forest fragments), we investigated how harvestmen (Opiliones), which represent the third largest order of arachnids and have been poorly studied in tropical forests, are affected by habitat quality and quantity. Richness and abundance of rare species were strongly affected by habitat quality.(first axis of principal component analysis on forest structure), increasing in less disturbed/mature forests. Richness, total abundance, abundance of rare species and of one of the three common species were higher in continuous forest, while only total abundance differed between large and small fragments. Detrended correspondence analysis revealed that just one species increased in abundance in fragments, while several others were associated with continuous and/or mature forest and that harvestman composition did not vary between large and small fragments. Our results suggest that harvestmen (1) are strongly affected by habitat quality and quantity, probably because, compared to other arthropod groups, they are relatively uniform in some relevant biological aspects (nocturnal predators dependent on microclimatic conditions that present low vagility); (2) are probably more indicative of intermediate-level disturbances, given the absence of species associated with highly-disturbed areas.

TI  - Pathways to win-wins or trade-offs? How certified community forests impact forest restoration and human wellbeing
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Certified community forests combine local governance with forest certification and aim to serve multiple objectives including forest protection, restoration, human wellbeing and equitable governance. However, the causal pathways by which they impact these objectives remain poorly understood. The ability of protected area impact evaluations to identify complex pathways is limited by a narrow focus on top-down theoretical, quantitative perspectives and inadequate consideration of local context. We used a novel mixed-methods research design that integrates the perspectives of multiple actors to develop a generalized conceptual model of the causal pathways for certified community forests. We tested the model using a combination of statistical matching, structural equation modelling and qualitative analyses for an agroforestry landscape in Tanzania. We found certified community forests positively impacted human wellbeing, equitable governance and forest restoration. Equitable governance had the largest impact on wellbeing, followed by crop yield and forest resource availability. Timber revenues varied widely between villages and the average effect of financial benefits did not impact wellbeing due to the immature stage of the certified timber market. We identified positive interactions and trade-offs between conservation and agriculture. Our findings suggest that no simple solution exists for meeting multiple objectives. However, developing understanding of the pathways linking social and conservation outcomes can help identify opportunities to promote synergies and mitigate negative impacts to reconcile competing objectives.This article is part of the theme issue 'Understanding forest landscape restoration: reinforcing scientific foundations for the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration'.

TI  - Soil properties and neighbouring forest cover affect above-ground biomass and functional composition during tropical forest restoration
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
AB  - Questions: We studied the importance of soil properties and neighbouring forest cover in affecting plant community biomass and assembly during the tropical forest restoration process. We also investigated how compositional responses depended on traits expected to influence individual success.
   Location: Forest restoration sites across anthropogenic grasslands in mixed use agricultural watersheds, eastern Sao Paulo state, Brazil.
   Methods: We identified and measured all woody individuals (DBH >= 5 cm) in four 200-m(2) plots per site. Then we translated these measurements into above-ground biomass (AGB), and related AGB variability to neighbouring forest cover, soil texture and chemical fertility using mixed effect models. We assessed the effect of these predictors on different species groups, arranged according to variation in wood density, tree height or habitat selectivity, through multivariate abundance models.
   Results: GB ranged between 0 and 104.7 t/ha (median of 10.4 t/ha), with high variation within, as well as between, watersheds. Sand percentage, forest cover and the interaction between soil nutrient concentrations and sand percentage were good predictors of measured AGB. The most parsimonious model projected a seven growing seasons AGB recovery of 70.90 t/ha, when a site is on fertile soils with 10% sand and surrounded by forest cover of 50%. In contrast, only 5.24 t/ha is predicted on acidic-poor soils with 67% sand and 0% forest cover. Increasing forest cover favoured smaller trees and habitat generalists while increasing sand percentage inhibited taller species and forest specialists. Sand percentage constrained softwoods in fertile soils.
   Conclusion: Our results confirm that the likelihood of restoration to pre-disturbance conditions is constrained in contexts of higher degradation, such as when agricultural use adversely affects soil properties and/or motivates extreme deforestation. Lower AGB found on sandy soils suggests that forest recovery is sensitive to local drought intensification. Given regional projections for extended dry seasons, restoration approaches could consider targeting alternative reference states, rather than historical/undisturbed ones, under highly altered environments, while aiming to improve soil and microclimate conditions to allow moist tropical forest recovery where feasible.

TI  - Simulating land use and land cover change under contrasting levels of policy enforcement and its spatially-explicit impact on tropical forest landscapes in Ecuador
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - This study simulates the future impact of land use and land cover (LULC) change and the enforcement of policy bundles on the multi-functionality of tropical forest landscapes. It focusses on the Northern Ecuadorian Amazonas (NEA) which is characterised by high biodiversity and endemism but at the same time is threatened by deforestation and unsustainable land use practices. Scenario simulations mimic LULC change during 2016-2030 at canton-level (area: 2,146 km2) combining explorative with policy-screening components. Scenarios NATIONAL(+)POLICY, NATIONAL(-)POLICY, REGIONAL(+)POLICY, and REGIONAL(-)POLICY are contrasted by varying deforestation trends (high regional demand for agricultural products vs. national-level structural transformations) and the enforcement/ non-enforcement of policy bundles on forest protection, reforestation and restoration. An indicator-based impact assessment analysed in a spatially-explicit fashion for each scenario in 2030 (i) the evolution of agricultural and forestry-related LULC change trajectories, (ii) future hotspots of deforestation, (iii) remaining forest core zones (FCZ) as key element of habitat integrity, and (iv) the provisioning of long-term carbon sinks. Key findings reveal that only NATIONAL(+)POLICY, as the combination of enforced policy bundles and simulated national LULC change trend extrapolating the long-term reference period 1990-2016, lead to an expansion of forest areas and a 2% carbon stock gain in 2030 compared to 2016. When assuming a linear continuation of this trend, it requires 96 years to reach a similar carbon stock level compared to the reference year 1990. Farm area expansion will continue to affect protected forests in case of scenarios NATIONAL(-)POLICY and REGIONAL(-)POLICY but will be avoided in NATIONAL(+)POLICY and REGIONAL(+)POLICY. The simulated persistence of many farming areas reveals that the likelihood to reforest existing agricultural patches will be rather low. Against expectations, scenario NATIONAL(+)POLICY which assumes net zero deforestation by 2030 led to a high level of FCZ fragmentation contrasting its carbon sink potential (27,971 Mio. Mg ha-1) which performed best among all scenarios. Our study depicts a mismatch of future LULC change realities compared to the anticipated future achievements of the Ecuadorian land use policy framework. The simulated variability of forest change patterns (deforestation, reforestation) and farming trajectories (diversification, intensification, rotation) further suggests to foster more cross-sectoral policy approaches that acknowledges the hybrid role of local stakeholders who can be farmers and forest users at the same time. Our study shows that focusing on preserving carbon stocks and their long-term climate mitigation potential only while neglecting other important ecosystem functions or biodiversity can be a short-sighted policy goal if not accompanied by rural development programmes. We further conclude that scenario-based assessments should become an integral part of multi-stakeholder interactions across relevant levels of decision-making. This can support long-term sustainable land use management which is not only relevant for the case of the Northern Ecuadorian Amazons region but for many other landscapes in transition.

TI  - Tropical forest strata shifts in plant structural diversity-aboveground carbon relationships along altitudinal gradients
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Aboveground carbon storage in forests can be influenced by both structural and compositional diversity of plant communities. However, the relative and interactive effects of structural and compositional diversity on multilevel aboveground carbon storage across forest strata and how these relationships vary with altitude and soil nutrients remain unclear. Using data obtained from 34 tropical forest plots (total area 8.5 ha) in Hainan Island, China, we analyzed the relationships between aboveground carbon at four levels (litter, understory, overstory, and whole-community) with structural diversity (diameter and height diversity) and compositional diversity (species diversity and evenness) in the understory and overstory. The direct and indirect effects of altitude, soil nutrients (total N and total P and N/P ratio), structural diversity, and compositional diversity on aboveground carbon were explored via Bayesian structural equation modeling. The results showed that structural diversity, rather than compositional diversity, in overstory stratum determined aboveground carbon. Specifically, overstory structural diversity was negatively associated with understory carbon, while positively associated with overstory and whole-community carbon. Furthermore, diversity-carbon relationships were slightly affected by soil nutrients but strongly by altitude. Specifically, the relationship between overstory and whole-community carbon content with overstory tree height diversity weakened with altitude, while their relationship with overstory diameter diversity strengthened. Altitude directly and indirectly affected overstory tree height and diameter diversity through overstory species diversity, thereby reducing understory and increasing overstory and whole-community carbon. Altitude directly promoted litter carbon. We provide evidence that the effects of plant diversity on aboveground carbon storage are forest strata-and altitude-dependent. As overstory

TI  - A preliminary assessment of water quality in silvopastoral systems of Panama's dry tropical forest
T2  - NEOTROPICAL BIOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Dry tropical forests are unique, biodiverse ecosystems threatened by human development, especially deforestation for agricultural land use. Deforestation reduces carbon sequestration in landscapes and, in turn, pollutes nearby waterways. Agroforestry practices, like silvopastoralism, can mitigate these impacts by integrating trees into working landscapes, but their effect on stream water quality has not been studied. We assessed the stream condition on five silvopastoral farms in Panama's Azuero Peninsula by utiliz- ing aquatic macroinvertebrates as indicators. We collected aquatic macroinvertebrates and calculated the percent EPT, Diptera, and Odonata. Using ArcGIS, we measured distance to live fence, riparian connectivity, and forest patch size. We also measured tree carbon stored in the riparian area and throughout each farm. We analyzed the rela- tionships between landscape or habitat variables and water quality scores using single linear regressions in R Studio. Percent EPT, Odonata, and diversity were positively predicted by riparian tree carbon, while percent Diptera was negatively predicted by riparian tree carbon. Our results highlight the importance of expanding agroforestry in this region and suggest that increasing tree cover in agricultural landscapes may be beneficial to stream condition, but additional research is needed.

TI  - Status and trends of pollination services in Amazon agroforestry systems
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - With the growing demand for food production worldwide, natural landscapes are increasingly being replaced by agricultural areas, which directly affects biodiversity and local ecosystem services. Agroforestry systems, which are the intentional integration of trees and shrubs into crop and animal farming systems, are a more sustainable production approach that has been increasing in several forested areas around the globe. Here, we examine the trends of agroforestry in the Brazilian Legal Amazon and estimate the associated value of ecosystem services mediated by pollinators. Using data from 2006 and 2017, we detected an increase in agroforestry activity in the Amazon, both in the number (3.27%) and in the area (23.18%) of establishments. Crop production in forested areas increased by 45.61% in the same period, and the main products cultivated in both years were native products from the Amazon, such as acai , Brazil nut and babassu. Although the crop data are from forested areas, all the five crops with the highest production value are associated with agroforestry in the Amazon. Pollination services also increased during the same period from US$73.3 to US$156.7 million (113.76%). In 2006, the value of pollination services corresponded to 44% of the total crop production, and it jumped to 64.43% in 2017. Bees and beetles were the two main groups of pollinators quoted for the analysed crops. Our estimates show the important contribution of pollinators to crop production in the Amazon forest. However, a growing loss of Amazon forest has been observed, and this can jeopardize pollinators and have detrimental consequences on food production in the near future. Public policies are urgently needed to encourage crop production in harmony with natural areas, combining the protection of forests and pollinators with food production.

TI  - Measuring the success of reforestation for restoring biodiversity and ecosystem functioning
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Effective assessment of the success of ecological restoration projects is critical in justifying the use of restoration in natural resource management as well as improving best practice. One of the main goals of ecological restoration is the recovery of ecosystem function, yet most researchers assume that increasing species and or functional diversity equates with restoration of ecosystem function, rather than empirically demonstrating these mechanistic relationships. In this study, we assess how dung beetle species diversity, community composition, functional diversity and ecological functions vary along a restoration chronosequence and compare restored areas with reference (rain forest) and degraded (pasture) systems. We also directly investigate the dung beetle diversity - ecosystem functioning relationship in the context of ecological rain forest restoration by testing the predictive power of traditional taxonomic indices and functional diversity metrics for functionality. Species richness, abundance, biomass and functional richness all increased with restoration age, with the oldest restoration sites being most similar to rain forest, whereas functional evenness and functional divergence decreased with restoration age. Community composition in the restored areas was clearly progressing towards the rain forest sites and deviating from the pasture sites with increasing restoration age. Secondary seed dispersal rates increased with restoration age, but there was only a weak positive relationship between dung removal and soil excavation and restoration age. Biodiversity metrics explained 47-74% of the variation in functions mediated by dung beetles; however, functional trait-based indices provided greater explanatory power of functionality than traditional species-based metrics.Synthesis and applications. Our results provide empirical evidence on the potential of tropical forest restoration to mitigate biodiversity losses, recovering not only faunal species diversity, but also functional diversity and ecosystem functions in a relatively short period of time. We also demonstrate that functional trait-based metrics are better predictors of functionality than traditional species-based metrics but that the relationship between restoration age, diversity and ecosystem functioning is not straightforward and depends on the functions, traits and metrics used.

TI  - Drivers, constraints and trade-offs associated with recultivating abandoned cropland in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - Further cropland expansion might be unavoidable to satisfy the growing demand for land-based products and ecosystem services. A crucial issue is thus to assess the trade-offs between social and ecological impacts and the benefits of converting additional land to cropland. In the former Soviet Union countries, where the transition from state-command to market-driven economies resulted in widespread agricultural land abandonment, cropland expansion may incur relatively low costs, especially compared with tropical regions.
   Our objectives were to quantify the drivers, constraints and trade-offs associated with recultivating abandoned cropland to assess the potentially available cropland in European Russia, western Siberia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan the region where the vast majority of post-Soviet cropland abandonment took place. Using spatial panel regressions, we characterized the socio-economic determinants of cropland abandonment and recultivation. We then used recent maps of changes in cropland to (i) spatially characterize the socio-economic, accessibility and soil constraints associated with the recultivation of abandoned croplands and (ii) investigate the environmental trade-offs regarding carbon stocks and habitat for biodiversity.
   Less cropland abandonment and more recultivation after 2000 occurred in areas with an increasing rural population and a younger labor force, but also improved yields. Synergies were observed between cropland recultivation and intensification over the 2000s. From 47.3 million hectares (Mha) of cropland abandoned in 2009, we identified only 8.5 (7.1-17.4) Mha of potentially available cropland with low environmental trade-offs and low to moderate socio-economic or accessibility constraints that were located on high-quality soils (Chernozems). These areas represented an annual wheat production potential of similar to 14.3 (9.6-19.5) million tons (Mt). Conversely, 8.5 (4.2-12.4) Mha had high carbon or biodiversity trade-offs, of which similar to 10% might be attractive for cropland expansion and thus would require protection from recultivation. Agro-environmental, accessibility, and socio-economic constraints suggested that the remaining 30.6 (25.7-30.6) Mha of abandoned croplands were unlikely to provide important contributions to future crop production at current wheat prices but could provide various ecosystem services, and some could support extensive livestock production. Political and institutional support could foster recultivation by supporting investments in agriculture and rural demographic revitalization. Reclaiming potentially available cropland in the study region could provide a notable contribution to global grain production, with relatively low environmental trade-offs compared with tropical frontiers, but is not a panacea to address global issues of food security or reduce land-use pressure on tropical ecosystems.

TI  - Balancing carbon dioxide: a case study of forest preservation, out-migration, and afforestation in the Pueblos Mancomunados of Oaxaca, Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
AB  - Carbon-based payments for ecosystem services solely consider afforestation and reforestation to assess sequestration. However, political ecology researchers demonstrate that tropical forests are complex socioecological systems where humans and institutions play an integral role in shaping landscapes. The current framing overlooks the net effect of traditional subsistence agriculturalists leaving behind low emission lifestyles, despite the likelihood of a significant increase in per capita emissions over time. In this case study, we use the history of forest use in the Pueblos Mancomunados-a commonwealth of indigenous communities in Oaxaca, Mexico-to explore sequestration through a socioecological systems lens. As negative emissions programs consider afforestation, we triangulated semistructured interviews, an unsupervised GIS classification of land cover, and a review of carbon dioxide emissions to consider out-migration, abandonment, and lifestyle change. We find that communities are struggling to maintain livelihoods as migration to urban centers and the United States continues. Meanwhile, spatial analysis revealed 800 ha of afforestation. Our analysis of out-migration scenarios and per capita emissions changes identified a tipping point in which no net-sequestration would occur from afforestation due to the changing lifestyles of the migrants and recommend improved local development to avoid this form of "leakage" when assessing global carbon stocks.

TI  - Tree recruitment failure in old-growth forest patches across human-modified rainforests
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Land-use change threatens biodiversity in tropical landscapes, but its impact on rainforest regeneration remains poorly known. In fact, the landscape-scale patterns driving the diversity of regenerating plants within forest fragments have been rarely explored, and we are uncertain whether such drivers vary across regions with different land-use change patterns.
   2. We assessed the effect of landscape composition (forest cover and matrix openness) and configuration (forest patch density) on species diversity of sapling assemblages (trees >= 30 cm height and <1 cm diameter) in old-growth forest fragments from three Mexican rainforest regions with different disturbance levels (n = 20 landscapes per region). We separately assessed old-growth forest specialists (OGS) and forest generalist (FG) species to test the hypotheses that: (a) OGS species show recruitment limitation ('loser' species), and can therefore be negatively impacted by landscape changes, especially by forest loss and matrix openness in more deforested regions; and (b) FG species can regenerate and even proliferate in more disturbed landscapes ('winner' species).
   3. We recorded similar to 24,000 plants from 415 species. Landscape composition showed stronger effects than landscape configuration. The diversity of OGS species generally decreased in more deforested landscapes dominated by open matrices, and FG species followed the opposite response, especially in the regions with high-to-intermediate degree of disturbance. Overall, forest fragmentation (patch density) showed weak or no effects on species diversity, especially after controlling for forest cover effects (i.e. fragmentation per se). In contrast to the fragmentation threshold hypothesis, the effect of fragmentation was independent of the regional context. Moreover, FG species were affected by landscape attributes operating at larger scales than OGS species.
   4. Synthesis. Our findings support our hypotheses, and suggest that forest loss and matrix openness, not fragmentation per se, can cause the recruitment failure of tree assemblages in highly deforested rainforests. This can be related to source and dispersal limitation in more deforested landscapes with treeless matrices. Therefore, to promote the regenerative potential (resilience) of forest patches in human-modified tropical landscapes, conservation programs should focus on preventing forest loss (even the smallest forest patches) and improving matrix quality with treed elements, particularly in highly deforested tropical regions.

TI  - Big-sized trees overrule remaining trees' attributes and species richness as determinants of aboveground biomass in tropical forests
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Large-diameter, tall-stature, and big-crown trees are the main stand structures of forests, generally contributing a large fraction of aboveground biomass, and hence play an important role in climate change mitigation strategies. Here, we hypothesized that the effects of large-diameter, tall-stature, and big-crown trees overrule the effects of species richness and remaining trees attributes on aboveground biomass in tropical forests (i.e., we term the "big-sized trees hypothesis"). Specifically, we assessed the importance of: (a) the " top 1% big-sized trees effect" relative to species richness; (b) the "99% remaining trees effect" relative to species richness; and (c) the "top 1% big-sized trees effect" relative to the "99% remaining trees effect" and species richness on aboveground biomass. Using environmental factor and forest inventory datasets from 712 tropical forest plots in Hainan Island of southern China, we tested several structural equation models for disentangling the relative effects of big-sized trees, remaining trees attributes, and species richness on aboveground biomass, while considering for the full (indirect effects only) and partial (direct and indirect effects) mediation effects of climatic and soil conditions, as well as interactions between species richness and trees attributes. We found that top 1% big-sized trees attributes strongly increased aboveground biomass (i.e., explained 55%-70% of the accounted variation) compared to species richness (2%-18%) and 99% remaining trees attributes (6%-10%). In addition, species richness increased aboveground biomass indirectly via increasing big-sized trees but via decreasing remaining trees. Hence, we show that the "big-sized trees effect" overrides the effects of remaining trees attributes and species richness on aboveground biomass in tropical forests. This study also indicates that big-sized trees may be more susceptible to atmospheric drought. We argue that the effects of big- sized trees on species richness and aboveground biomass should be tested for better understanding of the ecological mechanisms underlying forest functioning.

TI  - Effectiveness and synergies of policy instruments for land use governance in tropical regions
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - Land use is regulated through various mixes of command-and-control interventions that directly affect land use via land use restrictions, and other public interventions that indirectly affect land use via agricultural, forestry, trade or macro-economic policies. More recently, coalitions of public and private actors have designed market-based and/or demand-led policy instruments to influence land use-e.g., eco-certification, geographical indications, commodity roundtables, moratoria, and payments for environmental services. These innovative instruments fall along a continuum of state involvement and interact with traditional public forms of land use regulation, leading to "hybrid" interventions. This article reviews emerging evidence on the effectiveness of the main instruments used to promote sustainable land use, and explores interactions between the new demand-led interventions and formal regulatory public policies. Although there are still insufficient rigorous studies evaluating the effectiveness of hybrid instruments, available evidence suggests some positive direct and indirect benefits. Hybrid instruments combine elements from both private and public regulatory systems, in innovative and effective ways. We propose a typology to characterize potential interactions between instruments that regulate land use. It links various types of interactions-i.e., complementarity, substitution, and antagonism-to the various stages of regulatory processes-i.e., agenda setting, implementation, and monitoring and enforcement We give examples of governments endorsing certifications or using certification to support their own policies; governments creating enabling conditions for hybrid instruments to mature, allowing for wider adoption; and private instruments reinforcing public regulations or substituting for missing or weak governance. In some cases, governments, NGOs and corporations compete and may hinder each other's actions. With favourable institutional and governance contexts, well-designed hybrid public-private instruments can be effective. More systematic evaluation could boost the effectiveness of instruments and enhance synergistic interaction with traditional public land-use policy instruments to achieve incremental benefits as well as longer-term transformative outcomes in land-use protection.

TI  - Carbon stock dynamics in a disturbed tropical forest ecosystem of Central India: Strategies for achieving carbon neutrality
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Anthropogenic land use changes in the vicinity of forest catchments are explicitly responsible for the defores-tation and degradation of tropical forest thereby altering the carbon (C) balance under rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Thus, strategic mitigation measures are required to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. It becomes imperative to understand the impact of land cover conversion on the functioning of tropical forests and to determine the carbon dynamics. The present study examined the land cover changes (LUC) in dry tropical ecosystem of Central India during the last two decades and assessed its influence on the forest biomass, litter crop, and C stocks. Geospatial techniques coupled with ground measurements were employed in the study. The total biomass, vegetative C stocks and soil C were estimated as 64 to 338.3 Mg ha-1, 26.4 to 131.1 Mg C/ha and 24.6 to 50.2 Mg C/ha respectively. In the past decades (2000-2020), about 1851.8 ha of forest constituting 15.1% of the total area under study was lost (mainly to Agriculture) under open mixed forest, moderately mixed forest and mixed teak forest. The study demonstrated that forests of the studied region behave as a potential C source, which accounted for a net loss of 59 gigagram carbon (Gg C) equivalent to 216 Gg CO2eq. Besides, discussed three viable scenarios of restoration to offset C emissions and to achieve C neutral landscape by 2030. The conservation and restoration of 26-85% degraded forests (open mixed forest and moderately mixed dense forests), use of agroforestry on 1/5th of existing agricultural lands, or implementation of regenerative agricul-tural practices in 30% of the area will compensate for net losses, while attaining C neutrality. Further, the finding of this study helps to understand the climatic extremes as per the commitments of Paris Agreement, 2015 and Glasgow Pact, 2021.

TI  - Does conservation agriculture deliver climate change mitigation through soil carbon sequestration in tropical agro-ecosystems?
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Conservation agriculture (CA), comprising minimum soil disturbance, retention of crop residues and crop diversification, is widely promoted for reducing soil degradation and improving agricultural sustainability. It is also claimed to mitigate climate change through soil carbon sequestration: we conducted a meta-analysis of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock changes under CA practices in two tropical regions, the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), to quantify this. In IGP annual increases in SOC stock compared to conventional practice were between 0.16 and 0.49 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). In SSA increases were between 0.28 and 0.96 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), but with much greater variation and a significant number of cases with no measurable increase. Most reported SOC stock increases under CA are overestimates because of errors introduced by inappropriate soil sampling methodology. SOC increases require careful interpretation to assess whether or not they represent genuine climate change mitigation as opposed to redistribution of organic C within the landscape or soil profile. In smallholder farming in tropical regions social and economic barriers can greatly limit adoption of CA, further decreasing realistic mitigation potential. Comparison with the decreases in greenhouse gas emissions possible through improved management of nitrogen (N) fertilizer in regions such as IGP where N use is already high, suggests that this is a more effective and sustainable means of mitigating climate change. However the mitigation potential, and other benefits, from crop diversification are frequently overlooked when considering CA and warrant greater attention. Increases in SOC concentration (as opposed to stock) in near-surface soil from CA cause improvements in soil physical conditions; these are expected to contribute to increased sustainability and climate change adaptation, though not necessarily leading to consistently increased crop yields. CA should be promoted on the basis of these factors and any climate change mitigation regarded as an additional benefit, not a major policy driver for its adoption. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Survival and growth of five Neotropical timber species in monocultures and mixtures
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Conversion of tropical forests to crop lands and pastures has been an on-going issue in the Neotropics for decades. Despite the fact that international agreements and incentives have tried to encourage the reforestation of degraded lands in developing countries, in Panama, the actual area reforested has been limited. One of the reasons is that one of the preferred timber species, Tectona grandis (Teak), grows poorly on the infertile and clay soils that dominate much of the country, including the Panama Canal watershed.
   Reforestation strategies that optimize both the economic return and the production of ecosystem services in tropical degraded lands could meet the demands of different stakeholders from local to international scales. We evaluated the growth and survival of five valuable native timber species grown in both monocultures and mixtures.
   In 2008 a fully replicated design with 267 plots and 21 treatments was set up. A total of 22,267 trees were annually monitored until 2015. Locally developed allometric biomass models were used to determine above-ground biomass (AGB) of each treatment in order to assess growth and productivity in monocultures and mixed plantations from five native species (Anacardiurn excelsium, Dalbergia retusa, Pachira quinata, Tabebuia rosea and Terminalia amazonia) that differed in key functional traits.
   Biomass accumulation of Terminalia amazonia monocultures far exceeded that of all other treatments, with up to 47.1 t/ha of biomass 7 years after planting. Nonetheless, individual tree growth of T. amazonia was much higher in mixtures than in monoculture, indicating that intraspecific competition started to limit growth. All target species significantly overyielded in the five-species mixture, indicating a diversity effect. The high Relative Land Output (>4) exhibited by Pachira quinata in mixture with the nitrogen fixing Dalbergia retusa indicated a facilitation effect from the latter.

TI  - Simulated effects of logging on carbon storage in dipterocarp forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. As the role of forestry-based options for reducing or mitigating greenhouse gas emissions is debated by policymakers, there is a need to inform the debate by synthesizing existing information on carbon dynamics in tropical forest systems and by applying this information to a range of possible interventions in forestry.
   2. To investigate the consequences of reductions in logging damage for ecosystem carbon storage, we constructed a model to simulate changes in biomass and carbon pools following logging of primary dipterocarp forests in south-east Asia. We adapted a physiologically driven tree-based model of natural forest gap dynamics (FORMIX) to simulate forest recovery following logging.
   3. Following selective logging, simulated ecosystem carbon storage declined from prelogging levels (213 Mg C ha(-1)) to a low of 97 Mg C ha(-1), 7 years after logging. Carbon storage in biomass approached prelogging levels about 120 years after logging.
   4. The relationship between fatal stand damage and ecosystem carbon storage was not linear, with biomass recovery following logging severely limited by 50-60% stand damage.
   5. Results from simulations suggest that when 20-50% of the stand is killed during logging, replacing persistent forest species with pioneer tree species can reduce the site's potential for carbon storage by 15-26% over 40-60 years.
   6. Reducing fatal damage from 40% to 20% of the residual stand, as was the case with a pilot project in Malaysia, was associated with an increase of 36 Mg C ha(-1) in mean carbon storage over 60 years.
   7. Efforts to monitor and verify the benefits, either through carbon sequestration in new growth or carbon retention in existing biomass, of offset projects involving tropical forests and natural forest management should focus on above-ground biomass, particularly the large trees. Selection of the most appropriate allometric equations for a site and species is important because of their influence on biomass estimates.

TI  - Anthropogenic activities dominated tropical forest carbon balance in two contrary ways over the Greater Mekong Subregion in the 21st century
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - The tropical forest carbon (C) balance threatened by extensive socio-economic development in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) in Asia is a notable data gap and remains contentious. Here we generated a long-term spatially quantified assessment of changes in forests and C stocks from 1999 to 2019 at a spatial resolution of 30 m, based on multiple streams of state-of-the-art high-resolution satellite imagery and in situ observations. Our results show that (i) about 0.54 million square kilometers (21.0% of the region) experienced forest cover transitions with a net increase in forest cover by 4.3% (0.11 million square kilometers, equivalent to 0.31 petagram of C [Pg C] stocks); (ii) forest losses mainly in Cambodia, Thailand, and in the south of Vietnam, were also counteracted by forest gains in China due mainly to afforestation; and (iii) at the national level during the study period an increase in both C stocks and C sequestration (net C gain of 0.087 Pg C) in China from new plantation, offset anthropogenetic emissions (net C loss of 0.074 Pg C) mainly in Cambodia and Thailand from deforestation. Political, social, and economic factors significantly influenced forest cover change and C sequestration in the GMS, positively in China while negatively in other countries, especially in Cambodia and Thailand. These findings have implications on national strategies for climate change mitigation and adaptation in other hotspots of tropical forests.

TI  - Primate and ungulate responses to teak agroforestry in a southern Amazonian landscape
T2  - MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY
AB  - Agroforestry systems are widely extolled as a biodiversity-friendly alternative to food and wood production. However, few studies on large-vertebrates in the tropics consistently support this assumption. In the Amazonian 'arch of deforestation', commodity cropland and pastures for beef production have relentlessly replaced native forests. Agroforestry should therefore be both economically profitable and a more wildlife-friendly land-use alternative. Here we assess the local abundance and habitat use by forest primates and ungulates in a landscape mosaic containing large areas of primary forest and teak (Tectona grandis) agroforestry. We focused on animals of these groups because they have similar day ranges and home ranges, and are at the same trophic level. We surveyed 12 transects in both of these environments, totalling 485 km walked. We recorded four ungulate (Tayassu pecari, Pecari tajacu, Mazama americana, and Tapirus terrestris) and seven primate species (Ateles chamek, Lagothrix cana, Sapajus apella, Saimiri ustus, Chiropotes albinasus, Plecturocebus cf. moloch and Mico cf. emiliae). We indicate the importance of a species-level approach to evaluate the contribution of agroforests to population persistence. Large-bodied atelids, which are ripe-fruit-pulp specialists, were never recorded in teak agroforest. Sakis were more common in primary forest, while the smallest faunivore-frugivores had similar sighting rates in both environments. Ungulates exhibited subtler differences in their use of space than primates, but their sighting rates and track counts indicated temporal niche partition. White-lipped peccaries and red brocket deer were the only ungulates more frequently recorded in primary forest areas. Teak agroforestry still harbours some large and midsized frugivores, which may contribute with some biotic ecosystem services if their patches are connected to primary tropical forests. However, teak agroforestry should not be used to justify population subsidies for all Amazonian forest vertebrate species, since at least some threatened species clearly avoid forest stands dominated by this fast-growing exotic tree.

T2  - NEOTROPICAL SAVANNAS AND SEASONALLY DRY FORESTS: PLANT DIVERSITY, BIOGEOGRAPHY, AND CONSERVATION
CP  - Meeting on Tropical Savannas and Seasonally Dry Forests
AB  - The status and biogeography of Mesoamerican seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTF) are briefly described. Two areas with SDTF conservation initiatives, one in Oaxaca, Mexico, the other in southern Nicaragua, are described. The degree to which scientific practices have influenced their establishment is discussed. The reasons for the selection of these areas as sites for biodiversity conservation are shown to be largely determined without recourse to scientific procedures such as biodiversity assessment or systematic reserve selection. It is argued that such opportunistic reserve selection, especially where local concerns are taken into account, is inevitable and can contribute much to the conservation of Mesoamerican SDTF.

TI  - Estimations of REDD plus opportunity costs: Aligning methods with objectives
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB  - Since the early 2000 ' s when discussions started around the concept of REDD+ , numerous studies estimated the opportunity costs often implicitly viewed as proxies for the total costs of avoided deforestation. We reviewed their methods and the stated objectives to assess their alignment, suitability and robustness. We found a lack of correspondence between methods and objectives, which include setting compensation levels, identifying costefficient activities, or assessing financial viability with respect to carbon markets. While the search for perfect accuracy is a fallacy, some major mistakes must be avoided, e.g. equating the costs of avoided deforestation to opportunity costs or including an inappropriate group of economic agents in the calculations. Best practises must be followed to ensure that estimations properly inform intervention design, decisions and policies; they refer to methods applied and their suitability for related decisions. They include: the need to first define objectives and then adapt methods because estimations can be done variously with contrasted results; to cautiously determine the scope - which stakeholders and stages of value chain are considered - while prioritising the broad picture and avoiding getting lost in estimation details; to discuss sensitivity of results and recognise uncertainties; and to consider the implications of scale in the study design. Given the urgency to preserve natural forest and mitigate climate change in the most cost-effective way, we believe that our analysis and its recommendations are a step in this direction with expected increased emissions reductions due to improved interventions.

TI  - MESOCLOSURES - increasing realism in mesocosm studies of ecosystem functioning
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - 1. Experimental studies linking community composition to functioning are typically confined to small and closed micro- or mesocosms. Such restricted conditions may affect both species' biology and their environment. Yet, targeting simple features in the behaviour of species may circumvent these constraints. Focusing on ecological functions provided by dung beetles, we test whether large, open-top cages - MESOCLOSURES - will intercept the flight trajectories of beetles, thereby allowing manipulation of local community composition.
   2. MESOCLOSURES were built in both tropical forest (Brazil) and temperate grasslands (Finland), thus testing their general efficiency. Within the respective environments, we varied different aspects of MESOCLOSURE design: in the tropical forest, we examined the impact of MESOCLOSURE dimensions on exclusion efficiency, whereas in the temperate grassland, we assessed the potential for selectively excluding and including community members by different mesh sizes. In the temperate environment, we also went from method to application, using MESOCLOSURES to relate community composition to functioning under two simulated grazing regimes.
   3. MESOCLOSURES allowed efficient manipulation of dung beetle communities, maintaining dung beetle densities at intended levels in both temperate and tropical systems. In the tropics, the smallest cages (1x1m) offered the highest contrast in beetle densities inside vs. outside of the fence, whereas the largest cages (9x9m) offered the lowest. Nonetheless, densities inside cages never exceed one-fifth of those outside. At the temperate site, manipulations of community structure through mesh size yielded significant differences in functioning and suggested an interaction between small dung-dwelling species and large tunnelling species. Within cages, higher grazing was reflected in augmented dung removal.
   4.We conclude that MESOCLOSURES can be effectively used to study dung beetle functions across habitats and latitudes. As applied insights, the present study adds resolution to the significance of different functional groups of dung beetles and shows that grazing pressure may have an important impact on the ecosystem functions that they provide. Overall, this study suggests that targeted manipulation of dispersal may offer new solutions for linking fauna to ecosystem functions with minimal impact on the processes measured.

TI  - Tree species classification in tropical forests using visible to shortwave infrared WorldView-3 images and texture analysis
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Tropical forest conservation and management can significantly benefit from information about the spatial distribution of tree species. Very-high resolution (VHR) spaceborne platforms have been hailed as a promising technology for mapping tree species over broad spatial extents. WorldView-3, the most advanced VHR sensor, provides spectral data in 16 bands covering the visible to near-infrared (VNIR, 400-1040 nm) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR, 1210-2365 nm) wavelength ranges. It also collects images at unprecedented levels of details using a panchromatic band with 0.3-m of spatial resolution. However, the potential of WorldView-3 at its full spectral and spatial resolution for tropical tree species classification remains unknown. In this study, we performed a comprehensive assessment of WorldView-3 images acquired in the dry and wet seasons for tree species discrimination in tropical semi-deciduous forests. Classification experiments were performed using VNIR individually and combined with SWIR channels. To take advantage of the sub-metric resolution of the panchromatic band for classification, we applied an individual tree crown (ITC)-based approach that employed pan sharpened VNIR bands and gray level co-occurrence matrix texture features. We determined whether the combination of images from the two annual seasons improves the classification accuracy. Finally, we investigated which plant traits influenced species detection. The new SWIR sensing capabilities of WorldView-3 increased the average producer's accuracy up to 7.8%, by enabling the detection of non-photosynthetic vegetation within ITCs. The combination of VNIR bands from the two annual seasons did not improve the classification results when compared to the results obtained using images from each season individually. The use of VNIR bands at their original 1.2-m spatial resolution yielded average producer's accuracies of 43.1 +/- 3.1% and 38.8 +/- 3% in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The ITC -based approach improved the accuracy to 70 +/- 8% in the wet and 68.4 +/- 7.4% in the dry season. Texture analysis of the panchromatic band enabled the detection of species-specific differences in crown structure, which improved species detection. The use of texture analysis, pan-sharpening, and ITC delineation is a potential approach to perform tree species classification in tropical forests with WorldView-3 satellite images.

TI  - Interspecific variation in vitamin E levels and the extent of lipid peroxidation in pioneer and non-pioneer species used in tropical forest restoration
T2  - TREE PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Reforestation projects have gained interest over recent years due to the loss of biodiversity in tropical regions as a result of large deforestation by anthropogenic actions. However, better knowledge on the tolerance of plant species to environmental stresses is needed for reforestation success. Here, we evaluated the photoprotective and antioxidant capacity, in terms of vitamin E accumulation, of five pioneer (Platypodium elegans Vogel, Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi, Lafoensia pacari A. St.-Hil, Cecropia pachystachya Tr,cul. and Aegiphila sellowiana Cham.) and five non-pioneer (Myracrodruon urundeuva Allemo, Cedrela fissilis Vell., Genipa americana L., Copaifera langsdorffii Desf. and Hymenaea courbaril L.) species, in relation to the extent of lipid peroxidation in leaves. Furthermore, we examined differences between sun and shade leaves on vitamin E accumulation and the extent of lipid peroxidation. Pioneer plants showed on average 33% higher malondialdehyde levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, than non-pioneer species, but no significant differences in vitamin E contents. In contrast, a marked interspecific variation was observed in the levels of alpha-tocopherol and its precursor, gamma-tocopherol. Natural variation revealed interesting relationships between vitamin E levels and the extent of lipid peroxidation in leaves. The pioneer species, P. elegans, did not accumulate alpha-tocopherol and displayed the highest levels of malondialdehyde. Sun and shade leaves accumulated vitamin E levels to a similar extent, except for the pioneer L. pacari and the non-pioneer C. langsdorffii, the former accumulating more alpha-tocopherol in sun leaves and the latter in shade leaves. We conclude that interspecific variation is higher than both leaf type and successional-group variation in terms of vitamin E accumulation and the extent of lipid peroxidation, and that vitamin E levels, particularly those of alpha-tocopherol, negatively correlate with the extent of lipid peroxidation, thus supporting a photoprotective and antioxidant function for vitamin E in plants growing in tropical environments.

TI  - Early successional understory communities show idiosyncratic phylogenetic patterns in Neotropical silvicultural plantations
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - One approach in forest restoration is to plant trees that will establish an initial canopy to promote forest recovery through the colonization of other species. The identity of the planted tree affects which species are able to recruit in its understory. Here we evaluate the phylogenetic structure of young understory plant communities recruiting beneath eleven different species planted in single species stands and relate those structures with processes affecting community assembly. We expected the presence of negative biotic interactions between closely related overstory and understory species, as well as among related understory species, to lead to phylogenetic overdispersion. However, we did not find consistent phylogenetic patterns maybe due to the young age of the understory communities at the time of sampling. Most overstories showed a higher than expected presence of close relatives due to the recruitment of con specifics, whereas, the higher recruitment of the ancient Glade of Piperaceae beneath Fabaceae trees led to overdispersion. The presence of various Asteraceae species in understories that had been invaded by the grass, Saccharum spontaneum, led to significant clustering suggesting the conservatism of traits that allow overcoming the strong competition imposed by the grass. Phylogenetic patterns among the recruiting species showed that dispersal and competition are playing a role in shaping the communities. Our results highlight the importance of choosing an adequate set of species to plant in a restoration project since they dictate the subsequent regeneration of a forest community.

TI  - Predicting resilience and stability of early second-growth forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Identifying deforested areas with high potential for natural forest recovery can be used as an aid for ecological restoration projects at large-scale. However, accurate predictions that infer the resilience (i.e. recovery rate after deforestation) and stability (i.e. the ability of the ecosystem to maintain its functions) of early second-growth forests are scarce at a regional scale. Here, we investigated the effect of climate, soil and topography on the resilience and stability of 165 early second-growth forests throughout the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We also built prediction maps of potential resilience and stability to identify where reforestation could be optimized in the early stages of forest succession. We assessed the resilience and stability through an interannual plant primary productivity time series using a normalized difference vegetation index. Our analysis reveals that resilience was mainly associated with isothermality (i.e. diurnal temperature oscillation relative to the annual temperature oscillation) and precipitation of the warmest quarter. In turn, stability was mainly associated with the probability of bedrock occurrence, annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality. The prediction maps show a spatial pattern in which potential resilience and stability increase from north to south of the Atlantic Forest. Forest restoration can be optimized in regions with high potential resilience and stability, such as an isolated area on the north coast in the Bahia state and the southern region. However, restoration may require active practices and management in regions with low potential for both ecosystem properties, such as the north inland in the Bahia and Minas Gerais states. This ecosystemic approach can help achieve Atlantic Forest restoration commitments.

TI  - Changes in plant diversity and community attributes of coal mine affected forest in relation to a community reserve forest of Nagaland, Northeast India
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - This study assessed changes in herb, shrub and tree composition of Coal mining-affected forest (CMAF) area in relation to a community reserve forest designated as Non-affected forest (NAF) of Changki village, Nagaland, Northeast India. In all the three plant life forms, Shannon-Wiener index, Simpson's diversity index and Margalef richness index showed higher species diversity and richness in NAF compared to CMAF while Sorenson's index reveals a low species similarity between the sites. Pielou's evenness was higher at NAF and a contiguous pattern was prominently distributed in both the forest. The family Poaceae, Asteraceae and Cyperaceae dominated the CMAF while Euphorbiaceae, Rubiaceae and Poaceae dominated NAF. The NAF has greater plant density compared to CMAF and the IVI shows the dominant status of native tree Terminalia myriocarpa in the Northeastern tropical forest. Weeds like Ageratum conyzoides, Bidens pilosa and Drymaria cordata were prominently distributed in CMAF while Abarema clypearia, Inula cappa and Strobilanthes coloratus has been obstructed by mining. The result imparted that the plant diversity of Nagaland tropical forests are under threat due to coal mining which has reduced the vegetation diversity and induce the loss of dominant plant species. As such, regulation of mine waste, land reclamation projects, robust forest management and bioremediation can be scientifically integrated to reduce the mining repercussion effects. Moreover, the result emphasizes the need to impart the tribal knowledge of preserving natural forest to the upcoming generations and develop conservation strategies to prevent further degradation or loss of biodiversity in this part of the Indo-Burma hotspot region.

TI  - Does rice paddy management increase soil organic carbon in the warm temperate and tropical regions?
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
AB  - Enhancing soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in agricultural fields is an effective option for climate change mitigation and food security. In temperate regions, rice farming under paddy is known to increase SOC stock due mainly to the reduced decomposition caused by prolonged submerged conditions compared to the cropping practices under non-flooded conditions. It remains unclear, however, if and to what extent rice paddy management increases SOC storage in warmer climate regions where decomposition is much faster. We thus examined the factors controlling the SOC stock and the net change in SOC normalized to the duration under paddy (Delta SOC) at paddy fields in warm temperate (21 sites) and tropical climatic regions (11 sites) from peer-reviewed literature which was concentrated to Asia. Using collected data (e.g., SOC content, bulk density, mean annual temperature (MAT), precipitation, management duration, soil management, crop rotation), we evaluated predictor variables that account for Delta SOC variability (i.e., mean decrease accuracy) by random forest regression. The mean paddy duration for all data (n = 170) was 22 years. Average SOC stock and Delta SOC at 0-20 cm depth were 38 +/- 1.45SE Mg C ha(-1) and 0.34 +/- 0.04SE Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, indicating that continuous paddy management had a positive effect on SOC storage in both climatic regions. SOC stock was two-fold higher and Delta SOC was four-fold higher in the warm temperate region compared to the tropical region (p < 0.05). The best predictor variables for Delta SOC were MAT followed by soil management and then paddy duration. While organic amendment including both straw and manure increased Delta SOC in both warm temperate and tropical paddies, we did not detect a positive effect of chemical fertilizer application alone or crop rotation type (e.g., rice-upland vs rice-rice). Despite high variability, Delta SOC in the warm temperate region significantly declined over time from 0.82 +/- 0.10 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (< 20 yrs) to 0.22 +/- 0.06 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). While SOC stock was 50% lower, the tropical paddies showed no clear decline in Delta SOC up to 41 years (0.04-0.21 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)). These results suggest that SOC accretion might have reached equilibrium after 20 years of paddy practice in the warm temperate region and, if so, Delta SOC is likely to diminish to zero in the near future. In tropical paddy fields, on the other hand, slow SOC build-up may continue for a longer term although the Delta SOC value itself is not high. While the current study showed the efficacy of paddy management on SOC build-up under the warmer climate regions, further study on the rate and qualitative changes is necessary to evaluate the trade-offs between soil fertility improvement (e.g., soil N build-up) and methane emission.

TI  - Who Cares about Forests and Why? Individual Values Attributed to Forests in a Post-Frontier Region in Amazonia
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Understanding the multiple ways people value forests is important, as individual values regarding nature have been shown to partly determine willingness to participate in conservation initiatives. As individual values are influenced by past experiences, the way people value forests may be related to the ecosystem services they use and receive. We here aim to investigate if people value forests because of material and non-material benefits forest provide (material and non-material values), and if these values are defined by previous experiences associated with using forest resources and having frequent contact with forests. By interviewing 363 residents across 20 landscapes varying in forest cover in a post-frontier region in Amazonia, we evaluated: (1) if the use of forest resources-especially bushmeat, important for sustenance and cash income in virtually all tropical forests-is associated with attributing higher material value to forests; (2) whether the contact with forest (estimated by local forest cover and visits to forests) is associated with attributing higher non-material value to forests. As expected, respondents from households where hunting occurs and bushmeat consumption is more frequent attributed higher material value to forests, and those living in more deforested landscapes and that visited forests less often attributed lower non-material value to forests. The importance of bushmeat in shaping the way people value forests suggests that encouraging the sustainable use of this product will encourage forest conservation. Results also point to a potential dangerous reinforcing cycle: low forest cover and the loss of contact with forests may erode forest values and facilitate further deforestation. Engaging rural communities in forest conservation initiatives is challenging yet urgent in degraded landscapes, although harnessing appreciation for bushmeat could offer a starting point.

TI  - Predicting the terminal velocity of dipterocarp fruit
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - We measured the terminal velocity of helicopter-like fruit from the Dipterocarpaceae family and present a model predicting the terminal velocities for all dipterocarp species in the Malesiana region. A ballistic model of seed dispersal using the observed terminal velocities predicted dispersal distances of 17-77m under normal atmospheric conditions. These data are of applied use in parametizing models of species coexistence, forest regeneration and habitat connectivity in Southeast Asian tropical forests.

TI  - Combining mechanical control and tree planting to restore montane Atlantic forests dominated by the Neotropical bracken (Pteridium arachnoideum)
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Climate and land-use changes have driven the dominance of native herbaceous plants in degraded tropical forests, leading to losses in biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, controlling these super-dominant species to promote forest regeneration is often ineffective and may favour undesirable species. Native clonal ferns from the Pteridium genus often dominate degraded tropical forests subjected to repeated fires. Although many ways of controlling these species have been proposed, the efficiency of different combinations of strategies and their effect on forest recovery remain unknown. Here, we assessed to what extent removing the aboveground biomass of the shade-intolerant Pteridium arachnoideum and planting trees contributed to the control of this fern and the recovery of montane Atlantic forests in south-east Brazil. In four sites dominated by P. arachnoideum we applied five treatments in adjacent plots: (1) control without interference, (2) cutting twice per year, (3) cutting twice per year plus tree planting, (4) cutting three times per year, and (5) cutting three times per year plus tree planting. Over two consecutive years we repeated the treatments and monitored P. arachnoideum height, rhizome and above-ground biomass, as well as the composition of the established vegetation and soil seed bank. We also assessed the survival and growth of the planted trees. Tree planting accounted for over half of the treatment costs, whereas increasing the cutting frequency only increased costs by 15 %. After two years, the three times per year cutting treatment caused the largest decrease in above-ground biomass (1 to 0.1 kg/m2) and abundance (80 to 15 %) of P. arachnoideum. Planted trees exhibited low survival (47 %) rates and growth (30 cm/year), and hence had no effect on the dominance of P. arachnoideum. Treatments did not affect rhizome biomass, suggesting that P. arachnoideum could regain its dominance if cutting treatments were discontinued. Although two annual cuts slightly favoured tree regeneration, trees were rare in both the established vegetation (less than 10 %) and seed bank (less than 0.3 seeds/dm3). Conversely, under three annual cuts the African grass M. minutiflora became more abundant in both the established vegetation (5 to 25 %) and seed bank (1 to 4 seeds/dm3). Our findings show that intensive mechanical removal decreases the dominance of P. arachnoideum in Atlantic forests. However, its benefits to forest recovery seem to be limited by lack of tree regeneration, impoverished seed banks and invasive grasses. Therefore, planting fast-growing and drought-tolerant tree species may be essential to the recovery of these degraded Neotropical forests.

TI  - Landscapes on the Move: Land-Use Change History in a Mexican Agroforest Frontier
T2  - LAND
AB  - An unprecedented magnitude of land-use/land-cover changes have led to a rapid conversion of tropical forested landscapes to different land-uses. This comparative study evaluates and reconstructs the recent history (1976-2019) of land-use change and the associated land-use types that have emerged over time in two neighboring rural villages in Southern Mexico. Qualitative ethnographic and oral histories research and quantitative land-use change analysis using remote sensing were used. Findings indicate that several interacting historical social-ecological drivers (e.g., colonization program, soil quality, land conflicts with indigenous people, land-tenure, availability of surrounding land where to expand, Guatemala's civil war, several agricultural development and conservation programs, regional wildfire, Zapatista uprising, and highway construction) have influenced each village's own unique land-use change history and landscape composition: the smaller village is characterized by a dominating pasture landscape with some scattered agricultural and forest areas, while the larger village has large conserved forest areas intermixed with pastures, agriculture, oil palm and rubber plantations. The differential histories of each village have also had livelihood diversification implications. It is suggested that landscape history research in tropical agroforest frontiers is necessary because it can inform land-use policies and forest conservation strategies that are compatible with local livelihoods and conservation goals.

TI  - Deforestation scenarios show the importance of secondary forest for meeting Panama's carbon goals
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB  - Context Tropical forest loss has a major impact on climate change. Secondary forest growth has potential to mitigate these impacts, but uncertainty regarding future land use, remote sensing limitations, and carbon model accuracy have inhibited understanding the range of potential future carbon dynamics. Objectives We evaluated the effects of four scenarios on carbon stocks and sequestration in a mixed-use landscape based on Recent Trends (RT), Accelerated Deforestation (AD), Grow Only (GO), and Grow Everything (GE) scenarios. Methods Working in central Panama, we coupled a 1-ha resolution LiDAR derived carbon map with a locally derived secondary forest carbon accumulation model. We used Dinamica EGO 4.0.5 to spatially simulate forest loss across the landscape based on recent deforestation rates. We used local studies of belowground, woody debris, and liana carbon to estimate ecosystem scale carbon fluxes. Results Accounting for 58.6 percent of the forest in 2020, secondary forests (< 50 years) accrue 88.9 percent of carbon in the GO scenario by 2050. RT and AD scenarios lost 36,707 and 177,035 ha of forest respectively by 2030, a carbon gain of 7.7 million Mg C (RT) and loss of 2.9 million Mg C (AD). Growing forest on all available land (GE) could achieve 56 percent of Panama's land-based carbon sequestration goal by 2050. Conclusions Our estimates of potential carbon storage demonstrate the important contribution of secondary forests to land-based carbon sequestration in central Panama. Protecting these forests will contribute significantly to meeting Panama's climate change mitigation goals and enhance water security.

TI  - Following a site-specific secondary succession in the Amazon using the Landsat CDR product and field inventory data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Secondary forests cover large areas and are strong carbon sinks in tropical regions. They are important for ecosystem functioning, biodiversity conservation, watershed protection, and recovery of soil fertility. In this study, we used the Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record (CDR) product from 16 Thematic Mapper (TM)/Landsat-5 images (1984-2010) to continuously track the secondary succession (SS) of a forest following land abandonment in 1980. Changes in canopy structure and floristic composition were analysed using data from four field inventories (1995, 2002, 2007, and 2012). To characterize variations in brightness, greenness, spectral reflectance, and shadows with the natural regeneration of vegetation, we applied tasselled cap transformations, principal component analysis (PCA), and linear spectral mixture models to the TM datasets. Shade fractions were plotted over time and correlated with the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Because image texture may reflect the variability of the successional process, eight co-occurrence-based filter metrics were calculated for selected TM bands and plotted as a function of time since abandonment. The successional forest was compared to a nearby primary reference forest (PF) and had differences in the spectral and textural means evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results showed increases of 35% and 10.4% over time in basal area and tree height, respectively. Species richness within the assemblage of sampling units increased from 14 to 71 between 1995 and 2012, and this trend was also confirmed using an individual-based rarefaction analysis. Species richness in 2012 was still lower than that observed in the PF site, which presented greater amounts of aboveground biomass (336.4 + 17.0 ton ha(-1) for PF versus 98.5 + 21.4 ton ha(-1) for SS in 2012). Brightness and greenness tasselled cap differences between the SS and PF rapidly decreased from 1984 (SS at the age of 4 years) to 1991 (age of 11 years). Brightness also decreased from 1997 to 2003, as indicated by PC1 scores and surface reflectance of the TM bands 4 (near infrared) and 5 (shortwave infrared). Spectral mixture shade fraction increased from young to old successional stages with strata composition and canopy structure development, whereas NDVI and EVI decreased over time. Because EVI was strongly dependent on near infrared reflectance (r = + 0.96), it was also much more strongly correlated with the shade fraction (r = -0.93) than NDVI. Except for the image texture mean that decreased from young to old successional stages in TM bands 4 and 5, no clear trend was observed in the remaining texturemetrics over the time period of vegetation regeneration. Overall, due to structural-floristic and spectral/textural differences with the PF, the SS site was still distinguishable using Landsat data 30 years after land abandonment. Most of the spectral metric means between PF and SS were significantly different over time at 0.01 significance level, as indicated by ANOVA.

TI  - Alternative Tree Species for Sustainable Forest Management in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - The scarcity of hardwoods from tropical forests makes the search for alternative species necessary for commercialization. This study aimed to establish groups of timber species from the Amazon Forest with potential for logging purposes through the assessment of their physical-mechanical properties, aiming to identify alternative species that can meet the market demands. We utilized data from the Forest Products Laboratory (LPF) (containing information on basic density and other wood mechanical properties) and the Timberflow platform, as well. We applied a multivariate cluster analysis technique with the aim of grouping species based on the technological characteristics of their wood and evaluating similarity among them to obtain homogeneous groups in terms of economic potential and utilization. The results indicated four homogeneous groups: Cluster 1 (40.72% of species, basic density-db: 690 kg m-3), Cluster 2 (13.92%, db: 260 and 520 kg m-3), Cluster 3 (27.32%, db: 550 and 830 kg m-3), and Cluster 4 (18.04%, db: 830 kg m-3). Most of the 20 listed species are classified as more commercially viable (70%), with high wood density. Species identified as alternatives include Dialium guianense and Zollernia paraensis for Dipteryx odorata, Terminalia argentea for Dinizia excelsa, Terminalia amazonia and Buchenavia grandis for Goupia glabra, and Protium altissimum and Maclura tinctoria for Hymenaea courbaril. The analysis highlighted the overexploitation of a restricted group of species and the need to find alternatives to ensure the sustainability of forest management. This study contributed to identifying species that can serve as alternatives to commercial ones, promoting a more balanced and sustainable forest management.

TI  - Residual Multi-Attention Classification Network for A Forest Dominated Tropical Landscape Using High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
AB  - Tropical forests are of vital importance for maintaining biodiversity, regulating climate and material cycles while facing deforestation, agricultural reclamation, and managing various pressures. Remote sensing (RS) can support effective monitoring and mapping approaches for tropical forests, and to facilitate this we propose a deep neural network with an encoder-decoder architecture here to classify tropical forests and their environment. To deal with the complexity of tropical landscapes, this method utilizes a multi-scale convolution neural network (CNN) to expand the receptive field and extract multi-scale features. The model refines the features with several attention modules and fuses them through an upsampling module. A two-stage training strategy is proposed to alleviate misclassifications caused by sample imbalances. A joint loss function based on cross-entropy loss and the generalized Dice loss is applied in the first stage, and the second stage used the focal loss to fine-tune the weights. As a case study, we use Hainan tropical reserves to test the performance of this model. Compared with four state-of-the-art (SOTA) semantic segmentation networks, our network achieves the best performance with two Hainan datasets (mean intersection over union (MIoU) percentages of 85.78% and 82.85%). We also apply the new model to classify a public true color dataset which has 17 semantic classes and obtain results with an 83.75% MIoU. This further demonstrates the applicability and potential of this model in complex classification tasks.

TI  - Removing understory vegetation in oil palm agroforestry reduces ground-foraging ant abundance but not species richness
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Ants are known to provide valuable ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes, including oil palm plantations. Their communities are less diverse and more uneven in oil palm compared with forest, and this may increase their vulnerability to disturbance. This study quantifies ant communities in oil palm agroforestry and experimentally tests their robustness to a common practice high-disturbance management intervention: removing understory vegetation.
   Fieldwork was based at the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function in Tropical Agriculture (BEFTA) Understory Vegetation Project in Sumatra, Indonesia, where three treatments varying in their degree of understory vegetation management were established in 2014: (1) widespread herbicide was applied removing all understory vegetation (Reduced); (2) herbicide was applied to the harvesting paths and circles, and other vegetation was allowed to grow (Normal control); (3) no herbicide was applied (Enhanced). We measured ground-foraging ant communities before and after the treatments were implemented, using pitfall traps over 324 trap-nights (a trap-night is one trap set for one night). We investigated how ant abundance, species richness, species evenness, beta diversity, and community composition differed between the treatments.
   We found 3507 ants across 68 species or morphospecies. Seven of these were highly abundant and accounted for 78% of individuals. Post-treatment ant abundance was lower in the reduced treatment (mean per plot: 84) than in the normal (159) and enhanced (131) treatments, which did not differ from each other. Species richness, species evenness, beta diversity and community composition were not affected by the vegetation treatments.
   We recommend that oil palm growers maintain understory vegetation in oil palm plantations to support ground-foraging ants. Though not tested here, this may also improve ant-mediated ecosystem services, such as pest control, seed dispersal, nutrient redistribution, and the maintenance of soil health. This study demonstrates that enhancing habitat complexity through management practices can support biodiversity in monocrop landscapes. (C) 2020 Gesellschaft fur okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - Causes and consequences ofCedrela odoratainvasion in West African semi-deciduous tropical forests
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB  - Most of the West African forests have disappeared or have been deeply fragmented. This deforestation dynamic is still ongoing under a strong demographic pressure, forests being mostly replaced by agricultural lands. On the other hand, some reforestation projects are also undertaken, in particular by planting non-native species likeCedrela odorata. To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the causes and consequences ofCedrela odorataspread in West African natural forests. We studied a 400ha area of natural forest where 100ha of permanent plots have been affected by a major fire in 1983. Within these permanent plots, 21,444 trees were mapped, botanically determined and their diameters at breast height were measured in 2018. Using a bayesian hierarchical framework, we modelled the causes of the spread ofCedrela odoratain the studied plots, and its consequences on aboveground biomass and tree community diversity. Regarding the causes, the occurrence ofCedrela odoratais significantly linked to the fire occurence 25 years ago, to the proximity of the forest edge and to the presence of hydromorphic soils. Regarding the consequences,Cedrela odoratainvasion doesn't have any significant impact on the above-ground biomass but has a strong negative effect on the tree community diversity, as far as decreasing Simpson diversity in Hill numbers from 27 equivalent species in slightly invaded plots to 2 equivalent species in largely invaded plots. Our results highlight the long-lasting impacts of human disturbance (fire,Cedrela odorataintroduction) on forest ecosystems and the need to use local species for ongoing reforestation plans in West African semi-deciduous forests.

TI  - Effect of land tenure on forest cover and the paradox of private titling in Panama
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Meeting sustainable development goals requires policies that account for interrelatedness in social and environmental issues such as land tenure and deforestation. This work takes advantage of a nationwide titling campaign in Panama to explore the effect of private titling on forest cover across a heterogeneous landscape covering all stages of forest transition and diverse tenure arrangements. Situated in a broader matched analysis of the influence of zoning and tenure on forest cover, private management is estimated to have contributed to the deforestation of 1750-3650 km2 of mature forest nationwide from 1990 to 2020 with an average marginal effect of 15.3%. Conversely, Protected Areas and Indigenous Comarcas are estimated to have protected 1700-3900 km2 and 500-1250 km2 of mature forest, respectively. Private titling is associated with increased deforestation both during titling and years after, supporting observations that the titling process itself encourages speculative deforestation by title seekers and that private landholders value natural forests less than other land uses such as cattle. By disaggregating the data by region to highlight different stages of forest transition as well as by processes of deforestation and forest growth, this analysis shows that while private titling accelerates deforestation, it also encourages investment in reforestation. This presents a paradox for private titles and forests where agencies may perversely encourage speculative deforestation by creating stronger markets for forest-ready landscapes than for intact natural forests. In cases such as this one, where deforestation helps to secure a title, this paradox is confounded when having a title is set as a precondition for participation in a forest conservation program.

TI  - Evaluating the effectiveness of protected area management in Indonesia
T2  - ORYX
AB  - Protected areas worldwide are strongholds for safeguarding biodiversity, natural habitats, ecosystem services and cultural values. Yet despite their importance, the effectiveness of protected area management varies greatly. Indonesia is a biodiversity hotspot, with 554 protected areas that cover 27 million ha across the archipelago. To assess and improve the management effectiveness of these protected areas, the Government of Indonesia applied an adapted version of the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) to assess 422 of the country's protected areas, of which 170 were repeatedly assessed in 2015, 2017 and 2019. We investigated the METT score changes across these protected areas and the factors explaining the varying scores. Over the study years, METT scores significantly improved (mean increase of 44.1%). National parks had the highest mean score, which was 13.4 points higher than other protected area types. After correcting for spatial autocorrelation using a generalized least-squares model, we found that METT score increase was positively influenced by year of assessment and having a well-resourced management authority, with no influence of protected area size or mean protected area budget allocation per ha. The assessments identified five main threats to protected areas: poaching, illegal logging, human settlements, tourism and non-timber cultivation. The widespread and repeated use of METT across the protected areas of Indonesia and the increasing METT scores indicate an overall improvement in management and professionalism. Building on the foundational work in our study, future studies should assess the association between METT scores and progress made towards achieving the conservation objectives of protected areas.

TI  - Drivers of tropical forest cover increase: A systematic review
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Promoting natural regeneration can be a viable strategy to achieve ambitious restoration commitments, but predicting where native forest cover is likely to expand is challenging. Different biophysical and socioeconomic factors may determine the chances of native forest regrowth at different spatial and temporal scales, producing complex spatial patterns in the landscape and adding more and deeper information about potential for different forms of forest restoration. On the basis of a systematic literature review including 64 peer-reviewed articles from the global tropics and subtropics published from 1990 to 2017, we assessed the methodologies employed to remotely detect forest cover increase and to identify its biophysical and socioeconomic drivers. Automatic classification of multitemporal images and transition matrices were the most popular methods to detect areas of forest regrowth, whereas regression analysis was the most used analytical approaches to assess drivers. Forest cover increased more often on steeper slopes, close to forest remnants, inside protected areas, and far from population centers. However, the effects of most drivers varied among scales of evaluation and may be further affected by the scale of forest regrowth. The most influential biophysical and socioeconomic drivers of forest cover increase identified here can be used to develop predictive models on the likelihood of native forest regrowth to guide the implementation of cost-effective tropical forest restoration, thus contributing to the mitigation of climate change and species extinction. Current remote-sensing literature evaluating forest cover changes seems to be largely focused on deforestation dynamics, with little attention given to forest cover increase.

TI  - Compliance with sustainable forest management guidelines in three timber concessions in the Venezuelan Guayana: Analysis and implications
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - After more than 40 years of natural forest management (NFM) in Venezuela, out of 16 million ha of production forests only 10% located in the Guayana region is currently being managed with some consideration of sustainability. A recent survey of three private concessions in the Imataca Forest Reserve, based on partial consideration of criteria and indicators for the sustainable management of tropical forests, revealed that a new form of management is needed. Compliance with reduced impact logging was very low, with poor planning in logging operations detected in all cases, highly affecting forest stands and biomass recovery. A limited capacity for monitoring was also found. Social assessments showed that local communities in all cases demanded more participation in wood production benefits and tended to value provision services such as timber, food and water above other important regulations and cultural services. Here, three strategies are proposed as an effective way to partially modify NFM into a more integrated approach: 1) strengthening of institutional cooperation between private and public sectors and capacity building in the process of monitoring; 2) creation of a training framework for reduced impact logging techniques 3) a review of current legal structures and national policies related to NFM in order to favour small-scale operations.

TI  - Anthropogenic and biophysical predictors of deforestation in the Amazon: towards integrating REDD plus activities
T2  - BOSQUE
AB  - The Amazon is one of the most important tropical forests in the world, providing important goods and services to society. However, these forests are threatened by land use change. Deforestation and forest degradation are the two drivers that significantly contribute to both carbon emissions to the atmosphere and loss of biodiversity. Although there are alternatives to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, there is still little research on methods for assessing and monitoring the relationship between these processes and biodiversity (REDD+), as well as the impacts generated by the socioecological system on the stability and recovery of ecosystem services. With this review, we aimed at (i) describing the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning; (ii) analyzing the possible synergistic impacts of biophysical and anthropogenic predictors of deforestation; and, consequently, (iii) proposing the integrated implementation of REDD+ strategies in the Amazon basin. To increase REDD+ efficiency in the Amazon, it is essential to simultaneously evaluate the socioecological and biophysical predictors that directly affect the current and future demands for ecosystem goods and services. Accordingly, it is important to estimate the magnitude of multifactorial effects of deforestation predictors for the integration of REDD+ actions. Such estimations should be made through the rehabilitation of degraded lands with successional and permanent agroforestry systems, as well as with the application of different restoration methods.

TI  - Edge effects: impact of anthropogenic activities on vegetation structure and diversity in western Umfurudzi Park, Zimbabwe
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Understanding the patterns and intensity of anthropogenic impacts on habitats is important in the conservation of tropical ecosystems. The aim of the study was to establish the associated edge effects of anthropogenic disturbances on vegetation in western Umfurudzi Park, Zimbabwe. Three study strata were established using distance from the boundary into the park. Vegetation attributes and anthropogenic disturbance levels data were collected in 2012. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were noted on tree and shrub density, woody plant height, woody plant diversity, grass height and grass sward width across the three strata. Land clearing, livestock grazing and firewood collection were the most frequent and pronounced disturbances occurring along the park boundary. These disturbances decreased in intensity as distance from the boundary increased. We recommend the following: (i) the need to revisit the buffer zone concept and policy measures associated with ecosystem services and goods provision for communities surrounding protected areas, (ii) engaging neighbouring communities on sustainable ways of deriving ecosystem goods and services from buffer zones and protected areas and (iii) further studies on the regeneration and recovery of cleared patches along the boundary and their use by wildlife species in the park.

TI  - PREDICTION OF NEOTROPICAL TREE AND LIANA SPECIES RICHNESS FROM SOIL AND CLIMATIC DATA
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - We present an analysis of local species richness in neotropical forests, based on a number of 0.1 ha samples of woody plants collected by the late Alwyn Gentry. For each of 69 forests, soils were analysed and climatic data were collated. Using transformed independent variables and interaction terms, multiple regression equations were developed that explained the greatest possible amount of variation in species richness, and the best equations were selected on the basis of regression diagnostics. The best models are presented for (a) all neotropical forests, (b) forests west of the Andes (transandean) and (c) east of the Andes (cisandean), and for various subsets based on elevation and annual rainfall. For the whole dataset, and for most subsets, annual rainfall and rainfall seasonality were the most important variables for explaining species richness. Soil variables were correlated with precipitation - drier forests have more nutrient-rich soils. After the inclusion of rainfall variables, available soil nutrient concentrations contributed little to explaining or accounting for additional variation in species numbers, indicating that tropical forest species richness is surprisingly independent of soil quality. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that plants in mature tropical forests may obtain nutrients through the process of direct cycling, in which mineral nutrients are extracted from litterfall before they enter the soil. The strong relationship between community species richness and rainfall patterns has implications for biodiversity conservation, Wet forests with an ample year-round moisture supply harbour the greatest number of woody plant species and should be a focus of conservation efforts.

TI  - Allelopathy: a tool for weed management in forest restoration
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
AB  - Forest restoration uses active management to re-establish natural forest habitat after disturbance. However, competition from early successional species, often aggressively invasive exotic plant species, can inhibit tree establishment and forest regeneration. Ideally, restoration ecologists can plant native tree species that not only establish and grow rapidly, but also suppress exotic competitors. Allelopathy may be a key mechanism by which some native trees could reduce the abundance and impact of exotic species. Allelopathy is a recognized tool for weed management in agriculture and agroforestry, but few studies have considered how allelopathic interactions may aid restoration. Here we introduce the "Homeland Security" hypothesis, which posits that some na < ve exotic species may be particularly sensitive to allelochemicals produced by native species, providing a tool to reduce the growth and impacts of invasive exotic species on reforestation. This article explores how exploiting allelopathy in native species could improve restoration success and the re-establishment of natural successional dynamics. We review the evidence for allelopathy in agroforestry systems, and consider its relevance for reforestation. We then illustrate the potential for this approach with a case study of tropical forest restoration in Panama. C-4 grasses heavily invade deforested areas in the Panama Canal watershed, especially Saccharum spontaneum L. We measured the effect of leaf litter from 17 potential restoration tree species on the growth of invasive C-4 grasses. We found that leaf litter from legume trees had a greater inhibitory effect on performance of S. spontaneum than did litter from non-legume trees. However, allelopathic effects varied greatly among species within tree functional groups. Further evaluation of intra- and inter-specific interactions will help to improve our selection of restoration species.

TI  - Local institutions as mediators of the impact of markets on non-timber forest product extraction in central India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Non-timber forest product (NTFP) extraction contributes significantly to household incomes across India. This study aimed to understand the relationship between market proximity, NTFP dependence and forest condition, and assess how it is mediated by local forest institutions. Three villages with different degrees of access to markets for sale of forest products, in an area of high poverty and forest dependence in the dry tropical forest belt in central India, were examined. The village with the greatest access to the market had a greater proportion of income coming from non-forest sources, the least dependence on NTFP harvest and the most degraded forests. The strongest forest institution was found in the village closest to the market, owing largely to its access to support from the Forest Department. This emphasizes the extreme vulnerability of forest villages located distant from local markets, which are forced to depend on forests for most of their livelihood and income requirements, and left to deal with degrading forests in the absence of technical and financial support from the forest Department. There is a critical need to strengthen local institutions for sustainable forest management in such villages, and to provide them with alternate sources of income generation.

TI  - Trade-offs in linking adaptation and mitigation in the forests of the Congo Basin
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB  - Recent discussions on forests and climate change have highlighted the potential for conservation of tropical forests to contribute synergistically to both mitigation (reducing emissions of greenhouse gases) and adaptation ( increasing capacity to cope with changing climate conditions). Key mechanisms through which adaptive advantages might be gained include the potential for forest resources to support livelihoods in the context of climatic strains on agriculture and the protection that intact forest ecosystems might provide against landslides, flash floods and other hazards related to extreme weather. This paper presents findings from field research with forest communities in three areas of the Congo Basin in Central Africa, in which the adaptive role and potential of forests in these respects is critically analysed. The investigation was carried out through a combination of structured and semi-structured qualitative techniques within six villages in Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and Rwanda. The findings of the research highlight the need to understand both the limits of synergy, and the constraints and trade-offs for rural livelihoods that may be associated with a forest conservation agenda driven by the additional impetus of carbon sequestration. The search for synergy may be conceptually laudable, but if forest management actions do not take account of on-the-ground contexts of constraints and social trade-offs then the result of those actions risks undermining wider livelihood resilience.

TI  - Diverging land-use projections cause large variability in their impacts on ecosystems and related indicators for ecosystem services
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS
AB  - Land-use models and integrated assessment models provide scenarios of land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes following pathways or storylines related to different socioeconomic and environmental developments. The large diversity of available scenario projections leads to a recognizable variability in impacts on land ecosystems and the levels of services provided. We evaluated 16 projections of future LULC until 2040 that reflected different assumptions regarding socioeconomic demands and modeling protocols. By using these LULC projections in a state-of-the-art dynamic global vegetation model, we simulated their effect on selected ecosystem service indicators related to ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration potential, agricultural production and the water cycle. We found that although a common trend for agricultural expansion exists across the scenarios, where and how particular LULC changes are realized differs widely across models and scenarios. They are linked to model-specific considerations of some demands over others and their respective translation into LULC changes and also reflect the simplified or missing representation of processes related to land dynamics or other influencing factors (e.g., trade, climate change). As a result, some scenarios show questionable and possibly unrealistic features in their LULC allocations, including highly regionalized LULC changes with rates of conversion that are contrary to or exceed rates observed in the past. Across the diverging LULC projections, we identified positive global trends of net primary productivity (+10.2% +/- 1.4 %), vegetation carbon (+9.2% +/- 4.1 %), crop production (+31.2% +/- 12.2 %) and water runoff (+9.3% +/- 1.7 %), and a negative trend of soil and litter carbon stocks (-0.5% +/- 0.4 %). The variability in ecosystem service indicators across scenarios was especially high for vegetation carbon stocks and crop production. Regionally, variability was highest in tropical forest regions, especially at current forest boundaries, because of intense and strongly diverging LULC change projections in combination with high vegetation productivity dampening or amplifying the effects of climatic change. Our results emphasize that information on future changes in ecosystem functioning and the related ecosystem service indicators should be seen in light of the variability originating from diverging projections of LULC. This is necessary to allow for adequate policy support towards sustainable transformations.

TI  - Bee diversity along a forest regeneration gradient in Western Kenya
T2  - JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH
AB  - Changes in bee species richness and diversity were studied along a forest regeneration gradient in seven sites in Buyangu Nature Reserve, Kakamega Forest, Kenya. At each site, 12 belt transects of 100 m length and 2 m width were established. The selected sites ranged from relatively undisturbed primary to late secondary forests, bush lands and the surrounding farming areas. A total of 4,485 individuals were identified out of 234 species of bee in four families. A Renyi Diversity Index was used to analyse bee diversity. One-way measures of ANOVA were calculated for bee diversity and species richness, with study sites and year as independent factors. The highest species richness and bee diversity were recorded in the open areas followed by secondary forests while evenness was higher in forested sites. There was a general similarity between sites in bee species composition, especially between those of almost similar vegetation structure. This similarity was suspected to have important implications in promoting current understanding of ecological resilience of bees in tropical ecosystems. The study concludes that the future of forest biodiversity and pollination services are dependent on strategic and holistic management of natural forests, secondary forests and the neighbouring agro-ecosystems.

TI  - Effects of trees on infiltrability and preferential flow in two contrasting agroecosystems in Central America
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - We tested the hypothesis that trees have measurable effects on infiltrability, macroporosity, and preferential flows in agrosilvopastoral systems. Managing agricultural systems for water conservation is a critical component of sustainable systems. We investigated the relationship between infiltrability and the distance to the nearest tree, and whether differences in macroporosity can account for differences in infiltrability.
   In both systems, preferential soil water flows were dominant compared to matrix flow. Trees in the pasture landscape improved infiltrability and preferential flow but had no significant effect in the coffee agroforestry system. After comparing rainfall intensity and frequency data to the measured infiltrability values, we conclude that trees in the pasture system reduce surface runoff at the highest observed rainfall intensities (>50 mm h(-1)). The volcanic soils of the coffee plantation are less degraded and their high natural permeability has been maintained. Since the coffee plants at this site are established (40 years) perennial vegetation with substantial residues and extensive root systems like trees, they improve soil physical properties similarly to trees.
   Trees increase hydrologic services in pasture lands, a rapidly expanding land use type across Latin America, and therefore may be a viable land management option for mitigating some of the negative environmental impacts associated with land clearing and animal husbandry. However, in land management practices where understorey perennial vegetation makes up a large proportion of the cover, such as for coffee agroforestry systems, the effect of trees on infiltration-related ecosystem services could be less pronounced (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Evaluating variability in soil attributes and forest vegetation in a degraded dry tropical region: an ecological restoration perspective
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The land use change pattern from disturbed tropical dry forests has significant impact on vegetation and soil physico-chemical properties, leading to alterations in vegetation structure and diversity. Thus, aim of this study was to better understand how disturbances affect forest vegetation and soil physico-chemical attributes under varied land uses in the deciduous forest region of Vindhyan highlands, India. Soil samples and vegetation analyses were conducted across three distinct disturbed forest sites on three land use types using the quadrate method. The study documented 45 species in the tree layer, with 37 in least disturbed, 33 in moderate disturbed, and 28 in highly disturbed stands. Shannon, Simpson, Evenness, Margalef and beta-diversity indices exhibited pronounced variations among the three disturbed stands. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed significant difference in soil physico-chemical properties (p < 0.001, p < 0.01 and p < 0.05) due to various disturbed forest stands and land use types. Micronutrients such as zinc, copper, and nickel showed significant variation, with higher concentrations in least disturbed stands. Pearson's correlation analysis indicated strong relationships between vegetation characteristics and soil physico-chemical attributes, consistent across disturbances. Additionally, the principal component analysis indicated that the first four principal components accounted for 77.7% of the total variation in the data. The comprehensive research will add forest managers in developing long-term eco-restoration plans that will result in reduced soil loss and degradation. This study contributes to more effective forest management and conservation efforts by providing essential insights into the interactions between disturbances, vegetation, and soil properties.

TI  - Phylogenetic impoverishment of plant communities following chronic human disturbances in the Brazilian Caatinga
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Chronic disturbances, such as selective logging, firewood extraction and extensive grazing, may lead to the taxonomic and phylogenetic impoverishment of remaining old-growth forest communities worldwide; however, the empirical evidence on this topic is limited. We tested this hypothesis in the Caatinga vegetation - a seasonally dry tropical forest restricted to northeast Brazil. We sampled 11,653 individuals (adults, saplings, and seedlings) from 51 species in 29 plots distributed along a gradient of chronic disturbance. The gradient was assessed using a chronic disturbance index (CDI) based on five recognized indicators of chronic disturbances: proximity to urban center, houses and roads and the density of both people and livestock. We used linear models to test if mean effective number of lineages, mean phylogenetic distance and phylogenetic dispersion decreased with CDI and if such relationships differed among ontogenetic stages. As expected, the mean effective number of lineages and the mean phylogenetic distance were negatively related to CDI, and such diversity losses occurred irrespective of ontogeny. Yet the increase in phylogenetic clustering in more disturbed plots was only evident in seedlings and saplings, mostly because clades with more descendent taxa than expected by chance (e.g., Euphorbiaceae) thrived in more disturbed plots. This novel study indicates that chronic human disturbances are promoting the phylogenetic impoverishment of the irreplaceable woody flora of the Brazilian Caatinga forest. The highest impoverishment was observed in seedlings and saplings, indicating that if current chronic disturbances remain, they will result in increasingly poorer phylogenetically forests. This loss of evolutionary history will -potentially limit the capacity of this ecosystem to respond to human disturbances (i.e., lower ecological resilience) and particularly their ability to adapt to rapid climatic changes in the region.

TI  - Assessing landscapes: a case study of tree and shrub diversity in the seasonally dry tropical forests of Oaxaca, Mexico and southern Honduras
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Tropical dry forests, with their distinct and economically important diversity, are acknowledged conservation priorities because of alarming rates of forest conversion. Whilst it is realised that terrestrial conservation requires an understanding of landscape level patterns of diversity, forests are rarely assessed accordingly. Here we demonstrate that, in the case of the seasonally dry tropical forests of the Pacific watershed of Mesoamerica, landscape level assessment of woody diversity can inform decision making relevant to both between-landscape and within-landscape prioritisation. We report floristic surveys of dry forest landscapes in Oaxaca, Mexico and southern Honduras. It is noted that these forests are floristically similar to other seasonally dry tropical forests in the neotropics. By calculation of Genetic Heat Indices, a relative measure of the concentration of restricted range species in a sample, we determine that the conservation of the, tree diversity of the coastal lowlands of Oaxaca should be prioritised over that of southern Honduras. The current conservation status of forested areas in Oaxaca is briefly described. We suggest that the greater degree of anthropogenic disturbance in southern Honduras may explain the relative lack of restricted range species there. We argue that some forest fallows can act as analogues of mature forest and therefore landscape elements other than mature forest need to be included in forest conservation assessments. We conclude that diversity sampling of any forest type should not be limited to mature forests, but extended to other elements of forested landscapes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Integration of carbon conservation into sustainable forest management using high resolution satellite imagery: A case study in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB  - Conservation of tropical forests is of outstanding importance for mitigation of climate change effects and preserving biodiversity. In Borneo most of the forests are classified as permanent forest estates and are selectively logged using conventional logging techniques causing high damage to the forest ecosystems. Incorporation of sustainable forest management into climate change mitigation measures such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) can help to avert further forest degradation by synergizing sustainable timber production with the conservation of biodiversity. In order to evaluate the efficiency of such initiatives, monitoring methods for forest degradation and above-ground biomass in tropical forests are urgently needed. In this study we developed an index using Landsat satellite data to describe the crown cover condition of lowland mixed dipterocarp forests. We showed that this index combined with field data can be used to estimate above-ground biomass using a regression model in two permanent forest estates in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Tangkulap represented a conventionally logged forest estate while Deramakot has been managed in accordance with sustainable forestry principles. The results revealed that conventional logging techniques used in Tangkulap during 1991 and 2000 decreased the above-ground biomass by an annual amount of average -6.0 tC/ha (-5.2 to -7.0 tC/ha, 95% confidential interval) whereas the biomass in Deramakot increased by 6.1 t C/ha per year (5.3-7.2 t C/ha, 95% confidential interval) between 2000 and 2007 while under sustainable forest management. This indicates that sustainable forest management with reduced-impact logging helps to protect above-ground biomass. In absolute terms, a conservative amount of 10.5 t C/ha per year, as documented using the methodology developed in this study, can be attributed to the different management systems, which will be of interest when implementing REDD+ that rewards the enhancement of carbon stocks.

TI  - An individual-based forest model to jointly simulate carbon and tree diversity in Amazonia: description and applications
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS
AB  - Forest dynamic models predict the current and future states of ecosystems and are a nexus between physiological processes and empirical data, forest plot inventories and remote-sensing information. The problem of biodiversity representation in these models has long been an impediment to a detailed understanding of ecosystem processes. This challenge is amplified in species-rich and high-carbon tropical forests. Here we describe an individual-based and spatially explicit forest growth simulator, TROLL, that integrates recent advances in plant physiology. Processes (carbon assimilation, allocation, reproduction, and mortality) are linked to species-specific functional traits, and the model was parameterized for an Amazonian tropical rainforest. We simulated a forest regeneration experiment from bare soil, and we validated it against observations at our sites. Simulated forest regeneration compared well with observations for stem densities, gross primary productivity, aboveground biomass, and floristic composition. After 500years of regrowth, the simulated forest displayed structural characteristics similar to observations (e.g., leaf area index and trunk diameter distribution). We then assessed the model's sensitivity to a number of key model parameters: light extinction coefficient and carbon quantum yield, and to a lesser extent mortality rate, and carbon allocation, all influenced ecosystem features. To illustrate the potential of the approach, we tested whether variation in species richness and composition influenced ecosystem properties. Overall, species richness had a positive effect on ecosystem processes, but this effect was controlled by the identity of species rather by richness per se. Also, functional trait community means had a stronger effect than functional diversity on ecosystem processes. TROLL should be applicable to many tropical forests sites, and data requirement is tailored to ongoing trait collection efforts. Such a model should foster the dialogue between ecology and the vegetation modeling community, help improve the predictive power of models, and eventually better inform policy choices.

TI  - Land-Use and Land-Cover Dynamics in the Brazilian Caatinga Dry Tropical Forest
T2  - CONSERVATION
AB  - The use of remote sensing to determine land-use and land-cover (LULC) dynamics is often applied to assess the levels of natural forest conservation and monitor deforestation worldwide. This study examines the loss of native vegetation in the Campo Maior Complex (CMC), in the Brazilian Caatinga dry tropical forest, from 2016 to 2020, considering the temporal distribution of rainfall and discussing the trends and impacts of forest-degradation vectors. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform is used to obtain the rainfall data from the CHIRPS collection and to create the LULC maps. The random forest classifier is used and applied to the Landsat 8 collection. The QGIS open software and its SPC plugin are used to visualize the LULC dynamics. The results show that the months from June to October have the lowest average rainfall, and that 2019 is the year with the highest number of consecutive rainy days below 5 mm. The LULC maps show that deforestation was higher in 2018, representing 20.19%. In 2020, the proportion of deforestation was the lowest (11.95%), while regeneration was the highest (20.33%). Thus, the characterization of the rainfall regime is essential for more accurate results in LULC maps across the seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTF).

TI  - Growth, deforestation and the efficiency of the REDD mechanism
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - This paper assesses the long term impacts of an international transfer called the Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) mechanism, which aims at preserving tropical forests of the recipient economy. This two-sector economy faces a dilemma between economic growth and deforestation. The rural sector can substitute reproducible capital for agricultural land whereas the manufacturing sector only requires capital. The model shows that the REDD mechanism has a non-monotonic effect on steady state welfares. For low transfer schemes, the agricultural output increases with the transfer even though less land is under cultivation. For high transfer schemes, the increase in the transfer may not offset the decrease in the agricultural output. The open-loop symmetric Nash equilibrium in a dynamic deforestation game predicts that redistributing the transfer among a finite number of producers is less efficient in reducing deforestation than in the social optimum.

TI  - Plant distribution, ecological traits and diversity patterns of vegetation in subtropical managed forests as guidelines for forest management policy
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Forest vegetation is an important component of forest ecosystems, contributing to terrestrial plant diversity while also providing a variety of ecological services. In managed landscapes, plantations emerge as dominant kinds after stand-replacing disturbances. However, the dynamics of vegetation cover, diversity, and composition in plantation forests remains poorly understood in the subtropical region. Our study recorded a rich floral diversity with 173 angiosperm species, characterized by varying life forms and distinct flowering phenology. The uneven distribution of species across families demonstrated the complexity of the ecosystem, with Poaceae being dominant. Diversity patterns among different plantation types varied, with Dalbergia sissoo and Populus nigra plantations exhibiting higher species richness and diversity. Conversely, Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Morus alba plantations displayed lower diversity, emphasizing the influence of plantation type on biodiversity. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) and PERMANOVA analyses revealed significant dissimilarity patterns of vegetation composition. Indicator species analysis identified unique compositions within each plantation type, emphasizing the importance of conserving specific types to protect indicator species and maintained ecological distinctiveness. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) demonstrated that road accessibility, stem cutting, and fire significantly influenced plant distribution patterns. The present research underscored the importance of considering plantation type in forest management for biodiversity conservation and highlighted the environmental variables' influence on the formation of plant communities. These results provided major implications for sustainable forest management and conservation efforts in tropical regions.

TI  - Planting accelerates restoration of tropical forest but assembly mechanisms appear insensitive to initial composition
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Central to the success of restoration is how applied activities influence community assembly mechanisms. Phylogenetic and trait-based approaches to community ecology are increasingly being used to test for non-random community assembly and are now being applied to assessments of habitat restoration. A critical question for the restoration of tropical forests is how plantings influence the recruitment of new species, and specifically the phylogenetic and functional diversity of restored habitats.
   2. We examined 8 years (2006-2014) of tropical-forest recruitment in two restoration planting compositions (12 animal-dispersed and 12 wind-dispersed tree species), with a control (no planting) in 24 plots in Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. Specifically, we assessed the influence of plantings on newly arriving individuals' phylogenetic, functional, taxonomic diversity, abundance and the change of these measures during early succession.
   3. The recruiting individuals' phylogenetic, functional, taxonomic diversity and abundance increased through succession. Both animal-dispersed planting and wind-dispersed planting appeared to accelerate forest succession more than controls (natural succession), and diversity in the animal-dispersed plantings was marginally higher after 8 years. We did not find any difference in recruiting individuals' phylogenetic and functional dispersion (measured as standardized effect sizes) in any given year, or when measured as turnover between successive pairs of years, measuring planting composition and control plots.
   4. Recruiting individuals were phylogenetically clustered during early forest restoration regardless of treatment. At the same time, the recruits transitioned from appearing randomly constructed to clustering according to functional traits, which suggests an increase in recruits' functional similarity during early succession.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Both the animal and wind-dispersed plantings accelerated the increase of recruiting individuals' phylogenetic, functional, taxonomic diversity and abundance during early succession. However, planting treatment did not appear to alter community assembly mechanisms of recruiting individuals. Our findings support restoration planting by showing that planting trees with animal dispersal syndrome could accelerate forest restoration more than unassisted forest regeneration. Furthermore, communities appeared to be phylogenetically and functionally clustered during early succession regardless of initial planted composition. Thus, while overall diversity increased with planting, if a restoration goal is to maximize phylogenetic or functional dispersion, the planting composition tested did not provide means to achieve this goal, at least during early succession.

TI  - The effectiveness of lidar remote sensing for monitoring forest cover attributes and landscape restoration
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Ambitious pledges to restore over 400 million hectares of degraded lands by 2030 have been made by several countries within the Global Partnership for Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR). Monitoring restoration outcomes at this scale requires cost-effective methods to quantify not only forest cover, but also forest structure and the diversity of useful species. Here we obtain and analyze structural attributes of forest canopies undergoing restoration in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil using a portable ground lidar remote sensing device as a proxy for airbome laser scanners. We assess the ability of these attributes to distinguish forest cover types, to estimate aboveground dry woody biomass (AGB) and to estimate tree species diversity (Shannon index and richness). A set of six canopy structure attributes were able to classify five cover types with an overall accuracy of 75%, increasing to 87% when combining two secondary forest classes. Canopy height and the unprecedented "leaf area height volume" (a cumulative product of canopy height and vegetation density) were good predictors of AGB. An index based on the height and evenness of the leaf area density profile was weakly related to the Shannon Index of tree species diversity and showed no relationship to species richness or to change in species composition. These findings illustrate the potential and limitations of lidar remote sensing for monitoring compliance of FLR goals of landscape multifunctionality, beyond a simple assessment of forest cover gain and loss.

TI  - Understanding and Integrating Local Perceptions of Trees and Forests into Incentives for Sustainable Landscape Management
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - We examine five forested landscapes in Africa (Cameroon, Madagascar, and Tanzania) and Asia (Indonesia and Laos) at different stages of landscape change. In all five areas, forest cover (outside of protected areas) continues to decrease despite local people's recognition of the importance of forest products and services. After forest conversion, agroforestry systems and fallows provide multiple functions and valued products, and retain significant biodiversity. But there are indications that such land use is transitory, with gradual simplification and loss of complex agroforests and fallows as land use becomes increasingly individualistic and profit driven. In Indonesia and Tanzania, farmers favor monocultures (rubber and oil palm, and sugarcane, respectively) for their high financial returns, with these systems replacing existing complex agroforests. In the study sites in Madagascar and Laos, investments in agroforests and new crops remain rare, despite government attempts to eradicate swidden systems and their multifunctional fallows. We discuss approaches to assessing local values related to landscape cover and associated goods and services. We highlight discrepancies between individual and collective responses in characterizing land use tendencies, and discuss the effects of accessibility on land management. We conclude that a combination of social, economic, and spatially explicit assessment methods is necessary to inform land use planning. Furthermore, any efforts to modify current trends will require clear incentives, such as through carbon finance. We speculate on the nature of such incentive schemes and the possibility of rewarding the provision of ecosystem services at a landscape scale and in a socially equitable manner.

TI  - Assessment and prediction of carbon sequestration using Markov chain and InVEST model in Sariska Tiger Reserve, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Enhancing and conserving carbon pools in vegetation is a major climate change mitigation strategy. The dynamics of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems depend on processes like photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition and combustion, anthropogenic activities like emission of greenhouse gases and climatic variations in rainfall and temperature, and is stored as biomass in different forms. The quantification of biomass is necessary to understand the productivity of forests, carbon sink and source dynamics and recommend ways to aid sequestration through supply side interventions like afforestation and demand side measures that check wood consumption. In this study, carbon sequestration based on the change in total carbon in two different scenarios using Markov chain and InVEST model is evaluated for the years 2000, 2018 and predicted for 2035. The results show that 1.351 Tg carbon has already been lost from 2000 to 2018 in the forest area of Sariska Tiger Reserve and another 0.107 Tg of carbon is expected to be lost in the predicted future, when we compare the land use land cover of the year 2035 with the present scenario. The local communities extract fuel-wood by cutting down tree branches illegally, which leads to carbon loss into the atmosphere. The lower release of carbon in 2035 as compared to 2018 is because of forest management practices e.g., plantations done in the range Tehla-Talabberi, Sariska-Ganeshpura, Alwar buffer-Shoydanpura, Talvriksh-Manavaas, Akbarpur-Kalikhol, Ajabgarh-Jatwana. The study shows that the economic value of carbon lost from 2000 to 2018 is million $ 214.57 and if we see the economic value of the predicted year 2035, carbon sequestration is worth million $ 17.19. Outputs demonstrate the potential for restoration/reforestation and afforestation as the most practical carbon loss mitigation strategy and calls for improved access to cleaner energy sources where the renewable energy industry and government may pitch in.

TI  - Old-growth forest loss and secondary forest recovery across Amazonian countries
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - There is growing recognition of the potential of large-scale forest restoration in the Amazon as a 'nature-based solution' to climate change. However, our knowledge of forest loss and recovery beyond Brazil is limited, and carbon emissions and accumulation have not been estimated for the whole biome. Combining a 33 year land cover dataset with estimates of above-ground biomass and carbon sequestration rates, we evaluate forest loss and recovery across nine Amazonian countries and at a local scale. We also estimate the role of secondary forests in offsetting old-growth deforestation emissions and explore the temporal trends in forest loss and recovery. We find secondary forests across the biome to have offset just 9.7% of carbon emissions from old-growth deforestation, despite occupying 28.8% of deforested land. However, these numbers varied between countries ranging from 9.0% in Brazil to 23.8% in Guyana for carbon offsetting, and 24.8% in Brazil to 56.9% in Ecuador for forest area recovery. We reveal a strong, negative spatial relationship between old-growth forest loss and recovery by secondary forests, showing that regions with the greatest potential for large-scale restoration are also those that currently have the lowest recovery (e.g. Brazil dominates deforestation and emissions but has the lowest recovery). In addition, a temporal analysis of the regions that were >80% deforested in 1997 shows a continued decline in overall forest cover. Our findings identify three important challenges: (a) incentivising large-scale restoration in highly deforested regions, (b) protecting secondary forests without disadvantaging landowners who depend on farm-fallow systems, and (c) preventing further deforestation. Combatting all these successfully is essential to ensuring that the Amazon biome achieves its potential in mitigating anthropogenic climate change.

TI  - Agricultural land-use change in Kerala, India: Perspectives from above and below the canopy
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Despite the availability of a wide range of tools, measuring and explaining changes in land cover and land use in tropical regions can be extremely challenging. Kerala, India, is a biodiversity hotspot with a high population density and a long history of complex agricultural land-use patterns. Some reports suggest that agriculture in Kerala, which historically is rice paddy-wetland and agroforestry-based, is on the decline. However, the evidence is often anecdotal, especially with regards to smallholding homegarden agriculture. In this study we employ mixed methods, including remote sensing, quantitative household surveys, and semi-structured interviews, to unravel the complex land-cover and land-use changes occurring in Kerala.
   Results indicate that, from a land-cover change perspective, agroforests are in dynamic equilibrium with other land covers, being cleared for roads and new buildings, but offset by the expansion of younger, less diverse agroforests into paddy wetlands. Yet beneath the canopy, agroforests are undergoing rapid land-use change not discernible using remote sensing. These changes include a reported decrease in the cultivation of 80% of Kerala's primary crop species during 2003-2013, alongside a dramatic decline in chickens (from 12.5 to 2.6 per homestead on average) and cows (from 1.7 to 0.8). Over this period, no crop increased in cultivation. According to farmers, the primary drivers of this shift were declining profitability of agriculture in Kerala, labour shortages, unreliable weather, unfamiliar pests and diseases, and government policy.
   Despite the undeniable move away from agricultural activity in homegardens, we conclude that these ecologically and culturally important systems are not disappearing, but rather evolving to meet the needs of a less agricultural Kerala. Our research highlights the value of using mixed methods for characterizing land-use and land-cover histories in tropical regions.

TI  - Monitoring recovery of tree diversity during tropical forest restoration: lessons from long-term trajectories of natural regeneration
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Given the importance of species diversity as a tool for assessing recovery during forest regeneration and active restoration, robust approaches for assessing changes in tree species diversity over time are urgently needed. We assessed changes in tree species diversity during natural regeneration over 12-20 years in eight 1-ha monitoring plots in NE Costa Rica, six second-growth forests and two old-growth reference forests. We used diversity profiles to show successional trajectories in measures of observed, asymptotic and standardized tree diversity and evenness as well as sample completeness. We randomly subsampled 1-ha plot data to evaluate how well smaller spatial subsamples would have captured temporal trajectories. Annual surveys in eight 1-ha plots were missing substantial numbers of rare or infrequent species. Older second-growth sites showed consistent declines in tree diversity, whereas younger sites showed fluctuating patterns or increases. Subsample areas of 0.5 ha or greater were sufficient to infer the diversity of abundant species, but smaller subsamples failed to capture temporal trajectories of species richness and yielded positively biased estimates of evenness. In tropical forest regions with high levels of diversity, species diversity from small sample plots should be assessed using methods that incorporate abundance information and that standardize for sample coverage.This article is part of the theme issue 'Understanding forest landscape restoration: reinforcing scientific foundations for the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration'.

TI  - Carbon allocation in a Costa Rican dry forest derived from tree ring analysis
T2  - DENDROCHRONOLOGIA
AB  - The rising discussion on carbon balance of tropical forests often does not consider the sequestration. potential of secondary dry forests, which are becoming an increasing importance due to land use change and reforestation. We have developed an easy applicable tool for the estimation of biomass increment of tropical secondary forest stands on the base of tree ring analysis. The existence of annual rings was shown by a combination of anatomical examination and radiocarbon estimations. With tree ring analysis, forest inventories and destructive sampling the above-ground biomass increment of secondary forest stands of age between 9 and 48 years in the dry forest region of Guanacaste, Costa Rica were estimated. The above-ground biomass increment of the tree layer varies between 2.4 and 3.2 Mg/ha yr in different stands. Lianas contribute with up to 23% additional production. Differences in productivity among the stands along a chronosequence were not significant. The measured carbon allocation potential of 1.7-2.1 Mg C/ha yr lies in the range of reported values from other tropical dry forests and old growth humid forests as well.

TI  - Effects of Landscape Configuration on the Body Condition of Migratory and Resident Tropical Birds
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
AB  - Landscape structure and configuration may affect bird body condition, with contrasting effects on resident and migratory species. There is little empirical evidence to support this hypothesis in tropical regions, where land-use change poses a major threat to biodiversity. We aimed to assess the effects of landscape structure and configuration on the body condition of neotropical migrant and resident bird species. We compiled body condition data (using the scaled mass index) of nine bird species (five resident and four migratory). We characterized landscape structure and configuration at 26 localities. We evaluated the effects of landscape metrics on bird body condition using Bayesian linear mixed models. The landscapes in our study largely varied in forest, crop, and grassland cover, as well as in landscape metrics. When we examined migrant birds, we found a positive effect of landscape connectivity and crop cover on body condition. Similarly, body condition of resident birds was positively affected by connectivity and crop cover, but also by forest patch area and capture day. Changes in landscape structure and configuration may indirectly alter the access to resources, causing additional energy expenditures, leading to a deteriorated body condition. Conversely, landscape heterogeneity may have a positive effect on bird body condition. Therefore, we recommend maintaining connectivity and complementary resources in the landscape.

TI  - Tree diversity, composition, forest structure and aboveground biomass dynamics after single and repeated fire in a Bornean rain forest
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Forest fires remain a devastating phenomenon in the tropics that not only affect forest structure and biodiversity, but also contribute significantly to atmospheric CO2. Fire used to be extremely rare in tropical forests, leaving ample time for forests to regenerate to pre-fire conditions. In recent decades, however, tropical forest fires occur more frequently and at larger spatial scales than they used to. We studied forest structure, tree species diversity, tree species composition, and aboveground biomass during the first 7 years since fire in unburned, once burned and twice burned forest of eastern Borneo to determine the rate of recovery of these forests. We paid special attention to changes in the tree species composition during burned forest regeneration because we expect the long-term recovery of aboveground biomass and ecosystem functions in burned forests to largely depend on the successful regeneration of the pre-fire, heavy-wood, species composition. We found that forest structure (canopy openness, leaf area index, herb cover, and stem density) is strongly affected by fire but shows quick recovery. However, species composition shows no or limited recovery and aboveground biomass, which is greatly reduced by fire, continues to be low or decline up to 7 years after fire. Consequently, large amounts of the C released to the atmosphere by fire will not be recaptured by the burned forest ecosystem in the near future. We also observed that repeated fire, with an inter-fire interval of 15 years, does not necessarily lead to a huge deterioration in the regeneration potential of tropical forest. We conclude that burned forests are valuable and should be conserved and that long-term monitoring programs in secondary forests are necessary to determine their recovery rates, especially in relation to aboveground biomass accumulation.

TI  - Riparian vegetation and water yield: A synthesis
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB  - Forested riparian zones perform numerous ecosystem functions, including the following: storing and fixing carbon; serving as wildlife habitats and ecological corridors; stabilizing streambanks; providing shade, organic matter, and food for streams and their biota; retaining sediments and filtering chemicals applied on cultivated/agricultural sites on upslope regions of the catchments. In this paper, we report a synthesis of a different feature of this type of vegetation, which is its effect on water yield. By synthesizing results from studies that used (i) the nested catchment and (ii) the paired catchment approaches, we show that riparian forests decrease water yield on a daily to annual basis. In terms of the treated area increases on average were 1.32 +/- 0.85 mm day(-1) and 483 +/- 309 mm yr(-1), respectively; n = 9. Similarly, riparian forest plantation or regeneration promoted reduced water yield (on average 1.25 +/- 0.34 mm day(-1) and 456 +/- 125 mm yr(-1) on daily and annual basis, respectively, when prorated to the catchment area subjected to treatment; n = 5). Although there are substantially fewer paired catchment studies assessing the effect of this vegetation type compared to classical paired catchment studies that manipulate the entire vegetation of small catchments, our results indicate the same trend. Despite the occurrence of many current restoration programs, measurements of the effect on water yield under natural forest restoration conditions are still lacking. We hope that presenting these gaps will encourage the scientific community to enhance the number of observations in these situations as well as produce more data from tropical regions.

TI  - Factors explaining variability in woody above-ground biomass accumulation in restored tropical forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Secondary forests comprise an increasing area of the tropics and play an important role in global carbon cycling. We compare above-ground biomass accumulation of both planted and naturally regenerating trees, as well as C in the top soil layer, in three restoration treatments replicated at 14, six to eight year old restoration sites in southern Costa Rica. Restoration strategies include: control (no planting), planting tree islands, and conventional, mixed-species tree plantations. We evaluate the importance of past land-use, soil nutrients, understory cover, and surrounding forest cover in explaining variation in above-ground biomass accumulation (ABA) rate across sites. Total ABA and planted tree ABA rate were highest in plantations, intermediate in islands, and lowest in control treatments, whereas ABA rate of naturally regenerating trees did not differ across treatments. Most ABA in plantations (89%) and islands (70%) was due to growth of planted trees. Soil carbon did not change significantly over the time period of the study in any treatment. The majority of across-site variation in both total and planted tree ABA rate was explained by duration of prior pasture use. Tree growth in the first two years after planting explained approximately two-thirds of the variation in ABA rate after 6-8 years. Soil nutrient concentrations explained relatively little of the variation in planted or naturally recruiting ABA rate. Our results show that planting trees substantially increases biomass accumulation during the first several years of forest recovery in former agricultural lands and that past-land use has a strong effect on the rate of biomass accumulation. Planting tree islands is a cost-effective strategy for increasing ABA and creating more heterogeneous habitat conditions than tree plantations. We recommend small scale planting trials to quickly assess potential biomass accumulation and prioritize sites for ecosystem service payments for carbon sequestration. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Mapping selective logging impacts in Borneo with GPS and airborne lidar
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Reduced-impact logging (RIL) is a promising management strategy for biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration, but incentive mechanisms are hindered by inadequate monitoring methods. We mapped 937 ha of logging infrastructure in a selectively harvested tropical forest to inform a scalable approach to measuring the impacts of discrete management practices (hauling, skidding, and felling). We used a lidar-derived disturbance model to map all skid trails and haul roads within 26 months of the selective harvest of six blocks of dipterocarp forest in five industrial concessions in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Lidar maps of logging impacts (220 ha) agreed well with ground-based maps (total of 217 ha, RMS error of 6 ha or 3%), but skid trail positions agreed only 59% of the time. Due to rapid forest regeneration, total lidar-derived haul road area was 31% smaller than road area measured in the field; agreement was higher for lidar collections within a year of the harvest. Maps of carbon density generated from Fourier transforms of lidar height profiles estimated skidding and felling biomass losses to within 1-5% of ground-based measurements. Lidar-derived skidding and hauling impact zones covered only 69% of the permitted harvest area; the remaining areas showed no signs of logging disturbance, and available biophysical data did not explain their location. These results emphasize the need for more extensive mapping of logging infrastructure to capture spatial variability in skid trail density and hitherto undetected no-impact zones. While a ground-based GPS is recommended as the most affordable method for wide-scale infrastructure mapping, aerial lidar is an effective tool for remotely quantifying the extent of logging impacts in tropical forests.

TI  - Monitoring canopy bird activity in disturbed landscapes with automatic recorders: A case study in the tropics
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Tropical forests are facing threats that may affect the dynamics of seed dispersers which participate in the forest regeneration. To implement appropriate conservation programs, it appears necessary to monitor seed dispersers and to estimate their response to local changes. Here, we used non-invasive ecoacoustic methods to monitor the activity of a canopy bird, the White-throated toucan, Ramphastos tucanus, a major seed disperser and flagship species of the Amazonian forest. We deployed nine acoustic recorders over 29 days along a road that connects French Guiana to Brazil. We used template matching to automatically detect the vocalizations of R. tucanus. This method, which can easily be repeated with limited human expertise, detected 1748 recordings with R. tucanus vocalizations. A GLMM analysis was applied to test for a possible effect of habitat type and human activity, while accounting for time of the day and rainfall. The number of vocalizations varied according to time of the day with peaks at dawn and dusk. The number of vocalizations did not differ significantly among sites, they were not affected by habitat type, and they were only marginally influenced by human activity. These results indicate that the vocal activity of a key conservation species can be monitored automatically in a non-invasive way. The species targeted, R. tucanus, does not seem to be significantly impacted by the road and local human activity. This might be related to the mobility of the species, which can easily cross the road, as well as low local forestry pressure.

TI  - Macrofauna and soil properties in agroforestry system and secondary forest
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
AB  - Atlantic Forest devastation has resulted in the search and introduction of management capable of promoting and reestablishing the quality and sustainability of the ecosystem. Agroforestry systems (AS) are recognized for many benefits due to their management. This study compares an agroforestry system macrofauna and physical and chemical soil properties to those of a secondary forest area in the Atlantic Forest biome in southeast Brazil. Agroforestry system with 8 years of establishment and the regenerating subcaducifolious tropical forest fragment with 28 years were examined. Samplings were conducted in two periods of the year (rainy and dry seasons) to evaluate physical and chemical soil fertility-associated properties, as well as soil organic matter (SOM) fractions and biological aspects (macrofauna). Higher clay content, moisture levels, basic cations, and greater values of the sorption complex, diversity indices, and uniformity in macrofauna were observed in the agroforestry plots. Agroforestry systems increased the levels of the most labile fraction of soil organic matter (SOM) compared to the forest fragment. Higher abundance, diversity indices, and evenness of fauna were observed in the agroforestry plots during both seasons. In terms of multivariate analyses, a higher correlation was observed among fauna, carbon fractions, P, K+, pH, clay, potential acidity, moisture, and temperature in the Agroforestry plots. In general, AS promoted a positive relationship between physical and chemical properties and the macrofauna community of soil invertebrates, in a similar way and sometimes superior to the forest, confirming the study hypothesis and demonstrating the efficiency of management in maintaining soil properties and, consequently, ecosystem services.

TI  - Sustainable Agroforestry Landscape Management: Changing the Game
T2  - LAND
AB  - Location-specific forms of agroforestry management can reduce problems in the forest-water-people nexus, by balancing upstream and downstream interests, but social and ecological finetuning is needed. New ways of achieving shared understanding of the underlying ecological and social-ecological relations is needed to adapt and contextualize generic solutions. Addressing these challenges between thirteen cases of tropical agroforestry scenario development across three continents requires exploration of generic aspects of issues, knowledge and participative approaches. Participative projects with local stakeholders increasingly use 'serious gaming'. Although helpful, serious games so far (1) appear to be ad hoc, case dependent, with poorly defined extrapolation domains, (2) require heavy research investment, (3) have untested cultural limitations and (4) lack clarity on where and how they can be used in policy making. We classify the main forest-water-people nexus issues and the types of land-use solutions that shape local discourses and that are to be brought to life in the games. Four 'prototype' games will be further used to test hypotheses about the four problems identified constraining game use. The resulting generic forest-water-people games will be the outcome of the project "Scenario evaluation for sustainable agroforestry management through forest-water-people games" (SESAM), for which this article provides a preview.

TI  - Forest Landscape Restoration and Local Stakeholders: A Global Bibliometric Mapping Analysis
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Forest landscape restoration (FLR) has a central place in current global debates about the sustainability of natural resources, climate change mitigation and adaptation, livelihoods and biodiversity conservation. FLR approaches support the involvement of different social actors in participatory decision-making processes. We conducted a bibliometric analysis research to provide an overview of scientific publications in forest restoration, FLR and local stakeholders (LS) studies, and, specifically, examine if the studies (1) recognised the relevance of the local level actors and (2) collected primary and/or secondary data on LS using different methods from related publications since 2000. We used the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus as bibliographic sources. We analysed five main research aspects: (1) publication year, (2) most productive countries according to the total number of publications, (3) most influential journals and cited papers, (4) most influential authors ranked by number of publications, their respective organisations and country collaborations, and (5) a co-occurrence analysis of countries' collaborations and keywords. We found that forest restoration, FLR and LS studies have been growing over the years, especially in the last decade. However, only 50% (99 records) of the studies recognised the relevance of the local level actors and also collected primary and/or secondary data through different methods. Authors from organisations in North and South America, and Oceania were the ones with the most publications, with only 20% (4 authors) of the top 20 authors having degrees in social sciences. Studies about "ecosystem services", "ecological restoration", "natural regeneration", "livelihoods", "Bonn challenge" and "governance" have become the main subject of research along the years within the scope of FLR at the local level. Finally, the results showed the gaps that should be considered in future research to improve the involvement and more direct participation of LS, as well as the participation of interdisciplinary and social science researchers in FLR research teams.

TI  - Seed dispersal limitations shift over time in tropical forest restoration
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Past studies have shown that tropical forest regeneration on degraded farmlands is initially limited by lack of seed dispersal, but few studies have tracked changes in abundance and composition of seed rain past the first few years after land abandonment. We measured seed rain for 12 months in 10 6-9-year-old restoration sites and five mature, reference forests in southern Costa Rica in order to learn (1) if seed rain limitation persists past the first few years of regeneration; (2) how restoration treatments influence seed community structure and composition; and (3) whether seed rain limitation is contingent on landscape context. Each restoration site contained three 0.25-ha treatment plots: (1) a naturally regenerating control, (2) tree islands, and (3) a mixed-species tree plantation. Sites spanned a deforestation gradient with 9-89% forest area within 500 m around the treatment plots. Contrary to previous studies, we found that tree seeds were abundant and ubiquitous across all treatment plots (585.1 +/- 142.0 seeds.m(-2).yr(-1) [mean +/- SE]), indicating that lack of seed rain ceased to limit forest regeneration within the first decade of recovery. Pioneer trees and shrubs comprised the vast majority of seeds, but compositional differences between restoration sites and reference forests were driven by rarer, large-seeded species. Large, animal-dispersed tree seeds were more abundant in tree islands (4.6 +/- 2.9 seeds.m(-2).yr(-1)) and plantations (5.8 +/- 3.0 seeds.m(-2).yr(-1)) than control plots (0.2 +/- 0.1 seeds.m(-2).yr(-1)), contributing to greater tree species richness in actively restored plots. Planted tree species accounted for <1% of seeds. We found little evidence for landscape forest cover effects on seed rain, consistent with previous studies. We conclude that seed rain limitation shifted from an initial, complete lack of tree seeds to a specific limitation on large-seeded, mature forest species over the first decade. Although total seed abundance was equal among restoration treatments, tree plantations and tree islands continued to diversify seed rain communities compared to naturally regenerating controls. Compositional differences between regenerating plots and mature forests suggest that large-seeded tree species are appropriate candidates for enrichment planting.

TI  - Agroforestry Practices Promote Biodiversity and Natural Resource Diversity in Atlantic Nicaragua
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Tropical forest conversion to pasture, which drives greenhouse gas emissions, soil degradation, and biodiversity loss, remains a pressing socio-ecological challenge. This problem has spurred increased interest in the potential of small-scale agroforestry systems to couple sustainable agriculture with biodiversity conservation, particularly in rapidly developing areas of the tropics. In addition to providing natural resources (i.e. food, medicine, lumber), agroforestry systems have the potential to maintain higher levels of biodiversity and greater biomass than lower diversity crop or pasture systems. Greater plant diversity may also enhance soil quality, further supporting agricultural productivity in nutrient-limited tropical systems. Yet, the nature of these relationships remains equivocal. To better understand how different land use strategies impact ecosystem services, we characterized the relationships between plant diversity (including species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and natural resource diversity), and soil quality within pasture, agroforests, and secondary forests, three common land use types maintained by small-scale farmers in the Pearl Lagoon Basin, Nicaragua. The area is undergoing accelerated globalization following the 2007 completion of the region's first major road; a change which is expected to increase forest conversion for agriculture. However, farmer agrobiodiversity maintenance in the Basin was previously found to be positively correlated with affiliation to local agricultural NGOs through the maintenance of agroforestry systems, despite these farmers residing in the communities closest to the new road, highlighting the potential for maintaining diverse agroforestry agricultural strategies despite heightened globalization pressures. We found that agroforestry sites tended to have higher surface soil % C, % N, and pH relative to neighboring to secondary forest, while maintaining comparable plant diversity. In contrast, pasture reduced species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and natural resource diversity. No significant relationships were found between plant diversity and the soil properties assessed; however higher species richness and phylodiversity was positively correlated with natural resource diversity. These finding suggest that small, diversified agroforestry systems may be a viable strategy for promoting both social and ecological functions in eastern Nicaragua and other rapidly developing areas of the tropics.

TI  - Enhanced mitigation of N2O and NO emissions through co-application of biochar with nitrapyrin in an intensive tropical vegetable field
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Vegetable fields in tropical regions characterized by intensive cultivation have the potential to be significant sources of gaseous nitrogen (N) emissions. This is primarily due to human-induced input of N fertilizer and the naturally abundant water and heat resources in these areas. While biochar and nitrification inhibitors are recognized as effective measures for mitigating soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions, there is limited research on their combined effectiveness in intensively managed tropical croplands. In a 2-year field experiment conducted in a tropical vegetable ecosystem, we investigated the impact of single and combined applications of peanut biochar and nitrapyrin (a nitrification inhibitor) on N2O and NO emissions, N-cycling associated gene abundances, and bacterial community structure. Under conventional fertilization, cumulative N2O and NO emissions were 1.96 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 1.76 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), with emission factors of N fertilizer for N2O (EFN2O) and NO (EFNO) at 0.29% and 0.30%, respectively. The random forest model indicated that soil organic carbon (SOC) was key in regulating N2O+NO emissions. Biochar alone decreased cumulative N2O and NO emissions by 6.1 % and 13.0 %, respectively. When biochar was co-applied with nitrapyrin, the mitigation of N2O and NO reached up to 23.4 % and 18.6 %, respectively. This enhanced effect was attributed to the strong inhibitory impact of nitrapyrin on nitrifiers (AOA and AOB) and denitrifiers (nirK/S) in biochar-amended soils. Additionally, biochar co-application increased SOC levels in nitrapyrin-applied soils. Analysis of bacterial community structure revealed that nitrapyrin decreased the relative abundance of Nitrospirae, while biochar increased the relative abundance of Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes and Nitrospirae to varying extents. Considering the carbon sequestration ability of biochar and the effective mitigation potential of nitrapyrin, the combined application of biochar with a nitrification inhibitor emerges as a promising strategy for dual objectives - reducing gaseous N emissions and enhancing soil carbon storage - in intensive vegetable ecosystems in the tropical region of China.

TI  - Benefits of tropical forest management under the new climate change agreement-a case study in Cambodia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB  - Promoting sustainable forest management as part of the reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation in developing countries (REDD)-plus mechanism in the Copenhagen Accord of December 2009 implies that tropical forests will no longer be ignored in the new climate change agreement. As new financial incentives are pledged, costs and revenues on a 1-ha tract of tropical forestland being managed or cleared for other land use options need to be assessed so that appropriate compensation measures can be proposed. Cambodia's highly stocked evergreen forest, which has experienced rapid degradation and deforestation, will be the first priority forest to be managed if financial incentives through a carbon payment scheme are available. By analyzing forest inventory data, we assessed the revenues and costs for managing a hypothetical 1 ha of forestland against six land use options: business-as-usual timber harvesting (BAU-timber), forest management under the REDD-plus mechanism, forest-to-teak plantation, forest-to-acacia plantation, forest-to-rubber plantation, and forest-to-oil palm plantation. We determined annual equivalent values for each option, and the BAU-timber and REDD-plus management options were the highest, with both options influenced by logging costs and timber price. Financial incentives should be provided at a level that would allow continuation of sustainable logging and be attractive to REDD-plus project developers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Phytosociological attributes of high-elevation agroforestry systems in the Western Ghat regions of Kerala, India
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - The diversity of tree species within agroforestry systems (AFS) plays a critical role in enhancing ecosystem services while fostering resilience and adaptability to environmental changes. Though plant diversity in the forests of Western Ghats is widely studied, research on the compositional and phytosociological characteristics of agroforestry systems remains underexplored. This study aims to assess the diversity and distribution of tree species in AFS to guide conservation strategies and sustainable management practices in Kerala's Western Ghats. A total of 116 quadrates were established randomly and the species richness, stand density, diversity, dominance and other phytosociological attributes were measured. The study recorded 119 tree species with an average stand density of 1099 trees per hectare. The Shannon diversity index indicated relatively high species diversity (3.26), while the Simpson index suggested low dominance (0.08) across the study area. Pielou's evenness index indicated moderate evenness in species distribution (0.68). Among different types of AFS, coffee-based systems exhibited the highest species richness, followed by cardamom, homegarden, rubber, and tea. Dominant tree species varied across different systems with Artocarpus heterophyllus, Grevillea robusta, Hevea brasiliensis, Mangifera indica and Erythrina variegata being the top species in the AFS in general. This study highlights the importance of conserving and managing the diverse AFS in the highland regions of the Western Ghats, a previously underrepresented area in biodiversity assessments, by demonstrating that variations in species composition underscore the unique characteristics of each system, with phytosociological studies playing a crucial role in conservation planning.

TI  - Phytoplankton species predictability increases towards warmer regions
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
AB  - We explored systematic patterns in predictability of phytoplankton species from 83 lakes over a gradient ranging from subpolar to tropical regions in South America. We estimated the explained variance (proxy of predictability) of the presence and biomass (estimated as biovolume) of species using multiple regressions from commonly measured environmental variables such as nutrient levels, light, mixing depth, temperature, and zooplankton biomass. Both the presence and biomass of species occurring at least in 10 lakes were quite well predicted from the environmental variables, with average values of 35% and 58%, respectively. Predictability was not systematically related to phylogenetic affiliation or particular functional groups as defined by morphology. However, biomass predictability decreased with increasing occurrence, and improved with larger species size (maximum linear dimension). Species that were predictable in terms of biomass (R-2 >= 0.5, p <= 0.05) had, on average, a larger volume, and were relatively more frequent in lakes from warmer regions, with high water temperature, low chlorophyll a, low nutrient concentrations, and low total zooplankton biomass. Although we cannot diagnose the mechanisms involved, our finding that the number of predictable species increases towards warmer regions resembles situations where competition for nutrients and grazing are likely to be less severe, and may imply that in a future warmer world phytoplankton will be easier to predict.

TI  - Biodiversity conservation in the sacred groves of north-west Ethiopia: diversity and community structure of woody species
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Forest fragmentation is globally pervasive but especially severe in tropical forests, as exemplified by the state of Afrotropical montane forests in Ethiopia, where remnant forests almost exclusively exists as small, isolated fragments centered around churches, forming networks of partially intact 'habitat islands.' Church forests deliver ecosystem services such as forest products and erosion control, and are considered a benchmark for assessing forest biodiversity quality. However, safeguarding church forest integrity necessitates a better understanding of the factors determining their biodiversity and community structure. Therefore, we surveyed a network of church forests southeast of Lake Tana to assess factors explaining their tree species richness and composition. We found that the 24 church forests studied here represent about 20% of the ca. 270 tree species that occur in tropical northeast Africa. All surveyed forests however face strong extinction debts, with five tree species at risk of completely disappearing from the region and many more species only regenerating in a limited number of church forests. Church forest integrity partially reflected the anthropogenic pressure on the area, as forest regeneration tended to be stronger in fenced church forests. Seedling abundance depended on the local presence of large, mature conspecific trees and on the geographic distance to potential source populations of seeds, strongly suggest that metapopulation dynamics likely are important. We conclude that church forest conservation and minimizing further degradation of the landscape matrix are needed to help sustaining the ecological and socioeconomic potential of this unique network of remnant forests.

TI  - Designing effective and equitable zero-deforestation supply chain policies
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - In response to the clearing of tropical forests for agricultural expansion, agri-food companies have adopted promises to eliminate deforestation from their supply chains in the form of 'zero-deforestation commitments' (ZDCs). While there is growing evidence about the environmental effectiveness of these commitments (i.e., whether they meet their conservation goals), there is little information on how they influence producers' opportunity to access sustainable markets and related livelihood outcomes, or how design and implementation choices influence tradeoffs or potential synergies between effectiveness and equity in access. This paper explores these research gaps and makes three main contributions by: i) defining and justifying the importance of analyzing access equity and its relation to effectiveness when implementing forest-focused supply chain policies such as ZDCs, ii) identifying seven policy design principles that are likely to maximize synergies between effectiveness and access equity, and iii) assessing effectiveness-access equity tensions and synergies across common ZDC implementation mechanisms amongst the five largest firms in each of the leading agricultural forest-risk commodity sectors: palm oil, soybeans, beef cattle, and cocoa. To enhance forest conservation while avoiding harm to the most vulnerable farmers in the tropics, it is necessary to combine stringent rules with widespread capacity building, greater involvement of affected actors in the co-production of implementation mechanisms, and support for alternative rural development paths.

TI  - Increased anthropogenic disturbance and aridity reduce phylogenetic and functional diversity of ant communities in Caatinga dry forest
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Anthropogenic disturbance and climate change are major threats to biodiversity. The Brazilian Caatinga is the world's largest and most diverse type of seasonally dry tropical forest. It is also one of the most threatened, but remains poorly studied. Here, we analyzed the individual and combined effects of anthropogenic disturbance (three types: livestock grazing, wood extraction, and miscellaneous use of forest resources) and increasing aridity on taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional ant diversity in the Caatinga. We found no aridity and disturbance effects on taxonomic diversity. In spite of this, functional diversity, and to a lesser extent phylogenetic diversity, decreased with increased levels of disturbance and aridity. These effects depended on disturbance type: livestock grazing and miscellaneous resource use, but not wood extraction, deterministically filtered both components of diversity. Interestingly, disturbance and aridity interacted to shape biodiversity responses. While aridity sometimes intensified the negative effects of disturbance, the greatest declines in biodiversity were in the wettest areas. Our results imply that anthropogenic disturbance and aridity interact in complex ways to endanger biodiversity in seasonally dry tropical forests. Given global climate change, neotropical semi-arid areas are habitats of concern, and our findings suggest Caatinga conservation policies must prioritize protection of the wettest areas, where biodiversity loss stands to be the greatest. Given the major ecological relevance of ants, declines in both ant phylogenetic and functional diversity might have downstream effects on ecosystem processes, insect populations, and plant populations.

TI  - Establishment of tree seedlings in the understory of restoration plantations: natural regeneration and enrichment plantings
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Little is known about the potential of restoration plantations to provide appropriate understory conditions to support the establishment of seeds arriving from neighboring native forests. In this article, we investigated how seedling establishment is affected in the understory of restoration sites of different ages and assessed some of the potential environmental factors controlling this ecological process. We first compared the density and richness of native tree seedlings among 10-, 22-, and 55-year-old restoration plantations within the Atlantic Forest region of southeastern Brazil. Then, we undertook a seed addition experiment in each study site, during the wet season, and compared seedling emergence, survival, and biomass on local versus old-growth forest soil (transferred from a reference ecosystem), in order to test whether local substrate could hamper seedling establishment. As expected, the oldest restoration site had higher density and richness of spontaneously regenerating seedlings. However, seedling establishment was less successful both in the oldest restoration planting and using substrate transferred from a reference ecosystem, where emergence and survival were lower, but surviving seedlings grew better. We attribute these results to lower light availability for seedlings in the understory of the oldest site and speculate that higher incidence of pathogens on old-growth forest soil may have increased seedling mortality. We conclude that the understory of young restoration plantations provides suitable microsite conditions at the early establishment phases for the spontaneous regeneration or enrichment planting of native trees.

TI  - Evaluation of reclamation success in an open-pit coal mine using integrated soil physical, chemical and biological quality indicators
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - The evaluation and success of ecological reclamation can be assessed by measuring soil physical, chemical and biological variables, either in isolation or combined into composite indicators. In this study we tested the suitability of biological, chemical and physical quality indicators-and their combination in a General Indicator of Soil Quality (GISQ)-to monitor soil quality in restored areas of an open cast coal mine. These composite indicators were computed with principal component analyses (PCA) and co-inertia multivariate analyses (CoIA). Our biological indicator showed a significant recovery of soil invertebrate communities along the chronosequence. Taxonomic richness increased from 7 taxa the 1st year to 13-17 taxa in 6-20-y sites, far less than in forests (19-20). Soil pH, bulk density and proportion of physical and macro aggregates were highest in the 1-y site, while soil organic matter (SOM), total N and proportion of biogenic aggregates were highest in older sites. In general, the three sub-indicators and the GISQ yielded the lowest values in the 1-y site (from 0.1 to 0.3 on a scale of 0.1 to 1.0), intermediate in the 16- and 20-y sites, (0.4-0.7) and reached highest values in the two forests (0.4-1.0). The GISQ methodology proved efficient in assessing progress in the reclamation process which should not be achieved only by monitoring vegetation cover changes.

TI  - Diversity and Phylogeny of Novel Cord-Forming Fungi from Borneo
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - Cord-forming (CF) fungi are found worldwide; however, tropical CF fungi are poorly documented. They play an essential role in forest ecosystems by interconnecting nutrient resources and aiding in the decomposition of plant matter and woody litter. CF fungi samples were collected from two forest conservation sites in the Sabah region of Malaysian Borneo. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the ribosomal rRNA gene array 18S to 28S region from cords collected placed all of the collected specimens in Agaricomycetes (Basidiomycetes), specifically within the orders Trechisporales, Phallales, Hymenochaetales, Polyporales, and Agaricales. Comparison of the cord-derived sequences against GenBank and UNITE sequence databases, as well as phylogenetic analyses, revealed they were all novel sequences types. Many of these novel lineages were found to be closely related to other basidiomycetes commonly found in tropical forests, suggesting a large undiscovered tropical fungal diversity in Borneo that has been detected independently of sampling fruiting bodies. We show how these sequence types relate to the morphologies of the cords from which they were sampled. We also highlight how rapid, small-scale sampling can be a useful tool as an easy and relatively unbiased way of collecting data on cord-forming fungi in difficult-to-access, complex forest environments, independently of locating and sampling sporophores.

TI  - Plant diversity and dry-matter dynamics of peri-urban plant communities in an Indian dry tropical region
T2  - ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - The emergence of variety of land-use changes due to continuous anthropogenic pressure in peri-urban areas may concomitantly result in modification of the structure of associated plant communities for their sustainable growth. In the present study, plant diversity, and above- and belowground biomass distribution among species were investigated to understand their dynamics across different season, soil, and site conditions in a dry tropical peri-urban region in India. From four study sites that covered contrasting land uses: abandoned brick kiln (ABK), grazing land (GL), Kali river bank (KRB), and agricultural land (AL), a total of 360 monoliths were randomly extracted in three seasons, and dry weights were estimated for aboveground and belowground parts of species individuals. Seasonal soil samples of the sites were analyzed for physico-chemical characteristics. Of the total 87 recorded species that were mainly annual weeds and ruderals, 77% were forbs and 23% grasses. The ranges of plant biomass recorded across all sites and seasons were: aboveground 228-738 g m(-2), belowground 83-288 g m(-2), and a total of 344-1,026 g m(-2). The dominance of species differed between above- and belowground; some species dominated only above- or belowground, and others dominated in both layers. Above- and belowground biomass of the sites, differential community-biomass allocation to above- and belowground parts and species dominants varied significantly with site and season. ABK and AL sites showed lower species diversity and soil nutrients compared to GL and KRB sites. Belowground biomass significantly declined with increasing soil organic C and total N, indicating altered dry matter allocation under resource-scarce habitat conditions. Higher diversity occurred at both low- and high-biomass sites, reflective of enhanced ability of these plant communities to exploit resources maximally in spatio-temporal pattern.

TI  - Long-term effect of selective logging on floristic composition: A 25 year experiment in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Selective logging is one of the most prominent land uses in tropical forests and although it involves harvesting a limited number of trees, the impact on forest structure, composition and aboveground biomass can be significant. Although these impacts are well documented, what is little known is the extent to which selective logging affects tree floristic composition and its recovery process. Understanding how floristic composition is affected by logging activities is essential for determining subsequent cutting cycles, for the maintenance of carbon stocks and for biodiversity conservation. This research investigates the effect of logging on long-term trends on the recovery of species composition in a tropical forest using a unique logging experiment where measurements have been taken annually over a period of 25 years. Changes in 12 long-term 1-hectare (ha) permanent plots were assessed where different selective logging intensities occurred. In the first years after logging, floristic composition differed widely between intact and selectively logged forests, with exploited areas deviating from pre-logged composition. Over time, exploited areas shifted towards the original composition, with more pronounced changes in this trend after similar to 13 years. Shifts in floristic composition were caused mainly by a significant increase in light-demanding fast-growing pioneer species and their subsequent continuous high mortality rates after 13 years of the recovery process. In contrast, the control plots showed similar shifts in composition over time, suggesting external factors such as long-term climate changes may be driving these shifts. The results suggest that 25 years after an experimental selective logging has taken place, floristic composition tends to recover closer to the pre-logged status. Thus, in the absence of further human disturbances, experimental selectively logged forests in low to moderate intensities are compatible with biodiversity conservation, at least during the first cycle of exploitation. Reconciling conservation strategies with the recovery of stocks of commercial timber species would be greatly improved by using these results and lead towards more sustainable forest management plans.

TI  - Novel growth models for three Brazilian native timber species and their applications for timber production and carbon stock assessment
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Sustainable native timber production and the carbon market can be a crucial strategy for scaling up tropical forest restoration. In this context, this study developed both growth models and growth-climate models for Cariniana legalis, Dalbergia nigra, and Zeyheria tuberculosa to predict tree diameter and total height, analyzed growth patterns among species, and estimated their commercial rotation age for timber production. We collected data from 14 tree plantations distributed throughout the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, with a total of 5564 trees sampled. The plantations span a broad climatic gradient, with ages ranging from 1 to 50 years. Dalbergia nigra showed the highest growth rate (1.33 cm/year) and a first harvest age of 22 years, indicating its suitability for furniture and construction wood production. Cariniana legalis showed a slightly lower growth rate (1.16 cm/year) and required 31 years to reach first harvest, with wood ideal for construction and furniture. In contrast, Z. tuberculosa had the lowest diameter increment (0.90 cm/year) and did not reach the diameter at the breast level threshold, making it more suitable for non-premium uses such as utensils and pallets. Through the growth-climate models, we found that climatic water deficit and minimum temperature were the most influential variables explaining tree growth across bioclimatic regions, with higher temperatures and limited water availability significantly constraining species productivity. The developed models can greatly contribute to predicting timber production potential and carbon stock assessment, which can contribute to scaling up restoration efforts and facilitating forest management planning.

TI  - The first report of composition and occurrence of myxomycete assemblages in protected and unprotected plantation forests: a comparative study in Thai Nguyen City, Northern Vietnam
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Background and aims - In spite of the cosmopolitan distributions of myxomycetes, relatively few studies have been conducted in subtropical forests of Southeast Asia particularly in Northern Vietnam, where comprehensive reports of myxomycetes are lacking up to this date. Hence. a rapid biodiversity assessment was conducted in protected and unprotected plantation forests of Thai Nguyen City to compare the species composition of myxomycete communities between the two different forest management types.
   Methods - A total of 360 substrate samples were haphazardly collected within 5 m x 5 m plots established within three protected and three unprotected forests. The moist chamber cultures prepared from these samples were regularly checked for myxomycete fructifications over a period of 12 weeks. Analyses of diversity (species richness) and community composition were performed using the software EstimateS and the vegan package in R.
   Key results - The study yielded a total of 505 records representing 54 species belonging to 17 genera. All species recorded herein were new records for Northern Vietnam:, among them five were new for the entire country. The rarefaction curves showed higher numbers of myxomycete species to be expected for protected forest (43.0) in comparison to unprotected forests (39.4). However, calculations of species diversity indices showed higher values in unprotected forest than in protected forest. The species composition between the two forest types showed clear overlaps with many shared (56%) species.
   Conclusions - Forest conservation strategies do not affect freely dispersing myxomycetes implicating that spore dispersal of myxomycetes is caused not only by natural factors but also by anthropogenic activities. The production of high number of myxomycete species for this study seems to point out that the subtropical forests of Vietnam harbours many undiscovered myxomycete species for Southeast Asia.

TI  - Local tropical forest restoration strategies affect tree recruitment more strongly than does landscape forest cover
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Developing restoration strategies that accelerate natural successional processes and are resource-efficient is critical to facilitating tropical forest recovery across millions of hectares of deforested lands in the tropics. We compared tree recruitment after a decade in three restoration treatments (natural regeneration, applied nucleation/island tree planting and plantation) and nearby reference forest in the premontane rain forest zone in southern Costa Rica. The study was replicated at 13 sites with a range of surrounding forest cover, enabling us to evaluate the relative influence of local restoration treatments and landscape forest cover on tree recruitment. Density of small-seeded (<5mm), animal-dispersed recruits was lower in natural regeneration than in applied nucleation, plantation or reference forest plots. Species richness, species density and density of medium (5-10mm)- and large (>10mm)-seeded, animal-dispersed recruits were greatest in reference forest, intermediate in applied nucleation and plantation and lowest in natural regeneration plots. Recruit composition differed substantially between reference forest and all restoration treatments. In general, plantation recruit composition was more similar to reference forests and natural regeneration least similar; however, there was high within-treatment variation. Models suggested weak support for the effect of surrounding forest cover on tropical tree recruit density and composition, as compared to restoration treatment and site conditions (e.g. elevation), in this intermediate forest cover landscape.Synthesis and applications. Applied nucleation appears to be a cost-effective strategy as compared to plantation-style planting to accelerate tropical forest recovery regardless of the amount of forest cover immediately adjacent to the site. However, even with active restoration interventions, forest recovery is a multidecade process that proceeds at highly variable rates.

TI  - Habitat structure and food resources for wildlife across successional stages in a tropical forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Tropical forests are experiencing an increase in the proportion of secondary forests as a result of the balance between the widespread harvesting of old-growth forests and the regeneration in abandoned areas. The impacts of such a process on biodiversity are poorly known and intensely debated. Recent reviews and multi-taxa studies indicate that species replacement in wildlife assemblages is a consistent pattern, sometimes stronger than changes in diversity, with a replacement from habitat generalists to old-growth specialists being commonly observed during tropical forest regeneration. However, the ecological drivers of such compositional changes are rarely investigated, despite its importance in assessing the conservation value of secondary forests, and to support and guide management techniques for restoration. By sampling 28 sites in a continuous Atlantic forest area in Southeastern Brazil, we assessed how important aspects of habitat structure and food resources for wildlife change across successional stages, and point out hypotheses on the implications of these changes for wildlife recovery. Old-growth areas presented a more complex structure at ground level (deeper leaf litter, and higher woody debris volume) and higher fruit availability from an understorey palm, whereas vegetation connectivity, ground-dwelling arthropod biomass, and total fruit availability were higher in earlier successional stages. From these results we hypothetize that generalist species adapted to fast population growth in resource-rich environments should proliferate and dominate earlier successional stages, while species with higher competitive ability in resource-limited environments, or those that depend on resources such as palm fruits, on higher complexity at the ground level, or on open space for flying, should dominate older-growth forests. Since the identification of the drivers of wildlife recovery is crucial for restoration strategies, it is important that future work test and further develop the proposed hypotheses. We also found structural and functional differences between old-growth forests and secondary forests with more than 80 years of regeneration, suggesting that restoration strategies may be crucial to recover structural and functional aspects expected to be important for wildlife in much altered ecosystems, such as the Brazilian Atlantic forest.

TI  - The CO2 dependence of photosynthesis, plant growth responses to elevated CO2 concentrations and their interaction with soil nutrient status, II.: Temperate and boreal forest productivity and the combined effects of increasing CO2 concentrations and increased nitrogen deposition at a global scale
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Appropriate rates of carbon acquisition by temperate and boreal forests are re-evaluatted, Based on continental-scale forestry data it is suggested that the productivity of temperate and boreal forests has been overestimated previously.
   2, Using these values, a model of the integrated response of ecosystems to carbon dioxide concentration and soil nitrogen availability is presented. The model does not assume constant C/N ratios in plant or soil and considers effects of increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and nitrogen deposition separately or together.
   3, For temperate-zone forests a co-occurrence of a CO2 increase and nitrogen deposition doubles the increase in net primary productivity and carbon sequestration that would be the case for nitrogen deposition occurring on its own. Considered separately, the effect of the atmospheric CO2 increase is less than even moderate rates of anthropogenic N deposition for temperate or boreal forests. By contrast, for tropical forests, the atmospheric CO2 increase is sufficient to induce large rates of carbon accumulation in plants and soil.
   4, Application of the model at the global scale suggests large localized sinks for CO2 in either tropical rain forests or in forested or grassland areas of Europe and North America where appreciable N deposition occurs. Overall, the model suggests a terrestrial sink owing to CO2 fertilization and N deposition of about 0.2 Pmol C per year. About half of this is in the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere and about half in the tropics.

TI  - Assessing Forest Cover Dynamics and Forest Perception in the Atlantic Forest of Paraguay, Combining Remote Sensing and Household Level Data
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - The Upper Parana Atlantic Forest (BAAPA) in Paraguay is one of the most threatened tropical forests in the world. The rapid growth of deforestation has resulted in the loss of 91% of its original cover. Numerous efforts have been made to halt deforestation activities, however farmers' perception towards the forest and its benefits has not been considered either in studies conducted so far or by policy makers. This research provides the first multi-temporal analysis of the dynamics of the forest within the BAAPA region on the one hand, and assesses the way farmers perceive the forest and how this influences forest conservation at the farm level on the other. Remote sensing data acquired from Landsat images from 1999 to 2016 were used to measure the extent of the forest cover and deforestation rates over 17 years. Farmers' influence on the dynamics of the forest was evaluated by combining earth observation data and household survey results conducted in the BAAPA region in 2016. Outcomes obtained in this study demonstrate a total loss in forest cover of 7500 km(2). Deforestation rates in protected areas were determined by management regimes. The combination of household level and remote sensing data demonstrated that forest dynamics at the farm level is influenced by farm type, the level of dependency/use of forest benefits and the level of education of forest owners. An understanding of the social value awarded to the forest is a relevant contribution towards preserving natural resources.

TI  - Trema micrantha (L.) Blume. IN PLANTATIONS FOR ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION: EARLY DEVELOPMENT IN THE BRAZILIAN SUBTROPICAL FOREST
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
AB  - The understanding of silviculture of native species in a determined region is fundamental for the selection of more appropriate species for using in ecological restoration. Trema micrantha (Cannabaceae), a pioneer species which is widely distributed, shading and attractive to birds, is intensively planted in restoration projects of the southeastern Brazilian Atlantic Forest. In order to get information regarding to the performance of this species in subtropical forests (subject to the yearly frosts), we analyzed its early growth in a planting carried out with 70 native tree species in 3 x 2 m spacing in four plots of 40 x 54 m. Semiannually, we collected data of 72 individuals of Trema micrantha. These data were statistically analyzed using the Statistical Software Assistat-beta submitted to Tukey test (p<0.05) and graphically described by R. Trema micrantha showed excellent performance at 3.5 years of age in root collar diameter (12.01 +/- 5.24 cm), total height (5.95 +/- 1.44 m), crown projection area (22.56 +/- 11.26 m(2)) and crown volume (61.34 +/- 37.46 m(3)), enduring severe frosts with a yearly survival rate of 78%. Based on the results obtained, and considering that this species has broad natural distribution, we recommend its extensive use also in forestry restoration projects in the subtropical regions of Brazil.

TI  - Toward an integrated monitoring framework to assess the effects of tropical forest degradation and recovery on carbon stocks and biodiversity
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Tropical forests harbor a significant portion of global biodiversity and are a critical component of the climate system. Reducing deforestation and forest degradation contributes to global climate-change mitigation efforts, yet emissions and removals from forest dynamics are still poorly quantified. We reviewed the main challenges to estimate changes in carbon stocks and biodiversity due to degradation and recovery of tropical forests, focusing on three main areas: (1) the combination of field surveys and remote sensing; (2) evaluation of biodiversity and carbon values under a unified strategy; and (3) research efforts needed to understand and quantify forest degradation and recovery. The improvement of models and estimates of changes of forest carbon can foster process-oriented monitoring of forest dynamics, including different variables and using spatially explicit algorithms that account for regional and local differences, such as variation in climate, soil, nutrient content, topography, biodiversity, disturbance history, recovery pathways, and socioeconomic factors. Generating the data for these models requires affordable large-scale remote-sensing tools associated with a robust network of field plots that can generate spatially explicit information on a range of variables through time. By combining ecosystem models, multiscale remote sensing, and networks of field plots, we will be able to evaluate forest degradation and recovery and their interactions with biodiversity and carbon cycling. Improving monitoring strategies will allow a better understanding of the role of forest dynamics in climate-change mitigation, adaptation, and carbon cycle feedbacks, thereby reducing uncertainties in models of the key processes in the carbon cycle, including their impacts on biodiversity, which are fundamental to support forest governance policies, such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation.

TI  - Shaping pollinator diversity through coffee agroforestry management: A meta-analytical approach
T2  - INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY
AB  - Pollinator diversity plays an important role in improving the resilience of pollination services. However, agricultural intensification is causing declines in pollinator diversity. Such losses could be mitigated and even reversed by agroforestry systems, whose structural complexity exceeds that of intensive agricultural systems. Research, primarily conducted in tropical regions, suggests that efficiently managing agroforestry systems can increase pollinator diversity. We performed a global meta-analysis to explore how coffee agroforestry management practices affect the diversity of bee pollinators. We employed 137 sets of results from 20 studies that had been conducted at widely distributed locations across four of the seven continents. More specifically, we investigated the impact of augmenting floral resources (60 sets of results) and shade-tree cover (43 sets of results) and reducing the distance to natural forests (34 sets of results). Additionally, we examined key moderating factors, including climatic conditions, pollinator sociality, the metrics used to describe pollinator diversity, pollinator sampling methods, the metrics used to characterise the effects of management practices and floral resource type. We observed that bee pollinator diversity broadly increased as local floral resources increased in tropical coffee agroforestry systems. Shade-tree cover and proximity to natural forests did not broadly influence bee pollinator diversity. However, the strength and direction of the relationships between the agroforestry management practices and bee pollinator diversity were moderated by different factors, mainly climatic conditions and pollinator sociality. Our findings underscore the importance of managing coffee agroforestry systems to maximise bee diversity, which is crucial for coffee plant pollination. The broader objective should be to ensure the availability of resources that promote pollinator fitness, effective pollination and, as a consequence, crop yields.
   Through a global meta-analysis, we explored how coffee agroforestry management practices (i.e., local floral resources, shade-tree cover and distance to natural forests) affect the diversity of bee pollinators. Additionally, we analysed key moderating factors: climate, pollinator sociality, diversity metrics, sampling methods, metrics to characterise management practices and floral resource types. In tropical coffee agroforests, bee pollinator diversity increased with the rise in local floral resources. Shade-tree cover and forest proximity had limited influence, moderated by various factors, primarily climatic conditions. image

TI  - A Natural Forest of Commercial Timber Species: Logging or Not Logging
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
AB  - Most tropical forests outside protected areas have been or will be selectively logged because the timber industry is a main income-generating resource for many developing countries. Therefore, understanding the composition of commercial timber species and logging types is key for sustainable forest management in countries like Vietnam as they move toward fulfilling Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) agreements. Seven 1-ha plots were surveyed in the Central Highland of Vietnam, and 18 commercial tree species from these plots, whose timber is widely used by local people for housing and furniture making and timber is easily sold at local markets for high prices, were analyzed. In total, 151 tree species with a diameter at breast height (DBH) of 10cm were recorded. The 18 commercially valuable species assessed in this study accounted for 33.2% of all stems (total of 524 stems ha(-1) for all species), 47.1% of basal area (total of 34.35m(2)ha(-1) for all species), and 50.8% of aboveground biomass/AGB (total of 262.68Mgha(-1) for all species). Practicing diameter-limit harvesting of all commercially valuable species with DBH of 40cm, which is widely performed in Vietnam, will reduce the number of stems by 7%, basal area by 31.6%, and AGB by 38.2%. Because such harvesting practices cause severe ecological impacts on the remaining forest, logged forests may require >40years to recover the structure status of a pre-logged forest. In addition, the recovery of the 18 commercially valuable species may require a much longer time because they comprised 33.2% of stems. Permission for logging natural forests should be given in Vietnam to sustain lives of local communities, where logging has been prohibited. However, alternative harvesting systems, such as reduced-impact logging systems, should be considered. The systems selected must simultaneously generate economic returns for local people and respect the REDD+ agreements with regard to protecting biodiversity and reducing carbon emissions.

TI  - A global evaluation of the effectiveness of voluntary REDD plus projects at reducing deforestation and degradation in the moist tropics
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) projects aim to contribute to climate change mitigation by protecting and enhancing carbon stocks in tropical forests, but there have been no systematic global evaluations of their impact. We used a new data set for tropical humid forests and a standardized evaluation approach (based on pixel matching) to quantify the performance of a representative sample of 40 voluntary REDD+ projects in 9 countries certified under the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS). In the first 5 years of implementation, deforestation within project areas was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 24-68) compared with matched counterfactual pixels, and degradation rates were 58% lower (95% CI: 49-63). Reductions were small in absolute terms but greater in sites located in high-deforestation settings and did not appear to be substantially undermined by leakage activities in forested areas within 10 km of project boundaries. At the 26th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the international community renewed its commitment to tackling tropical deforestation as a nature-based solution to climate change. Our results indicate that incentivizing forest conservation through voluntary site-based projects can slow tropical deforestation and highlight the particular importance of prioritizing financing for areas at greater risk of deforestation.

TI  - Habitat disturbance trumps moonlight effects on the activity of tropical insectivorous bats
T2  - ANIMAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Changes in moonlight intensity can affect predation risk and induce changes in habitat use and activity of nocturnal species. However, the effect of moonlight on animal activity is rarely evaluated in human-modified landscapes and can be of vital importance to understand possible changes in ecosystem services provided by light-sensitive taxa, such as insectivorous bats. Fragmentation changes forest structure and affects light penetration across the landscape. In this case, the effects of fragmentation on bat activity can be modulated by cyclical variations of moonlight intensity. We acoustically quantified the activity of nine aerial insectivorous bat species in relation to moonlight at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, Central Amazonia. We aimed to understand species-level variation in activity across habitats (continuous forest, fragments and secondary forest) at different temporal scales: lunar cycle, dark vs. bright nights and within nights. Amazonian aerial insectivorous bats responded more to habitat type than to moonlight, with two and six species showing reduced activity in fragments and secondary forest, respectively, compared to continuous forest. The lower activity in secondary forest suggests that despite c. 30 years of secondary forest regeneration, it is still less attractive as foraging habitat. An interactive effect of habitat type and moonlight on bat activity was most evident when contrasting dark and bright nights. Our results indicate that fragments have reduced bat activity on extremely bright nights, probably due to higher predation risk in small fragments. Species that emit constant-frequency calls (Pteronotus spp.) were the ones that most modulated their responses to habitat disturbance and moonlight. Otherwise, moonlight had little effect on hourly activity levels, irrespective of habitat type. Moonlight is capable of modulating the responses of some bat species in disturbed habitats, particularly in fragments.

TI  - Testing heterogeneity-diversity relationships in tropical forest restoration
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Restoring small-scale habitat heterogeneity in highly diverse systems, like tropical forests, is a conservation challenge and offers an excellent opportunity to test factors affecting community assembly. We investigated whether (1) the applied nucleation restoration strategy (planting tree islands) resulted in higher habitat heterogeneity than more homogeneous forest restoration approaches, (2) increased heterogeneity resulted in more diverse tree recruitment, and (3) the mean or coefficient of variation of habitat variables best explained tree recruitment. We measured soil nutrients, overstory and understory vegetation structure, and tree recruitment at six sites with three 5- to 7-year-old restoration treatments: control (no planting), planted tree islands, and conventional, mixed-species tree plantations. Canopy openness and soil base saturation were more variable in island treatments than in controls and plantations, whereas most soil nutrients had similar coefficients of variation across treatments, and bare ground was more variable in control plots. Seedling and sapling species density were equivalent in plantations and islands, and were substantially higher than in controls. Species spatial turnover, diversity, and richness were similar in island and plantation treatments. Mean canopy openness, rather than heterogeneity, explained the largest proportion of variance in species density. Our results show that, whereas canopy openness and soil base saturation are more heterogeneous with the applied nucleation restoration strategy, this pattern does not translate into greater tree diversity. The lack of a heterogeneity-diversity relationship is likely due to the fact that recruits respond more strongly to mean resource gradients than variability at this early stage in succession, and that seed dispersal limitation likely reduces the available species pool. Results show that planting tree islands facilitates tree recruitment to a similar degree as intensive plantation-style restoration strategies.

TI  - Effects of secondary forest succession on the richness and composition of frog species in humid tropical forest
T2  - STUDIES ON NEOTROPICAL FAUNA AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Our aim was to evaluate whether the richness and composition of anurans responded to the time of forest regeneration via secondary succession. We sampled the anuran community in a mosaic of areas at three different stages of secondary succession in the Atlantic Forest, southern Brazil. The anurans were collected from nine lentic ponds and from their margins up to a 50 m radius. The late secondary forest sheltered the higher species richness, followed by the primary forest. The spatial variation in species richness was related to the forest succession stage and predominance of arboreal vegetation on the pond edge. The species composition changed throughout the succession stages, regardless of the distance among areas. Along the gradient of forest succession, environmental changes have driven species distribution, limiting the occurrence of forest species and favoring the colonization of areas at the early succession stage by opportunist species. We could observe that the secondary forest succession was a determining factor in the anuran community structure, and with the advancement of the secondary succession, both richness and composition were partly restored. Thus, the conservation of secondary forests might be an efficient strategy to preserve the biodiversity in areas of the Atlantic Forest.

TI  - Genetic diversity and structure of the tree Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Fabaceae) associated with remnants of a seasonally dry tropical forest
T2  - FLORA
AB  - Fragmentation of tropical forests is one of the major threats to biodiversity and viable natural populations. Brazilian seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTF) are endangered because of human occupation, conversion of lands to agriculture and high deforestation rates in these fertile soils. Enterolobium contortisiliquum has been removed from SDTF natural areas due to the advance of cattle grazing and agriculture in Brazilian SDTFs. To aid conservation efforts of this species we used molecular markers to study the genetic diversity and population structure of E. contortisiliquum in Brazilian SDTF remnants. A total of 263 individuals in 13 forest patches were analyzed with 103 ISSR fragments. In spite of being found scattered among the SDTF patches, E. contortisiliquum populations exhibited high genetic diversity (mean Shannon's index of diversity = 0.384; mean genetic diversity = 0.280) and genetic divergence between populations was detected (Phi(ST) =0.155, p < 0.0001). UPGMA dendrogram, principal coordinate analysis and Bayesian analysis showed that E. contortisiliquum populations were clustered into three groups that were not related to geographic distance (r = 0.119, p = 0.197). However, these populations are spatially structured into groups distributed in the West, Central and East of the study area. This genetic structure may be related with landscape and both the Espinhaco Range and Sao Francisco River may act as a partial geographic barrier limiting the gene flow. Because the highest rates of genetic diversity were found outside of conservation units, we propose the creation of protected areas in different geographic regions that include E. contortisiliquum populations from different genetic clusters.

TI  - Temporal variations in burn severity among various vegetation layers in subtropical Pinus Roxburghii (Chir Pine) forest of Hindu Kush mountain range
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
AB  - The Sub-tropical forests of Pinus roxburghii (chir pine) provide various ecosystem services and act as watershed for low lying regions. However, this species is prone to human induced fire primarily due to local communities' dependence for various resources exacerbated by the current dry conditions. The impact of fire across various vegetation layers and developmental stages has not been thoroughly studied. Bearing to this, the present study was conducted using composite burn index to assess the severity on various layers of vegetation and their longterm impact through a chronological approach. The impact of fire on 40 representative circular plots with a radius of 30 m, categorized into five forest strata: large and intermediate trees, seedlings/saplings, pole stage, shrubs, and soil were investigated and compared across four different time interval: unburnt (B0), burnt two years ago (B2), burnt five years ago (B5), and burnt 15 years ago (B15). The results were statistically proved using Kruskal-Wallis followed by Dunn's Post Hoc and Friedman test with the Holm correction in R Language. The study revealed significant variations in the average burn severity for each treatment, with shrubs having the highest average score of burn severity (average = 1.4) and soil showing the lowest (average = 0.408). The results of the Friedman test indicated non-uniform distribution of burn severity across different ecological treatments. This study is contributing significant insights into the effects of forest fires and their severity on different vegetation layers, which can be instrumental in devising and executing successful restoration strategies.

TI  - Prioritizing forestation based on biogeochemical and local biogeophysical impacts
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
AB  - Reforestation and afforestation is expected to achieve a quarter of all emission reduction pledged under the Paris Agreement. Trees store carbon in biomass and soil but also alter the surface energy balance, warming or cooling the local climate. Mitigation scenarios and policies often neglect these biogeophysical (BGP) effects. Here we combine observational BGP datasets with carbon uptake or emission data to assess the end-of-century mitigation potential of forestation. Forestation and conservation of tropical forests achieve the highest climate benefit at 732.12 tCO(2)e ha(-1). Higher-latitude forests warm the local winter climate, affecting 73.7% of temperate forests. Almost a third (29.8%) of forests above 56 degrees N induce net winter warming if only their biomass is considered. Including soil carbon reduces the net warming area to 6.8% but comes with high uncertainty (2.9-42.0%). Our findings emphasize the necessity to conserve and re-establish tropical forests and consider BGP effects in policy scenarios.
   Forests take up carbon from the atmosphere but also change Earth's surface energy balance through biophysical effects. Accounting for these shows that tropical forests have the highest mitigation potential; the climate benefit of higher-latitude forests is offset by their warming effects in winter.

TI  - Birds in the matrix: the role of agriculture in avian conservation in the Taita Hills, Kenya
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Agricultural conversion of tropical forests is a major driver of biodiversity loss. Slowing rates of deforestation is a conservation priority, but it is also useful to consider how species diversity is retained across the agricultural matrix. Here, we assess how bird diversity varies in relation to land use in the Taita Hills, Kenya. We used point counts to survey birds along a land-use gradient that included primary forest, secondary vegetation, agroforest, timber plantation and cropland. We found that the agricultural matrix supports an abundant and diverse bird community with high levels of species turnover, but that forest specialists are confined predominantly to primary forest, with the matrix dominated by forest visitors. Ordination analyses showed that representation of forest specialists decreases with distance from primary forest. With the exception of forest generalists, bird abundance and diversity are lowest in timber plantations. Contrary to expectation, we found feeding guilds at similar abundances in all land-use types. We conclude that whilst the agricultural matrix, and agroforest in particular, makes a strong contribution to observed bird diversity at the landscape scale, intact primary forest is essential for maintaining this diversity, especially amongst species of conservation concern.

TI  - What fate for swidden agriculture under land constraint in tropical forests? Lessons from a long-term study in an Amazonian peasant community
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - What happens when swidden cultivation systems in tropical forests become land-constrained? In this paper we report the findings of a long-term, interdisciplinary project on swidden farming, swidden farming households, and the forest landscape in a Peruvian Amazonian peasant community that has faced growing land scarcity over the past 35 years. Data were gathered at the household and plot level in 1994/95 and 2007 on land use, land cover, demographics, income and assets. By employing 'retrospective field history assessment', we reconstructed the historical land portfolios and demographic profiles of households since inception, enabling us to track changes in cropping and fallowing as well as land cover change and household composition through time. These data were combined with aerial photograph and satellite imagery interpretation to independently assess change in forest cover and type. We find that farmers confronted growing land scarcity through outmigration, diversification of land holdings, increased use of fallow products and of orchards as both an income source and as fallows, and agricultural innovation through the use of biochar on charcoal kiln sites and home gardens. The forest surrounding the community has become younger over time and more heterogeneous in age but more homogeneous in biodiversity. The paper concludes with five general lessons: (1) forest peasants are highly resilient to land scarcity; (2) forests play an overlooked role in agricultural intensification; (3) the 'modal' forest farmer does not exist; (4) early land endowment is key to understanding farmer land use and poverty dynamics; and, (5) swidden forests are social landscapes.

TI  - Recovery in soil carbon stock but reduction in carbon stabilization after 56-year forest restoration in degraded tropical lands
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Afforestation is considered as an effective method for alleviating the rising of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration through the accumulation and long-term storage of carbon (C) in the vegetation and soil. However, it is still unknown whether soil C accumulation in the restored forests could eventually recover to the equivalent level of the undisturbed forests and much less is known about how afforestation will affect C stabilization. Here we conducted a field study in degraded tropical forests of south China. The aim was to evaluate the recovery of soil C stock following afforestation by comparing different C fractions in soils (0-10 cm and 10-20 cm) in two reforested forests [a restored secondary forest (RSF) and a managed Eucalyptus plantation (MEP)] to those in a bare land (BL) and a nearby undisturbed forest (UF). Results showed that after 56-year afforestation at the bare lands, C stocks in both soil layers were significantly increased with an increase greater in the RSF than the MEP, while C recalcitrant indices (RI) were reduced. Soil C stock in the RSF recovered to a similar level to the UF, but soil RI in the RSF was still lower than the UF particularly in the 10-20 cm layer. The calculated capacity of soil C sequestration with the product of soil C stock and its RI followed the order of UF > RSF > MEP > BL. Our results demonstrate that afforestation on degraded tropical lands could recover soil C stock within a few decades, but C stabilization would be reduced.

TI  - Genetic Diversity and Differentiation in Plathymenia reticulata Benth.: A Comparative Study of Forest and Cocoa Agroforest Systems in the Atlantic Forest Domain
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
AB  - Tropical forests, housing about two-thirds of Earth's terrestrial biodiversity, face significant deforestation and fragmentation, leading to the loss of over half their area. Conservation and restoration efforts are crucial, especially for regions like the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, which suffers with a reduction in biomass and species diversity. The Brazilian agroforest system, typical from the region of Southern Bahia called "cabruca", are helping to mitigate these effects by combining cocoa cultivation with forest management, enhancing both socio-economic and environmental benefits. In a study focusing on Plathymenia reticulata, a tree species native to the Atlantic Forest, we evaluated the effectiveness of the cabruca agroforest system versus the natural forest for maintaining genetic diversity and landscape connectivity. Results showed that cabruca systems, while managed, exhibit a level of genetic diversity compared to natural forests. However, forest populations remain critical for their genetic reservoirs and adaptability. The cabrucas agroforest system also showed higher inbreeding levels, emphasizing the need for effective management to reduce inbreeding risks.

TI  - Sampling tree diversity in Malaysian tropical forests: an evaluation of a pre-felling inventory
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Integration of conservation into sustainable forest management plans requires the accurate assessment of pre-harvesting biodiversity. An open question is how to efficiently and accurately sample biodiversity in production forests. Here we investigate one possible answer: the use of existing pre-felling inventories designed for the estimation of timber stocking. Using data drawn from two large permanent forest sample plots in Malaysia, we tested the ability of the Malaysian SPOS pre-felling inventory (PreF) to accurately assess alpha (alpha)- and beta (beta)-tree diversity. We found that the Pre-F did not accurately estimate variation in alpha-diversity at small spatial-scales, but could be used to accurately extrapolate alpha-diversity on larger spatial scales. The Pre-F also adequately assessed P-diversity in heterogeneous environments, but did not perform as well in homogeneous environments. The use of tree species codes as opposed to Latin nomenclature affected estimates of beta- but not a-diversity. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of different land use patterns on seasonal termite species diversity within the Vhembe district of the Limpopo province, South Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
AB  - This study evaluated the effects of three different land use types: mango orchards, maize fields and communal grazing lands on termite species distribution in the Vhembe District, Limpopo Province, South Africa. The main objective was to identify the termite species found in the area and investigate the effect of land use on termite species. Termites were collected from six study sites using a standardized transect sampling protocol and baiting methods in a transect of 2 x 100 m during the dry and wet seasons. A total of 18 termite species from 2 families (Termitidae and Rhinotermitidae), 5 subfamilies (Macrotermitinae, Amitermitinae, Apicotermitinae, Nasutitermitinae and Cubitermitinae) and 11 genera (Allodontotermes, Ancistrotermes, Macrotermes, Microtermes, Odontotermes, Microcerotermes, Rhadinotermes, Trinervitermes, Psammotermes, Schedorhinotermes and Cubitermes) were recorded. A higher species diversity index was observed for the wet season. Communal grazing resulted in a higher Shannon diversity index (H ') of 2.23 and Simpson diversity index (1-D) of 0.84 followed by mango orchard (H ' = 1.41, 1-D = 0.68), while maize field recorded the lowest (H ' = 1.07, 1-D = 0.48). Macrotermitinae constituted 77% of the total number of species recorded across all the land use types. Edible termite species recorded are important in rural communities to supplement human protein requirements and they provide ecosystem services thus, there is a need for studies that quantify the trade-off between costs (crop damage) and benefits of maintaining termites in agricultural landscapes.

TI  - Is Planting Trees Enough? The Effect of Different Types of Reforestation on the Offspring of Trypoxylon (Trypargilum) lactitarse (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) in the Southern Amazon
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - The deforestation has led to local loss of species and important ecosystem services performed by them, causing ecological and economic losses. It is proposed that the reforestation of such areas aims to reduce those impacts. However, particularly in the tropics, little is known about the real success of different types of reforestation in the recovery of the species, and especially of the population parameters. Here we evaluated whether different types of reforestations affect Trypoxylon (Trypargilum) lactitarse Saussure (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) in terms of abundance, percentage of emergence, proportion of males, fluctuating asymmetry, and foraging capacity. We compared primary forest (control) data to data collected in five different habitats: pasture, secondary forest, and tree plantations of Teak, Ficus, and a mixture of native species. The abundance of T. lactitarse was higher in tree plantations than in pasture. However, among the analyzed parameters, Teak plantation presented lower emergence percentage and the majority of individuals born were males. The emerged females in this habitat showed higher asymmetry and lower foraging capacity. Ficus showed lower individual abundance and mixed plantation showed lower emergence percentage, with both plantation types showing higher male emergence. On the other hand, in secondary forest, the analyzed parameters did not differ in relation to the primary forest, being the habitat more efficient in relation to those with tree planting. The changes in population parameters of T. lactitarse in different reforestations and particularly on Teak monocultures were probably attributed to indirect effects, such as low food availability and inadequate environmental conditions.

TI  - Assessment of Gayo agroforestry coffee characteristics and carbon stock potential in Mumuger social forestry area, Central Aceh Regency
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
AB  - Coffee agroforestry has become a nature-based solution for controlling climate change impacts while, providing access to sustainable forest utilization for rural farmers, especially for the governance of social forestry policies in Indonesia. Ecosystem services established in coffee agroforestry provide high-carbon stocks that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. Statistical and spatial information on carbon stocks in coffee agroforestry in the Sumatran tropical forest region, especially above ground carbon (AGC), is still very limited. Therefore, this study aims to assess the available carbon stocks in Gayo coffee agroforestry in Mumuger Social Forestry Area, Central Aceh Regency, with the help of combining multi-source data (Landsat-Sentinel-NICFI imagery) and involving machine learning algorithms in estimation modelling. The agroforestry carbon stock distributed in the study area has 72.31 +/- 48.46 Mg C ha-1, which is dominated by the Leucaena-coffee agroforestry combination. There are 13 species at the overstory level that contribute carbon stock values up to 198 Mg C ha-1. Based on modelling tests of carbon stock estimation using 37 predictors, the two best machinelearning algorithms were RF and SVM, with R2 reaching 0.83 and 0.85. Carbon stock quantification information and remote sensing machine learning approaches play a strategic role in studying the impacts of agroforestry systems and as a policy evaluation in social forestry governance that can contribute to climate change mitigation.

TI  - Qui bono? Justice in the Distribution of the Benefits and Burdens of Avoided Deforestation
T2  - RES PUBLICA-A JOURNAL OF MORAL LEGAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY
AB  - In this paper, I explore the question of how the costs of undertaking an important type of climate change mitigation should be shared amongst states seeking an environmentally effective and equitable response to global climate change. While much of the normative literature on climate mitigation has focused on burden sharing within the context of reductions in emissions of greenhouse gas, I explore the question of how the costs of protecting tropical forests in order to harness their climate mitigation potential should be distributed amongst developing and developed states. In response to this question, I outline and defend a 'beneficiary pays' account of forestry mitigation burden sharing that requires affluent states to finance measures supporting avoided deforestation while less affluent states, within whose territory these forests tend to be located, implement these measures. The normative basis for this account, I argue, is a principle of 'unjust enrichment' according to which developed states must bear much of the cost of avoided deforestation for its climate mitigation potential because of the huge economic benefits their citizens have accumulated from productive activities that have contributed to climate change.

TI  - Tree diversity, use and carbon stocks in productive restoration areas in Calakmul, Campeche
T2  - ECOSISTEMAS Y RECURSOS AGROPECUARIOS
AB  - Tropical forests of the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve (REBICA) are home to high biodiversity and provide diverse ecosystem services threatened by the advance of the agricultural frontier. Productive restoration (RP), as a strategy that articulates the needs of producers and the conservation of natural resources, was implemented in modules in the ejidos Benito Juarez II (BJ), Eugenio Echeverria Castellot I (EEC) and Los Angeles (LA), adjacent to the REBICA. The aim was to evaluate a baseline for long-term monitoring of the impact of restoration actions on tree diversity, its use and stored carbon. The ejidos EEC and LA were associated with agroforestry systems, while in BJ a silvopastoral system was implemented, estimating densities of 1 713 ind ha(-1), 3 144 ind ha(-1) and 1 717 ind ha(-1) respectively. True diversity (1D) ranged from 24.63 in LA to 15.13 in EEC and 13.47 in BJ. Sixteen potential uses were recognized for the identified species of which 47 were protected under CITES, IUCN and NOM-059 lists. The carbon values corresponded to 6.96 Mg C ha(-1) in BJ, 10.32 Mg C ha(-1) in EEC and 34.40 Mg C ha(-1) in LA. The variations in composition, structure, biomass and carbon estimated indicate that the estimation of this baseline will facilitate the generation of a monitoring program that will allow evaluating the impact of the restoration actions implemented and, where appropriate, modifying them to accelerate the recovery of the analysed attributes.

TI  - Role of anthropogenic drivers in altering the forest community structure in a prime tiger habitat in central India
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB  - Tropical forests are complex systems with heterogeneous community assemblages often threatened under anthropogenic disturbances and grazing. We studied the change in plant community composition and structure under a disturbance gradient in the tropical dry deciduous forest of the corridor area between Nagzira Wildlife Sanctuary and Navegaon National Park of central India. We tested the hypothesis that the plant community will change along the gradient of proximity to human settlements depending on the anthropogenic stress. We sampled 183 nested quadrat plots to collect data on species abundance and various disturbance parameters. Density, diversity, and importance value index were calculated, and multivariate analysis was performed to assess the changes in species assemblage along the disturbance gradients. We found 76% overall dissimilarity between the plant communities in the three distance classes perpetrated by the difference in mean abundance of species like Tectona grandis, Terminalia sp., and Largerstroemia parviflora. The anthropogenic factors influence the density and diversity of tree species and regeneration classes. We found the abundance of regeneration class increased along the distance from the villages. The study intensifies the need for proper management and conservative approach to preserve the diversity of the forest patches for their structural and functional contiguity as a corridor in central India's highly susceptible and intricate corridor framework.

TI  - Increased soil organic carbon stocks under agroforestry: A survey of six different sites in France
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Agroforestry systems are land use management systems in which trees are grown in combination with crops or pasture in the same field. In silvoarable systems, trees are intercropped with arable crops, and in silvopastoral systems trees are combined with pasture for livestock. These systems may produce forage and timber as well as providing ecosystem services such as climate change mitigation. Carbon (C) is stored in the aboveground and belowground biomass of the trees, and the transfer of organic matter from the trees to the soil can increase soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. Few studies have assessed the impact of agroforestry systems on carbon storage in soils in temperate climates, as most have been undertaken in tropical regions. This study assessed five silvoarable systems and one silvopastoral system in France. All sites had an agroforestry system with an adjacent, purely agricultural control plot. The land use management in the inter-rows in the agroforestry systems and in the control plots were identical. The age of the study sites ranged from 6 to 41 years after tree planting. Depending on the type of soil, the sampling depth ranged from 20 to 100 cm and SOC stocks were assessed using equivalent soil masses. The aboveground biomass of the trees was also measured at all sites. In the silvoarable systems, the mean organic carbon stock accumulation rate in the soil was 0.24 (0.09-0.46) Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) at a depth of 30 cm and 0.65 (0.004-1.85) Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in the tree biomass. Increased SOC stocks were also found in deeper soil layers at two silvoarable sites. Young plantations stored additional SOC but mainly in the soil under the rows of trees, possibly as a result of the herbaceous vegetation growing in the rows. At the silvopastoral site, the SOC stock was significantly greater at a depth of 30-50 cm than in the control. Overall, this study showed the potential of agroforestry systems to store C in both soil and biomass in temperate regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cropping system diversification for food production in Mindanao rubber plantations: a rice cultivar mixture and rice intercropped with mungbean
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Including food production in non-food systems, such as rubber plantations and biofuel or bioenergy crops, may contribute to household food security. We evaluated the potential for planting rice, mungbean, rice cultivar mixtures, and rice intercropped with mungbean in young rubber plantations in experiments in the Arakan Valley of Mindanao in the Philippines. Rice mixtures consisted of two- or three-row strips of cultivar Dinorado, a cultivar with higher value but lower yield, and high-yielding cultivar UPL Ri-5. Rice and mungbean intercropping treatments consisted of different combinations of two- or three-row strips of rice and mungbean. We used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate the yield of each crop alone and in the mixture or intercropping treatments. We also evaluated a land equivalent ratio for yield, along with weed biomass (where Ageratum conyzoides was particularly abundant), the severity of disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae and Cochliobolus miyabeanus, and rice bug (Leptocorisa acuta) abundance. We analyzed the yield ranking of each cropping system across site-year combinations to determine mean relative performance and yield stability. When weighted by their relative economic value, UPL Ri-5 had the highest mean performance, but with decreasing performance in low-yielding environments. A rice and mungbean intercropping system had the second highest performance, tied with high-value Dinorado but without decreasing relative performance in low-yielding environments. Rice and mungbean intercropped with rubber have been adopted by farmers in the Arakan Valley.

TI  - Instant trees: Using giant vegetative stakes in tropical forest restoration
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Remnant trees have been widely reported to facilitate tropical forest recovery, however, few restoration strategies can mimic the role such trees play in their absence. This study evaluated the establishment success and growth of planting oversized vegetative 'stakes' (>4 m tall) of three species: Ficus pertusa (Moraceae), Bursera simaruba (Burseraceae), and Erythrina poeppigiana (Fabaceae) at three different sites in southern Costa Rica. I found high establishment rates for all species (range 67-100%) with no mortality for Erythrina. This result was coupled with a rapid development of canopy area over 1 yr for Erythrina (7.69 +/- 0.86 m(2)) and Bursera (1.82 +/- 0.86 m(2)), but not Ficus (0.23 +/- 0.04 m(2)). Similar results are reported for height. The study presents an important new addition to the growing body of literature on the use of stakes in tropical restoration, where, oversized stakes may be planted as solitary individuals in restoration sites to mimic the role played by remnant trees in forest recovery.

TI  - Functional diversity and traits assembly patterns of lichens as indicators of successional stages in a tropical rainforest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Understanding community assembly patterns with regard to functional traits, which may be common to different species, allows us to compare ecological communities in a wider range of environmental and phytogeographic conditions. Moreover, a functional approach may facilitate the comprehension of the relation between biotic changes and ecosystem functions in complex systems such as tropical forests. Considering the lack of information in relation to the influence of environmental conditions on lichen functional traits, on lichen functional patterns in tropical forests and the potential usage of this approach in bioindication studies, this paper aims at (i) determining the functional structure of the lichen communities along the forest succession gradient, (ii) assessing the relation of lichen functional traits to this gradient and (iii) verifying the potential of using lichen functional traits as indicators of successional stages in tropical rainforests. Lichens were sampled in 24 sampling units of three successional stages (6-10; 12-20; and 40-60 years of recovering). The results corroborated our main hypothesis that the functional structure of the lichen communities responds to structural changes along a forest regeneration gradient. Growth forms (foliose, fruticose and crustose) as well as some reproductive trait states (lirella, isidia and perithecia) were the most suitable lichen traits to be used as indicators of forest succession in the southern edge of the Atlantic Rainforest. Lirella, fruticose and foliose were more related to earlier successional stages; isidia was more related to intermediate stages, while perithecia and crustose were more related to older stages. These results reinforce the ability of lichens to be used as bioindicators of forest conditions. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Small-scale edaphic heterogeneity as a floristic-structural complexity driver in Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests tree communities
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
AB  - Our work aimed to test the hypothesis that soil microscale heterogeneity act as a community ecological driver, increasing diversity and promoting structural shifts on the Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest (SDTF) tree community. We evaluated the relationship between microscale edaphic variations and floristic-structural patterns of tree communities in a SDTF fragment located in the southern end of the Brazilian Caatinga domain. Vegetation and soil data were obtained through 27 sample units of 400 m(2)(20 m x 20 m), within each one we measured and identified at species level all arboreal individuals with Circumference at the Breast Height greater or equal to 10 cm, and also collected the soil samples. Through the data we evaluated soil variation influence on the tree community structural and floristic patterns trough generalized linear models. Soil explained the small-scale structural and floristic variations, contributing significantly to biomass, sprouting and to floristic relationships between sample units. It was also observed a possible relation of the result with the Caatinga domain biogeographic history, due the presence of Sedimentary Caatinga species, which are not expected for the study region. Soil plays an important role in driving small-scale complexity and diversity of SDTF, but we also suggest that Caatinga biogeographic events have influence on the high heterogeneity patterns.

TI  - Protected areas of Borneo fail to protect forest landscapes with high habitat connectivity
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Throughout the world, previously extensive areas of natural habitats have been degraded and fragmented, and improving habitat connectivity may help the long-term persistence of species, and their ability to adapt to climate changes. We focused on Borneo, where many remaining areas of tropical forest are highly fragmented, and we assessed the extent to which Protected Areas (PAs) protect highly-connected forest sites. We analysed remotely-sensed land cover data (0.86 km(2) grid cell resolution) using 'Zonation' reserve design software, and we ranked grid cells (rank 0-1) according to forest extent and connectivity. PAs currently cover 9% of Borneo, but <20% of highly-connected cells (i.e. cells with Zonation ranks >= 0.9) lie within PAs. Approximately 65% of highly-connected cells were located above 400 m elevation, although >60% of Borneo's total land area lies below 200 m and only 15% of highly-connected cells occurred in these low elevation areas. These findings were relatively insensitive to assumptions about species' dispersal ability (within the range 1-20 km; representing relatively mobile animal species). The percentage of highly-connected grid cells within PAs could rise from 20 to 50% under proposed new PAs (including the 'Heart of Borneo' project), although many other highly-connected sites will remain unprotected. On-going land-use changes mean that existing PAs in lowland areas are likely to become increasingly isolated within inhospitable agricultural landscapes, and improving connectivity through reforestation and rehabilitation of degraded forest may be required to maintain the conservation value of these PAs in future.

TI  - A probabilistic scenario approach for developing improved Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD plus ) baselines
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Performance-based payments are widely seen as a promising tool for Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) in tropical forests. Despite great advances in international REDD+ negotiations, there is a lack of consensus around the development of business-as-usual (BAU) reference scenarios or baselines to derive and quantify net carbon emission reductions. In this paper, we explore a novel approach for developing baselines (point forecasts) using exponential smoothing. Further, we introduce the concept of probabilistic BAU scenario ranges developed using this approach.
   We compare predictive performance with the linear trend and historical averages approaches conventionally used in policy proposals and REDD+ pilots. Weempirically test the relative performance of all three approaches by forecasting BAU baselines and scenario ranges in 36 sites (consisting of 20 countries and 8 Amazonian states with and 8 countries without REDD+ schemes). Based on two predictive performance measures (the root mean squared error and mean absolute percentage error), we find that exponential smoothing outperforms the linear trend and historical average models at predicting forest cover changes. In addition, we show how prediction intervals based on a desired confidence level generated through exponential smoothing can be used in novel ways to determine likely baseline scenario ranges. In this way it is possible to quantify the degree of variability and uncertainty in datasets. Importantly, this also provides a statistical measure of confidence to determine if REDD+ interventions have been effective.
   By generating robust probabilistic baseline scenarios, exponential smoothing models can facilitate the effectiveness of REDD+ payments, support a more efficient allocation of scarce conservation resources, and improve our understanding of effective forest conservation investments, also beyond REDD+.

TI  - Mixed impacts of protected areas and a cash crop boom on human well-being in North-Eastern Madagascar
T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
AB  - Tropical forest frontier areas support the well-being of local populations in myriad ways. Not only do they provide the material basis for people's livelihoods, they also sustain socio-cultural foundations through relational values. They host some of the most biodiverse ecosystems and largest carbon stocks on the planet, and are thus a focus of global conservation efforts. They are also a prime location for the production of many global agricultural commodities. These dynamics-often intertwined-may trap local populations between powerful interests, with the potential to affect their well-being. We conducted 100 structured interviews in four biodiversity-rich landscapes of north-eastern Madagascar to investigate how multi-dimensional human well-being is affected by the recent establishment of protected areas and surge in cash crop prices. We asked households about their satisfaction-and changes in satisfaction-with locally relevant well-being components, mapping their answers through Nussbaum's Central Capabilities approach. We also investigated the cultural significance of key natural resources beyond the material benefits they provide. All issues were explored along four variables: site, main source of rice, gender and household land use portfolio. Our findings are as follows: first, human capabilities are interconnected and mutually interdependent, with relational values linking many of them. Second, subjective accounts of well-being are influenced by cognitive biases, such as treadmill effects, adaptive preferences and recency bias. Third, while households perceived a positive influence of protected areas, those most reliant on forest land and products held a more negative view of conservation interventions. And fourth, while households more engaged in commercial agriculture may be benefitting economically from the recent increase in cash crop prices, these very dynamics might be leading to trade-offs between capabilities. This is most notably so for the Bodily Health capability (e.g. greater spending on housing) and Affiliation and Bodily Integrity (i.e. worsening social relations and security). These insights highlight the importance of addressing the multiple dimensions of well-being when assessing the impacts of conservation and economic dynamics in forest frontier populations. Particular attention should be paid to the relational values ascribed to the natural resources the communities rely on. Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

TI  - The tree Acacia mangium (Fabaceae) facilitates the recovery of mining areas in the rain forest of Choco, Colombia
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: Mining-impacted areas in tropical forests require the application of ecological restoration strate-gies, but this process often involves use of exotic plant species ignoring the effects on the ecological regeneration of the sites where they are introduced. Objective: To evaluate the effect of Acacia mangium plantations (exotic plant) on early ecological rehabilitation (soil and vegetation) of areas impacted by open-pit gold mining in the tropical rain forest of Choco, Colombia.Methods: 16 mining areas were selected as sampling units (eight reforested with A. mangium and eight in natu-ral succession) in two locations. In each sampling unit, a 2 x 50 m plot was established (four plots per sampling scenario and locality), where soil fertility (physical and chemical parameters) was analyzed and the number of individuals of each vascular plant species was quantified.Results: 73 species (69 genera, 45 families) were recorded. The density of individuals was higher in areas of natural succession than in those reforested with A. mangium; conversely, species richness and diversity were higher under the A. mangium plantations. Floristic similarity was low between successional scenarios (shared species 35.6 %). The soil showed better conditions (especially N-NHO3) in mining areas with A. mangium than in those in natural regeneration. Conclusions: A. mangium plantations appears to facilitate the early rehabilitation of soil fertility and vegeta-tion in abandoned mines; therefore, this species can play an important role in the implementation of ecological restoration strategies in areas impacted by open-pit gold mining in the Choco and other tropical forest systems with similar environmental and disturbance conditions.

TI  - Integrating indicators of natural regeneration, enrichment planting, above-ground carbon stock, micro-climate and soil to asses vegetation succession in postmining reclamation in tropical forest
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Open-cast mining in tropical forests causes negative impacts on biodiversity and carbon storage. Postmining reclamation is therefore imposed to recover the vegetation despite the lack of understanding which indicators can be used to monitor the progress of succession. This study proposes an integrated framework to assess the trajectory of vegetation succession in coal mining site in East Kalimantan, Borneo. We combine the indicators of floristic diversity of naturally growing terrestrial and epiphytic plants, survival and growth of enrichment planting of native plants, above-ground carbon stock of pioneer trees, and the measurements on micro-climate and soil conditions. We compare some indicators across the 9-year-old and 17-year-old reclaimed sites and the premining sites. The results showed that naturally growing vegetation at the reclaimed sites was at the early to midsuccession stages, with biodiversity indicators much lower than those at the premining areas, implying the necessity of native species planting. During a six-month monitoring, the enrichment planting of native species had high rates of survival and growth. Surprisingly, the above-ground carbon at the two reclamation sites were higher, up to six times larger, than that at the premining sites. While the micro-climates had been improved, the soils in the reclaimed sites were still in poor conditions. Our findings suggest that using single parameter to monitor the trajectory of vegetation succession in postmining reclamation can be biased, and integrating several monitoring measures would provide a much better assessment.

TI  - Natural forest regrowth under different land use intensities and landscape configurations in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Natural forest regrowth is considered the most cost-effective strategy to promote large-scale forest restoration, but regrowth trajectories and their consequences for nature and people can be highly variable. This uncertainty may obstruct devoting land, time and resources in promoting this restoration approach. Process-based models allow to simulate forest regrowth under different scenarios and may thus support decision making to manage areas in ways that maximize forest restoration based on natural forest regrowth. In the present study, we used the process-based model LandClim to assess the following questions:1) How does land use intensity affect forest growth, aboveground biomass (AGB) and tree species diversity in agricultural landscapes in the long term? 2) How do different land use configurations affect the structure and expansion of second-growth forests? We based our study on six 4 x 4 km agricultural landscapes, dominated by pastures and sugarcane, in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest region. We parameterized and validated LandClim for the study region by comparing model outputs with published estimates and information from field data collected across the six landscapes. We then simulated natural forest regrowth under different land use intensities in the six landscapes and analyzed how land use intensity and landscape configuration affect AGB, tree species diversity and the spatial dynamics of second growth forests. Our results showed negative effects of increased land use intensity on landscape biomass accumulation due to limited forest cover expansion. Landscapes dominated by sugarcane had lower forest regrowth potential than pasture-dominated landscapes due to lower likelihood of abandonment, and limited rates of seed availability and seedling growth. Land use intensity and landscape configuration were also important factors for tree diversity changes. However, temporal patterns differed, and while AGB reached a plateau after 100-150 years, tree diversity peaked between 30 and 70 years. Thus, the effects of land use intensity and landscape configuration on forest AGB and tree diversity take decades to be fully expressed, highlighting the importance of a long-term commitment in restoration projects.

TI  - Biodiversity patterns and trophic interactions in human-dominated tropical landscapes in Sulawesi (Indonesia): plants, arthropods and vertebrates
T2  - TROPICAL RAINFORESTS AND AGROFORESTS UNDER GLOBAL CHANGE: ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC VALUATIONS
AB  - The need to capture primary production in order to sustain and improve economic livelihoods has lead to increasing conversion of natural habitat and intensification of agricultural practices in many parts of the world including most tropical regions. Understanding how these processes affect ecosystems and their functioning, in particular in the high-diversity ecosystems of the tropics, has become a key issue in ecological research. In this chapter, our focus is on the agriculture-forest landscapes of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, an island widely known for its endemic yet still poorly known flora and fauna. The rise of the region to one of the largest cacao producing areas in the world is at the core of recent land-use change and intensification processes. Covering plants (trees, rattan palms, herbs, bryophytes) and several invertebrate (ants, dung beetles, cacao insect herbivores, fruit-feeding butterflies, parasitic Hymenoptera, spiders) and vertebrate groups (amphibians, birds, murids, reptiles), we give an in-depth overview of the determinants of biodiversity in cacao landscapes, including both management and landscape-scale variables into our analyses. Results show that shaded agroforests host a rich community of species. By adopting a large-scale study design we showed that proximity of natural forest is a key predictor for species richness of plants, invertebrates and vertebrates alike. Endemics and forest specialists benefit most from indigenous shade tree cover and proximity to natural forest. Importantly, several functionally important groups such as insectivorous and seed-dispersing birds benefit from tall shade trees, shade tree diversity and proximity to forest edge, while parasitoid diversity is greatest close to natural forests. Available data on the effects of landuse change in cacao landscape of Central Sulawesi is increasing. Change in landscape configuration and management practices are being clearly reflected in the composition of species communities, with likely impacts on ecosystem services such as pest control and pollination. More knowledge is needed especially in terms of species interactions and ecosystem functioning, but also on how existing knowledge can contribute to effective conservation in human-dominated landscapes outside protected areas.

TI  - Ecological restoration as a strategy for mitigating and adapting to climate change: lessons and challenges from Brazil
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Climate change is a global phenomenon that affects biophysical systems and human well-being. The Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change entered into force in 2016 with the objective of strengthening the global response to climate change by keeping global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees C. The agreement requires all Parties to submit their "nationally determined contributions" (NDCs) and to strengthen these efforts in the years ahead. Reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation is an important strategy for mitigating climate change, particularly in developing countries with large forests. Extensive tropical forest loss and degradation have increased awareness at the international level of the need to undertake large-scale ecological restoration, highlighting the need to identify cases in which restoration strategies can contribute to mitigation and adaptation. Here we consider Brazil as a case study to evaluate the benefits and challenges of implementing large-scale restoration programs in developing countries. The Brazilian NDC included the target of restoring and reforesting 12 million hectares of forests for multiple uses by 2030. Restoration of native vegetation is one of the foundations of sustainable rural development in Brazil and should consider multiple purposes, from biodiversity and ecosystem services conservation to social and economic development. However, ecological restoration still presents substantial challenges for tropical and mega-diverse countries, including the need to develop plans that are technically and financially feasible, as well as public policies and monitoring instruments that can assess effectiveness. The planning, execution, and monitoring of restoration efforts strongly depend on the context and the diagnosis of the area with respect to reference ecosystems (e.g., forests, savannas, grasslands, wetlands). In addition, poor integration of climate change policies at the national and subnational levels and with other sectorial policies constrains the large-scale implementation of restoration programs. The case of Brazil shows that slowing deforestation is possible; however, this analysis highlights the need for increased national commitment and international support for actions that require large-scale transformations of the forest sector regarding ecosystem restoration efforts. Scaling up the ambitions and actions of the Paris Agreement implies the need for a global framework that recognizes landscape restoration as a cost-effective nature-based solution and that supports countries in addressing their remaining needs, challenges, and barriers.

TI  - Fast recovery of soil macrofauna in regenerating forests of the Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY
AB  - The emergence of secondary forests in deforested tropical regions represents an opportunity to mitigate biodiversity loss and climate change, but there is still debate on how fast and to which level these forests can recover biodiversity. Recent studies have shown that the recovery of plant and vertebrate species richness is relatively fast, but the pace of recovery for other groups remains unclear. Soil macroinvertebrates play critical roles on litter decomposition and seed dispersal, therefore the pace of their recovery has consequences for the entire forest ecosystem.
   We investigated how fast broad taxonomic groups of soil macrofauna recover in the first 30 years of forest regeneration using forests older than 50 years as reference.
   We surveyed the number, diversity and abundance of 19 broad taxonomic groups of soil macrofauna in 85 sites located in Brazilian Amazon, covering forests of different ages and clearing frequencies. Forest age and clearing frequency were obtained accurately from Landsat images in forests up to 30 years old. We used regression analysis to determine (a) the effects forest age and clearing frequency on macrofauna groups in secondary forests up to 30 years old; and (b) the changes in macrofauna groups between young forests (up to 10 years old), median age forests (between 10 and 30 years old) and forests older than 50 years.
   We found that the number and diversity of macrofauna groups recover rapidly in the first 10 years of forest regrowth, but show slower change among older forests. This rapid recovery was also observed in the abundance of several taxonomic groups and for predators and detritivores as functional groups. Forest clearing frequency had no effect on the number or the diversity of macrofauna groups, but the abundance of ants increased as forest was cleared more often.
   Our results for soil macrofauna align with those in plant and vertebrate studies showing that secondary forests quickly recover a large part of their biodiversity and ecological functions. Therefore, global-scale conservation strategies are needed to ensure the opportunity for secondary forests to grow.

TI  - Unconditional Transfers and Tropical Forest Conservation: Evidence from a Randomized Control Trial in Sierra Leone
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Unconditional conservation payments are increasingly used by non-governmental conservation organizations to further their environmental objectives. One key objective in many conservation projects that use such unconditional payments schemes is the protection of tropical forest ecosystems in buffer zone areas around protected parks where the scope of instating mandatory restrictions is more limited. We use a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of unconditional livelihood payments to local communities on land use outside a protected area-the Gola Rainforest National Park-which is a biodiversity hotspot on the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia. High resolution RapidEye satellite imagery from before and after the intervention was used to determine land use changes in treated and control villages. We find support for the hypothesis that unconditional payments, in this setting, increase land clearance in the short run. The study constitutes one of the first attempts to use evidence from a randomized control trial to evaluate the efficacy of conservation payments and provides insights for further research.

TI  - Using linear mixed models to evaluate stand level growth rates for dipterocarps and Macaranga species following two selective logging methods in Sabah, Borneo
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - To understand and predict the dynamics and productivity of the world's tropical rainforests after logging is a major challenge for ecologists and forest managers. Realistic forest-dynamics models for this biome are largely lacking. Using linear mixed models, we analyse basal area development for the commercially valuable tree species of dipterocarps and the fast-growing pioneer Macaranga spp., following two selective logging methods; supervised logging (SL) and conventional logging (CL) combined with- or without pre-harvest climber cutting (SLC and SL, and CLC and CL, respectively). After logging there was an initial period of about five years before recovery started. During the 18-year study period, the average stand basal area growth rates of the dipterocarp group in the SLC treatment was double that in the CL treatment, revealing a faster recovery. Eighteen years after logging, SL and SLC treatments recovered 93% and 84%, respectively, of the initial standing dipterocarp basal area, compared to 73% and 72% recovery for the CL and CLC treatments. SLC treatments reduced the overall establishment of pioneer species (Macaranga spp.) by about 45% in contrast to CL and CLC treatments. Our study provides a framework for evaluating and comparing growth rates in tropical forests for different logging methods. The results suggest that a combination of directional felling, pre-aligned skid trails and pre-harvest climber cutting can improve future yields in tropical rainforests.

TI  - Economic value of the carbon sink services of tropical secondary forests and its management implications
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper explores the economic feasibility of secondary forest regeneration and conservation as an alternative in the campaign addressing the problem of global warming. Detailed measurements of tropical secondary forests over time, in different ecological zones of Costa Rica, are used to evaluate carbon storage models. The paper addresses key issues in the international discussion about cross- and within-country compensation for carbon storage services and illustrates a method to compute/predict their economic value over time under a variety of scenarios. The procedure is applicable to other developing countries where secondary forest growth is increasingly important.

TI  - Sucessional trajetories of bird assemblages in amazonian secondary forests: Perspectives from complementary biodiversity dimensions
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Secondary forests occupy extensive areas in tropical regions, providing an opportunity to investigate their relevance to biodiversity restoration. However, determining the conservation value of secondary forests and evaluating their successional trajectories depends on how biodiversity is measured. Here, we explore different biodiversity dimensions to understand how bird assemblages recover from forest disturbance caused by small scale farmers in the Amazon. We sampled bird species through standard visual and auditory censuses in 24 small plots of 1-hectare distributed in a paired design of old growth forests and secondary forests from different age categories (early, middle and late succession). We used 12 biodiversity metrics to explore the taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic dimensions of bird diversity. Total species richness and evenness was similar between secondary and old growth forests. In contrast, the number of passerine species and disturbance-vulnerable species were higher in the controls of old growth forests compared to secondary forests. The relative abundance of birds with distinct functional traits consistently differed between the secondary forests of different age categories and their old growth forest counterparts. Functional evenness and divergence increased with canopy height and basal area through forest regeneration. In contrast, bird phylogenetic diversity in secondary forests was higher compared to those found in old growth forests while accounting for forest types and age categories of secondary forests. Bird species tolerant to disturbances partially compensate the loss of avian taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity during the conversion of undisturbed forests to agricultural fields. Changes in functional evenness and functional divergence suggest that resources used by birds are altered along the secondary succession and that the niche complementarity among species is reduced in more intensively managed sites. Ecological succession can be highly complex in terms of taxa identity, their functional roles and evolutionary history. Therefore, measurements that explore distinct biodiversity dimensions are fundamental to understanding how species are organized in assemblages across time and space.

TI  - Positive effects of liana cutting on seedlings are reduced during El Nino-induced drought
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Liana cutting is a management practice currently applied to encourage seedling regeneration and tree growth in some logged tropical forests. However, there is limited empirical evidence of its effects on forest demographic rates in Southeast Asia.
   We used 22 four-hectare plots in the Sabah Biodiversity Experiment (a reduced impact logging site) enrichment line planted with 16 dipterocarp species to assess the effects of complete liana cutting on tree growth and survival. We compared plots where lianas were only cut along planting lines (standard enrichment line planting) with those with one (2014) or two rounds (2011 and 2014) of complete liana cutting.
   We found increased seedling growth following the first complete liana cut in 2011 relative to the enrichment line planting, consistent with previous studies. The response after 3years to the cutting in 2014 depended on whether lianas had been previously cut or not: in twice-cut plots, seedling growth was not significantly different from the standard enrichment planting controls, whereas growth in plots with only one complete cut in 2014 was significantly slower. Seedling survival decreased through time for both once- and twice-cut liana treatments but remained stable in controls.
   Sapling growth after the 2014 liana cutting showed a similar pattern to seedling growth, while tree growth following the 2014 liana cutting was significantly lower than controls regardless of whether lianas were cut twice (2011 and 2014) or once (2014).
   Differences in response between the two rounds of liana cutting were likely due to changes in precipitation2011 was followed by consistent rainfall while 2014 was followed by two severe droughts within 2years.
   Synthesis and applications. Our results generally support the widely reported positive effects of liana cutting on tree growth and survival. However, reduced growth and survival after the 2015/2016 El Nino suggests that drought may temporarily undermine the benefits of liana cutting in logged tropical forests. Managers of similar areas in SE Asia should consider halting liana cutting during El Nino events. In other tropical areas, seedling survival should be monitored to assess to what extent results from SE Asia are transferable.

TI  - Evolving frontier land markets and the opportunity cost of sparing forests in western Amazonia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Efforts aimed at sparing forests on tropical forest frontiers through REDD+, PES or conservation initiatives currently rely on a limited understanding of the operation of land markets and their effects on the opportunity cost of forests as frontiers develop. In this paper, we draw on a unique dataset of landholder reported land transactions that includes post-1991 land sales-in three sub-montane frontier forest areas on the eastern slopes of the Peruvian Andes. We analyze reported land sales that took place between 1979 and 2013 among Amazonian frontier farmers and find highly active land markets in all three areas, often in the absence of formal land tenure. As frontiers developed, parcel size fell, as did the portion of remaining forest cover, and land prices rose, reflecting both forest clearing and general land price inflation as the areas became more populated and developed. Across three study districts in 2013, each additional hectare of forest cleared raised the expected price of a parcel of land by US $1371-$2587. Importantly, we estimate the opportunity cost per hectare of frontier forest rose markedly over time: by $124-$226 per year between 2003 and 2013, a rate of increase over that period of 9-27% per year. Forest conservation programs that rely on estimates of landholders' willingness to accept compensation for sparing forest need to take into account that these values change rapidly as frontiers develop.

TI  - Deforestation in Continental Ecuador with a Focus on Protected Areas
T2  - LAND
AB  - Forest conservation is of particular concern in tropical regions where a large refuge of biodiversity is still existing. These areas are threatened by deforestation, forest degradation and fragmentation. Especially, pressures of anthropogenic activities adjacent to these areas significantly influence conservation effectiveness. Ecuador was chosen as study area since it is a globally relevant center of forest ecosystems and biodiversity. We identified hotspots of deforestation on the national level of continental Ecuador between 1990 and 2018, analyzed the most significant drivers of deforestation on national and biome level (the Coast, the Andes, The Amazon) as well as inside protected areas in Ecuador by using multiple regression analysis. We separated the national system of protected areas (SNAP) into higher and lower protection levels. Besides SNAP, we also considered Biosphere Reserves (BRs) and Ramsar sites. In addition, we investigated the rates and spatial patterns of deforestation in protected areas and buffer zones (5 km and 10 km outwards the protected area boundaries) using landscape metrics. Between 1990 and 2018, approximately 4% of the accumulated deforestation occurred within the boundaries of SNAP, and up to 25.5% in buffer zones. The highest rates of deforestation have been found in the 5 km buffer zone around the protected areas with the highest protection level. Protected areas and their buffer zones with higher protection status were identified as the most deforested areas among SNAP. BRs had the highest deforestation rates among all protected areas but most of these areas just became BRs after the year 2000. The most important driver of deforestation is agriculture. Other relevant drivers differ between the biomes. The results suggest that the SNAP is generally effective to prevent deforestation within their protection boundaries. However, deforestation around protected areas can undermine conservation strategies to sustain biodiversity. Actions to address such dynamics and patterns of deforestation and forest fragmentation, and developing conservation strategies of their landscape context are urgently needed especially in the buffer zones of areas with the highest protection status.

TI  - Greater stability of carbon capture in species-rich natural forests compared to species-poor plantations
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Tree plantations and forest restoration are leading strategies for enhancing terrestrial carbon (C) sequestration and mitigating climate change. While it is well established that species-rich natural forests offer superior C sequestering benefits relative to short-rotation commercial monoculture plantations, differences in rates of C capture and storage between longer-lived plantations (commercial or non-commercial) and natural forests remain unclear. Using a natural experiment in the Western Ghats of India, where late-20th century conservation laws prohibited timber extraction from monodominant plantations and natural forests within nature reserves, we assessed forests and plantations for aboveground C storage and the magnitude and temporal stability of rates of photosynthetic C capture (gross primary production). Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that species-rich forests show greater temporal stability of C capture, and are more resistant to drought, than monodominant plantations. Carbon stocks in monodominant teak (Tectona grandis) and Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp.) plantations were 30%-50% lower than in natural evergreen forests, but differed little from moist-deciduous forests. Plantations had 4%-9% higher average C capture rates (estimated using the Enhanced Vegetation Index-EVI) than natural forests during wet seasons, but up to 29% lower C capture during dry seasons across the 2000-18 period. In both seasons, the rate of C capture by plantations was less stable across years, and decreased more during drought years (i.e. lower resistance to drought), compared to forests. Thus, even as certain monodominant plantations could match natural forests for C capture and storage potential, plantations are unlikely to match the stability-and hence reliability-of C capture exhibited by forests, particularly in the face of increasing droughts and other climatic perturbations. Promoting natural forest regeneration and/or multi-species native tree plantations instead of plantation monocultures could therefore benefit climate change mitigation efforts, while offering valuable co-benefits for biodiversity conservation and other ecosystem services.

TI  - Economically important species dominate aboveground carbon storage in forests of southwestern Amazonia
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - Tree species in tropical forests provide economically important goods and ecosystem services. In submontane forests of southwestern Amazonia, we investigated the degree to which tree species important for subsistence and trade contribute to aboveground carbon storage (AGC). We used 41 1-hectare plots to determine the species abundance, basal area, and AGC of stems >10 cm diameter at breast height (dbh). Economically important taxa were classified using ethnobotanical studies and according to their stem density. These taxa (n = 263) accounted for 45% of total stems, 53% of total basal area, and 56% of total AGC, significantly more than taxa with minor or unknown uses (Welch test at p < 0.05). Taxa with 1-2 stems per hectare, or with fewer than 1 stem per hectare (common and rare) accounted for 35% of total AGC, more than the 22% accounted for by dominant taxa. High basal area had a greater impact on AGC than abundance in economic taxa because their populations are skewed to adult trees. Size in these taxa had a median dbh > 40 cm and few stems in regeneration classes of dbh < 10 to 20 cm (e.g., Bertholletia excelsa, Cariniana spp., Cedrelinga spp., Ceiba spp., Dipteryx spp.), whereas dominant Tetragastris spp., and Pseudolmedia spp. had most stems in low diameter classes and a median diameter of < 30 cm. Bertholletia excelsa, with 1.5 stems per hectare, showed the highest basal area of any species and accounted for 9% of AGC (11 Mg/ha), twice that of the second-ranking species. Our study shows that economic importance and carbon stocks in trees are closely linked in southwestern Amazonia. Unplanned harvests can disrupt synergistic dual roles altering carbon stocks temporally or permanently. Precautionary measures based on species ecology, demography, and regeneration traits should be at the forefront of REDD+ to reconcile maximum harvesting limits, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable forest management.

TI  - Dynamics of tropical forest regeneration in the Mexican Mesoamerican Biological Corridor from 2000 to 2020: does forest regeneration maintain continuous forest cover?
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB  - Forest dynamics in the Mexican Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MxMBC) have been part of a land sharing system, helping maintain forest cover following semi-subsistence land-use through regeneration. Recently, mechanized cash-crop cultivation is occurring, translated in larger, permanent tracts of agriculture in place of core forest. This emerging land-use marks a potential shift in regeneration patterns, with implications for the maintenance of forest cover. We characterize MxMBC forest regeneration patterns from 2000 to 2020 to assess their relationship with the maintenance and expansion of forest cover. Classification of multi-temporal remotely sensed Landsat data reveals a decrease of 2.2% (296 km(2)) of forest area from 2000 to 2020, with regrowth making back 0.93% of forest (121 km(2)) by 2020. A spatial model identifies that 75.1% of forest regeneration in the study site occurs in four patterns ranging from permanent (89.2 km(2), 41.7%) to ephemeral (71.5 km(2), 33.4%). Analyzing the relation between landscape configuration and forest regeneration shows that regrowth occurs in small, widely dispersed forest patches. Spatial patterns of ephemeral regeneration mark two distinct land sharing contexts - ephemeral regeneration buffering core forest loss alongside semi-subsistence agriculture and agroforestry, and ephemeral regeneration masking core forest loss alongside cash crop agriculture. These cases suggest that maintaining forest cover through regeneration is impacted by land-use context, as the regeneration to core forest ratio decreases when permanent cash crop cultivation emerges.

TI  - Implementing and Monitoring the Use of Artificial Canopy Bridges by Mammals and Birds in an Indonesian Agroforestry Environment
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
AB  - Deforestation is a major threat to biodiversity, particularly within tropical forest habitats. Some of the fastest diminishing tropical forest habitats in the world occur in Indonesia, where fragmentation is severely impacting biodiversity, including on the island of Java, which holds many endemic species. Extreme fragmentation on the western part of the island, especially due to small-scale agriculture, impacts animal movement and increases mortality risk for mainly arboreal taxa. To mitigate this risk in an agroforest environment in Garut District, West Java, we installed 10 canopy bridges and monitored them through camera trapping between 2017 and 2019. Five of the monitored bridges were made of waterlines and five of rubber hose. We recorded Javan palm civets using the waterline bridges 938 times, while Javan slow lorises used the waterlines 1079 times and the rubber bridges 358 times. At least 19 other species used the bridges for crossing or perching. Our results demonstrate that relatively simple and cost-effective materials can be used to mitigate the effects of habitat fragmentation. We also recommend the use of camera traps to monitor the effectiveness of these interventions.

TI  - Influence of Land-Use Changes (1993 and 2013) in the Distribution of Wild Edible Fruits From Veracruz (Mexico)
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - Wild edible fruits are a complement to the diet, generate income, and contain cultural values for local populations.In Mexico, their presence is threatened mainly by deforestation. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the distribution of 106 wild edible fruits from Veracruz state in several vegetation types and consider the effect of land-use changes on species distribution between 1993 and 2013. Seven species with the least number of herbarium specimens were chosen in order to estimate the current and potential distribution using Maxent models. The types of vegetation with the largest number of wild edible fruit species were the evergreen tropical rainforest with 64, deciduous tropical forest with 51, and the mountain cloud forest with 33. The largest loss between 1993 and 2013 was in secondary vegetation (0.19%) and evergreen tropical rainforest (0.11%). The main causes are the increment in human settlements and pasture, and grazing land (originally populated by tropical forests)-both factors that could put at risk, in the near future, most of the species studied. All of the species with restricted distribution in Veracruz showed a tendency to shrink in area, particularly the pinon (Pinus cembroides) and nuez de castilla (Juglans pynformis), both of economic importance In the face of land-use changes, conservation strategies must be designed in accordance with rational use and public policies that promote a sustainable management of wild edible fruits and the forests in which they grow.

TI  - Termite diversity across an anthropogenic disturbance gradient in the humid forest zone of West Africa
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Data are presented for termite assemblages across an anthropogenic disturbance gradient in the humid forest zone of West and Central Africa. Sampling was by standardised 100 m x 2 m transects in: primary forest, several ages of regenerating forest, agroforestry plots, short follows, mixed food crop fields, and mechanically cleared plots. Most sites were in southern Cameroon-two additional transects were conducted in primary forest in Congo (Brazzaville). Species richness was negatively correlated with the disturbance gradient, although transects in areas with a complete or near-complete canopy were broadly similar in species richness. The strongest negative correlation was found for termite species feeding furthest down the humification gradient (group IV soil feeders) probably because these species are energetically constrained from living in non-forest habitats. In contrast species feeding and nesting in dead wood (group I wood feeders) termites, which live in the most protected micro-habitats, were significantly positively correlated with the disturbance gradient. Species composition was also strongly correlated with disturbance level in multivariate redundancy analyses. Pest species were an insignificant element of the assemblage, in part because of the distance of the sites from savanna source pools. Overall, it appears that termite-mediated wood and litter decomposition may be relatively unaffected by light to moderate disturbance intensity, but that soil-conditioning by termites might be greatly reduced in agricultural land cleared from tropical forest.

TI  - Oil Palm Agroforestry Can Achieve Economic and Environmental Gains as Indicated by Multifunctional Land Equivalent Ratios
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Driven by increased global demand for vegetable oil in the food and biofuel sectors, oil palm plantations based on monoculture technology have expanded into lowland tropical forests. Interest in diversified, mixed oil palm systems is increasing as these might increase efficiency of the use of land and other resources, reduce farmer risk, and decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per unit product. Land Equivalent Ratio for provisioning services (LERP) values above 1.0 show that at least some diversified systems use land more efficiently than monocultures and are thus "land sparing," where monoculture LERP cannot exceed 1.0. Diversification also modifies climate and water regulating functions ("land sharing") relative to a forest reference, as indicated in the LERR index. A "multifunctional" LERM indicator combines both; land sparing plus land sharing effects jointly determine expected regulating services. Empirical assessment of multiple ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes is assisted by models that synthesise process-based knowledge, especially for perennial systems where well-designed experiments require a full production cycle, and are costly and scarce. Agroforestry models explore spacing, intercropping and soil management options, predicting harvestable yields, impacts on water flows, nutrient leaching, and greenhouse gas emissions. We used the process-based Water, Nutrient and Light Capture in Agroforestry System (WaNuLCAS) model to explore mixed oil palm + cocoa and oil palm + pepper intercrop systems with modified ("double row") planting patterns for Indonesian contexts and estimated consequences for the carbon footprint. The oil palm + cocoa intercrop provided a high LERP (1.4), while also replenishing more ground water and having a lower C footprint. This combination also has a return to labour equal to that in oil palm monocultures and a higher benefit cost ratio than the oil palm + pepper combination that maximizes Net Present Value. Oil palm + cocoa systems are also less sensitive to price uncertainty for oil palm, and buffer for oil palm and cocoa production risks, assumed to be independent of each other. Considerable economic and environmental system improvements appear to be feasible through mixed oil palm systems and diversification as a pathway to intensification deserves full attention of research and policy development.

TI  - A large-scale field assessment of carbon stocks in human-modified tropical forests
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Tropical rainforests store enormous amounts of carbon, the protection of which represents a vital component of efforts to mitigate global climate change. Currently, tropical forest conservation, science, policies, and climate mitigation actions focus predominantly on reducing carbon emissions from deforestation alone. However, every year vast areas of the humid tropics are disturbed by selective logging, understory fires, and habitat fragmentation. There is an urgent need to understand the effect of such disturbances on carbon stocks, and how stocks in disturbed forests compare to those found in undisturbed primary forests as well as in regenerating secondary forests. Here, we present the results of the largest field study to date on the impacts of human disturbances on above and belowground carbon stocks in tropical forests. Live vegetation, the largest carbon pool, was extremely sensitive to disturbance: forests that experienced both selective logging and understory fires stored, on average, 40% less aboveground carbon than undisturbed forests and were structurally similar to secondary forests. Edge effects also played an important role in explaining variability in aboveground carbon stocks of disturbed forests. Results indicate a potential rapid recovery of the dead wood and litter carbon pools, while soil stocks (0-30cm) appeared to be resistant to the effects of logging and fire. Carbon loss and subsequent emissions due to human disturbances remain largely unaccounted for in greenhouse gas inventories, but by comparing our estimates of depleted carbon stocks in disturbed forests with Brazilian government assessments of the total forest area annually disturbed in the Amazon, we show that these emissions could represent up to 40% of the carbon loss from deforestation in the region. We conclude that conservation programs aiming to ensure the long-term permanence of forest carbon stocks, such as REDD+, will remain limited in their success unless they effectively avoid degradation as well as deforestation.

TI  - Cenostigma microphyllum seedlings in semiarid region grow faster under arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, regardless of water availability
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
AB  - Reforestation dry tropical forests (DTF) has several challenges that need to be overcome. In this perspective, this study evaluated the performance of Cenostigma microphyllum seedlings inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF plants) for 2 years after transplanting to the field with different rainfall intensity. AMF plants showed the highest gs values in both plots. These plants in wet plots stored more soluble sugars in their stems and roots, whereas root tissue was chosen under the dry plot. AMF plants had more phosphorus than Control plants in dry plots. Furthermore, AMF plants were 24% and 27% larger than Control plants in wet and dry plots, respectively. AMF plants root diameter was 25% and 18% greater in wet and dry plots, respectively, than in the control plants. Thus, the AMF plants showed higher main root biomass in both plots than the Control plants. The results of this study confirm that inoculation of C. microphyllum seedlings during germination confers a physiological advantage to these plants in field conditions after transplanting, regardless of water availability in the plot, even after two dry seasons. This can be a useful tool for recovering deforested areas in DTF.

TI  - Beyond opportunity costs: who bears the implementation costs of reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation?
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) in developing countries is based on the premise that conserving tropical forests is a cost-effective way to reduce carbon emissions and therefore can be fully funded by international actors with obligations or interests in reducing emissions. However, concerns have repeatedly been raised about whether stakeholders in REDD+ host countries will actually end up bearing the costs of REDD+. Most prior analyses of the costs of REDD+ have focused on the opportunity costs of foregone alternative uses of forest land. We draw on a pan-tropical study of 22 subnational REDD+ initiatives in five countries to explore patterns in implementation costs, including which types of organizations are involved and which are sharing the costs of implementing REDD+. We find that many organizations involved in the implementation of REDD+, particularly at the subnational level and in the public sector, are bearing implementation costs not covered by the budgets of the REDD+ initiatives. To sustain this level of cost-sharing, REDD+ must be designed to deliver local as well as global forest benefits.

AB  - Climate change mitigation mechanisms, such as REDD+, which aim at avoiding deforestation and forest degradation, require an accurate aboveground biomass (AGB) monitoring. In the present study, multi-temporal X-(TerraSAR-X) and L-band (ALOS PALSAR) SAR data and a multispectral RapidEye image were analyzed for their ability to estimate AGB in a tropical forested peatland area in Central Kalimantan on Borneo, Indonesia. Field inventory AGB data was used to calibrate regression models based on SAR backscatter values and spectral unmixed fractions of the RapidEye image. The independent validation indicated that the estimated AGB using optical data is more accurate (RMSE=44%) than the SAR estimated AGB (RMSE=82%). AGB derived from RapidEye data overestimates AGB on burned areas, but these estimations depict degradation through low impact selective logging. The SAR model estimated AGB accurately in lower biomass ranges and on burned scars.

TI  - Monitoring the structure of forest restoration plantations with a drone-lidar system
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB  - We are in an unprecedented moment for promoting forest restoration globally, with international and regional pledges to restore at least 350 million hectares by 2030. To achieve these ambitious goals, it is necessary to go beyond traditional plot-scale assessments and develop cost-effective technologies that can monitor the structure and function of restored forests at much broader scales. Lidar remote sensing in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms can be an agile and autonomous method for monitoring forest restoration projects, especially under conditions when information updates are frequently needed in relatively small areas or, when using an airplane borne lidar system may be not financially viable. Here, we explored the potential of an UAV-borne lidar system to assess the outcomes of a mixed-species restoration plantation experiment, designed to maximize aboveground biomass (AGB) accumulation. The experiment was established in Brazil's Atlantic Forest, with 20 native tree species, by combining two levels of planting density and two management levels, totaling four treatment combinations and one control (plots left over for natural regeneration). We analyzed three structural variables from lidar data (canopy height, gap fraction and leaf area index) and one from field inventory data (AGB). Structural differences between the treatments and the control plots were reliably distinguished by the UAV-borne lidar system. AGB was strongly correlated with canopy height, allowing us to elaborate a predictive equation to use the UAV-borne lidar system for monitoring structural features in other restoration plantations in the region. UAV-borne lidar systems showed enormous potential for monitoring relatively broad-scale (thousands of hectares) forest restoration projects, providing an important tool to aid decision making and accountability in forest landscape restoration.

TI  - Multi-Decadal Forest-Cover Dynamics in the Tropical Realm: Past Trends and Policy Insights for Forest Conservation in Dry Zone of Sri Lanka
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Forest-cover change has become an important topic in global biodiversity conservation in recent decades because of the high rates of forest loss in different parts of the world, especially in the tropical region. While human interventions are the major cause, natural disasters also contribute to forest cover changes. During the past decades, several studies have been conducted to address different aspects of forest cover changes (e.g., drivers of deforestation, degradation, interventions) in different parts of the world. In Sri Lanka, increasing rates of forest loss have been recorded during the last 100 years on a regional basis, especially in the dry zone. However, Sri Lanka needs detailed studies that employ contemporary data and robust analytical tools to understand the patterns of forest cover changes and their drivers. The dry zone of Sri Lanka encompasses 59% of the total land area of the country, ergo, the most extensive forest cover. Our study analyzed forest cover dynamics and its drivers between 1992 and 2019. Our specific objectives included (i) producing a forest cover map for 2019, (ii) analyzing the spatiotemporal patterns of forest cover changes from 1992 to 2019, and (iii) determining the main driving forces. Landsat 8 images were used to develop forest-cover maps for 2019, and the rest of the forest cover maps (1992, 1999, and 2010) were obtained from the Forest Department of Sri Lanka. In this study, we found that the dry zone had undergone rapid forest loss (246,958.4 ha) during the past 27 years, which accounts for 8.0% of the net forest cover changes. From 2010 to 2019, the rates of forest loss were high, and this can be associated with the rapid infrastructure development of the country. The findings of this study can be used as a proxy to reform current forest policies and enhance the forest sustainability of the study area.

TI  - Fragmented tropical forests lose mutualistic plant-animal interactions
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
AB  - Aim Forest fragmentation is among the principal causes of global biodiversity loss, yet how it affects mutualistic interactions between plants and animals at large spatial scale is poorly understood. In particular, tropical forest regeneration depends on animal-mediated seed dispersal, but the seed-dispersing animals face rapid decline due to forest fragmentation and defaunation. Here, we assess how fragmentation influences the pairwise interactions between 407 seed disperser and 1,424 tree species in a highly fragmented biodiversity hotspot. Location Atlantic Forest, South America. Methods We predicted interaction networks in 912 sites covering the entire biome by combining verified interaction data with co-occurrence probabilities obtained from a spatially explicit joint species distribution model. We identified keystone seed dispersers by computing a species-specific keystone index and by selecting those species belonging to the top 5% quantile. Results We show that forest fragmentation affects seed dispersal interactions negatively, and the decreased area of functionally connected forest, rather than increased edge effects, is the main driver behind the loss of interactions. Both the seed disperser availability for the local tree communities and in particular the proportion of interactions provided by keystone seed dispersers decline with increasing degree of fragmentation. Importantly, just 21 keystone species provided >40% of all interactions. The numbers of interactions provided by keystone and non-keystone species, however, were equally negatively affected by fragmentation, suggesting that seed dispersal interactions may not be rewired under strong fragmentation effects. Conclusions We highlight the importance of understanding the fragmentation-induced compositional shifts in seed disperser communities as they may lead to lagged and multiplicative effects on tree communities. Our results illustrate the utility of model-based prediction of interaction networks as well as model-based identification of keystone species as a tool for prioritizing conservation efforts. Similar modelling approaches could be applied to other threatened ecosystems and interaction types globally.

T2  - BIOSCIENCE JOURNAL
AB  - Incorporation of native areas to production systems induced changes in ecosystems, especially in tropical regions, due to inappropriate land use, resulting in the rapid loss of organic carbon. This study aimed to evaluate impact of soil management and land use on biomass and microbial activity, as well as soil organic carbon and its fractions in an Oxisol and Quartzipsamment in Cerrado. Management and land use systems in Quartzipsamment were native vegetation, crop-livestock integration, pasture, no-till 1 (soybean/Brachiaria) and two no-till 2 (corn/Brachiaria). In Oxisol the systems were native vegetation, crop-livestock integration, conventional tillage, no-till 3 (soybean/radish/corn radish) and no-till 4 (soybean/corn/sorghum/soybean). Both soils evaluated, integrated crop-livestock improved the microbial biomass levels and soil carbon pools. In Quartzipsamment, management and land use systems not increased microbial biomass carbon, urease activity, hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate and the carbon stock of the light fraction. In Oxisol, conventional tillage system decreased soil organic carbon and total carbon in the free light fraction soil. Furthermore, although it increased the organic carbon soil losses, the soil conservation systems enhanced the light fraction carbon in relation to native vegetation.

TI  - Spatial and temporal patterns of gap dominance by low-canopy lianas detected using EO-1 Hyperion and Landsat Thematic Mapper
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Woody lianas are critical to tropical forest dynamics because of their strong influence on forest regeneration, disturbance ecology, and biodiversity. Recent studies synthesizing plot data from the tropics indicate that lianas are increasing in both abundance and importance in tropical forests. Moreover, lianas exhibit competitive advantages over trees in elevated CO2 environments and under strong seasonal droughts, suggesting that lianas may be poised to increase not only in abundance but also in spatial distribution in response to changing climate. We used a combination of high-resolution color-infrared videography and hyperspectral imagery from EO-1 Hyperion to map low-lying lianas in Noel Kempff Mercado National Park (NKMNP) in the Bolivian Amazon. Evergreen liana forests comprise as much as 14% of the NKMNP landscape, and low-stature liana patches occupy 1.5% of these forests. We used change vector analysis (CVA) of dry season Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery from 1986 and 2000 to determine changes in liana-dominated patches over time and to assess whether those patches were regenerating to canopy forest. The spatial distribution of liana patches showed that patches were spatially aggregated and were preferentially located in proximity to waterways. The CVA results showed that most of the dense liana patches increased in brightness and greenness and decreased in wetness over the 14 years of the change analysis, while non-liana forest patches changed less and in more random directions. Persistent liana patches increased in area by an average of 59% over the time period. In comparison, large burned areas appeared to recover completely to canopy forest in the same time period. This suggests that the dense liana patches of NKMNP represent an alternative successional pathway characterized not by tree regeneration but rather by a stalled state of low-canopy liana dominance. This research supports hypotheses that liana forests can be a persistent rather than transitional component of tropical forests, and may remain so due to competitive advantages that lianas enjoy under changing climatic conditions.

TI  - Acai palm management disturbs seed rain and soil seed bank of an Amazonian estuarine forest
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
AB  - The exploitation of non-timber forest products has been proposed as a sustainable way to exploit tropical forests, but such an opportunity remains to be proved. Here, we examine the impact of intensive acai palm (Euterpe oleracea) management on the seed rain and soil seed bank in an estuarine forest landscape with a long history of forest management by locals in the Amazon region. Seed rain (100 80 cm(2) collectors) and soil seed bank (100 30 cm(2) samples) were monitored through a year across 20 forest stands, covering a gradient of acai stem density (50-3575 acai stems per ha). Seed rain and bank were dominated by acai seeds (85.5%-85.8%) and by excluding them, seed rain and bank were low density and species poor, capturing a tiny subset from the local (17.91%-19.40%) and landscape woody flora (11.82%-14.55%). Moreover, autochthonous and vertebrated-dispersed predominated as well as those from tree species considered useful by locals. Overall, acai stem density positively affected acai seed abundance in the seed rain and negatively affected seed pools in the bank in relation to abundance of seeds and vertebrated dispersed, while adult tree species richness and density and accessibility to forest stands were associated with more diversified seed pools. Thereby, forest stands are exposed to different levels of acai management (high vs. low intensity) supported taxonomically distinct seed pools. Our results suggest that acai intensification disturbs seed rain and soil seed bank with potential impacts on forest regeneration and the forest integrity standards required to consider acai fruit production as sustainable according to current legislation.

TI  - Ecological and social drivers of coffee pollination in Santander, Colombia
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Bees and other insects provide pollination services that are key to determining the fruit set on coffee plantations. These pollination services are influenced by local ecology as well as human factors, both social and economic. To better understand these different factors, we assessed their effect on pollinators and coffee pollination services in Santander, Colombia. We quantified the effect of key ecological drivers on pollinator community composition, such as the method of farm management (either conventional or organic) and the surrounding landscape composition, specifically the proximity to forest.
   We found that ambient levels of pollination services provided by the local pollinator fauna (open pollination) accounted for a 10.5 +/- 2.0% increase in final coffee fruit set, and that the various pollinators are affected differently by the differing factors. For example, our findings indicate that conventional farm management, using synthetic inputs, can promote pollinators, especially if they are in close proximity to natural forest fragments. This is particularly true for stingless bees. Honeybee visitation to coffee is also positively influenced by the conventional management of farms. Factors associated with greater numbers of stingless bees on farms include greater shade cover, lower tree densities, smaller numbers and types of trees in bloom, and younger coffee plantations. A forested landscape close to farms appears to enhance these factors, giving increased stability and resilience to the pollinating bees and insects. However we found that organic farms also support diverse pollinator communities, even if distant from forest fragments.
   The contribution of honeybees to pollination value (US$129.6/ha of coffee) is greater than that of stingless bees (US$16.5/ha of coffee). Since the method of farm management has a major impact on the numbers and types of pollinators attracted to farms, we have analysed the statistically significant social factors that influence farmers' decisions on whether to adopt organic or conventional practices. These include the availability of technology, the type of landowner (whether married couples or individual owners), the number of years of farmers' formal education, the role of institutions, membership of community organizations, farm size, coffee productivity and the number of coffee plots per farm. It is hoped that the use of our holistic approach, which combines investigation of the social as well as the ecological drivers of pollination, will help provide evidence to underpin the development of best practices for integrating the management of pollination into sustainable agricultural practices.

TI  - Opportunity costs of conserving a dry tropical forest under REDD plus : The case of the spiny dry forest in southwestern Madagascar
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD +) has been identified as a potentially cost-effective climate change mitigation strategy. The success of REDD + in preventing deforestation and degradation in dry forests will depend partly on whether financial incentives for forest conservation can cover smallholders' opportunity costs of forgone uses of the forest. We therefore compared the opportunity costs of the main forest use activities (slash-and-burn agriculture or charcoal production) with potential benefits from the sale of carbon credits under REDD + from a smallholder perspective for a case study in southwestern Madagascar. Calculations are based on an assessment of carbon stocks in the dry spiny forests as well as benefit and cost data from interviews with smallholders. To assess the risks and uncertainties associated with opportunity costs and the REDD + benefits, we used a Monte Carlo modeling approach. We compare net present values for opportunity costs and potential community profits from REDD + at discount rates of 5% and 20% over a project period of 25 years. Our results show that REDD + community profits can outweigh the profits from charcoal production and the profits from slash-and-burn agriculture in 54-57% of the cases, despite opportunity costs being highly variable for both land uses. Charcoal production in particular has low opportunity costs as smallholders only engage in this activity when no other sources of income are available. The case study shows that potential REDD + payments can provide sufficient financial incentives to preserve dry forests with low carbon stocks but relatively low opportunity costs of preservation.

TI  - Analysis of Land Cover Change Detection in Gozamin District, Ethiopia: From Remote Sensing and DPSIR Perspectives
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Land cover patterns in sub-Saharan Africa are rapidly changing. This study aims to quantify the land cover change and to identify its major determinants by using the Drivers, Pressures, State, Impact, Responses (DPSIR) framework in the Ethiopian Gozamin District over a period of 32 years (1986 to 2018). Satellite images of Landsat 5 (1986), Landsat 7 (2003), and Sentinel-2 (2018) and a supervised image classification methodology were used to assess the dynamics of land cover change. Land cover maps of the three dates, focus group discussions (FGDs), interviews, and farmers' lived experiences through a household survey were applied to identify the factors for changes based on the DPSIR framework. Results of the investigations revealed that during the last three decades the study area has undergone an extensive land cover change, primarily a shift from cropland and grassland into forests and built-up areas. Thus, quantitative land cover change detection between 1986 and 2018 revealed that cropland, grassland, and bare areas declined by 10.53%, 5.7%, and 2.49%. Forest, built-up, shrub/scattered vegetation, and water bodies expanded by 13.47%, 4.02%, 0.98%, and 0.25%. Household surveys and focus group discussions (FGDs) identified the population growth, the rural land tenure system, the overuse of land, the climate change, and the scarcity of grazing land as drivers of these land cover changes. Major impacts were rural to urban migration, population size change, scarcity of land, and decline in land productivity. The outputs from this study could be used to assure sustainability in resource utilization, proper land use planning, and proper decision-making by the concerned government authorities.

TI  - Effects of selective logging on tropical forest butterflies on Buru, Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. The butterfly fauna of lowland monsoon forest on Buru, Indonesia was compared in unlogged forest and forest that had been selectively logged 5 years previously.
   2. Seven variables relating to vegetation structure were measured in each habitat. Tree density and percentage cover of vegetation in the canopy and understorey were significantly higher, and vegetation cover 2 m above the ground was significantly lower, in unlogged forest. There were no differences between sites in the mean heights or girths of trees, but the ranges of both heights and girths were lower in logged forest, Percentage cover of vegetation at ground level was similar at the two sites.
   3. Species richness, abundance and evenness of butterflies and an index of taxonomic distinctiveness were ail significantly higher in unlogged forest. Two endemic species and a further four species with distributions restricted to Maluku Province were recorded only in unlogged forest.
   4. Species abundance data for butterflies at both sites fitted a log-series distribution. Data for unlogged forest also fitted a log-normal distribution, whereas those far logged forest did not. This indicated the presence of a more complex butterfly community in unlogged forest.
   5. These results indicate that the distributional pattern of species abundance of tropical butterflies may be used as an indicator of forest disturbance, and that selective logging of tropical forests in SE Asia may be associated with a significant decrease in biodiversity of butterflies, at least during the first 5 years of forest regeneration.

TI  - Vertical distribution of epiphytic bryophytes in an Indonesian rainforest
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - We studied species richness, composition and vertical distribution of epiphytic bryophytes in submontane rainforest of Central Sulawesi. Bryophytes were sampled on eight canopy trees and on eight trees in the forest understorey. Microclimate was measured at trunk bases and at crown bases. The total recorded number of 146 epiphytic bryophyte species is among the highest ever reported for tropical forests and underlines the importance of the Malesian region as a global biodiversity hotspot. Species composition differed significantly between understorey trees and canopy tree trunks on the one hand, and the forest canopy on the other. Fourty-five percent of the bryophyte species were restricted to canopy tree crowns, 12% to the understorey. Dendroid and fan-like species mainly occurred in the forest understorey whereas tufts were most species rich in the tree crowns. The findings reflect the different microclimatic regimes and substrates found in the understorey and in the forest canopy. The results indicate that assessments of the bryophyte diversity of tropical forests are inadequate when understorey trees and tree crowns are excluded.

TI  - Impacts of logging, hunting, and conservation on vocalizing biodiversity in Gabon
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Tropical forests support two-thirds of the world's biodiversity, contribute to global climate regulation, and support the culture and livelihoods of forest-dependent people. Much of extant tropical forest is subject to selective logging and hunting - extractive activities that potentially alter ecosystem function and species diversity. However, the collective impact of these threats, especially in the context of protected vs unprotected areas, is not fully understood. Here we assess how vocalizing biodiversity responds to logging and hunting, across the diel cycle, seasonally, and between protected and unprotected landscapes in Gabon. We compared soundscape saturation across 109 sites in national parks, Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified, and non-certified logging concessions. We estimated hunting pressure by quantifying gunshots and relative accessibility per site. Overall, we found that the soundscapes of FSC-certified concessions resembled national parks (selectively logged 20+ years ago) more so than non-certified concessions. We also found that never logged sites, part of a proposed community conserved area, had different soundscapes than all other categories, including national parks. Unlogged sites had higher saturation than logging concessions at dusk and dawn. Soundscapes and hunting pressure were highly variable across different concessions. We found that higher gunshot rates and recent logging were associated with lower soundscape saturation overall. Based on our findings, we recommend that (i) the very few never logged forests that remain (and are not yet protected) should be urgently withdrawn from selective logging, and (ii) FSC or other certification schemes should be promoted in Gabon, with an emphasis on sustainable hunting.

TI  - Quantification by allometric equations of carbon sequestered by Tectona grandis in different agroforestry systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
AB  - Non destructive methods for quantification of carbon sequestration in tropical trees are inadequately developed. We described a standardized method for estimating carbon stock in teak (Tectona grandis Linn. F.). We developed linear allometric equations using girth at breast height (GBH), height and age to quantify above ground biomass (AGB). We used AGB to estimate carbon stock for teak trees of different age groups (1.5, 3.5, 7.5, 13.5, 18.5 and 23.5 years). The regression equation with GBH, y = 3.174x -21.27, r(2)=0.898 (p < 0.01), was found precise and convenient due to the difficulty in determination of height and age in dense natural forests of teak. The equation was evaluated in teak agroforestry systems that included Triticum aestivum (wheat), Cicer arietinum (gram), Withania somnifera (ashwagandha), Avena fatua (wild oat) and Hordeum vulgare (barley) as agricultural crops established at Tropical Forest Research Institute, Jabalpur, M.P. (India). The annual carbon stock gain in teak in different agroforestry systems was in the order: teak-barley (60.47%) > teak-wheat (56.92%) > teak-wild oat (54.94%) > teak-gram (37.15%) > teak-ashwagandha (11.86%). The results from GBH-based regression equations provided satisfactory estimates of carbon stock in tropical trees.

TI  - Tropical countries may be willing to pay more to protect their forests
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Inadequate funding from developed countries has hampered international efforts to conserve biodiversity in tropical forests. We present two complementary research approaches that reveal a significant increase in public demand for conservation within tropical developing countries as those countries reach upper-middle-income (UMI) status. We highlight UMI tropical countries because they contain nearly four-fifths of tropical primary forests, which are rich in biodiversity and stored carbon. The first approach is a set of statistical analyses of various cross-country conservation indicators, which suggests that protective government policies have lagged behind the increase in public demand in these countries. The second approach is a case study from Malaysia, which reveals in a more integrated fashion the linkages from rising household income to increased household willingness to pay for conservation, nongovernmental organization activity, and delayed government action. Our findings suggest that domestic funding in UMI tropical countries can play a larger role in (i) closing the funding gap for tropical forest conservation, and (ii) paying for supplementary conservation actions linked to international payments for reduced greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in tropical countries.

TI  - Differential nutrient limitation and tree height control leaf physiology, supporting niche partitioning in tropical dipterocarp forests
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Revealing the mechanisms of environmental niche partitioning within lowland tropical forests is important for understanding the drivers of current species distributions and potential vulnerability to environmental change. Tropical forest structure and species composition change across edaphic gradients in Borneo over short distances. However, our understanding of how edaphic conditions affect tree physiology and whether these relationships drive niche partitioning within Bornean forests remains incomplete. This study evaluated how leaf physiological function changes with nutrient availability across a fine-scale edaphic gradient and whether these relationships vary according to tree height. Furthermore, we tested whether intraspecific leaf trait variation allows generalist species to populate a wider range of environments. We measured leaf traits of 218 trees ranging in height from 4 to 66 m from 13 dipterocarp species within four tropical forest types (alluvial, mudstone, sandstone and kerangas) occurring along an <5 km edaphic gradient in North Borneo. The traits measured included saturating photosynthesis (A(sat)), maximum photosynthetic capacity (V-cmax), leaf dark respiration (R-leaf), leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf thickness, minimum stomatal conductance (g(dark)) and leaf nutrient concentrations (N, P, Ca, K and Mg). Across all species, leaf traits varied consistently in response to soil nutrient availability across forest types except R-leaf_mass, [Mg](leaf) and [Ca](leaf). Changes in photosynthesis and respiration rates were related to different leaf nutrients across forest types, with greater nutrient-use efficiency in more nutrient-poor environments. Generalist species partially or fully compensated reductions in mass-based photosynthesis through increasing LMA in more nutrient-poor environments. Leaf traits also varied with tree height, except V-cmax_mass, but only in response to height-related modifications of leaf morphology (LMA and leaf thickness). These height-trait relationships did not vary across the edaphic gradient, except for A(sat), [N](leaf), [P](leaf) and [K](leaf). Our results highlight that modification of leaf physiological function and morphology act as important adaptations for Bornean dipterocarps in response to edaphic and vertical environmental gradients. Meanwhile, multiple nutrients appear to contribute to niche partitioning and could drive species distributions and high biodiversity within Bornean forest landscapes.

TI  - Restoring a dry tropical forest through assisted natural regeneration: enhancing tree diversity, structure, and carbon stock
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
AB  - Deforestation is a key factor in global climate change, severely impacting ecosystem services. Effective implementation of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) +) initiatives is essential for mitigating this change. Reforestation is a sustainable way to mitigate deforestation effects. We studied the impact of assisted natural regeneration (ANR) on restoring dry forest land, increasing biodiversity, structure, and carbon stock. Reforestation units were established at a multiple row planting system in a dry tropic region. We selected 63 plots, each 20 m x 20 m, categorized into multiple row-mixed plantation (MRMP) and multiple row-unmixed plantation (MRUP). We measured tree height and diameter at breast height (DBH) and evaluated biodiversity indices, including the Shannon-Weiner Index (SWI), species richness, evenness, and Important Value Index (IVI). Carbon stock was estimated using allometric equations. We identified 931 individual trees representing 27 species, 24 genera, and 14 families. MRMP showed significantly higher biodiversity, species richness, and evenness than MRUP. Terminalia arjuna was the most dominant species (IVI=124.45), =124.45), followed by Khaya senegalensis (53.84). Survival rates exceeded 90 % for T. arjuna, K. senegalensis, Madhuca longifolia, , and Pongamia pinnata (p<0.001). < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in tree DBH, tree height, tree density, basal area, and carbon stock among the plantation categories. The species Albizia saman exhibited a high diameter increment rate (4.07 +/- 1.55 cm/year), followed by K. senegalensis (3.83 +/- 0.43 cm/year). A mean value of 5.63 +/- 1.13 MgC/ha of carbon stock was stored, while 20.66 +/- 4.13 Mg/ha of atmospheric CO2 2 was sequestered. The results highlight that promoting mixed tree species in multiple rows to enhance biodiversity and optimize carbon regulation. This technique should be popularized to restore the dry forest landscape across the region.

TI  - Forest landscape dynamics after intentional large-scale fires in western Patagonia reveal unusual temperate forest recovery trends
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB  - ContextWestern Chilean Patagonia is an isolated temperate region with an important proportion of intact forest landscapes (IFL) that was subjected to large-scale fires over 60 years ago. However, there is no empirical evaluation of the land cover dynamics to establish the forest loss and recovery, and the effect on the landscape structure and function, and remnant IFL following the fires.ObjectivesThe present study addressed the following questions: (1) What have been the main trends of the land cover dynamics between 1984 and 2018 following earlier fires, and how have these trends shaped the spatial patterns and potential carbon stock of forests in western Patagonia? (2) What proportion of forest landscape remains intact following fires in this region?MethodsWe selected the Coyhaique Province (1,231,910 ha) in western Chilean Patagonia as the study area. Land cover maps for three dates (1984, 2000, 2018) were used to evaluate landscape dynamics after fires. A map of persistence and change occurrence was made to estimate the IFL area over the 1984-2018 period. Landscape metrics were used to assess landscape structure change, and potential carbon stock was estimated based on a literature review.ResultsFollowing fires, the main land cover changes between 1984 and 2018 were loss of similar to 32,600 ha of old-growth forest and a recovery of similar to 69,000 ha of second-growth forest. The increase in second-growth forest area mainly resulted from loss of agricultural cover (similar to 41% of the area). Despite these changes, similar to 61% of the area could potentially remain as IFL after fires. Over the 1984-2018 period, a slight increase in fragmentation of old-growth forest, and a decline in second-growth forest were observed. Coyhaique Province experienced a slight increase (3.6%) in overall potential carbon stock, likely as a result of second-growth forest recovery.ConclusionsOur study provides the first evidence of the western Patagonia landscape state after more than six decades since the large-scale fires. The results provide baseline information on landscape structure and function that could help to make conservation and forest management decisions on specific territory areas.

The present study aimed to assess (i) potential of tree-bamboo-medicinal herb mixed plantation founded on the concept of adaptive co-management in restoration of degraded community forest in a temperate village of Indian Himalaya and (ii) persistence of offer of local people to voluntarily maintain and expand the trial after its economic benefit/cost ratio became >1.0. Biodiversity, carbon stock and economic benefits were assessed in the restored forest 1, 3 and 10 years after 7-year-long-funding phase (i.e., 8, 10 and 20 years after initial planting in 1991), and other land uses in the village landscape. Significant economic loss occurred from gregarious flowering induced mass mortality of bamboo in the 2nd year after funding phase but it was outweighed by the gain from walnut fruiting. People maintained recovery by transplanting Nepalese Alder (Alnus nepalensis) in gaps. The 20-year-old restored forest land had 17% of aboveground and 75% of belowground carbon stocks, and 39% of flowering species present in the intact forest. Restored forest had only four of the eight Near-threatened/Threatened species present in intact forest. Further, intact forest was monetarily the most efficient land use despite absence of payments for its ecosystem services. People did not expand the trial or medicinal plant cultivation in farms induced by it. They abandoned cropping in 39% farm area and leased 24% abandoned area to a company. Flowering plant species richness and carbon stocks changed at the ecosystem scale but not at the village landscape scale. Emission from agricultural abandonment nullified carbon sequestration by forest restoration. Community forest restoration should render both material/monetary and non-material/non-monetary benefits to people. Cultural landscapes should be taken as spatial units for ecosystem restoration planning, monitoring and evaluation.

TI  - Landscape composition is more important than local vegetation structure for understory birds in cocoa agroforestry systems
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Biodiversity-friendly agricultural systems allow the maintenance of native species even in highly fragmented landscapes by providing corridors to species dispersion and offering supplementary resources for animal populations. In the tropical region, cocoa agroforestry systems are of great importance for biodiversity conservation as they maintain part of the native vegetation, and therefore can be used by the local fauna. In this system, understory of native forests is replaced by cocoa trees, which are shaded by large old-growth trees. However, the persistence of native species in cocoa agroforests depends on local vegetation characteristics but also the landscape structure in which these systems are located. Here, we investigated the influence of landscape composition (i.e. amount of forest cover, cocoa agroforestry and cattle pasture) and local vegetation structure (i.e. number of native and cocoa trees, basal area of native trees and canopy closure) on understory birds in 18 cocoa agroforestry systems located in three regions in the Brazilian Atlantic forest, presenting distinct land use contexts. Specifically, we assessed the effects of these landscape and local features in predicting richness and abundance patterns of the entire community, and also in distinct ecological groups, such as forest-dependent and non-forestdependent birds, and insectivores, frugivores, and omnivores. Using generalized linear models and Akaike information criterion, we observed lower species richness of complete community, non-forest and omnivorous birds in the most deforested region. Also, our findings demonstrated that cocoa agroforests integrated in more forested landscapes harbor greater richness and abundance of frugivorous birds. Conversely, the increase in cattle pasture amount at the landscape had a harsh effect on all bird groups evaluated. Regarding local vegetation, we observed that the increase of canopy closure leads to greater abundance of insectivorous birds in cocoa agmforestry systems. Similarly, abundance of non-forest species increased in agroforests with higher number of cocoa trees. Our study demonstrated that cocoa agroforestry systems can provide complementary habitats for many species, including forest birds, and therefore can mitigate the effects of habitat loss. However, this key benefit for bird conservation will be more effective when these agmforestry systems are located in more forested landscapes, with low amount of cattle pastures. Our findings therefore reinforce the alarming need to maintain and recover landscape-scale forest amount to ensure species persistence of birds in anthmpogenic landscapes, even in those comprising biodiversity-friendly land uses such as cocoa agmforestry systems.

TI  - Overstory structure and soil nutrients effect on plant diversity in unmanaged moist tropical forest
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Forests with intensive management past are kept unmanaged to restore diversity and ecosystem functioning. Before perpetuating abandonment after protracted restitution, understanding its effect on forest vegetation is desirable. We studied plant diversity and its relation with environmental variables and stand structure in northern Indian unmanaged tropical moist deciduous forest. We hypothesized that post-abandonment species richness would have increased, and the structure of contemporary forest would be heterogeneous. Vegetation structure, composition, and diversity were recorded, in forty 0.1 ha plots selected randomly in four forest ranges. Three soil samples per 0.1 ha were assessed for physicochemistry, fine sand, and clay mineralogy. Contemporary forest had less species richness than pre-abandonment reference period. Fourteen species were recorded as either seedling or sapling, suggesting reappearance or immigration. For most species, regeneration was either absent or impaired. Ordination and multiple regression results showed that exchangeable base cations and phosphorous affected maximum tree diversity and structure variables. Significant correlations between soil moisture and temperature, and shrub layer was observed, besides tree layer correspondence with shrub richness, suggesting that dense overstory resulting from abandonment through its effect on soil conditions, is responsible for dense shrub layer. Herb layer diversity was negatively associated with tree layer and shrub overgrowth (i,e. Mallotus spp.). Protracted abandonment may not reinforce species richness and heterogeneity; perhaps result in high tree and shrub density in moist deciduous forests, which can impede immigrating or reappearing plant species establishment. This can be overcome by density/basal area reduction strategies, albeit for both tree and shrub layer. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - National forest cover change in Congo Basin: deforestation, reforestation, degradation and regeneration for the years 1990, 2000 and 2005
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - This research refers to an object-based automatic method combined with a national expert validation to produce regional and national forest cover change statistics over Congo Basin. A total of 547 sampling sites systematically distributed over the whole humid forest domain are required to cover the six Central African countries containing tropical moist forest. High resolution imagery is used to accurately estimate not only deforestation and reforestation but also degradation and regeneration. The overall method consists of four steps: (i) image automatic preprocessing and preinterpretation, (ii) interpretation by national expert, (iii) statistic computation and (iv) accuracy assessment. The annual rate of net deforestation in Congo Basin is estimated to 0.09% between 1990 and 2000 and of net degradation to 0.05%. Between 2000 and 2005, this unique exercise estimates annual net deforestation to 0.17% and annual net degradation to 0.09%. An accuracy assessment reveals that 92.7% of tree cover (TC) classes agree with independent expert interpretation. In the discussion, we underline the direct causes and the drivers of deforestation. Population density, small-scale agriculture, fuelwood collection and forest's accessibility are closely linked to deforestation, whereas timber extraction has no major impact on the reduction in the canopy cover. The analysis also shows the efficiency of protected areas to reduce deforestation. These results are expected to contribute to the discussion on the reduction in CO2 emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) and serve as reference for the period.

TI  - Tree biomass, carbon stock characteristics and ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) diversity in the Uzungwa Scarp Forest Nature Reserve, Tanzania
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Reducing carbon emission from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) has drawn attention and remain one of the main options for climate change mitigation. However, the extent to which conservation for carbon may enhance biodiversity conservation in both disturbed and relatively undisturbed (control) environment remain unclear in most forest types. The extent to which anthropogenic disturbances affect carbon stock and ground beetle diversity is also far from clear. This paper addressed these knowledge gaps using data based on ground beetles, carbon stock in live trees and tree species sampled in Uzungwa Scarp Nature Forest Reserve (USNFR). All trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 5 cm were measured for height and DBH in twelve clusters of 1 ha in size. In the same clusters, ground beetles were sampled using pitfall traps, active night search and active day search. The species diversity of ground beetles differed significantly between control sites and disturbed sites (p < 0.05). The mean total biomass and carbon stock in live trees were high in disturbed sites (323.72 t/ha) when compared to control sites (289.72 t/ha) but the difference was not statistically significant (U = 14, p > 0.05). Carbon in live trees and ground beetle diversity showed a weak positive correlation, while richness and abundance showed weak negative in control sites. Results show that REDD+ related activities in a tropical forest may enhance ground beetle diversity and carbon stock if ground beetles conservation is explicitly taken into account. Thus forest conservation planning that pursues both carbon storage and ground-dwelling invertebrate diversity is recommended.

TI  - A comprehensive experimental assessment of glyphosate ecological impacts in riparian forest restoration
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Competition with invasive grasses is one of the most important drivers of tree planting failures, especially in tropical forests. A widely disseminated weeding approach has been glyphosate spraying, the most used herbicide globally in forestry and ecosystem restoration. However, glyphosate use in restoration is highly controversial and requires further studies to elucidate its effects on restoration processes and the environment. We evaluated the use of glyphosate in riparian forest restoration and its impacts on tree planting costs, weed control efficiency, planted seedling performance, herbaceous and woody species regeneration, soil bacteria, and environmental contamination, using mowing treatments as a reference and based on a controlled experiment established in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Glyphosate spraying reduced by one-half and one-third the accumulated aboveground biomass of, respectively, weeds in general and of the invasive grass Urochloa decumbens compared to mowing treatments, and it reduced the cost by half. The performance of planted tree seedlings was markedly favored by glyphosate spraying compared to mowing treatments, as expressed by improved seedling height (similar to twice higher), crown area (similar to 5x higher), and basal area (similar to 5x higher); the regeneration of both native woody and ruderal herbaceous plants were also enhanced. Neither glyphosate nor its metabolite Aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) residues were detected in either water runoff or soil samples, but they were found at relatively high concentrations in the runoff sediments (from 1.32 to 24.75 mg/kg for glyphosate and from 1.75 to 76.13 mg/kg for AMPA). Soil bacteria communities differed before and after glyphosate spraying in comparison to mowing plots (without glyphosate). Glyphosate spraying was far more cost effective than mowing for controlling U. decumbens and greatly improved the performance of planted tree seedlings and natural regeneration, while not leaving residues in soil and water. However, the changes in the structure of bacterial communities and high concentration of glyphosate and AMPA residues in runoff sediments highlight the need for caution when using this herbicide in riparian buffers. We present alternatives for reducing glyphosate use and minimizing its risks in tree planting initiatives.

TI  - Extraction of remote sensing-based forest management units in tropical forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - As a spatial source of forest data, the forest stand is the basic unit for forest management and planning. Computerized segmentation of a diverse range of remote sensing material has been studied for delineating stands in various forest types, but is relatively rare under tropical conditions. In line with REDD+, which advocates sustainable forest management in tropical developing countries, we report here on the delineation of forest stands in Laos using data from Airborne Laser Scanning, Airborne CIR and ALOS AVNIR-2. Rather than using the spectral layers alone, the segmentation was applied to wall-to-wall maps of predicted values from empirical models that retrieve forest stem volume and basal area. The homogeneity of 96 sets of segmentation categorized according to the hierarchical mean sizes of the segments was evaluated quantitatively in terms of the AIC(var) index and qualitatively by eye. The results show that the quality and performance of the empirical models are duly reflected in the quality and performance of the segmentation, and that the most competitive delineations are provided by models that involve ALS. Finally, the future prospects for using this empirical model-based segmentation approach to detect and quantify deforestation, or even forest degradation, and thereby to provide further support for the development of REDD methodology, are discussed.

TI  - Confronting sustainable intensification with uncertainty and extreme values on smallholder tropical farms
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
AB  - Sustainable intensification of agricultural lands might reconcile the conservation of tropical forest with food production, but in-depth assessments considering uncertainty and extreme values are missing. Uncertainty prohibits mapping probabilities to potential future states or ranking these states in terms of their likelihood. This in turn hampers the assessment of possible decision outcomes. Here, we use simulations to investigate how uncertainty may influence the social acceptability of alternative land-use strategies to halt tropical deforestation (including sustainable intensification), based on indicators representing farmer satisfaction. The results show how extreme values (worst values) for indicators of farmer satisfaction may undermine the adoption of sustainable intensification. We demonstrate that a pure forest conservation strategy leads to lower food production, but outperforms a sustainable intensification strategy that maintains food security. Pure forest conservation performed better, i.e., could secure higher farmer satisfaction, than sustainable intensification across a range of indicator groups. This suggests strong barriers to achieving sustainable intensification. Using agricultural subsidies breaks the dominance of pure forest conservation by enhancing the economic returns of sustainable intensification. We discuss the importance of access to labor and farmers' preferences for the use of already cleared lands, which achieved the worst values under sustainable intensification and conclude that any assessment of land-use strategies requires careful consideration of uncertainty and extreme values.

TI  - Mixed-species tree plantings enhance structural complexity in oil palm plantations
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Conversion of structurally complex rainforests into simplified oil palm monocultures leads to dramatic losses of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. To alleviate negative ecological impacts, enrichment with native tree species may rapidly restore structural complexity in existing oil palm plantations. However, the mechanisms underlying the recovery of structural complexity in mixed-species tree plantings remain poorly understood. We measured structural complexity from terrestrial laser scanning in a biodiversity enrichment experiment with multiple tree species planted in an oil palm monoculture, forming agroforestry plots of varying tree species diversity and plot size. We find that three years after tree planting, structural complexity in oil palm increased by one third, representing 25% of the increase needed to restore the structural complexity of tropical forests. Changes in structural complexity were associated with denser and more complex filling of three-dimensional space, whereas vertical stratification was mainly influenced by oil palm. Furthermore, structural complexity increased with tree species diversity in the agroforestry plots. This relationship was mainly due the presence of well-performing species that contributed to higher levels of structural complexity. However, interactions among multiple species independently from the species identity were also detected. Finally, increasing plot size had a positive effect on a scale-independent measure of structural complexity. Our results provide evidence that planting multiple tree species in large agroforestry plots is a suitable strategy to rapidly enhance structural complexity in oil palm plantations.

TI  - A 40-year evaluation of drivers of African rainforest change
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Background Tropical forests are repositories of much of the world's biodiversity and are critical for mitigation of climate change. Yet, the drivers of forest dynamics are poorly understood. This is in large part due to the lack of long-term data on forest change and changes in drivers. Methodology We quantify changes in tree abundance, diversity, and stand structure along transects first enumerated in 1978 and resampled 2019 in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We tested five predictions. First, based on the purported role of seed dispersal and herbivory and our quantification of changes in the abundance of frugivores and herbivores, we tested two predictions of how faunal change could have influenced forest composition. Second, based on an evaluation of life history strategies, we tested two predictions concerning how the forest could have changed following disturbance that happened prior to written history. Finally, based on a 50-year climate record, we evaluate the possible influence of climate change on forest dynamics. Results More trees were present on the assessed transects in 2019 (508) than in 1978 (436), species richness remained similar, but diversity declined as the number of dominant species increased. Rainfall increased by only 3 mm over the 50 years but this had not significant effect on forest changes measured here. Annual average monthly maximum temperature increased significantly by 1.05 degrees C over 50 years. The abundance of frugivorous and folivorous primates and elephants increased over the 50 years of monitoring. Neither the prediction that an increase in abundance of seed dispersing frugivores increases the abundance of their preferred fruiting tree species, nor that as an increase in folivore abundance causes a decline in their preferred species were supported. As predicted, light-demanding species decreased in abundance while shade-tolerant species increased as expected from Kibale being disturbed prior to historical records. Finally, while temperature increased over the 50 years, we found no means to predict a priori how individual species would respond. Conclusions Our study revealed subtle changes in the tree community over 40 years, sizable increases in primate numbers, a substantial increase in the elephant population and an increase in local temperature. Yet, a clear picture of what set of interactions impact the change in the tree community remains elusive. Our data on tree life-history strategies and frugivore/herbivore foraging preferences suggest that trees species are under opposing pressures.

TI  - Slash-and-Burn Practices Decrease Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi Abundance in Soil and the Roots of Didierea madagascariensis in the Dry Tropical Forest of Madagascar
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
AB  - Deforestation and the use of fire to clear land have drastic effects on ecosystem functioning and compromise essential ecosystem services, especially in low-income tropical countries such as Madagascar. We evaluated the effects of local slash-and-burn practices on soil nutrients and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi abundance in a southwestern Madagascar forest. Nine sampling plot pairs were established along the border of a reserve within the Fiherenana-Manombo (pk-32) complex, where soil and seedling root samples of the endemic tree Didierea madagascariensis were taken. We analysed soil extractable PO43-, NH4+, and NO3- as well as total soil carbon and nitrogen. We analysed AM fungal abundance in soil and roots through fatty acid marker analysis (NLFA and PLFA 16:1 omega 5), spore extraction, and root staining. Slash-and-burn caused an increase in pH and doubled the plant available nutrients (from 7.4 to 13.1 mu g PO43- g(-1) and from 6.9 to 13.2 mu g NO3- g(-1)). Total C and total N increased in deforested soil, from 0.6% to 0.84% and from 0.06% to 0.08%, respectively. There was a significant decline in AM fungi abundance in soil, with a decrease in soil NLFA 16:1 omega 5 from 0.2 to 0.12 nmol/g. AM fungi abundance in D. madagascariensis roots was also negatively affected and colonization decreased from 27.7% to 16.9% and NLFA 16:1 omega 5 decreased from 75.7 to 19 nmol/g. Together with hyphal network disruption, increased nutrient availability caused by burning is proposed as an explanation behind AM decline in soil and roots of D. madagascariensis. This is the first study to report the effects of slash-and-burn on AM symbiosis in Madagascar's dry forests, with likely implications for other tropical and subtropical dryland forests worldwide where slash-and-burn is practiced.

TI  - Tamm Review: Re-imagining forestry and wood business: pathways to rural development, poverty alleviation and climate change mitigation in the tropics
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Millions of people are dependent on tropical forests for livelihood. However, their dependence on meagre incomes from nontimber forest products (NTFPs) and payment for ecosystem services (PES) are leading to continuing poverty. It is doubtful if the program, Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD + ) has yet achieved much in its primary goal of forest conservation, and the chance of it helping to alleviate rural poverty is slim. Forest conservation per se hardly creates economic opportunities, beyond survival, for rural people. Our efforts for conserving forests and their biodiversity will remain less effective as long as there are so many enclaves of trenchant poverty within and around them in the landscapes and we continue to by-pass practical routes to poverty alleviation. Poverty can be alleviated only if local actions spur economic development in which local communities have a rightful and fair share and can earn rewards for their entrepreneurships.
   Wood is a renewable, recyclable, versatile and sustainable natural resource. The demands for wood products are rising in developing countries, as their economies grow. They also face endemic wood deficits. This provides opportunities to pro-actively develop commercial forestry as a path to rural development and poverty alleviation. That would also assist national climate change mitigation measures, because forests sequester carbon, wood products are largely carbon positive and timber- based options are on hand to substitute for high emission materials such as concrete, steel and aluminium used to build our living environments.
   To move along this path, the businesses of tree growing by small-growers and local value adding should be strengthened, catalysing the entrepreneurial spirits of local people. Central to this is the need to put in place strategies to improve the productivity of and value from small scale enterprises; yet there is a serious lack of research and application to serve this key need. Among other constraints faced by small-growers include, lack of transparent and legal rights to land ownership in several countries, layers of bureaucratic regulations and the current international forest certification systems which are cumbersome and unaffordable for small-growers. Actions are possible and needed for simplifying or removing road blocks on all these fronts, along with, importantly, the development of markets for diverse products. Growth of the forestry sector as an engine for rural development warrants far greater recognition and investment than has been the case so far. We need to reimagine and strengthen the role of forestry including commercial wood business - green growth - as an effective path to rural development and poverty alleviation.

TI  - Synthesizing Global and Local Datasets to Estimate Jurisdictional Forest Carbon Fluxes in Berau, Indonesia
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   Forest conservation efforts are increasingly being implemented at the scale of sub-national jurisdictions in order to mitigate global climate change and provide other ecosystem services. We see an urgent need for robust estimates of historic forest carbon emissions at this scale, as the basis for credible measures of climate and other benefits achieved. Despite the arrival of a new generation of global datasets on forest area change and biomass, confusion remains about how to produce credible jurisdictional estimates of forest emissions. We demonstrate a method for estimating the relevant historic forest carbon fluxes within the Regency of Berau in eastern Borneo, Indonesia. Our method integrates best available global and local datasets, and includes a comprehensive analysis of uncertainty at the regency scale.
   Principal Findings and Significance
   We find that Berau generated 8.91 +/- 1.99 million tonnes of net CO2 emissions per year during 2000-2010. Berau is an early frontier landscape where gross emissions are 12 times higher than gross sequestration. Yet most (85%) of Berau's original forests are still standing. The majority of net emissions were due to conversion of native forests to unspecified agriculture (43% of total), oil palm (28%), and fiber plantations (9%). Most of the remainder was due to legal commercial selective logging (17%). Our overall uncertainty estimate offers an independent basis for assessing three other estimates for Berau. Two other estimates were above the upper end of our uncertainty range. We emphasize the importance of including an uncertainty range for all parameters of the emissions equation to generate a comprehensive uncertainty estimate-which has not been done before. We believe comprehensive estimates of carbon flux uncertainty are increasingly important as national and international institutions are challenged with comparing alternative estimates and identifying a credible range of historic emissions values.

To assess the impact of such forest disturbance on microbial diversity, we investigated the diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in the rich forests of Karbi Anglong hills of Assam, India. Three forest types viz. undisturbed forests (UF), slash-and-burn field (SBF) and monoculture forest (MF) were selected. A total of 21 isolates of AMF belonging to 4 genera were extracted and identified from rhizospheric soil. 'Species forming glomoid spores' comprised Glomus sensu lato, Rhizophagus and Claroideoglomus were the dominant genera in all the three sites. Spore density was highest in UF and lowest in MF. Shannon-Wiener index of diversity and Simpson's diversity index were almost similar in UF and SBF. Our results show that natural undisturbed forest and slash-and-burn field contained similar and a high AMF diversity compared to monoculture forest. The AMF diversity is not significantly affected by the slashand- burn agricultural land use practices practised by the local tribes and, therefore, could be a component of a tropical forest ` conservation-agriculture matrix'.

TI  - Wet and dry tropical forests show opposite successional pathways in wood density but converge over time
T2  - NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
AB  - Tropical forests are converted at an alarming rate for agricultural use and pastureland, but also regrow naturally through secondary succession. For successful forest restoration, it is essential to understand the mechanisms of secondary succession. These mechanisms may vary across forest types, but analyses across broad spatial scales are lacking. Here, we analyse forest recovery using 1,403 plots that differ in age since agricultural abandonment from 50 sites across the Neotropics. We analyse changes in community composition using species-specific stem wood density (WD), which is a key trait for plant growth, survival and forest carbon storage. In wet forest, succession proceeds from low towards high community WD (acquisitive towards conservative trait values), in line with standard successional theory. However, in dry forest, succession proceeds from high towards low community WD (conservative towards acquisitive trait values), probably because high WD reflects drought tolerance in harsh early successional environments. Dry season intensity drives WD recovery by influencing the start and trajectory of succession, resulting in convergence of the community WD over time as vegetation cover builds up. These ecological insights can be used to improve species selection for reforestation. Reforestation species selected to establish a first protective canopy layer should, among other criteria, ideally have a similar WD to the early successional communities that dominate under the prevailing macroclimatic conditions.

TI  - Interactive effects between vegetation structure and soil fertility on tropical ground-dwelling arthropod assemblages
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - The development of forests undergoing restoration determines the structure of the vegetation, influencing ground-dwelling arthropod composition. Soil fertility can interact with vegetation structure, influencing the diversity and composition of arthropod assemblages through bottom-up effects on developing forests. We evaluated if soil fertility (here defined by the attributes directly related to macronutrient availability) and the vegetation structure in three adjacent areas from different land-use/cover categories (abandoned pasture, riparian forest undergoing restoration, and remnant riparian forest) influences ground-dwelling arthropod assemblages. These areas were subject to a gradient of soil fertility due to the presence of a corral that resulted in a local increase of soil nutrients in the three areas, enabling to evaluate the interaction between soil fertility and vegetation structure. We hypothesized that ground-dwelling arthropod assemblages have lower diversity in pasture, intermediate in forest undergoing restoration and higher diversity in the remnant forest. Furthermore, we expected that increasing soil fertility would have a positive effect in these assemblages through bottom-up effects. Environmental conditions were characterized by vegetation structure and soil chemical attributes variables, whereas arthropods were sampled with pitfalls and identified to morphospecies. Diversity indicators responded differentially to the studied effects. Abundances decreased with soil fertility, and were higher in the forest undergoing restoration, followed by pasture and remnant forest. Species richness also varied among categories, following the same pattern as abundances. On the other hand, diversity indices indicated an interaction between soil fertility and land use category, with larger effects of soil fertility on diversity in the more simplified habitats (pasture and forest undergoing restoration), whereas no bottom-up effects were recorded in the remnant forest; species evenness increased with soil fertility in all studied areas. A redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that both vegetation structure and soil attributes significantly influenced arthropod composition. Arthropod assemblages in areas undergoing restoration with higher soil fertility and low grass cover were more similar to assemblages in remnant forest when compared to areas with low soil fertility, independently of the vegetation structure, indicating an interaction between these two effects. Therefore, ground-dwelling arthropod assemblages responded both to increasing vegetation complexity resulting from the different land use/cover categories, and to increasing soil fertility, so that they are effective indicators to evaluate the recovery of ecosystems in forest restoration projects and to determine the importance of soil fertility in this process.

TI  - Exploring the role of smallholder perceptions in shaping land-use decisions in a tropical agro-forest frontier in southern Mexico
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB  - Conversion of tropical forests into agricultural lands is increasing at a rapid pace. Smallholders are responsible for most of the world's agricultural production, and thus are important land-use decision-makers and land-use change actors. In agro-forest frontiers, land-use changes are dynamic and short-term, and highly influenced by different social-ecological factors. We employed the Photovoice methodology to assess how the perceptions of 20 smallholder families about what they most value in their daily lives, influence farm land-use decisions in two villages in southern Mexico. Results indicate that what farmers perceive as the most valued in their daily lives are the household (including family and food) and the farm. Similar perceptions sometimes result in similar farm land-use composition (land-use type and proportion) decisions (agriculture, reforestation), but sometimes not (pasture, forest). Positive and negative perceptions about oil palm highly influence whether this land-use is adopted or not. In contrast, positive perceptions about rubber do not always translate in this crop being planted. We conclude that perceptions play an important role in smallholder land-use decisions. However, perceptions are influenced and operate along other factors at multiple levels, including survival motivations, culture, economic considerations, markets, farm size, institutional programs, local ecological knowledge, ecosystem services, and risk assessment. We suggest that smallholder perceptions should be taken into account as part of the set of social-ecological factors driving land-use decisions. Involving farmers in the co-design of land-use policies, planning, and rural development initiatives that address their perceptions, values, and livelihood needs will improve the effectiveness of such policies.

TI  - Supporting forest conservation through community-based land use planning and participatory GIS - lessons from Crocker Range Park, Malaysian Borneo
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
AB  - In tropical regions, expanding human activities have become increasingly threatening to the ecological integrity of protected areas. Shifting cultivation and other agricultural activities around the protected areas by rural communities often lead to increased carbon emissions, wildlife habitat destruction and increasing hunting pressure. Land use planning, with the participation of local communities in the buffer zones, is being considered to strengthen the implementation of the Man and the Biosphere Program at Crocker Range Park, Sabah, Malaysia. As part of the European Union's 'Tackling Climate Change Through Sustainable Forest Management and Community Development' program, we emphasized the participatory geographic information systems (PGIS) approach to support village-scale land use planning that considers the needs of multiple stakeholders in the community. The PGIS was applied within a multi-criteria framework to determine the location of a potential community conservation area (CCA) and to plan future land use activities in the village. Key informant interviews were followed by a participatory mapping workshop, attended by various stakeholders and experts, which was convened to discuss and elicit local knowledge to generate the environmental and resource indicators for determining potential land use activities within the village (e.g., agriculture, tourism and recreation, and forest restoration). Based on the discussions and spatial analyses, a land use zoning map with a potential CCA was presented at a follow-up land use decision making workshop. The villagers and external stakeholders reached a consensus on the land use zoning; leading to the designation process of the CCA. The PGIS-based land use planning has effectively supported the community forest conservation and is potentially applicable to other Southeast Asia regions with similar environmental and socio-economic settings.

TI  - Understanding landscape and plot-scale habitat utilisation by Malayan sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) in degraded lowland forest
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Malayan sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) is a forest-dependent species globally threatened by loss of suitable habitat and hunting. Understanding how sun bears utilise habitat in more degraded landscapes is increasingly important for the effective conservation of the species. We studied how landscape and plot attributes affect sun bear habitat use along a gradient of logging disturbance in a lowland forest site of Sumatra. We conducted surveys of bear claw marks to indicate sun bear habitat use at plot and landscape scales, and inform forest restoration strategies that benefit the conservation management of the species. We recorded 12 habitat features and the presence/absence of claw marks in 262 plots in four different habitat types. We reduced the number of habitat variables using Principal Components Analysis (PCA), resulting in four derived habitat factors. We used these factors in a Discriminant Analysis to refine habitat classifications of plots, and modelled presence/absence of claw marks using the PCA factors in a binary logistic regression. We inventoried tree species in a subset of randomly selected plots with claw marks alongside paired control plots with no claw marks. We compared tree community compositions in these plots using ANOSIM and SIMPER analyses. Based on claw mark signs, sun bear habitat use appeared to be non-random and was significantly associated with gradients of increasing habitat intactness, from non-forest habitat to least disturbed forest. Two PCA factors explained the probability of bears utilising a given habitat, which increased with tree biomass and decreased with understorey cover. At the plot level, tree family and species compositions were significantly different between plots without and with claw marks. The abundance and use of Olacaceae stems was significantly higher in plots with claw marks. Incorporating forest restoration strategies that enhance or increase more intact forest and the availability of key tree resources should benefit the conservation of sun bears and encourage natural forest regeneration in these degraded landscapes. We also emphasise the conservation value of degraded forest habitats for this species while ensuring bear movement and connectivity within modified landscape matrices.

TI  - Fine-scale effects of bamboo dominance on seed rain in a rainforest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Bamboo dominance in tropical forests drives changes in floristic composition and vegetation structure. However, the role of bamboo dominance over ecosystem functions - including those related to forest regeneration - has received less attention. This study evaluated the fine-scale effects of the dominance of native bamboo Guadua weberbaueri Pflg. (Poaceae) on seed rain in a terra-firme forest in the southwest of the Brazilian Amazon to understand how bamboos remain a dominant element where they occur. We tested the hypothesis that bamboo dominance (i) reduces seed diversity and biomass and (ii) changes floristic composition and frequencies of seed dispersal mechanisms. For one year, we sampled seeds from seed rain in adjacent bamboo-dominated (BD) and bamboo-free (BF) environments in a forest without major anthropogenic disturbances. We found lower seed species richness in the BD environment and similar seed biomass between BD and BF. In addition, the seed species composition differed between BD and BF, with higher frequency of abiotic mechanisms to seeds dispersal in BD. We conclude that the dominance of bamboos acts as a filter for species that arrive via seed rain, modifying the floristic composition and dispersal mechanisms and, consequently, the dynamics of natural regeneration processes of terra-firme forests in the Amazon. This process can promote the permanence and expansion of the distribution area of bamboos in tropical forests.

TI  - Transcriptome-derived molecular resources for the conservation of threatened butterflies in Korea
T2  - ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Butterflies are expedient biodiversity indicators of a healthy environment. As virtuous pollinators, they provide environmental and economic benefits to the agricultural and natural ecosystem. The global loss of the butterfly community, especially in tropical regions, is causing irreparable damage to the ecological landscape. This decline in population is due to habitat degradation, forest succession, loss of symbiotic relations, economic loss due to flooding, forest development plans, low grassland area, global warming, and reforestation. Moreover, the limited information on the molecular resources of butterflies impedes informed conservation planning. The Threatened Species Initiative (TSI) of Korea has started to utilize the benefits of transcriptome-guided discovery of molecular resources of a few butterfly species, and a few others are in the pipeline. The cataloging of new genes and genetic markers provides the possibility to promote selective utilization of fitness traits for adaptation of the species to the wild and a newer habitat. In this review, we assessed the versatility of whole-transcriptome information of the Korean threatened butterfly species, such as the lycaenid Protantigius superans and Spindasis takanosis, the Nymphalid butterfly, Fabriciana nerippe, and the Papilionid species Parnassius bremeri. The schema employed under TSI, including the sequencing and downstream bioinformatics pipeline, could act as a reference for research outside of Korean butterflies. While the molecular resources are available to be exploited, their utilization for conservation is still in its infancy. It is important to synthesize these studies together to catalyze further conservation work applying genomics approaches.

TI  - Forest Management
T2  - TROPICAL FORESTRY HANDBOOK, 2ND EDITION
AB  - Sustainable forest management (SFM) is here considered as all practices to produce a continuous flow of desired forest goods and services without undue reduction in the forest's inherent values and future productivity and without undue undesirable effects on the physical and social environment (according to ITTO (2006) Status of Tropical Forest Management 2005). SFM has often been regarded as a means for the salvation of the still declining tropical forests. In this chapter, I investigate under which circumstances the expectation of SFM being an option to preserve tropical forests may be true. This question is addressed in three parts, mainly based on the existing literature, but partly also through simulations. The topics addressed are: (I) the characteristics of SFM for tropical natural forests, (II) the characteristics of planted forests in the tropics, and (III) SFM embedded in a land-use model together with agricultural land-use options. The results for part I show that SFM of natural forests would basically lead to decreasing timber yield, moderately reduced carbon stocks, and only marginally disturbed biodiversity. The economic performance of SFM is relatively low and inferior compared to the economic performance of planted forests and agricultural alternatives. The planted forests, investigated in part II, promise high profitability, even in the case of some native tree species. However, simulations by means of an economically driven land-use model show that planted forests would expand their area into natural forests, if afforestation is not directed to abandoned lands and if natural forests are not preserved by means of conservation payments transferred to land users. These results lead to part III, where SFM in natural forests and afforestation of abandoned lands are considered as parts of a more comprehensive land-use portfolio, in this case designed for the example of Ecuador, considering croplands and pastures as agricultural options. The composition of the land-use portfolio is controlled by the economic yield and risk of the land-use options considered. SFM of natural forests generates little economic yield for the land users; however, because of the vast area under consideration, the necessary conservation transfers to land users may greatly be reduced if the management of natural forests is considered. The afforestation of abandoned lands also increases the profitability of the resulting land-use portfolio and sequesters additional carbon on top of that. However, the recultivation of part of the abandoned lands back to pasture turned out to be a very important option as well. It helps in producing enough food, which, and in turn, secures moderate food prices. Moderate food prices have the advantage being responsible for moderate conservation payments to compensate for the opportunity costs of the preservation of natural forests. As a result, strategies to produce enough food without additional CO2 emissions can be designed at a minimal conservation costs. The analyses show that SFM and afforestation can complement agricultural land-use portfolios. This is also shown in more detail based on a farm-level consideration. It is concluded that SFM in natural forests and planted forests is a valuable option to increase the efficiency of sustainable land-use portfolios. It is, ultimately, of utmost importance to embed these forestry options in comprehensive land-use models to avoid undue undesirable effects, which could potentially be caused by indirect land-use change.

TI  - The implementation costs of forest conservation policies in Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Tropical forest conservation is considered a low-cost option for climate change mitigation. But mitigation cost assessments have featured opportunity costs, neglecting policy implementation costs. Here we use official data to identify the Brazilian federal government's operational and institutional budgets related to forest conservation policies implemented from 2000 to 2014. We distinguish the allocated and executed budgets of these policies, and provide scenario-based estimates of their cost-effectiveness. On average, Brazil spent US$ 1 billion/year on forest conservation policies at the federal level. Brazil's substantial reduction in annual forest loss after 2004 was accompanied by a higher operational budget execution of disincentive-based policy instruments, and an absolute increase in both allocated and executed institutional budgets. The post-2004 successful mitigation effort represented additional implementation costs to the Brazilian federal government of US$ 308-923/ha of avoided deforestation, or US$ 0.87-2.60/tCO(2) of avoided emissions. Factoring in also approximate municipal and state expenditures, these costs increase to US$ 385-1153/ha or US$ 1.09-3.25/tCO(2). We conclude that implementations costs are non-trivial in size, including compared to estimates of land users' opportunity costs. This has important implications for REDD-I-policy design, in the sense that implementation costs need to be adequately considered. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Grazing reduces plant species diversity of Caatinga dry forests in northeastern Brazil
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
AB  - Questions In many arid and semi-arid regions of the world, livestock husbandry is the main land use and grazing is one of the main challenges for biodiversity conservation. This also applies to the Caatinga, a unique seasonally dry tropical forest in northeastern Brazil. It is considered one of the most threatened ecosystems of Brazil. To protect semi-arid regions from biodiversity loss, degradation, and desertification, sustainable management practices are urgently needed. However, the effect of different grazing intensities on plant diversity is not yet fully understood. In this study, we examined the effect of different grazing intensities on plant species composition, alpha and beta diversity. Location Vicinity of the Itaparica Reservoir, northeastern Brazil. Methods We assessed the effects of different grazing intensities (high, intermediate, no/low) on species composition, alpha and beta diversity of the tree and shrub, and the herb layer in a Caatinga area. Plant diversity of the tree and shrub layer was assessed on 45 study plots (each 20 m x 20 m), while the diversity of herbs was studied on a subset of 36 plots (four subplots, each 2 m x 2 m). Results In total, we recorded 140 plant taxa including morphospecies. Grazing at high intensities significantly reduced almost all measures of alpha and beta diversity (tree and shrub layer) compared to areas with no or low grazing. In contrast, species composition was not significantly related to grazing but instead to altitude, which serves as an indicator of reduced anthropogenic impact such as slash-and-burn agriculture or tree harvesting. Conclusion Overall, the study results show that the current livestock management has negative effects on plant diversity in Caatinga ecosystems. These results have been incorporated into guidelines provided to regional stakeholders including recommendations for adapted land-management practices that protect and foster the biodiversity of dry forests while sustaining local livelihoods.

TI  - Artisanal and small-scale gold mining and biodiversity: a global literature review
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY
AB  - Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is crucial to the livelihoods of close to 20 million people in over 80 countries, including 4-5 million women, mainly in rural areas with limited alternative economic prospects, particularly in developing countries. ASGM is largely informal, which can add to the challenge of addressing negative social and environmental effects including impacts on biodiversity. However, with proper guidance, ASGM can operate in a responsible manner, using cleaner production methods that minimize impacts on human health and the environment. This study presents and analyzes the interactions between ASGM and biodiversity based on new findings from 27 ASGM National Action Plans (NAPs) developed within the framework of Article 7 and Annex C of the Minamata Convention on Mercury, as well as a global literature review of more than 100 publications. In terms of key findings according to the literature reviewed, alongside other human occupation such as agriculture and industrial activities, ASGM also has an impact on the environment and biodiversity. The interrelationship between ASGM and biodiversity, including protected areas, is pervasive at every stage of ASGM operations, from extraction to mine closure, and generates significant impacts on the surrounding ecosystems. These impacts include, in descending order of most reported impacts: deforestation, soil degradation, chemical contamination of aquatic and terrestrial systems, and changes to the turbidity of watercourses. Tropical regions and key species such as amphibians and freshwater fish are among the most affected. Singly or combined, these environmental stressors lead to loss or deterioration of habitat and, by extension, indigenous biodiversity and ecosystem services. In addition, legal, institutional, and regulatory frameworks and related measures, inadequate or non-existent in some cases, may not necessarily support sustainable practices, often resulting in exploited sites abandoned without remediation, reclamation, rehabilitation, or restoration measures. To mitigate such impacts a key recommendation arising from the literature review is to strengthen the integration of the interrelationship between ASGM and biodiversity in the implementation of existing relevant national strategies, including those developed under the NAPs. The global literature review also highlights the importance of a multi-stakeholder, systemic approach combining the use of geospatial analysis, scientific and local knowledge, as well as the adaptation of the relevant frameworks, capacity building, and awareness raising. This approach can inform decision making with a view to developing sustainable initiatives that prevent and reduce the impacts of artisanal and small-scale gold mining on ecosystems, and that preserve biodiversity.

TI  - Susceptibility of the Vegetation to Forest Fires in the Dry Forest of Ocana-Colombia
T2  - RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN GEOSPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCES, IGISC 2023
CP  - 3rd International Conference on Geospatial Information Sciences (iGISc)
AB  - According to the climate zoning proposed by Holdrige, Ocana, in the department of Norte de Santander in Colombia, has a distribution of Dry Tropical Forest (Bs-T). This forest is threatened at the national level, so the Colombian state has been prioritized to restore and conserve it, since it provides a considerable number of ecosystem services and also, is key to the conservation of our biodiversity and the adaptation and mitigation of climate change. Forest fires have been a problem in the dry forest area of Ocana, with a frequency of up to 13 fires per year in 2015 alone, according to the regional fire department. So far, fire management in the area has been lim-ited to emergency response, not prevention, because there is no institutional framework for fire risk management at the local level. The objective of this work is to identify the zones of vulnerability of the vegetation to forest fires in the Bs-T area of Ocana. To do this, a protocol proposed by the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies-IDEAM has been used, which specifies that it is necessary to first have a coverage map, adapted according to certain coverages (Corine Land Cover Methodology) prioritized by the protocol, to later generate the maps of type, duration and load of fuels, which are subjected to a multi-criteria evaluation in GIS soft-ware, thus generating the map of vegetation susceptibility to fires. As a result, for the predominant fuel type and load, a high threat was identified, mainly to the east of the Bs-T distribution area, while the low threat per fuel life, has a greater representativeness in hectares and is displayed mainly to the southeast of this area. It is concluded that the threat due to the vulnerability of vegetation to fire in Bs-T in Ocana is mainly moderate, representing an area of approximately 13,924 ha.

TI  - Modeling spatio-temporal change patterns of forest cover: a case study from the Himalayan foothills (India)
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB  - The present study used temporal remote sensing data for 1990, 2001 and 2006 to assess spatio-temporal patterns of forest cover changes in Shiwalik range of the Himalaya, Dehradun forest division. Forests are innately associated to human well-being. However, with the increasing anthropogenic activities, deforestation has increased. Quantitative change analysis of the forest cover for the past two decades provides valuable insight into the forest conservation vis-A -vis anthropogenic activities in the region. Spatio-temporal datasets along with biotic and abiotic variables provide opportunities to model the forest cover change further. The present study investigates forest cover change and predicts status of forest cover in the Dehradun forest division. Land Change Modeller (LCM) was used to predict status of forest cover for 2010 and 2015 using current disturbance scenarios. Comparing actual LULC of 2006 with the predicted LULC of 2006 validated change prediction model and agreement was 61.03%. The forested areas are getting degraded due to anthropogenic activities, but deforestation/degradation does not contribute much in expanding urban area. Agricultural areas and fallow lands are the main contributors to increased urban area. The study demonstrates the potential of geospatial tools to understand spatio-temporal forest cover change and generate the future scenarios.

TI  - Peat swamp forest conservation withstands pervasive land conversion to oil palm plantation in North Selangor, Malaysia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Tropical deforestation remains one of the major global challenges of the twenty-first century driven to a large extent by the conversion of land for agricultural purposes, such as palm oil production. Malaysia is one of the world's largest palm oil producers and has seen widespread conversion to oil palm from primary forest, including peat swamp forest (PSF). This study investigates the rate and extent of pervasive oil palm expansion in and around North Selangor Peat Swamp Forest (NSPSF) over the last three decades, exploring how land conversion has affected the region's tropical forests, and assessing the relative success of PSF conservation measures. Time-series Landsat imagery was used to assess thematic land cover change and improvement in vegetation condition since NSPSF was given protected status in 1990. The results show a near tripling in oil palm cover throughout North Selangor, from 24,930ha in 1989 to 70,070ha in 2016; while at the same time tropical forest cover shrank from 145,570ha to 88,400ha. Despite concerns over the sustainability and environmental impact of such rapid oil palm conversion at a regional level, at the local scale, NSPSF represents a relative conservation success story. Effective land stewardship by government and non-governmental organization (NGO) management actors has limited illegal encroachment of oil palm around the reserve boundary. PSF rehabilitation measures have also markedly improved vegetation condition in NSPFS's interior. These findings have broad significance for how oil palm agriculture is managed and especially for PSF stewardship and conservation, and the approaches described here may be usefully adopted elsewhere in Southeast Asia and around the world.

TI  - Do tree plantations or cultivated fields have the same ability to maintain soil quality as natural forests?
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Human activities, such as tree cutting and land-use change, have significantly altered the forests of Iran's Zagros Mountains. In plantation projects within these forests, maintaining soil structure and fertility is necessary for sustainable forest management. Ideally, the soil quality of tree plantations should be as good as that of natural forests. In this study, we investigated the long-term impact of land-use change, i.e. conversion of natural oak forest to tree plantations or cultivated fields, on soil quality (i.e., physicochemical, biological and biochemical soil properties) in the forests of the Zagros Mountains. We found that the conversion of natural oak forest to tree plantations (in this case Cupressus arizonica, Cedrus libani, Elaeagnus angustifolia, Quercus brantii (persica), Robinia pseudoacacia and Fraxinus rotundifolia) and agriculture caused declines in soil organic carbon content, especially in the cultivated fields where it fell by around 60%. Overall, the lowest contents of soil nutrients, except Cu, were measured in agricultural soils. Interestingly, the plantation of a non-native tree (Cedrus libani) sequestrated more atmospheric carbon and nitrogen than native Persian oak forests. The impact on soil biological activity remains unclear: the conversion of natural forests into cultivated fields reduced soil biological activity, while conversion from forest to tree plantations had little influence. Finally, the conversion of natural forest to tree plantations had less impact on soil properties than conversion to cultivated fields. In conclusion, to maintain soil fertility, forest managers should avoid forest conversion to agriculture. Moreover, we do not recommend plantation of Cupressus arizonica in the Zagros region for the purpose of carbon and nitrogen sequestration and the increase of soil productivity.

TI  - Seed rain dynamics following disturbance exclusion in a secondary tropical dry forest in Morelos, Mexico
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - In most of the legally protected areas in Mexico local inhabitants use natural resources, such as fire wood or cattle grazing. These frequent but low-intensity disturbances have consequences at various levels of the tropical ecosystems and strongly impact forest structure and its regeneration capacity. Despite their importance, the effects of these perturbations in many, aspects of tropical forest ecology and in the forest's capacity to recover after disturbance exclusion remain poorly understood. Understanding the impact of these processes oil tropical forests is necessary for rehabilitating these forests and enhancing their productivity. In this Study, we evaluate the impact of twelve years of exclusion (E) of cattle grazing and fire wood extraction in the composition and dynamics of seed rain, and compare this assessment to a similar analysis in all area where these perturbations continued (without exclusion, WE). We found a strong seasonality in seed rain (96% of seeds fell in the dry season) in both areas. There were no significant differences between F and WE sites in relation to overall Seed density, species richness and diversity. However, the distribution along the year of seed species density was significantly different among the E and WE sites. The Jaccard's similarity index between E and WE sites was relatively low (0.57). Barochory was the most common dispersal mode observed among the 23 species in terms of seed species density (48%), followed by anemochory (39%) and zoochory (13%). In relation to seed density, anemochory was the most frequent dispersal mode (88%). Most species in the zone were categorized as Small seeds (92%, and there were no significant differences in the distribution of seed size between E and WE. The spatial pattern of dispersal of the flour species with the highest relative importance value index, in both areas, was aggregated. years of disturbance exclusion were not enough to fully restore the seed rain of the area; some differences were already perceptible after this lapse. On the other hand, zoochorous species were almost absent from both sites. The re-introduction of climax and animal-dispersed species may be, in addition to perturbation exclusion, a viable strategy to accelerate ecological restoration in this area. Rev. Biol.

TI  - Farming vs forests: Trade-off between agriculture and the extraction of non-timber forest products
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - A number of empirical studies on tropical forests have focused on the issues of agricultural development and deforestation. According to these studies, deforestation is assumed to be an increasing function of agricultural yields hence implying a negative external effect. Contrary, this article presents a case which explores the trade-off between agriculture and extraction of forest products. We measure the technical efficiency of agriculture in natural forest peripheries and test the results from forest resource extraction. The study findings show that non-timber forest product extraction is a decreasing function of agricultural efficiency, hence producing a positive externality in the conversion of forest resources. This study also determines the level of efficiency improvement necessary to compensate the current income generated by non-timber forest products (NTFPs). Improving agricultural efficiency in forest peripheries should be an integral component of forest conservation policy. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Rapid recovery of tropical forest diversity and structure after shifting cultivation in the Philippines uplands
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Shifting cultivation is a widespread land-use in the tropics that is considered a major threat to rainforest diversity and structure. In the Philippines, a country with rich biodiversity and high rates of species endemism, shifting cultivation, locally termed as kaingin, is a major land-use and has been for centuries. Despite the potential impact of shifting cultivation on forests and its importance to many people, it is not clear how biodiversity and forest structure recover after kaingin abandonment in the country, and how well these post-kaingin secondary forests can complement the old-growth forests. We investigated parameters of forest diversity and structure along a fallow age gradient in secondary forests regenerating after kaingin abandonment in Leyte Island, the Philippines (elevation range: 445-650 m asl). We first measured the tree diversity and forest structure indices in regenerating secondary forests and old-growth forest. We then measured the recovery of tree diversity and forest structure parameters in relation to the old-growth forest. Finally, using linear mixed effect models (LMM), we assessed the effect of different environmental variables on the recovery of forest diversity and structure. We found significantly higher species density in the oldest fallow sites, while Shannon's index, species evenness, stem number, basal area, and leaf area index were higher in the old-growth forest. A homogeneous species composition was found across the sites of older fallow age. Multivariate analysis revealed patch size as a strong predictor of tree diversity and forest structure recovery after shifting cultivation. Our study suggests that, secondary forests regenerating after shifting cultivation abandonment can recover rapidly. Although recovery of forest structure was not as rapid as the tree diversity, our older fallow sites contained a similar number of species as the old-growth forest. Many of these species are also endemic to the Philippines. Novel and emerging ecosystems like tropical secondary forests are of high conservation importance and can act as a refuge for dwindling tropical forest biodiversity.

TI  - Ecological diagnostics, formulation and implementation of strategies for the restoration of an interandean dry tropical forest (Huila, Colombia)
T2  - CALDASIA
AB  - Ecological diagnostics at a regional level is fundamental for planning processes of ecological restoration (ER), especially in poorly known and threatened ecosystems such as the Dry Tropical Forest (DTF). Based on ecological diagnostics of a DTF in the department of Huila, Colombia, strategies for its restoration were formulated and implemented, and monitoring of those strategies were initiated. For restoration scenarios barriers for natural regeneration and its enhancers were identified, also reference ecosystems were defined, and key species for restoration process were selected. Related to this information, six strategies were formulated: i) nucleation in pastureland with nuclei between 2x2 m and 32x32 m with variation in species number (3-30), individuals density (9-196), species assemblages (1-4) and soil management, ii) plantations under nurse trees in wooded pastures with 37 individuals from six species, iii) plantations under tree clusters with 57 individuals of eleven species, iv) expansion of forests and shrublands edges with strips of 10x5 m with 17 individuals of five species, v) enrichment in shrublands and forests with monospecific hexagonal modules of 7 individuals, and vi) spontaneous restoration. A total of 54 300 individuals were planted, and the greatest effort was made in nucleation strategy that was implemented in 32x32 m completing 159 replicates and 21 676 individuals. Monitoring will allow evaluation of successional trajectories development according to references, also to determine cost-effectiveness of strategies. This methodological process of ecological diagnostics, formulation, implementation and monitoring of strategies can serve as an important guide for DTF ecological restoration in other locations.

TI  - Selective logging intensity and time since logging drive tropical bird and dung beetle diversity: a case study from Amazonia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Understanding how selective logging affects biodiversity is crucial to planning cost-effective conservation strategies in tropical forests, yet there is limited understanding of its impacts on fauna functional diversity in the tropical Americas. We assessed how selective logging intensification and time since logging influence multiple metrics of fauna functional integrity in the Brazilian Amazon by collecting bird and dung beetle data within 48 logging management units that had experienced varying exploitation intensities between 1.5-2.0 and 5.0-6.0 years before the faunal surveys. We investigated assemblage responses and used functional attributes to assess changes in functional diversity, specialization, originality and species rarity. Using point counts and pitfall traps, we collected 5081 records of 182 bird species and 7892 dung beetles from 45 species. Logging intensification led to significant declines in most dung beetle responses and bird body mass, whereas time since logging was a key driver of dung beetle and bird functional and taxonomic diversity. Our study presents novel empirical evidence of how logging intensification effects vary across taxa, ecological metrics and time since logging, which is key to informing forest conservation and further investigating environmental degradation impacts on tropical biodiversity.

TI  - "No signs of saturation": long-term dynamics of vascular epiphyte communities in a human-modified landscape
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - It is debated whether slowing human population growth and intense urbanization may result in a slowdown of deforestation and an acceleration of natural forest regeneration. In a fragmented landscape the structure and composition of developing secondary forests will strongly depend on the local species pool. Thus, the understanding how organisms cope with biotic and abiotic challenges outside pristine habitats is pivotal. Structurally dependent, vascular epiphytes are an important biotic component of tropical forests. In human-modified tropical landscapes potential hosts are often still present. We aimed to assess if human-modified landscapes offer a refuge habitat in which epiphytes can form metacommunities that are ultimately viable. Eight years after an initial assessment we recensused the epiphytes in pasture trees in western Panama along a strong rainfall gradient. We document a threefold abundance increase (ca. 20,000 vs. > 60,000 individuals) and an increase in species-richness (66 vs. 86 mostly drought-tolerant species). This large net increase suggests a highly dynamic system. Although absolute abundances changed dramatically, the relative contribution of major taxonomic groups to overall diversity and abundance changed little. Neither rainfall nor tree growth had a significant effect on relative annual community growth rates. At the plot level (=metacommunities), abundance increase was mostly due to the species already present in the first census, at the tree level (=communities) the contribution of new and old species was comparable. The documented long-term trend in epiphyte metacommunities in a human-modified landscape suggests that a diverse set of species sustains viable metacommunities and is likely to provide structural diversity to developing secondary forest.

TI  - Trees planted under a global restoration pledge have mixed futures under climate change
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Nations worldwide have committed to restoring millions of hectares of forest as a strategy to mitigate climate change with many other co-benefits. Paradoxically, the suitability of climatic conditions for the trees being planted at the restoration sites is changing, which may reduce the long-term viability of these projects. We assessed the potential future viability of trees planted as part of Ecuador's National Reforestation Plan from 2014 to 2017, committed under the global Bonn Challenge. We selected the 10 most frequently planted tree species (all native) in 1237 restoration sites in northwest Ecuador. We modeled the species' climatic suitability at the restoration sites under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 using 14 individual general circulation models for the 2030s, 2050s, and 2070s. We combined the 14 suitability models to create continuous climatic suitability models for each species. We then assessed the species suitability against three modeling thresholds simultaneously. Seven of the species showed high and medium climatic viability, all of these species were native to the region of planting. Three species showed low climatic viability; two of these are native to the country but not to the region being restored. Our results also show how using continuous rather than discrete modeling can affect viability assessments. Our study suggests the importance of including climate niche modeling in restoration projects; however, choosing to plant species that are within their native distribution range may be a good strategy in tropical regions if climate niche projections are not available.

TI  - Biogeophysical effects of land use on climate: Model simulations of radiative forcing and large-scale temperature change
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
CP  - International Workshop on Contribution of Agriculture to the State of Climate
AB  - Changes in land cover affect climate through the surface energy and moisture budgets. Here we assess the importance of these biogeophysical effects for present-day climate, and quantify the radiative forcing of historical climate change by land use change for comparison with radiative forcings due to anthropogenic changes in greenhouse gases and aerosols. We also discuss the implications of biogeophysical effects for the use of forestry as a tool for mitigating climate change through carbon sequestration. Our model results suggest that since most historical deforestation has taken place in temperate regions where the main climatic effect is an increase in surface albedo, the dominant biogeophysical effect of past land cover change has been a cooling. The northern mid-latitude agricultural regions are simulated to be approximately 1-2 K cooler in winter and spring in comparison with their previously forested state. This conflicts with the suggestion that land use change is responsible for the warming observed over the 20th century. The increase in albedo by 1750 is simulated to exert a negative radiative forcing of approximately -2 W m(-2) locally over Europe, China and India, suggesting a potential anthropogenic influence on climate before fossil fuel burning began. The present-day global mean radiative forcing by anthropogenic surface albedo change relative to the natural state is simulated to be -0.2 W m(-2), which is comparable with the estimated forcings relative to pre-industrial times by stratospheric and tropospheric ozone, N2O, the halocarbons, and the direct effect of anthropogenic aerosols. In cold regions, afforestation or reforestation would decrease the surface albedo and induce a positive radiative forcing (warming) which could partly or completely offset the negative forcing (cooling) due to carbon sequestration. This suggests that carbon sink plantations could be less effective than expected at reducing warming, and could even cause further warming. However, we note that reforestation (or avoided deforestation) in tropical regions could exert a double cooling effect through carbon sequestration and increased evaporation and cloud cover.

TI  - Global cost estimates of reducing carbon emissions through avoided deforestation
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Tropical deforestation is estimated to cause about one-quarter of anthropogenic carbon emissions, loss of biodiversity, and other environmental services. United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change talks are now considering mechanisms for avoiding deforestation (AD), but the economic potential of AD has yet to be addressed. We use three economic models of global land use and management to analyze the potential contribution of AD activities to reduced greenhouse gas emissions. AD activities are found to be a competitive, low-cost abatement option. A program providing a 10% reduction in deforestation from 2005 to 2030 could provide 0.3-0.6 Gt (1 Gt = 1 x 10(5) g) CO(2)(.)yr(-1) in emission reductions and would require $0.4 billion to $1.7 billion(.)yr(-1) for 30 years. A 50% reduction in deforestation from 2005 to 2030 could provide 1.5-2.7 Gt CO(2)(.)yr(-1) in emission reductions and would require $17.2 billion to $28.0 billion(.)yr(-1). Finally, some caveats to the analysis that could increase costs of AD programs are described.

TI  - Converting Forests to Farms: The Economic Benefits of Clearing Forests in Agricultural Settlements in the Amazon
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB  - Agricultural expansion into tropical forests is believed to bring local economic benefits at the expense of global environmental costs. The resulting tension is reflected in Brazilian government policy. The national agrarian reform program has settled farm families in the Amazon region since the 1970s, with the expectation that they will clear forests in order to farm the land. On the other hand, recent Brazilian policy initiatives seek to reduce deforestation to mitigate climate change. We contribute to the policy debate that surrounds these dual goals for the Amazon by estimating the marginal effects of new agricultural land on the full income and assets of farm settlers over a 13-year period from 1996 to 2009. Using micro panel data from agrarian settlements where forest was being rapidly cleared, and controlling for factors that would otherwise confound the relationship, we estimate the effect of converting forest to agriculture on total household income to estimate the opportunity cost of conserving forest. Our measure of income reflects any re-allocation of resources by utility maximizing households and any productivity effects due to loss of forest ecosystem services. The estimated effect of new agricultural land on income is positive, but small relative to the income per hectare of previously cleared land. However, we show that income increases investment in physical assets, which raises households' income generating capacity and future accumulation of assets. Thus, while there is only a small immediate income gain from clearing more forest, the long-term effects on wealth are still substantial. This demonstrates that given the right conditions, conversion of forest to agricultural land can be an impetus for asset accumulation by smallholders. It also highlights the importance of considering the indirect and long-term welfare benefits of new agricultural land when assessing the opportunity costs of forest conservation.

AB  - Here we present Tambopata: Who Owns Paradise?, a map-centric, multimedia website created to enrich an educational role playing exercise about biodiversity, conservation, and development in the Amazon (www.geography.wisc.edu/tambopata). The exercise assigns students a character from the Tambopata region of the Peruvian Amazon, and asks them to evaluate four proposed zoning plans from their assigned perspective. Using principles of web cartography, we designed the four proposal maps to communicate complex information and allow for increased exploration. Compared to the previously used static maps, the website increases opportunities for student engagement with the material, incorporates multimedia, and clarifies spatial relationships and land use patterns. The website is available publicly and can be integrated freely into other university and high school courses.

TI  - The ephemerality of secondary forests in southern Costa Rica
T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
AB  - Secondary forests are increasingly recognized for conserving biodiversity and mitigating global climate change, but these and other desired outcomes can only be achieved after decades of regeneration, and secondary forests are frequently recleared before they recover to predisturbance conditions. We used a time series of aerial photographs (1947-2014) to evaluate multidecadal persistence of secondary forests across a 320 km(2) landscape in southern Costa Rica. Secondary forests had relatively short lifespans, with 50% recleared within 20 years and 85% recleared within 54 years of when they were first observed. Larger forest fragments and forests near rivers had a lower reclearance hazard, but forest persistence did not differ over time, indicating that regional forest regeneration may be generally ephemeral. Costa Rica has made an international commitment to restore 1 million ha of degraded land by 2020. Depending on how this is achieved, only half that target may remain forested by 2040.

TI  - Evaluation of the anti-helminthic activity of crude extracts from the Brazilian Amazon and Mata Atlantica plants against Haemonchus contortus
T2  - ARQUIVO BRASILEIRO DE MEDICINA VETERINARIA E ZOOTECNIA
AB  - Helminthosis play a crucial role in small ruminant production leading to enormous economic losses particularly in areas where extensive grazing is practiced. It causes a loss of production through mortality, weight loss, reduced milk and wool production. Haemonchus contortus is a highly pathogenic small ruminant helminthes parasite, which is capable of causing acute diseases and high mortality. Therefore, there is an urgent need to seek alternative or complementary solutions to the control of parasitic nematodes of ruminants. The tropical forests concentrate the highest biodiversity in the world, particularly those located in Brazil, whose species richness is estimated to account for 20% of the total world richness and little is known about the chemical and pharmacological potentialities of Brazilian tropical forests. In this work, organic and aqueous extracts were tested on eggs and in the larval development test on Haemonchus contortus. The organic extract obtained from leaves and fruits of Trichilia sp. and the aqueous extract obtained from the aerial organs of Phyllanthus attenuates showed significant activity related to the inhibition of H. contortus egg eclosion. In vitro results suggest that both extracts, as well as eleven other active extracts, can offer alternatives in sheep worm control.

TI  - Can silvopasture with arboreal legumes increase root mass at deeper soil layers and improve soil aggregation?
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
AB  - Silvopastoral system (SPS) is a multifunctional agroforestry practice. This study evaluate soil properties and root biomass under SPS in Pernambuco, Brazil. The experiment was established in 2011. The treatments were (1) monoculture signalgrass (MS) [Urochloa decumbens (Stapf.) R. D. Webster], (2) intercropped pasture of signalgrass with legume Gliricidia (SG) [Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Steud.], and (3) intercropped pasture of signalgrass with legume sabi & aacute; (SS) (Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth). Treatments were allocated in randomized complete block design with three replications. Samples were collected at 0- to 10-, 10- to 20-, 20- to 40-, 40- to 60-, 60- to 80-, 80- to 100-, and 100- to 120-cm soil depths. Soil samples were also taken from the native forest (NF) considered as a reference at the same Experimental Station. Legume SPS (SG and SS) presented greater root biomass per unit area compared to MS at 60- to 80-cm depth (p < 0.05); however, MS had greater root biomass per hectare at the top layers. The average values of the weighted mean diameter of soil aggregates were 3.20, 3.19, 3.07, and 3.27 mm in MS, SG, SS, and NF, respectively, at 0- to 120-cm depths. The SPS increased soil cation exchange capacity in deeper layers, indicating greater biological activity at greater depth. Grasslands and SPS store 235 Mg C ha-1 with 71% of that found in deeper layers (20-120 cm). SPS with signalgrass intercropped with arboreal legumes has potential to improve deep soil C storage and resilience of livestock systems in tropical regions.

TI  - Reducing Fertilizer and Avoiding Herbicides in Oil Palm Plantations-Ecological and Economic Valuations
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Oil palm plantations are intensively managed agricultural systems that increasingly dominate certain tropical regions. Oil palm monocultures have been criticized because of their reduced biodiversity compared to the forests they historically replaced, and because of their negative impact on soils, water, and climate. We experimentally test whether less intensive management schemes may enhance biodiversity and lessen detrimental effects on the environment while maintaining high yields. We compare reduced vs. conventional fertilization, as well as mechanical vs. chemical weed control (with herbicides) in a long-term, full-factorial, multidisciplinary experiment. We conducted the experiment in an oil palm company estate in Sumatra, Indonesia, and report the results of the first 2 years. We measured soil nutrients and functions, surveyed above- and below-ground organisms, tracked oil palm condition and productivity, and calculated plantation gross margins. Plants, aboveground arthropods, and belowground animals were positively affected by mechanical vs. chemical weed control, but we could not detect effects on birds and bats. There were no detectable negative effects of reduced fertilization or mechanical weeding on oil palm yields, fine roots, or leaf area index. Also, we could not detect detrimental effects of the reduced fertilization and mechanical weeding on soil nutrients and functions (mineral nitrogen, bulk density, and litter decomposition), but water infiltration and base saturation tended to be higher under mechanical weeding, while soil moisture, and microbial biomass varied with treatment. Economic performance, measured as gross margins, was higher under reduced fertilization. There might be a delayed response of oil palm to the different management schemes applied, so results of future years may confirm whether this is a sustainable management strategy. Nevertheless, the initial effects of the experiment are encouraging to consider less intensive management practices as economically and ecologically viable options for oil palm plantations.

TI  - Effects of Pine Plantation on Native Ecuadorian Paramo Vegetation
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Exotic pine plantations, installed mainly for timber production and carbon sequestration purposes, cover an ever-expanding area of equatorial and tropical regions; however, their economic and environmental benefits are under debate due to their potential negative effects on native plant species conservation. The native understory plant species richness and cover under pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) plantations were compared with natural grasslands in the Ecuadorian Paramo. We analyzed the vegetation in four zones: Antisana (8-year-old pines), Cajas (16-year-old pines), Tisaleo (41-year-old pines) and Cotopaxi (53-year-old pines). The total understory plant cover decreased between 29% and 90% under pine plantations in all zones. The mean species richness in the pine plantations decreased by 44% in Antisana, Cajas and Tisaleo but not in Cotopaxi. Pine plantations strongly reduced the abundance of herbaceous light-demanding species (59%), except small herbs whose cover increased under pine (17.6%). Shrub cover was also negatively affected in Tisaleo and Cotopaxi (7.4%). Pine afforestation effects on Paramo vegetation depend mainly on canopy cover which changes with age and growing conditions (altitude) and secondarily on the vegetation state at the time of planting, resulting from land use history and ecological conditions. The pine effect was therefore more pronounced in the young and dense plantations of Antisana and Cajas than in the old and open stand of Cotopaxi, whose understory vegetation was more similar to that of grasslands.

TI  - Bat phylogenetic responses to regenerating Amazonian forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Throughout the tropics, regenerating secondary forests occupy vast areas previously cleared for agriculture and cattle ranching. However, despite the importance of regenerating forests in mitigating the pervasive negative consequences of forest loss and fragmentation on forest-associated biodiversity, longitudinal studies on species' phylogenetic responses to matrix regeneration are rare.
   2. We surveyed bats in continuous primary forest, primary forest fragments and in the regenerating secondary forest matrix of a whole-ecosystem Amazonian fragmentation experiment, similar to 15 and similar to 30 years after forest clearance, to investigate how changes in matrix quality through forest recovery affect phylogenetic alpha- and beta-diversity.
   3.We found that temporal changes in phylogenetic alpha-richness were more marked in the secondary forest matrix than in forest fragments and continuous forest, evidencing a significant increase in total evolutionary history over time. However, when the effects of species richness were accounted for, the phylogenetic structure of each assemblage was reduced close to zero, evincing a random pattern of lineages in all habitat types. Temporal differences in phylogenetic beta-diversity were driven mainly by beta(replacement) in secondary forest and continuous forest similar to 30 years after forest clearance. Both habitats also clustered together in terms of beta(richness), indicating similar levels of evolutionary heritage. Consequently, regenerating secondary forest showed a reduction in the extinction probability of lineages over time.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Approximately 30 years of secondary forest regeneration were sufficient for phylogenetic richness to recover to levels similar to those observed in continuous forest. Promoting forest succession on degraded land through a combination of natural and active restoration, while ensuring the long-term protection of secondary forests regardless of their age, is of key importance for conserving tropical bat diversity and their associated ecosystem services. Such restoration measures would stimulate the recolonization of fragments and matrix habitats by evolutionarily distinct bat species, safeguarding phylogenetically diverse assemblages and ecological functions. Our study suggests that forest restoration in tropical degraded areas should be encouraged and secondary forests be protected by law, especially in countryside ecosystems with high primary forest cover, and in the surroundings of protected areas.

TI  - A dataset of Neotropical liana research focusing on the strategies of control for forest restoration and management practices
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Key message: Forest fragmentation leads to a micro-environmental condition that favors the proliferation of liana, which infest trees, compete with them, and reduce their performance. To report the state of the art of the main actions to manage this structural component of tropical forests, we surveyed the control strategies in the literature in the last 71 years, highlighting research goals, tree-climber interactions, management, restoration, and conservation. Dataset access is at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6678112. Associated metadata are available at https://metadata-.afs.nancy.inra.fr/geonetwork/srv/fre/catalog.search#/metadata/712ff481-.dfa2-.4ddb-.b4fa-.fcbd7 c517842
   Context: Lianas (woody vines) are considered structural parasites of tropical trees because they start their development as terrestrial seedlings but need to reach a tree canopy for higher light availability. The tree-liana coexistence usually can damage tree species, thus removing lianas has been suggested as an alternative to reinforce forest regeneration.
   Aims: The dataset compilation begun during the first author doctoral work and a first dataset on neotropical lianas was published (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4050477) in 2020. The present dataset (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6678112) presents an update of the 2020 dataset with additional amend (published articles from 2018 to 2021) and enhanced metadata descriptions. Our aim is providing an updated database extracted from scientific literature compiling information related to the effect of lianas on tree and forest structure and diversity, and to contribute to improve decision making on forest restoration and management.
   Methods: We made a systematic literature review on lianas in the Neotropical region (native or restored) from 1950 to 2021. First, we selected studies on liana management and described each paper according to the following topics: vegetation status, positive (P), and negative (N) effects of lianas on each species, the species in focus, and the suggested management strategy.
   Results: Almost 83% of the studies pointed out tree-climber interactions as negative to trees. Cutting was the management strategy adopted in 92% of the studies. Controlled burning, enrichment, and selective cutting were adopted in only one paper. Rainy and seasonal forests were the vegetation types with more studied sites (20 and 17 respectively). Only one study suggested enhancing forest diversity through direct seeding of lianas. Four studies evaluated the impact of lianas on forest diversity and forest fauna.
   Conclusion: The data collected showed the different impacts of liana management on the diversity and structure of tropical forests. It can endorse environmental control and management practices and evaluate the consequences of these techniques in recovering forests or improving timber production.

TI  - Long-term change in the tree community of a tropical forest remnant surrounded by human-modified landscapes
T2  - FOLIA GEOBOTANICA
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that the tree community of small and isolated forest fragments show persisting structural and functional attributes characteristic of early-successional systems. Yet, the impacts of forest small size and isolation on several tree community attributes have not been comprehensively quantified in long-term studies. Here we analysed permanent plots over 17 years to investigate the recovery of community attributes in a small tropical forest remnant surrounded by human-modified landscapes in the endangered Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We conducted analyses on community species richness, functional diversity and composition, and aboveground biomass for the overall, adult and juvenile communities. The analysis of the demographic rates indicates a self-thinning phase (reduction in stem density and increase in basal area) characteristic of late-succession stages. In general, we found a reduction in the proportion of simple leaves along with a gradual increase in wood density mostly for the adult tree community and a significant increase in aboveground biomass throughout the years. Despite its reduced size, the fragment studied does not show clear trends of altered forest structure and functional composition dynamics through time. Yet, it holds aboveground biomass values comparable to large undisturbed rainforests, thus indicating that the ecological value of small forest fragments should not be neglected.

TI  - Expediting reforestation in tropical grasslands: Distance and isolation from seed sources in plantations
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Where tropical forests have been cleared and abandoned, forest regrowth is often slow. Because of the increasing extent of such degraded lands and desire for these areas to fulfill conservation and ecosystem functions, it has become important to assess mechanisms that accelerate reforestation. In situations where site conditions limit tree establishment, one option to facilitate reforestation is to establish plantations of fast-growing noninvasive trees that ameliorate site conditions and promote the growth of indigenous trees. To quantify the effect of distance and isolation from seed sources on the regeneration of indigenous trees, we evaluated tree species richness and stem density in four pine plantations surrounded by natural forest within Kibale National Park, Uganda, and one isolated pine plantation surrounded by agriculture near Kibale. Tree regeneration in these plantations was compared to that in natural forest and to an anthropogenic grassland similar to those upon which the plantations were established. Tree species richness and stem density were negatively correlated with distance to the plantation edge. The grassland had lower tree species richness and stein density than the isolated plantation, which had lower species richness and stem density than the plantations within Kibale. Leguminous species dominated tree regeneration in the isolated plantation and grassland, whereas small-seeded animal-dispersed species dominated regeneration in plantations adjacent to forest. We suggest that these differences are due to decreased seed dispersal across large distances or unfavorable habitats (e.g., grasslands) and to greater disturbance (e.g., fire) in the isolated plantation and grassland than in plantations within the National Park. This study demonstrates that forest reestablishment can be faster if plantations are established than if grasslands are left to recover without management. However, differences within and among plantations can lead to very different communities with respect to species composition, species richness, and stem density.

TI  - Underproductive agriculture aids connectivity in tropical forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Establishing connectivity in tropical lowland forests is a major conservation challenge, particularly in areas dominated by agriculture. Replanting schemes have been widely utilized as a method for reconnecting once contiguous forest patches. However, these approaches require funds for both initial planting and subsequent site maintenance. Furthermore, identifying sites for habitat rehabilitation schemes is difficult and may require purchasing of land, sometimes at great expense. Underproductive, often unprofitable, areas of agriculture have the potential to aid in re-establishing forest connectivity via natural forest regeneration. We identified an area of natural forest regrowth, previously cleared for agriculture and abandoned due to high levels of flooding. We assessed the structural regrowth of this forest after a 17-year period, and examined its efficacy as corridor habitat for Bornean elephants. Regrowth areas had re-established tree canopy areas similar to that of adjacent forest, as well as a randomly selected site of uncleared forest. Flooding in the area hampered the regrowth of some sections of the site; however, similar to 79% of the site exhibited canopy coverage. Aboveground carbon levels have returned to 50% those of uncleared forests, with flooding resulting in areas of reduced vegetation regeneration. Elephants have shown increasing usage of the regenerated forest, suggesting that the area has regenerated its suitability as elephant corridor habitat. We have shown that what would traditionally be thought of as low-quality, flood-prone areas for habitat restoration can be a useful, cost-effective tool for wildlife corridor management. We propose that natural regeneration of reclaimable, underproductive agriculture has the potential to play a key role in lowland tropical forest connectivity, reconnecting now isolated populations of endangered Bornean elephants.

TI  - What has Driven Deforestation in Developing Countries Since the 2000s? Evidence from New Remote-Sensing Data
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Using newly-released and globally available high-resolution remote sensing data on forest loss, we update the assessment of the cross-country determinants of deforestation in developing countries.
   We validate most of the major determinants found in the previous literature, generally based on earlier time-periods, except for the role of institutional quality. Agricultural trade, hitherto relatively neglected, is found to be one of the main factors causing deforestation. Focusing on the effect of international trade, we show that countries with different levels of relative forest cover react differently to a shock in agricultural exports' value. We also emphasize that taking countries' development into account may be critical in assessing global deforestation trends. The impact of trade is high in countries still endowed with a large proportion of forest cover while it is lower in countries with smaller remaining forest cover.
   We finally estimate, through a simple calibration exercise, the requirements for a cost-effective REDD+ policy for compensating trade losses in an open economy exporting agricultural commodities and endowed with tropical forests. We conclude that, in a world with increasing global demand, it might be costly to compensate totally and thus to offer the right incentives for developing countries to limit deforestation.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of past and future tropical forest transition and its dynamic to streamflow of the catchment, Malaysia
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
AB  - The consequences of human interventions on land use have been empirically demonstrated to affect substantially hydrological processes and ecosystem services within watershed environments. Since 1970, Malaysia has faced deforestation, driven mainly by logging and agricultural expansion, aligning with its developmental goals by 2020. From 1970 to 2000, deforestation led to a 25.5% decline in forested land, causing a significant 10.2% rise in excess runoff. Moreover from 2001 to 2021, the nation lost 17% of its total land to deforestation. These trends emphasize the need for a thorough investigation of sustainable conservation efforts in Malaysia. This study focuses on the Langat basin in Malaysia, evaluating past and future land use changes and their effects on the basin's hydrological response. The study employed key informant reports, population growth data, observed land use change, field survey and agricultural land availability considered for developing change scenarios. We emphasized the significance of integrating diverse modeling methods to analyze LULC changes effectively. The use of a semi -distributed hydrological model, SWAT, in combination with Markov chain and Multi -Layer Perceptron (MLP) model and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques proved to be an integrated and suitable tool for comprehensive change analysis and modeling of land use. Markov chain modeling is valuable for predicting land use changes over time, providing input scenarios for SWAT simulations. MLP is a powerful algorithm to capture non-linear relationships and complex patterns in the data, enhancing the modeling accuracy. The simulation results, based on historic land use data (1984-2006-2010) and projected future land use maps (2030-2050-2080), revealed a consistent pattern of urban expansion and deforestation leading to increased streamflow. Projections indicated a substantial rise in streamflow by 20%, 61%, and 71% for the 2030s, 2050s, and 2080s, respectively. To mitigate potential flood and sediment loss, it is crucial to involve local stakeholders such as local communities, government bodies, environmental organizations, and businesses. Such analysis facilitates understanding their perspectives and concerns regarding afforestation and urban expansion control, informing future development programs and land use planning effectively.

TI  - How Can Jurisdictional Approaches to Sustainability Protect and Enhance the Rights and Livelihoods of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Tropical forests are posited to hold up to one-third of the solution to slow climate change. It is estimated that over two-hundred million "forest peoples"-including indigenous peoples and local communities-live within and depend upon tropical forests. To successfully mitigate climate change, we must find new forms of collaboration that meet the goals of forest-dependent communities for secure land rights, equitable participation in decision-making, and dignified livelihoods in conjunction with meeting commitments to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2018, 34 subnational governments and 18 indigenous and local community organizations announced their endorsement of the "Guiding Principles for Collaboration between Subnational Governments, Indigenous Peoples, and Local Communities." The Guiding Principles of Collaboration (GPC) are a set of 13 universal tenets which lay out a blueprint for collaboration between subnational state actors, indigenous peoples and local communities to recognize rights, support livelihoods, strengthen participation of forest-dependent communities in decision-making, and protect indigenous and community environmental defenders within the context of joint action for climate change mitigation. Their implementation would advance the integration of climate justice in subnational efforts for forest conservation. Taking the GPC as a point of departure, we explore how jurisdictional approaches to sustainability can protect and enhance the rights and livelihoods of indigenous peoples (IP) and local communities (LC). We develop and apply a suite of indicators to assess existing conditions across 11 tropical forest jurisdictions toward meeting the commitments described in the GPC. Our findings suggest that while the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities are recognized within national legal frameworks, implementation and security of those rights is uneven across subnational jurisdictions. Participation of IP and LC is not yet formalized as part of jurisdictional climate change mitigation initiatives in most cases, limiting their potential to inform policy outcomes and benefit-sharing mechanisms. Monitoring the implementation of the GPC may foster greater accountability for commitments, as well as collective action and learning to support regional transformations to sustainability.

TI  - The long-term effects of active management and landscape characteristics on carbon accumulation and diversity within a seasonal dry tropical ecosystem
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Reforestation is the largest natural climate solution, while potentially reversing the biodiversity crisis, especially in tropical countries. Dry tropical forests are of particular interest because they experienced greater historic loss, and offer large reforestation opportunities. This study addressed the potential of secondary forests in dry tropical systems regenerating after 60 + years in cattle pasture to accumulate carbon while increasing floristic diversity. Total carbon and woody species diversity were quantified within experimental treatments established 15 years ago. Initial active management practices included removing exotic grass with herbicide, excluding cattle by constructing live fences, and monitoring succession relative to proximity to forested riparian zones and slope position. Overall, carbon accumulated relatively slowly in this landscape (1.30 MgC Ha(-1) Yr(-1)). Differences were seen between management practices and landscape characteristics. Lower slope plots, adjacent to forested zones, had significantly more carbon than upper slope plots, isolated from riparian zones. The initial application of herbicide decreased total carbon. However, natural regeneration of two valuable timber species with small seeds, Astronium graveolens and Cedrela odorata, benefited from this initial treatment. Live fences that were initially planted to exclude cattle significantly increased carbon of regenerating woody species. Lianas were abundant at this successional stage. Almost half of all inventoried trees (44%) had at least one liana climbing through them, with the most common species being Bauhinia glabra and Macherium microfolium. Some valuable timber tree species found within older, protected riparian forests were not yet regenerating in any treatment, such as the wind-dispersed species, Cieba pentandra, and the animal dispersed species, Hymenaea coubaril. These species may need to be actively planted at the mid-successional stage (similar to 15-20 years) to restore biodiversity. A trade-off between timber value, diversity, and carbon sequestration must be considered in reforestation programs and this depends on landscape characteristics and management. Passive management, even with invasive grass species, is a practical option when sites are located near forested riparian zones due to low cost and high timber value of a suite of native species that naturally regenerate. No intervention is needed other than continual protection from fire and grazing. However, low-cost management, such cutting lianas and enrichment planting at the mid-successional stage, is likely to increase carbon accumulation and diversity. More active management, such as planting drought-tolerant, higher timber value tree species, is recommended at sites isolated from forested riparian zones on upper slopes where carbon accumulation is lower. Tropical forest regeneration mechanisms in proximity to forest fragments can be surprisingly resilient if chronic human impacts are removed.

TI  - Seed-Bird co-occurrence networks in cocoa agroforests: Morphological matching analysis reveals shading effects on network organization
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
AB  - Tropical forests are highly vulnerable to ongoing deforestation, which often involves converting land for agricultural use. While tropical agroforests have been promoted as wildlife-friendly systems, limited information is available on the ability of agroforests to provide diverse fruits that attract birds and thus contribute to essential ecological processes, such as seed dispersal. Here, we evaluated the organization of tropical seed-bird cooccurrence networks in cocoa agroforests of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Specifically, we investigated the influence of (i) landscape and local predictors in shaping the structure of seed-bird co-occurrence networks; and (ii) species traits in explaining their interactive role in the networks. We constructed matrices of presence-absence interactions based on morphological matching among the beak width of frugivorous bird species and the size of ornithochorous seed species (both native and exotic species), using field data of seed rain and understory bird surveys from 15 cocoa agroforests. We further evaluated both the effects of landscape forest cover and local shading on five network indices and how functional traits of birds and seeds explain their importance to the network. In total, we obtained 467 events of potential plant-bird interactions, which revealed a modular pattern. We also observed that only canopy shading significantly affected network connectance, and seed diameter was a significant predictor in explaining tree species contribution in the network. Therefore, our findings show that cocoa agroforests with greater shading will have greater opportunities for interactions between frugivorous birds and plants. We also observed that plants with small seeds play a more relevant role in the co-occurrence interaction network. Based on findings, we emphasized that cocoa agroforests likely maintain certain mutualistic relationships to ensure ecosystem functionality and demonstrate that co-occurrence networks have great potential for future seed dispersal networks in agricultural ecosystems.

TI  - A bioenergy- focused versus a reforestation- focused mitigation pathway yields disparate carbon storage and climate responses
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Limiting global warming to 2 degrees C requires urgent action on land - based mitigation. This study evaluates the biogeochemical and biogeophysical implications of two alternative land - based mitigation scenarios that aim to achieve the same radiative forcing. One scenario is primarily driven by bioenergy expansion (SSP226Lu- BIOCROP), while the other involves re/afforestation (SSP126Lu- REFOREST). We find that overall, SSP126Lu- REFOREST is a more efficient strategy for removing CO2 from the atmosphere by 2100, resulting in a net carbon sink of 242 - 483 PgC with smaller uncertainties compared to SSP226Lu- BIOCROP, which exhibits a wider range of -78 - 621 PgC. However, SSP126Lu- REFOREST leads to a relatively warmer planetary climate than SSP226Lu- BIOCROP, and this relative warming can be intensified in certain re/afforested regions where local climates are not favorable for tree growth. Despite the cooling effect on a global scale, SSP226Lu- BIOCROP reshuffles regional warming hotspots, amplifying summer temperatures in vulnerable tropical regions such as Central Africa and Southeast Asia. Our findings highlight the need for strategic land use planning to identify suitable regions for re/afforestation and bioenergy expansion, thereby improving the likelihood of achieving the intended climate mitigation outcomes. Significance Our study compares two land - based mitigation scenarios that limit global warming to 2 degrees C, primarily driven by bioenergy expansion and re/afforestation. While the re/afforestation- focused scenario excels in CO2 removal with lower uncertainties, it could lead to a relatively warmer regional climate than the bioenergy expansion-focused scenario, especially in regions unfavorable for tree growth. Despite the global cooling effect, the bioenergy expansion- focused approach, however, reshuffles regional warming hotspots, potentially amplifying summer temperatures in vulnerable regions such as Central Africa and Southeast Asia. Our study highlights the importance of carefully locating suitable re/afforestation and bioenergy expansion regions for achieving intended climate mitigation outcomes. Our research provides valuable insights for future land use planning and policy decisions to mitigate climate change.

TI  - Coordination and cross-sectoral integration in REDD plus : experiences from seven countries
T2  - CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Ever since a global mitigation mechanism that aims to reduce emissions by avoiding deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) was introduced in climate change negotiations, governance challenges in implementing this concept in tropical forest countries have received considerable attention. In particular, multilevel governance has been identified as a key challenge, as REDD+ aims to tackle local deforestation activities through a global results-based financial scheme. This paper will present an analysis from seven REDD+ countries (Brazil, Cameroon, Indonesia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Tanzania and Vietnam) where 293 qualitative interviews were conducted with national-level REDD+ actors. We examined what kind of multilevel coordination problems emerge, particularly in relation to horizontal, cross-sectoral coordination, and analysed these problems through the concepts of functional alignment, institutional complexity and accountability. We argue that there are problems with coordination that have emerged due to failures in recognizing the key multilevel issues. REDD+ is not adequately integrated into existing policies, and there is a gap between REDD+ and sectoral and national development policies. This leads to overlapping regulations and unequal resource allocation among sectors. Our analysis suggests that effective coordination mechanisms for REDD+ should be built on existing mechanisms and experience, include all the stakeholders, ensure the flow of information across the levels and harness the potential of REDD+ itself to overcome multi-sectoral problems. At the national level, there is great awareness of the issues that hinder coordination and effective REDD+ implementation, but this awareness does not seem to be matched by the actions taken to date.

TI  - Use of logging roads by terrestrial mammals in a responsibly managed neotropical rainforest in Guyana
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Selective logging is the most widespread use of tropical forests. Building logging roads facilitates access to previously remote rainforests, and so proper management is essential for ensuring biodiversity retention in logged landscapes. Terrestrial mammals often directly use logging roads (via movement corridors, hunting or foraging), making them vulnerable to poorly managed roads. Here we explore how the presence, arrangement and use of logging roads influence terrestrial mammal occupancy and detection within a Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified logged forest in Guyana. We compared camera trap data from20 natural 'game' trails in an unlogged area, with camera trap data from 23 sites set near to or on logging roads within the Iwokrama forest. Our findings showed high occupancy within logged areas with no statistically significant difference to unlogged areas. Higher detections were noted along secondary and feeder roads compared to skid trails and the natural trails in control areas. Additionally, our data showed a negative correlation between occupancy and distance to village for a scatter hoarding rodent, most likely driven by subsistence hunting by local communities. Our results indicate that proper road management geared towards the monitoring and guarded access of logging roads, can have a positive effect on terrestrial mammal occurrence within responsibly managed rainforests.

TI  - Rules of thumb for predicting tropical forest recovery
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
AB  - Questions: Natural regeneration is increasingly recognized as a potentially cost-effective strategy to reach ambitious forest landscape restoration targets, but rates of recovery are notoriously variable. We asked how well initial habitat conditions after cessation of agriculture predict forest recovery after nearly a decade. We aimed to provide land managers with general rules of thumb to assess when it is necessary to invest resources in active restoration, such as tree planting, to accelerate forest recovery.
   Location: Coto Brus County, Puntarenas, Costa Rica.
   Methods: We compiled data on initial vegetation structure, soil nutrients, prior land-use history and surrounding forest cover at 13 sites. After 8.5 years, we measured vegetation indicators commonly used to assess forest recovery, namely amount of canopy closure and number and diversity of woody recruits.
   Results: Two variables, grass cover and canopy closure, measured 1.5 years after site abandonment, explained 47-87% of five of the six response variables after 8.5 years; recovery was faster in sites with lower grass cover and higher canopy closure initially. Waiting an additional year to measure initial vegetation variables did not improve model fit. Time since the original forest was cleared explained 62% of change in canopy cover, whereas percentage of surrounding forest cover, length of pasture use and soil variables explained minimal additional variation.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that two easily measurable vegetation variables can provide guidance to land managers and policy makers about where to invest scarce restoration resources to facilitate forest recovery.

TI  - Secondary forests offset less than 10% of deforestation-mediated carbon emissions in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Secondary forests are increasing in the Brazilian Amazon and have been cited as an important mechanism for reducing net carbon emissions. However, our understanding of the contribution of secondary forests to the Amazonian carbon balance is incomplete, and it is unclear to what extent emissions from old-growth deforestation have been offset by secondary forest growth. Using MapBiomas 3.1 and recently refined IPCC carbon sequestration estimates, we mapped the age and extent of secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon and estimated their role in offsetting old-growth deforestation emissions since 1985. We also assessed whether secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon are growing in conditions favourable for carbon accumulation in relation to a suite of climatic, landscape and local factors. In 2017, the 129,361 km(2)of secondary forest in the Brazilian Amazon stored 0.33 +/- 0.05 billion Mg of above-ground carbon but had offset just 9.37% of old-growth emissions since 1985. However, we find that the majority of Brazilian secondary forests are situated in contexts that are less favourable for carbon accumulation than the biome average. Our results demonstrate that old-growth forest loss remains the most important factor determining the carbon balance in the Brazilian Amazon. Understanding the implications of these findings will be essential for improving estimates of secondary forest carbon sequestration potential. More accurate quantification of secondary forest carbon stocks will support the production of appropriate management proposals that can efficiently harness the potential of secondary forests as a low-cost, nature-based tool for mitigating climate change.

TI  - Fencing promotes fast recovery of demographic processes after grazing-driven collapse in Bursera graveolens forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Global change pressures are jeopardizing the functioning and structure of most tropical forests and clouding the future for their biodiversity and provided services. Although the impact of direct destruction through deforestation and fragmentation is currently in the research portfolio, overgrazing, which is more diffuse and generalized but chronic, especially in the seasonal dry forests, has been by far less addressed. Overgrazing can lead to a dramatic change in natural regeneration, often triggering the collapse of dominant species. The almost monospecific dry forests of Bursera graveolens, one of the most representative forest of the Tumbesian region, are on the verge of extinction due to both direct destruction and chronic overgrazing and regeneration collapse in forest remnants. Here, we evaluated the impact of a very simple measure, the installation of fences, on the regeneration of ecological processes affecting the dominant species. We mapped and measured all Bursera individuals with a height greater than or equal to 30 cm in six 1-ha plots, 3 within and 3 outside fenced areas. Using spatial point pattern analysis, we inferred the importance of demographic and ecological processes affecting adults and juveniles in fenced and unfenced areas. The spatial structure of adults was similar in fenced and unfenced areas, varying from random to aggregated patterns, showing that fences did not interfere with ecological processes affecting adult trees. On the contrary, we found 2765 juveniles in the three fenced plots but none in free ranging areas. Juveniles showed heterogeneous clustered patterns, and their distribution and growth were negatively influenced both by the presence and the height of adult trees. On average, there was an exclusion zone of 10 m around adult trees were recruitment of juveniles was limited. Competition among juveniles appeared to be negligible. All in all, these results suggest that, in addition to recruitment, two of the main mechanisms that rule tree population dynamics in tropical forests, i.e., dispersal limitation and a Janzen-Connell-like mechanism favoring recruiting far from adult trees have been immediately restored in the fenced area. This shows that fencing is a viable tool for a fast regeneration and conservation of Bursera forests.

TI  - Conservation set-asides improve carbon storage and support associated plant diversity in certified sustainable oil palm plantations
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Maintaining forest conservation set-asides is a key criterion of sustainability certification of many crops that drive tropical deforestation, but their value for carbon storage and associated biodiversity is unclear. We conducted vegetation measurements to examine the benefits of set-asides for aboveground carbon stocks (AGC) in certified oil palm plantations on Borneo, and whether their AGC is positively associated with plant diversity. The mean estimated AGC of live trees and palms >= 10 cm diameter in set-asides in certified oil palm plantations (52.8 Mg ha(-1)) was > 1.5-times that of oil palm (30.3 Mg ha(-1)), with some plots supporting similar AGC to primary forest. For lowland Borneo, we estimate that the average AGC of oil palm plantations with 10% coverage of set-asides is up to 20% greater than the average AGC of oil palm plantations without set-asides, newly demonstrating carbon storage as a benefit of conservation set-asides. We found positive relationships between AGC and plant diversity, highlighting the carbon-biodiversity co-benefits of set-asides. However, set-asides had a lower density of tree seedlings than continuous primary forest, indicating potential suppression of future tree regeneration and AGC. Our findings support the application of zero-deforestation during agricultural development to conserve areas of remaining forest with high AGC and high biodiversity. We recommend management practices that boost regeneration in existing set-asides (e.g. enrichment planting), which would be most effective in larger set-asides, and could substantially increase the AGC of agricultural landscapes without removing land from production, and help conserve forest-dependent biodiversity.

TI  - Characterization of Canopy Gaps identified with spatial GLAS/ICESat data in the Bolo-Est Classified Forest (Southwest Côte d'Ivoire)
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The study presents an analysis of using the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System of Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (GLAS/ICESat) for the detection and characterization of canopy gaps in the Bolo-Est classified forest. This classified forest is located in southwest C & ocirc;te d'Ivoire, a region facing increasing deforestation due to agriculture, in particular cocoa cultivation. The main objective of the study was to demonstrate the effectiveness of this Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor for mapping canopy gaps, crucial for understanding the dynamics of tropical forest degradation. The methodology used integrates key steps: acquisition and pre-processing of GLAS/ICESat data, normalization of elevations to correspond to the World Geodetic System (WGS 84), calculation of canopy heights, detection of gaps via a thresholding process, and validation of results by field observations. The analysis revealed that 52% of the points analyzed corresponded to gaps, covering 19% of the study area, mainly caused by human activities such as agriculture and logging. The gaps identified vary in size from 50 m2 to 100 m2, indicating large canopy gap sizes in this forest. The results confirm that LiDAR GLAS/ICESat offers interesting accuracy and efficiency for detecting canopy gaps as a complement to traditional optical and radar remote sensing methods. The LiDAR approach thus provides a good understanding of degradation processes, offering useful data for environmental monitoring and sustainable forest management. This study demonstrates the potential of LiDAR remote sensing to support conservation initiatives such as the reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), contributing to the accurate assessment of anthropogenic canopy gaps, and proves a promising tool for the sustainable management of tropical forests on a national scale.

TI  - Object-Based Mapping of Aboveground Biomass in Tropical Forests Using LiDAR and Very-High-Spatial-Resolution Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Developing countries that intend to implement the United Nations REDD-plus (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation, and the role of forest conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) framework and obtain economic incentives are required to estimate changes in forest carbon stocks based on the IPCC guidelines. In this study, we developed a method to support REDD-plus implementation by estimating tropical forest aboveground biomass (AGB) by combining airborne LiDAR with very-high-spatial-resolution satellite data. We acquired QuickBird satellite images of Kampong Thom, Cambodia in 2011 and airborne LiDAR measurements in some parts of the same area. After haze reduction and atmospheric correction of the satellite data, we calibrated reflectance values from the mean reflectance of the objects (obtained by segmentation from areas of overlap between dates) to reduce the effects of the observation angle and solar elevation. Then, we performed object-based classification using the satellite data (overall accuracy = 77.0%, versus 92.9% for distinguishing forest from non-forest land). We used a two-step method to estimate AGB and map it in a tropical environment in Cambodia. First, we created a multiple-regression model to estimate AGB from the LiDAR data and plotted field-surveyed AGB values against AGB values predicted by the LiDAR-based model (R-2 = 0.90, RMSE = 38.7 Mg/ha), and calculated reflectance values in each band of the satellite data for the analyzed objects. Then, we created a multiple-regression model using AGB predicted by the LiDAR-based model as the dependent variable and the mean and standard deviation of the reflectance values in each band of the satellite data as the explanatory variables (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 42.8 Mg/ha). We calculated AGB of all objects, divided the results into density classes, and mapped the resulting AGB distribution. Our results suggest that this approach can provide the forest carbon stock per unit area values required to support REDD-plus.

TI  - Artificial bat roosts did not accelerate forest regeneration in abandoned pastures in southern Costa Rica
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Artificial roosts have been proposed as a tool for augmenting bat populations and catalyzing tropical forest regeneration. In the best case scenario, roosts would attract seed-carrying bats (Family Phyllostomidae) into degraded pastures and form nucleating patches of native vegetation. We tested this scenario by monitoring 48 artificial roosts in pastures and adjacent forest fragments in southern Costa Rica over 2 years. Half of the pasture roosts were exposed to direct sunlight and half were affixed to 4-m living stakes of Erythrina poeppigiana (Walp.) O.F. Cook that provided shade. After 2 years, 94% of roosts in forest and 40% of roosts in pasture had been used by bats at least once - primarily for nocturnal feeding. Maximum daily temperature inside of roosts was the best microclimatic predictor of bat visitation. We identified at least five species of bats that visited roosts, including two frugivores (Carollia and Glossophaga spp.). Bat-mediated seed dispersal increased with the number of frugivorous bat detections at roosts, but seedling recruitment did not increase with either bat detections or seed abundance over a 2-year period. Given that bats rarely used roosts in pastures, and bat visitation did not increase seedling recruitment, our data suggest that artificial bat roosts did not accelerate forest regeneration in abandoned, premontane pastures in southern Costa Rica. This method could be refined by investigating alternative roost designs, barriers to seedling recruitment below roosts, improvement of roost microclimatic conditions in pastures, and ability of bats to detect roosts in different habitats.

TI  - EVALUATION OF THE LITTER AND SOIL SEED BANK TRANSPOSITION AS A FOREST RESTORATION OF DEGRADED AREAS METHODOLOGY
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the viability of the litter and soil seed bank transposition as a forest restoration of degraded areas methodology. The litter and soil samples of 1 x 1 m were collected at a depth of 5.0 cm in a secondary semideciduous forest in Vicosa, MG, Brazil. The litter and soil samples were deposited in seedbeds in which the superficial soil (10 cm) was previously removed. Three treatments were performed as well as a separate control with five repetitions, totaling 20 samples. The first treatment (T1) was the litter transposition only, the second treatment (T2) was the soil seed bank only, the third treatment (T3) was the transposition of the litter together with the soil seed bank and the control (T). During a period of six months, 327 individuals of trees and shrubs and 864 herbaceous individuals were identified. Among the tree and shrub species occurring in the samples, 74% were classified as pioneers, and 26% were classified as other ecological groups. The most abundant tree species were Cecropia hololeuca with 151 individuals. Among the herbs, Oxalis corniculata was the most abundant, with 329 individuals. The differences of density and species richness between the treatments were significant, with the greatest richness in treatment T3 and the greatest densities in treatments T2 and T3. Therefore, it is concluded that the transposition of the seed bank is a promising methodology to stimulate forest restoration in degraded areas, being more efficient when the superficial soil is used with the litter.

TI  - Patterns of tree community differences in the core and buffer zones of a nature reserve in north-western Vietnam
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - In tropical forest conservation, areas with full statutory protection are often surrounded by buffer zones. Information on the patterns of tree community structure differences in these zones is helpful to evaluate the conservation efficacy. Our study was implemented within a biodiversity hotspot, in the Ta Xua Nature Reserve of north-western Vietnam, which has a statutorily protected core zone and a buffer zone, where local H'Mong people are permitted low intensity forest use. The forests are rich in tree species (249 observed). Many of these tree species provide non-timber forest products (NTFPs) (48%) or valuable timber (22%), and 18 species are red-listed. Overall tree density was not different in the two zones, but tree diameter and species richness were lower in the buffer zone. At the tree level, logistic regression analysis indicated that red-listed status, large diameter, and low density of conspecifics increased the probability of tree absence from the buffer zone but not the potential use as a NTFP. However, most NTFP species had different densities in the core and buffer zones, and this correlated with signs of human interference. At the species level, the density of species was the most important variable, and rarity strongly increased the probability of species absence. Our results also indicate that rare and red-listed trees were depleted in the buffer zone. In consideration of conservation goals, the future monitoring of these species at the Ta Xua Nature Reserve and other protected areas is needed, and conservation measures most likely need to be improved.

TI  - Recovery of biomass and merchantable timber volumes twenty years after conventional and reduced-impact logging in Amazonian Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Concerns about the sustainability of tropical forestry motivated this study on post-logging timber and carbon dynamics over a 20-year period in Paragominas, Para, Brazil. Previously unlogged forest was subjected to conventional logging (CL), reduced-impact logging (RIL), or was set aside as an unlogged control. All trees >= 25 cm DBH and all trees of commercial species >= 10 cm DBH were monitored in a 24.5 ha plot in each treatment, with a 5.25 ha subplot in each for monitoring all trees >= 10 cm DBH. Above-ground biomass and bole volumes of merchantable species were tracked based on 10 inventories made between 1993 and 2014. Pre-logging biomass and bole volumes of commercial species were estimated as 237, 231, and 211 Mg ha(-1), and 78, 80, and 70 m(3) ha(-1), in the RIL, CL, and unlogged plots, respectively. One year after logging, biomass was reduced 14% by RIL and 24% by CL with corresponding merchantable species volume reductions of 21% and 31%. By 2014, biomass and bole volumes of commercial species had recovered 95% and 98% of their pre-logging stocks in the RIL plot but only 76% and 72% in the CL, plot, respectively; timber volumes from large trees (>= 50 cm DBH) were only recovered to 81% in the RIL plot and to 53% in the CL plot. Over the first twenty years after logging, average volume increments from commercial species were substantially higher in the RIL plot (0.72 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1)) than in the CL plot (0.08 m(3) ha(-1) 1 year). Recovery of both biomass and timber volumes were temporarily reversed between 2009 and 2014 due to a 4-fold increase in annual mortality rates in the RIL plot and a 5.5-fold increase in the CL plot (as well as a 3-fold increase in the control plot), all presumably related to the extreme drought of 2010. Our findings support the claim that use of RIL techniques accelerates rates of biomass and timber stock recovery after selective logging. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A recent history of forest fragmentation in southwestern Ivory Coast
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - This study provides monitoring and spatial analysis of forest fragmentation based on high-resolution remote sensing, in order to give a framework for assessing residual biodiversity in the Guiglo-Tai region. Massive deforestation has taken place, mainly in the last 20 years, 79% of unprotected forests have been eliminated on the 100 X 100 km study area. Deforestation is also beginning to encroach on protected areas. Forest fragments are mainly found close to the deforestation front. In areas which were first deforested, forest fragments are very scarce and are restricted to less productive soils; they are often severely degraded. Young secondary forests develop on abandoned fields, but primary forest regeneration seems unlikely in light of the distance from seed sources and the increase in population pressure. Conservation initiatives in this zone of high biodiversity should focus on protected areas, taking into account short and long term benefits for the local population.

TI  - Erosion Potential Estimation by Network Measurement of Soil Properties in Coastal Areas after Clearcutting
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
AB  - Invasive white leadtrees (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) are contributing to the destruction of coastal ecosystems and biodiversity in humid subtropical and tropical regions. Sudden clearcutting of invasive tress can lead to substantial soil loss, which subsequently reduces the efficiency when indigenous vegetation is restored. Soil samples (n = 142) were collected using the grid method to measure soil properties and to spatially analyze the soil erosion potential in the studied area after clearcutting of the invasive trees. Results indicated that the soil erosion rates ranged from 21 to 249 tons ha(-1) yr(-1), and the eroded soil depths ranged from 0.30 to 3.40 cm yr(-1) after clearcutting. The network measurements for determining the mortality ratio of the restored indigenous vegetation demonstrated that Ficus benjamina L., Macaranga tanarius, and Scaevola taccada (Gaertner) Roxb were likely to be susceptible to damage from the substantial amount of soil loss and low SOC content. During the period between clearcutting and establishing the next stand of plants for reforestation, the network measurements for determining the soil properties and estimating the spatial heterogeneity of soil erosion potential are regarded as a major issue of concern regarding the efficiency of subsequent restoration efforts.

TI  - Analysing deforestation by remote sensing coupled with structural equation models: example of the cloud forest of mount Oku (Cameroon)
T2  - ACTA BOTANICA GALLICA
AB  - Habitat destruction and land use change are major causes of biodiversity erosion on Earth, especially in tropical regions. Monitoring studies or even surveys of species and community diversity in changing landscapes or disturbed areas require an assessment of the land cover changes over time. Here, we present a method combining remote sensing and structural equation models (SEM) to describe and analyse landscape dynamics. We focus on the mount Oku as an example, which is a mountain area located in north-west Cameroon. This site hosts the largest remaining tract of Central African cloud forest, a biodiversity hotspot threatened by contemporary land-use changes. Our aim is to characterize land cover changes over the last three decades and to quantify and elucidate the causes of deforestation and forest fragmentation. For this purpose, we integrate several Landsat satellite images taken between 1978 and 2007 in a Geographic Information System (GIS), and compare changes in land-use types. We assess forest fragmentation over this period by comparing the number, the area and the perimeter of forest fragments, and derive a forest fragmentation index. Finally, we quantify the respective effects of natural (altitude, slope) and human (human density, distance to villages) factors on deforestation using SEM. We evidence two periods in the dynamics of the cloud forest cover: a period of intense deforestation (1978-2001), followed by a period of re-afforestation (2001-2007). The forest cover lost 62.1% of its area (12,060 ha) between 1978 and 2001, corresponding to an averaged deforestation rate of 579 ha.yr(-1). Deforested areas were mainly converted into crop lands (+75.6% between 1978 and 1988), under the pressure of an increasing human density, which was multiplied by 20 between 1921 and 2005 and doubled during the last 18 years. After 2001, the forest cover stabilized with the appearance of numerous small fragments of secondary forest, reflecting the success of the local biodiversity protection programs. Despite this recent progression of the forest cover, the proportion of ancient forest has continuously decreased from 1978 to 2007, indicating that deforestation is still ongoing. In 2007, the forest cover was a mosaic composed of 66% of recent secondary forests (i.e. forests appeared after 1978) and only 34% of ancient forests (i.e. present before 1978). Between 1978 and 2007, the number of forest fragments increased from 2627 to 5183, their average area decreased from 7.4 to 1.8 ha, and perimeter from 912 to 446 m, and the forest fragmentation index increased by 285.7%. Deforestation started from lower altitudes (<2300 m, before 1988) and progressed towards higher altitudes (2100-2900 m) between 1988 and 2001. SEM showed that altitude and slope had a significant negative effect on human density, explaining why the deforestation has been low on steep slopes and/or at higher altitudes. Our study reveals that the last fragments of the primary cloud forest of mount Oku could be definitively lost in the next decades. As tropical primary forests are irreplaceable ecosystems that host numerous endemic species, we recommend (1) to urgently protect the last remnants of ancient forest for their biological value; clear-cuts, grazing in forest interior and fires should be excluded from these areas, and (2) to extend secondary forests around ancient forest fragments so that they can act as a protective buffer and be managed as community forests and used for hunting and logging activities.

TI  - Does heterogeneity in regenerating secondary forests affect mean throughfall?
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB  - As secondary tropical forests grow, their canopy structure and density change. This affects the canopy storage and aerodynamic roughness, and thus the amount of water that is lost to interception. Because interception is a considerable part of total evapotranspiration, it is important to assess how interception changes as secondary forests mature, and how this is affected by forest structure. However, the effects of tropical forest regeneration, and in particular changes in forest structure, on mean throughfall are so far poorly studied. This hampers the estimation of the interception loss, and thus the water balance, for regenerating forests. Therefore, we monitored throughfall for twelve regenerating, logged-over forest plots in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo over a 7-month period to determine the effects of forest regeneration on mean throughfall and tested if inclusion of measures of forest heterogeneity improves the prediction of mean throughfall compared to estimates based on tree height or density alone. Mean throughfall varied between 74% and 89% (average: 84%) of precipitation and was lowest in regenerating forest plots with a longer time since logging. There was a significant negative relationship between mean throughfall and tree density or basal area, as well as variables reflecting forest heterogeneity (i.e., the Shannon Diversity Index and the coefficient of variation of the diameter at breast height). Nevertheless, the inclusion of these indicators of heterogeneity did not improve model performance substantially; the best model was a linear relation with tree density alone. These results suggest that in the context of logged and regenerating forests in Sabah, mean throughfall depends mainly on tree density and is not substantially affected by species diversity or structural heterogeneity. To see if mean throughfall could be estimated over larger spatial scales based on LiDAR data, we also tested the relation between mean throughfall and LiDAR-derived Top of Canopy (TCH) but this relation was not significant for our study plots. A more in-depth analysis of LiDAR-products, such as point clouds, may be needed to estimate mean throughfall over large areas in tropical rainforests.

TI  - Conservation status of tropical dry forest remnants in Nicaragua: Do ecological indicators and social perception tally?
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Intensive deforestation is reducing dry tropical forest areas worldwide and increasing its fragmentation. Forest remnants can be the basis for the future recovery of this forest type if appropriate management practices are applied. This requires a better knowledge of their conservation status and the assessment of their perceived value by land users. In this study we compare the structure, species richness and diversity of different types of tropical dry forest remnants in Nicaragua and we assess their conservation status based on a new index: Social simplified Importance Value Index (SsIVI). This index summarizes both ecological indicators and the perception by local stakeholders of the conservation status of the tree species present. Results show that gallery and hillslope forest remnants have higher species richness and diversity than isolated vestigial patches. In all remnants, species richness and diversity is higher in the tree layer than in the regeneration layer. No differences are observed in valorisation among different types of remnants either for the tree layer or for the regeneration layer. In the hillslope forests, where several degrees of disturbance are present, the valorisation decreases with increasing degradation. Results of species composition and forest structure indicate a strong degradation of dry tropical forest remnants in Nicaragua. However, the similar social valorisation of the three types of remnants suggests that they face similar threats but also similar opportunities to be preserved. A decrease in valorisation with increasing degradation warns about the potential loss of the most degraded areas, unless forest restoration is applied.

TI  - Duration of Cattle Ranching Affects Dung Beetle Diversity and Secondary Seed Removal in Tropical Dry Forest Landscapes
T2  - INSECTS
AB  - Simple Summary The use of inadequate cattle ranching practices (e.g., fire, agrochemical applications, long term extensive grazing, lack of paddock rotation in pastures) could have negative consequences on biodiversity and ecological functions. In this study, the influence of cattle ranching duration on the diversity of dung beetles and seed removal was evaluated in pastures having different times of establishment in a tropical dry forest landscape. Dung beetle species richness was similar along the gradient of grazing ages, but the diversity of common and dominant species declined with increasing grazing age. Seed removal was mainly carried out by an exotic species. Although native dung beetles persisted at low abundances along this gradient, the consequences of land use changes and inadequate practices in similar landscapes could lead to their disappearance.Abstract Cattle ranching is an economic activity responsible for the loss of large extensions of tropical dry forest around the world. Several studies have demonstrated that the use of inadequate practices of this activity in tropical forests (e.g., fire, agrochemicals, and lack of rotational grazing systems of cattle in pastures) have negative consequences on dung beetle diversity and their ecological functions. In the present study, the influence of the cattle ranching duration gradient on the diversity of dung beetles and seed removal was evaluated. This study was carried out in pastures with different times of establishment of cattle ranching (between 4 and 40 years) in a tropical dry forest of Mexico. Overall, the species richness of dung beetles was similar along the gradient of grazing ages. However, the diversity of common (q1) and dominant (q2) species decreased and was associated with an increasing abundance of exotic species and a decreasing abundance of native species. Seed removal was mainly carried out by four beetle species, among which the exotic species Digitonthophagus gazella was the most important. The results establish that the duration of cattle ranching primarily influences the composition of dung beetle communities, as reflected in changes in the structure and function of their assemblages in the pastures. Although native dung beetles persist at low abundances along this gradient, the consequences of land use changes are undeniable in other similar ecosystems where these species could definitively disappear.

TI  - Biomass and carbon balance in a dry tropical forest area in northeast Brazil
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
AB  - Forest ecosystems play an important role in mitigating the concentration increase of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere through carbon sequestration by plants and its storage in biomass and soil. The objective was to determine the aerial biomass carbon stock in a dry tropical forest in Brazil. It was developed between 2012 to 2015, in an area with an advanced regeneration stage (50 years) in the semi-arid region of Pernambuco and it was used 40 permanent plots (400 m2) distant 80 m apart, with 50 m from the border, totaling 1.6 ha of the area to sample the shrubby-arboreal component, where all individuals with circumference at breast height (1.30 m of the soil) equal or greater than 6 cm were identified, measured and labeled in 2012 and remeasured in 2015. It was calculated the biomass and carbon stocks through developed equations available in the literature. The results showed that the total biomass and carbon stock in the first year was 27.97 e 12.92 Mg.ha-1 while in 2015 it was 18.49 and 8.39 Mg.ha-1 respectively. The results showed a biomass and carbon stock reduction of more than 30% in the period evaluated, even this, the area manages to present values within the expected pattern for the region, assuring the importance of sustainable forest management of these native/ natural vegetation areas.

TI  - Consequences of plantation harvest during tropical forest restoration in Uganda
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Timber plantations have recently received considerable attention as a forest restoration strategy for heavily degraded lands in the humid tropics. Plantations can facilitate secondary forest regrowth by providing an understory environment more favorable for native plant recruitment than unmanaged degraded habitats. To better understand secondary forest development and to evaluate plantation use as a restoration strategy, we studied natural forest succession after plantation harvest in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We asked four questions concerning using plantations as a restoration tool. How does timber harvest affect forest succession? How does initial on-site recruit availability (e.g., seeds, seedlings) after logging influence successional pathways? How easily can forest succession be enhanced through intervention? How does using exotic timber plantations to restore forests compare with fire exclusion as a restoration strategy? Timber harvesting killed or severely damaged many native stems, hindering subsequent forest regrowth. Despite this setback, native stem densities 4-6 years after logging equaled or surpassed native stem densities in unlogged plantations, suggesting timber removal accelerated forest succession. Successional habitats with high and low initial densities of on-site recruits first diverged in forest structure and composition, but then converged for many of these variables within 6 years of logging. Intervening to accelerate forest succession met with mixed results. Removing non-tree vegetation did not enhance tree establishment, growth, or survival after 2 years. However, leaving standing, dead timber trees as perches for seed-dispersing birds seemed to increase seedling establishment relative to control areas. Mortality and growth of seedlings planted into successional habitats 1-2 and 5-6 years after logging were similar, and predicting individual species responses based on successional status was unsuccessful. We compared succession in unlogged and logged (5-6 years after logging) plantations to a similar aged site where fires were excluded but no plantation species established. Our results suggest excluding fire is a better strategy for promoting forest succession than establishing then not harvesting plantations. Fire exclusion versus establishing then harvesting timber are comparable restoration strategies differentially enhancing tree sapling recruitment and growth, respectively. While forest regeneration was successful where fire was excluded long-term fire exclusion may be difficult, and several non-ecological challenges to using plantations exist (e.g., the conflict of managing for biodiversity versus timber production). In summary, our research suggests managers should carefully weigh the risks of using plantations or fire exclusion against other forest restoration strategies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Governing sustainable forest management in the new climate regime
T2  - WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE
AB  - The newly appreciated role of deforestation and forest degradation as globally significant sources of carbon emissions has focused fresh political attention and large prospective financial flows on tropical forest management. Negotiations at the Thirteenth Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change produced a 'road map' toward including compensation to tropical countries for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) in a future global climate agreement. The prospect of a global REDD mechanism has spurred the development of REDD initiatives by national governments, international organizations, and private actors. These new initiatives are facing many of the same forest governance challenges that have stymied past efforts to improve the conservation and management of tropical forests. To be effective, efficient, and equitable, REDD efforts will not only have to reverse the economic incentives that drive forest loss, but will also need to clarify land tenure, link to international efforts to curb illegal logging and trade, and manage trade-offs among competing objectives. They will also need to strengthen the institutional capacity for inclusive REDD design processes, transparent monitoring of carbon emissions and financial flows, and cross-sectoral and cross-scale coordination. At the same time, REDD initiatives could provide opportunities to accelerate the required forest governance reforms. (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Chronic human disturbance affects plant trait distribution in a seasonally dry tropical forest
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - The effects of human disturbance on biodiversity can be mediated by environmental conditions, such as water availability, climate and nutrients. In general, disturbed, dry or nutrient-depleted soils areas tend to have lower taxonomic diversity. However, little is known about how these environmental conditions affect functional composition and intraspecific variability in tropical dry forests. We studied a seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) under chronic anthropogenic disturbance (CAD) along rainfall and soil nutrient gradients to understand how these factors influence the taxonomic and functional composition. Specifically we evaluated two aspects of CAD, wood extraction and livestock pressure (goat and cattle grazing), along soil fertility and rainfall gradients on shrub and tree traits, considering species turnover and intraspecific variability. In addition, we also tested how the traits of eight populations of the most frequent species are affected by wood extraction, livestock pressure, rainfall and soil fertility. In general, although CAD and environmental gradients affected each trait of the most widespread species differently, the most abundant species also had a greater variation of traits. Considering species turnover, wood extraction is associated with species with a smaller leaf area and lower investment in leaf mass, probably due to the indirect effects of this disturbance type on the vegetation, i.e. the removal of branches and woody debris clears the vegetation, favouring species that minimize water loss. Livestock pressure, on the other hand, affected intraspecific variation: the herbivory caused by goats and cattle promoted individuals which invest more in wood density and leaf mass. In this case, the change of functional composition observed is a direct effect of the disturbance, such as the decrease of palatable plant abundance by goat and cattle herbivory. In synthesis, CAD, rainfall and soil fertility can affect trait distribution at community and species levels, which can have significant implications for the ecosystem functioning of SDTF under increasing levels of disturbance, climate change and soil nutrient depletion.

TI  - Climate change and deforestation: The evolution of an intersecting policy domain
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB  - Forests and climate change are increasingly dealt with as interconnected policy issues. Both the potential synergies and policy conflicts between forest conservation and restoration and climate change mitigation now receive sustained and high level attention from academic, policy analysis and practitioner communities across the globe. Arguably the most pronounced contemporary policy manifestation of this is the debate on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (or REDD+) by which governments and private investors from developed countries may compensate actors in tropical forest countries for reducing forest loss beneath an agreed baseline. Problems of climate-forest policies implementation and governance, however, can also be found in countries such as Canada, the USA, the UK and Australia. The future of instruments like REDD+ is uncertain with growing critiques on payment and performance-based mechanisms and unresolved issues of governance, government and accountability. This paper, and the special issue it introduces, illustrates that in the REDD+ debate many contentious issues have resurfaced from past debates. These issues include the participation and rights of local communities in forest policy and management; the relationship between internationally agreed payment and performance-based programmes and formal democratic decision-making processes and structures; the complexities of rights to carbon versus tenure rights; and the ways in which - in spite of the high expectations of both developing and developed countries to combat carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation through the REDD+ mechanism - effective climate-focused forestry policies are seldom found in most tropical forest-rich countries. REDD+ is now very much the dominant discourse at the forest-climate interface, and one with a primary focus on measurability to communicate carbon mitigation results across various levels. However, this serves to disperse and displace, rather than resolve, policy-making on non-carbon values. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Mixed plantations might contribute to sustainable land use because of complementary nutrient use. Our objective was to assess the nutrient economy of five native tree species and their response to different neighbor trees in an experimental plantation in Panama. In our study, H. crepitans was the least nutrient efficient tree species. H. crepitans produced less biomass in mixtures than in monocultures while Cedrela odorata - the most nutrient efficient species - produced more biomass independent of stem growth rates because they acquired more nutrients in mixtures than in monocultures.Three-species mixtures had increased mean Ca concentrations in branches and stems and increased N, P, K, Ca, and Mg storage in aboveground biomass compared to monocultures suggesting complementary resource uptake. Our results highlight the need to properly consider species-specific nutrient requirements and species interactions when designing tree mixtures for afforestation.

TI  - USE VALUES OF WOODY SPECIES USED IN AGROFORESTRY: COCOA AGROFORESTS IN CENTRAL CAMEROON
T2  - BOIS ET FORETS DES TROPIQUES
AB  - In humid tropical regions, the value to farmers of agroforestry systems is often difficult to assess. Based on an inventory of plant species in 14 cocoa agroforests in central Cameroon, this study developed a participatory assessment using a PRA (Participatory Rural Appraisal) scoring system to quantify the value given by farmers to each species according to their uses. Altogether, 86 species were identified. The five species most commonly found were African plum, Dacryodes edulis at 18% of the trees identified, avocado, Persea americana at 11%, limba, Terminalia superba at 10%, the fig tree, Ficus mucoso at 5% and Albizia adianthifolia at 3%. Twenty-two species (26%) were not used at all by the farmers, who defined seven different uses for the other species. Among these, the highest use value was attributed to the cocoa tree (20%). The next five tree species with high use values were, in decreasing order, the ayous, Triplochyton scleroxylon, sapelli, Entandrophragma cylindricum, African plum, Dacryodes edulis, oil palm, Elaeis guineensis, and mango, Mangifera indica. The use profile for cocoa agrofo rests showed that these are mainly managed by farmers for sales of timber and non-timber products and for home consumption of non-timber and medicinal products. These results show that technical innovations to improve cocoa agroforestry systems must take into account their multiple functions and their complexity.

TI  - Ecological succession succession drives the structural change of seed-rodent interaction networks in fragmented forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - While deforestation and fragmentation can cause massive species loss in forest ecosystems, forest regeneration can also drive successional changes in species composition. Although studies have sometimes documented the effects of these compositional changes on interspecific interactions, few studies have investigated changes in the structure of plant-animal networks. We investigated how interaction networks of assemblages of rodents and tree seeds changed with forest fragmentation and succession in a subtropical region. We compared seed-rodent interactions between 14 secondary forest patches that ranged in area from 2 to 58 ha, and from 10 to at least 100 years old, representing a successional gradient. We expected that deforestation and fragmentation would reduce seed production and diversify rodent communities, resulting in higher interaction strengths and connectivity, but weak nestedness (i.e., specialists interact with subsets of the species interaction of generalists). We measured the frequency of rodents eating and removing seeds (interaction strength) in each patch during 3 successive years, using seed tagging and infrared camera trapping, and calculated the properties of the seed-rodent networks. We found that the relative abundances of seeds and rodents changed with stand age not patch size, as did seed-rodent interactions: older patches produced more seeds, contained fewer individuals and species of rodents, and had seed-rodent networks with lower connectance and interaction strength, but higher nestedness. Connectance and interaction strength decreased with metabolic per capita seed availability (as measured by seed energy value); nestedness increased with seed richness, but decreased with rodent abundance. At species level, we found stand age and patch size showed significant effects on seed or rodent abundance of a few species. We also found seed coat thickness and starch contents had significant effects on network metrics. Our results suggest that during succession after deforestation, seed-rodent interactions in these sub-tropical forests change from a state dominated by high seed removal and highly connected seed-rodent networks to a state with more seeds and highly nested networks. From a management perspective of our study region, succession age, not fragment size, and network structure should be paid more attention so as to facilitate the restoration processes of degraded forests. Rodent management should be applied to protect native forest species and exclude incursive ones from farmlands and human residences at early succession stage.

TI  - Dynamics of Natural Regeneration: Implications for Landscape Restoration in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - This study aimed to understand post-agricultural natural forest regeneration in the Southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest and its possible role as a cost-effective, passive approach to forest restoration. The study characterized vegetation structure, floristic composition, and the dynamics of secondary forest chronosequences. Data were collected from 159 plots (10 x 10 m each) across forest remnants in Santa Catarina State, covering forest ages that ranged from 2 to 60 years of regeneration after swidden agriculture. Only areas with no signs of degradation were sampled in order to provide a description of vegetation characteristics that could be used to identify and monitor natural regeneration. A total of 11,455 woody plants were identified and classified into 334 species representing 71 families. As the succession process unfolds, the continuous turnover of species makes forests more diverse and structurally complex. Floristic similarity among forest types is observed during the early stages of succession, but decreases over time. Pioneer species dominate young secondary forests, representing about 40% of the basal area up to 10 years of regeneration. Shade-tolerant species start colonizing the sites at early ages; however, they become more important structural elements only after 30 years of succession. The observed patterns of forest structure and species diversity largely conform to the post-agricultural succession seen in many tropical forests. The high species diversity found in this study highlights the importance of natural regeneration as a strategy to restore ecosystems. Floristic data can be used as a reference for choosing suitable species for active restoration, as well as contributing to the design of integrated restoration strategies. We herein reinforce the potential of natural regeneration as part of large-scale restoration programs, which would be particularly attractive to family farmers by the low cost of supplies and labor.

TI  - Scale-dependent effects of forest restoration on Neotropical fruit bats
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Neotropical fruit bats (family Phyllostomidae) facilitate forest regeneration on degraded lands by dispersing shrub and tree seeds. Accordingly, if fruit bats can be attracted to restoration sites, seed dispersal could be enhanced. We surveyed bat communities at 10 sites in southern Costa Rica to evaluate whether restoration treatments attracted more fruit bats if trees were planted on degraded farmlands in plantations or island configurations versus natural regeneration. We also compared the relative influence of tree cover at local and landscape spatial scales on bat abundances. We captured 68% more fruit bat individuals in tree plantations as in controls, whereas tree island plots were intermediate. Bat activity also responded to landscape tree cover within a 200-m radius of restoration plots, with greater abundance but lower species richness in deforested landscapes. Fruit bat captures in controls and tree island plots declined with increasing landscape tree cover, but captures in plantations were relatively constant. Individual species responded differentially to tree cover measured at different spatial scales. We attribute restoration effects primarily to habitat structure rather than food resources because no planted trees produced fruits regularly eaten by bats. The magnitude of tree planting effects on fruit bats was less than previous studies have found for frugivorous birds, suggesting that bats may play a particularly important role in dispersing seeds in heavily deforested and naturally regenerating areas. Nonetheless, our results show that larger tree plantations in more intact landscapes are more likely to attract diverse fruit bats, potentially enhancing seed dispersal.

TI  - Multiscale modelling of the drivers of rainforest boundary dynamics in Kakadu National Park, northern Australia
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
AB  - Understanding the relative importance of factors driving savanna-forest dynamics is vital as changes in the extent of tropical forests can have major impacts on global climate and carbon balance, biodiversity, and human well-being. Comparison of aerial photographs for 50 rainforest patches in Kakadu National Park had previously revealed a landscape wide expansion of rainforest boundaries between 1964 and 2004. Here, we used generalized linear and mixed effects models to assess the role of fire, buffalo impact, and patch characteristics in determining the rate of boundary change. The analysis was conducted at both the patch scale, and within-patch ( plot) scale, to capture the different processes operating. At the patch scale, the rate of change was best explained by rainforest type and historical buffalo impact. Fire activity, patch size, and fragmentation were not important predictors of the rate of change. At the plot scale, distance from rainforest edge was the most important predictor of the probability of change, while the fragmentation and aspect of the boundary were unimportant. Rainforest expansion has occurred through a process of margin extension rather than eruption of new patches. The rainforest expansion is consistent with having been driven primarily by shifts in global change phenomena, such as increased rainfall and atmospheric CO2, rather than changes in disturbance regime. It appears that the current fire regimes are not sufficiently destructive to limit the overall expansion of the rainforest patches. Rainforest type and historical buffalo impact have mediated the rate of change at the patch scale.

TI  - The nature of a 'forest transition' in Thua Thien Hue Province, Central Vietnam - A study of land cover changes over five decades
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Informed from historical case studies of land cover change and development in northern countries, forest transition (FT) theories have a tendency to precast specific conclusions. Considering the case of a so-called FT in Th.a Thien Hue Province in tropical Central Vietnam, we investigated 1.) whether such a 'FT' indeed reflects a resurgence of genuine forest, 2.) whether the land cover changes can be explained through conventional 'pathways' of FT, and 3.) in which ways the changes may or may not portend 'sustainable development'. Using satellite imagery and topographic maps, we produced maps for twenty land cover types for the years 1966, 1973, 1979, 1988, 1998, 2008, 2016 and 2019 and analysed land cover change over time. We contextualize these results with reference to the historical and scientific literature on Vietnam, and find that 1.) the forestlands represent a historically rich bio-cultural landscape; 2.) considerable forest destruction resulted from the Second Indochina War rather than classical degradation pathways; 3.) in the post-war period altered forestland spaces and re-emerging land uses interacted with state-led re-territorialization and socialist plans for land resource development, influencing shifts in forest cover; 4.) during 1979-1988 state-led intensive timber logging in remaining rainforests (causing widespread forest degradation) somewhat paradoxically (in terms of conventional FT models and theories) coincided already with a slight increase in lower-biomass tree cover; 5.) after 1988 logging in natural forests was officially prohibited (logging bans), and forestry shifted to a reliance on wood produced in acacia-based plantations (largely on lands officially allocated to households); and 6.) this shift went along with a significant state-led restructuring and development of land use policies and the promotion of forest-relevant economic industries. 'Restoration' of tree cover mainly consisted of the expansion of exotic tree plantations, but - at least intermittently - this may also have mitigated impacts on natural forests. We conclude with some reflections on the FT-outcome, its 'sustainability', and future trajectories and possibilities of land cover changes in TTHP.

TI  - Disentangling the effects of facilitation on restoration of the Atlantic Forest
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Facilitation is an important ecological mechanism with potential applications to forest restoration. We hypothesized that different facilitation treatments, distance from the forest edge and time since initiation of the experiment would affect forest restoration on abandoned pastures. Seed and seedling abundance, species richness and composition were recorded monthly during two years under isolated trees, bird perches and in open pasture. Seed arrival and seedling establishment were measured at 10 m and 300 m from the forest edge. We sampled a total of 131,826 seeds from 115 species and 487 seedlings from 46 species. Isolated trees and bird perches increased re-establishment of forest species; however, species richness was higher under isolated trees. Overall, abundance and richness of seeds and seedlings differed between sampling years, but was unaffected by distance from the forest edge. On the other hand, species composition of seeds and seedlings differed among facilitation treatments, distance from the forest edge and between years. Seedling establishment success rate was larger in large-seeded species than medium-and small-seeded species. Our results suggest that isolated trees enhance forest re-establishment, while bird perches provide a complementary effort to restore tree abundance in abandoned pastures. However, the importance of seed arrival facilitation shifts toward establishment facilitation over time. Arriving species may vary depending on the distance from the forest edge and disperser attractors. Efforts to restore tropical forests on abandoned pastures should take into account a combination of both restoration strategies, effects of time and proximity to forest edge to maximize regeneration.

TI  - Assessing the structural differences between tropical forest types using Terrestrial Laser Scanning
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Increasing anthropogenic pressure leads to loss of habitat through deforestation and degradation in tropical forests. While deforestation can be monitored relatively easily, forest management practices are often subtle processes, that are difficult to capture with for example satellite monitoring. Conventional measurements are well established and can be useful for management decisions, but it is believed that Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) has a role in quantitative monitoring and continuous improvement of methods. In this study we used a combination of TLS and conventional forest inventory measures to estimate forest structural parameters in four different forest types in a tropical montane cloud forest in Kafa, Ethiopia. Here, the four forest types (intact forest, coffee forest, silvopasture, and plantations) are a result of specific management practices (e.g. clearance of understory in coffee forest), and not different forest communities or tree types. Both conventional and TLS derived parameters confirmed our assumptions that intact forest had the highest biomass, silvopasture had the largest canopy gaps, and plantations had the lowest canopy openness. Contrary to our expectations, coffee forest had higher canopy openness and similar biomass as silvopasture, indicating a significant loss of forest structure. The 3D vegetation structure (PAVD - Plant area vegetation density) was different between the forest types with the highest PAVD in intact forest and plantation canopy. Silvopasture was characterised by a low canopy but high understorey PAVD, indicating regeneration of the vegetation and infrequent fuelwood collection and/or non-intensive grazing. Coffee forest canopy had low PAVD, indicating that many trees had been removed, despite coffee needing canopy shade. These findings may advocate for more tangible criteria such as canopy openness thresholds in sustainable coffee certification schemes. TLS as tool for monitoring forest structure in plots with different forest types shows potential as it can capture the 3D position of the vegetation volume and open spaces at all heights in the forest. To quantify changes in different forest types, consistent monitoring of 3D structure is needed and here TB is an add-on or an alternative to conventional forest structure monitoring. However, for the tropics, TLS-based automated segmentation of trees to derive DBH and biomass is not widely operational yet, nor is species richness determination in forest monitoring. Integration of data sources is needed to fully understand forest structural diversity and implications of forest management practices on different forest types.

TI  - Drivers of forest cover transitions in the Selva Maya, Mexico: Integrating regional and community scales for landscape assessment
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Tropical forest disturbance contributes to global climate change from increased carbon emissions, and causes loss of biodiversity. Thus, identifying its direct causes and underlying drivers are necessary for effective land use, climate change control and conservation strategies. We integrated remote sensing forest cover data from 2000 to 2018 with georeferenced national socioeconomic and field-collected household data to determine underlying drivers behind forest cover transitions (e.g., deforestation, degradation, and recovery) in the Selva Maya ('Mayan Forest') of southeast Mexico. Spatial and statistical models (multinomial logistic regression, log-linear regression, and analysis of variance) and social science methods (household surveys and qualitative comparative analysis) were applied to evaluate and identify socioeconomic, institutional, and environmental drivers intervening at landscape and community scales. Forest cover transitions varied geographically, and associated drivers differed by scale of analysis. Using multiple methods improved the understanding of drivers. Population growth, poverty, and roads are major drivers influencing forest cover transitions (e.g., deforestation, degradation, and recovery) in the landscape. Community scale analysis identified more drivers and offered greater detail of causal relationships. Besides population and poverty, less off-farm employment, agriculture and cattle production, immigrant population, and private property were related to deforestation and degradation. Indigenous populations, forest dependence, off-farm employment, and common property were associated with forest conservation. Sustainable rural development should include poverty alleviation through diversification of economic activities and increased off-farm employment opportunities. Conservation measures should pursue the enhancement of forest value for local subsistence and economic benefits by strengthening community forest management and enterprises.

TI  - Biomass and carbon stocks of four vegetation types in the Llanos Orientales of Colombia (Mapiripan, Meta)
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
AB  - Agricultural lands occupy 38% of global land surface and are expected to grow significantly in the next years, increasing the need for more sustainable practices, as well as better informed conservation practices of natural ecosystems. Carbon stocks are important estimates for the assessment of potential emissions caused by defor-estation, and therefore widely used in strategies to mitigate climate change in agroforestry systems. Although research on biomass and carbon accumulation in agricultural lands is well documented, comparisons with adjacent natural forest areas are uncommon, mainly in tropical regions. Here, we used forest inventory data and allometric models to estimate biomass and carbon stocks of natural vegetation types (gallery forest-GF, morichal-MOR, and savanna-SAV) and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) crops in the Orinoquia bioregion, in Eastern Colombia. We found that natural forests (GF and MOR) hold 542.45 Mg ha-1 of aboveground biomass, whereas oil palm plantations store 284.87 Mg ha-1. Morichal vegetation, commonly known as peat swamp forests, accumulated the highest aboveground biomass and carbon per hectare among all vegetation types (natural and agricultural), with an estimate of 402.76 Mg ha-1. Thus, although oil palm crops are great reservoirs of biomass and carbon at the landscape level, it is the combination of natural and agricultural lands which assure highest carbon sequestration in the study area. These results highlight the importance of preserving natural areas in agricultural landscapes for climate mitigation and conservation of biodiversity, which may jointly benefit plantations sus-tainable development.

TI  - Near surface air humidity in a megadiverse Andean mountain ecosystem of southern Ecuador and its regionalization
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - The near surface humidity in a megadiverse mountain ecosystem in southern Ecuador is examined on the basis of Relative Humidity (RH) measurements inside the natural mountain forest and at open sites along an altitudinal gradient from 1700 to 3200 m. The main methodological aim of the current study is to generate a humidity regionalization tool to provide spatial datasets on average monthly mean, minimum and maximum RH, Specific Humidity (q) and Specific Saturation Deficit (D-S) by using observation data of RH. The maps based on data of the period 1999-2009 are needed by ecological projects working on various plots where no climate station data are available. The humidity maps are generated by combining a straightforward detrending technique with a Digital Elevation Model and a satellite-based land cover classification which also provides the relative forest cover per pixel. The topical aim of the study is to investigate the humidity distribution and structure of both manifestations of our ecosystem (pastures and natural vegetation) with special considerations to the ecosystem regulation service by converting natural forest into pasture. The results reveal a clear differentiation over the year. partly triggered by the change of synoptic weather situation but also by land cover effects. Humidity amplitudes are particularly low during the main rainy season when cloudiness and rainfall are high, but markedly pronounced in the relative dry season when daily irradiance and outgoing nocturnal radiation causes distinct differences between the land cover units. Particularly the upper pasture areas gained by slash and burn of the natural forest exhibit the lowest humidity values while the humidity inside the mountain forest is significantly higher due to the regulating effects of the dense vegetation. Thus, clearing the forest clearly reduces the regulation function (regulating ecosystem services) of the ecosystem which might become problematic for reforestation under future global warming.

TI  - Socioecological system and potential deforestation in Western Amazon forest landscapes
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
CP  - 5th Busan Global Water Forum
AB  - The ecosystem services provided by tropical forests are affected by deforestation. Territorial management strategies aim to prevent and mitigate forest loss. Therefore, modeling potential land use changes is important for forest management, monitoring, and evaluation. This study determined whether there are relationships between forest vulnerability to deforestation (potential deforestation distribution) and the forest management policies applied in the Ecuadorian Amazon.
   Proxy and underlying variables were used to construct a statistical model, based on the principle of maximum entropy that could predict potential land use changes. Entropy can be seen as a measure of uncertainty for a density function. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis and the Jackknife Test were used to validate the model. The importance of input variables in the model was determined through: Percent Contribution (PC) and Permutation Importance (PI). The results were compared with prevailing regional forest management strategies.
   The socioeconomic variables that provided the largest amount of information in the overall model (AUC=0.81) and that showed most of the information not present in other variables were: "Protected areas-Intangible zone" (PC=24%, PI=12.4%), "timber harvesting programs" (PC=21.7%, PI=4.7%), "road network" (PC=18.9%, PI=7.7%), and "poverty rate" (PC=3.7%, PI=6.1%). Also, the biophysical variable "temperature" (PC=7,9%, PI=22.3%) provided information in the overall model.
   The results suggested the need for changes in forest management strategies. Forest policies and management plans should consider integrating and strengthening protected areas and intangible zones, as well as restricting timber harvesting in native forest and establishing forest areas under permanent management. Furthermore, the results also suggested that financial incentive programs to reduce deforestation have to be evaluated because their present distribution is inefficient. In this context, conservation incentive plans need to be revised so that they focus on areas at deforestation risk. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mangrove restoration: A potential tool for coastal management in tropical developing countries
T2  - AMBIO
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems are important coastal habitats in tropical regions, directly or indirectly supporting subsistence and commercial fisheries. However, they are under threat in developing countries, where stands are being felled to accommodate a variety of human activities. An estimated aerial loss of 1% per year is occurring in Asia and the Pacific, with some areas having lost 70% of their original mangrove habitat. Due to continued disturbance, altered soil conditions and limited dispersal, natural recovery may be slow. This paper discusses mangrove restoration as a potential tool for the management of coastal ecosystem. We examine briefly the connections between mangroves and fisheries, and outline an ecosystem approach to evaluate mangrove restoration initiatives. Past mangrove restoration projects in developing countries have focussed only on methods of re-establishing trees, with little attention given to assessing whether ecosystem function is restored. However, the goal of mangrove restoration projects should be to actively promote a return to the natural assemblage structure and function (within the bounds of natural variation) that is self-sustaining. This goal requires: (i) identifying the natural state, including key organisms in maintaining the physical substratum, community structure and food webs maintaining fish stocks; (ii) developing biotechnology for restoring key organisms; and (iii) assessing the long-term success of the project. As restoration promises to be an important tool for maintaining coastal ecosystem health in developing countries, priority should be given to incorporating restoration projects and their evaluation into coastal management plans.

AB  - If global policies intended to promote forest conservation continue to use the definition of "forest" adopted in 2001 by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (an area of >0.05-1 ha with >10-30% cover of plants >2-5 m tall at maturity), great quantities of carbon and other environmental values will be lost when natural forests are severely degraded or replaced by plantations but technically remain "forests." While a definition of "forest" that is globally acceptable and appropriate for monitoring using standard remote sensing options will necessarily be based on a small set of easily measured parameters, there are dangers when simple definitions are applied locally. At the very least, we recommend that natural forest be differentiated from plantations and that for defining "forest" the lower height limit defining "trees" be set at more than 5 m tall with the minimum cover of trees be set at more than 40%. These changes will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from what is now termed forest "degradation" without increasing monitoring costs. Furthermore, these minor changes in the definition of "forest" will promote the switch from degradation to responsible forest management, which will help mitigate global warming while protecting biodiversity and contributing to sustainable development.

TI  - Comparing different densities of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.) for restoration of forest reserves in Pontal do Paranapanema, SP
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
AB  - Increasing reductions of tropical forests, especially in the Mata Atlantica bioma, have led to serious environmental consequences. However, there is a great need for new restoration models in tropical forestry. The aim of this work was to evaluate alternatives to accelerate restoration and decrease costs for such restoration. Pigeon pea may help ecological restoration. The main hypothesis was that different densities of Cajanus cajan can promote ecological restoration. Cajanus cajan was interplanted with native trees in a 2 x 4 m spacing. After 22 and 34 months of planting, four different treatments were evaluated. The treatments were: no guandu between tree lines; two seeds between tree lines; elimination of the one guandu plant after six months of planting and complete elimination of the two guandu plants after six months of planting. For data collection 100 trees were chosen by chance in each treatment. The results showed an increase in height where Cajanus cajan was present. 34 months after planting the total basal area of native trees planted close to two pigeon pea plants were significantly smaller when compared to those planted close to one pigeon pea per tree. The mortality of pioneer species without pigeon pea was significantly superior to the mortality of non-pioneer species in the same condition. The soil structure around Cajanus cajan showed a larger content of organic matter and less phosphorus, when compared to the testimony treatment. This study suggests negative and positive effects for the intercropping of Cajanus cajan and the native trees; therefore the first hypothesis is refuted and the second hypothesis is not.

TI  - Fire Effects on Understory Forest Regeneration in Southern Amazonia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Fire in tropical forests increases tree mortality, degrades forest structure, and reduces carbon stocks. Currently, there are large gaps in understanding how fire affects understory forest structure and composition, interactions with fire recurrence, and long-term impacts. Understanding these changes is critical to evaluate the present and future response of tropical forests to fire. We studied post-fire changes in understory regeneration in forests in Mato Grosso State, southern Amazonia, Brazil, aiming to answer the following questions: (i) does forest structure (basal area) and tree community composition vary with fire frequency and time since the last fire? (ii) does the response differ among strata (e.g., sapling, larger trees)? (iii) are changes in diversity associated with changes in forest structure? We surveyed trees and lianas in previously structurally intact forests that underwent selective logging, followed by different fire histories, including 5 and 16 years after once-burned, 5 years after three times burned, and unburned (control). Overall, species composition (abundance, richness, and number of families) and diversity were highest for the unburned treatment and lowest for the recurrent burned areas. Fire frequency negatively affected plant structure and basal area; basal area of small, medium, and large plants declined significantly by more than 50% in the most frequently burned areas. Richness was positively related to basal area in the three times burned sites and in the 16 years regenerating site for all strata. Our results demonstrate the negative influence of frequent fires on both the composition and structure of small trees in Amazonian forest. These changes to the cohort of small-sized trees may persist and have long-term impacts on forest structure, affecting the capacity, and direction of forest recovery. With wildfire widespread across the region and increasing in frequency, fire may negatively affect tree diversity in remaining selectively logged forests, and affect regional carbon cycling with consequences for the global vegetation carbon sink.

TI  - Barriers to forest regeneration of deforested and abandoned land in Panama
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. In Panama, abandoned agricultural lands that supported tropical rain forest are invaded by the exotic invasive grass Saccharum spontaneum, which precludes native forest regeneration. This study aimed to evaluate the importance of several barriers to forest regeneration and highlight mitigation opportunities.
   2. We examined four barriers to natural regeneration: Saccharum competition, seed dispersal limitation, fire and soil nutrient deficiency. Tree and shrub regeneration was measured in a factorial experiment combining Saccharum cutting treatments, distances from adjacent forest and a prescribed burn to assess the first three barriers, respectively. We compared soil nutrients in Saccharum plots with those from adjacent forest. Additionally, we determined the importance of distance to remnant vegetation (large-leaved monocots, shrubs and isolated trees) on forest regeneration.
   3. Fire significantly decreased plant species richness of forest regeneration. Fire inhibited the germination of most species; the effect was exacerbated by cutting the Saccharum.
   4. Grass competition significantly decreased seedling growth, while soil nutrient deficiency did not affect forest regeneration.
   5. Seed dispersal limitation affected density and species richness. Significantly more species (3x) regenerated at 10 m compared with 35 m from the forest. Mean seedling densities were, respectively, four, three and two times higher under large-leaved monocots, isolated trees and shrubs than in open Saccharum. When seed input was experimentally equalized, large-seeded species had the highest establishment rate, suggesting that if their propagules were dispersed to the site they would regenerate in high proportions. However, under natural conditions they regenerated poorly and represented the most dispersal-limited species group.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that facilitation of natural regeneration may be a feasible, low-cost management option for restoring native forest cover to large areas. Firebreaks must be established to promote biodiversity of forest regeneration. We do not recommend Saccharum cutting or fertilization as site treatments. Shading effectively eliminates Saccharum. Planting a variety of tree species in clumps throughout the Saccharum may overcome dispersal limitations and catalyse natural regeneration. Trees that attract different frugivores are recommended, especially large-seeded forest species.

TI  - The opportunities and challenges associated with developing rubber plantations as carbon sinks in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF RUBBER RESEARCH
AB  - Rubber plantations are among the most important in the world's tropical regions. They play a positive role in carbon sequestration and in delaying climate change, supplying strategic resources of natural rubber (NR), and aiding in poverty alleviation and rural revitalisation. This paper reviews six methods of research on carbon sinks in rubber plantations: the biomass inventory method, the biomass conversion factor continuous function method, the trade potential of carbon sinks method, the calculation method for carbon storage of rubber latex, the eddy covariance method, and the remote sensing image model method. This study clarifies the carbon sink assessment and enhancement model for rubber plantations and describes the composition of the carbon pool, which includes the aboveground and belowground vegetation biomass carbon pools, litter carbon pool, latex carbon pool, and soil carbon pool. It also examines influencing factors such as tree age, global climate change, and human disturbance, as well as improvement pathways including afforestation, fertilisation, irrigation, and tapping, and evaluation methods like field surveys, positional observations, remote sensing monitoring, and model simulation. Research on carbon sequestration in rubber plantations faces challenges, including the unclear dynamics of carbon sources and sequestration, uncertain spatial and temporal patterns, and the long-term lack of accurate monitoring of carbon sinks and technologies for increasing sinks and reducing emissions. Future research should focus on the methodology of rubber plantation carbon sequestration projects, the dynamics of carbon sequestration, and the spatial allocation pattern of carbon sequestration in rubber plantations.

TI  - How do management alternatives of fast-growing forests affect water quantity and quality in southeastern Brazil? Insights from a paired catchment experiment
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
AB  - Fast-growing forest plantations have been expanding in Brazil in the last 50 years, which reach productivities by over 40 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) in reduced rotation between 5 and 15 years. In the 1990s, environmental warnings about these plantations guided research projects seeking to understand their effects on water and propose forest management actions to minimize them. The assessment of forest management effects on water resources is conducted by long-term experiments in paired catchments. In this paper we present results of some studies conducted at the hydrological monitoring centre of Itatinga Experimental Forest Station, of the University of Sao Paulo, where hydrological monitoring began in 1987, and currently include three catchments (83-98 ha) under different forest management regimes: short-rotation Eucalyptus plantation, long-term forest plantation mosaic and native forest restoration. Results show that at similar conditions observed at study area including deep soils and good natural water regulation, hydrological effects vary according to the forest management regime adopted, increasing water consumption and making the flow regime vulnerable to intra- and inter-annual seasonality. Regarding water quality, weekly sampling results showed suspended sediments and nitrate concentrations below water quality thresholds criteria by silvicultural operations, and the effects were transient but higher concentrations of nutrients were observed in intensive management regime. In the study area, reducing the management intensity of forest plantation by increasing the rotation time, adopting forest age mosaic and avoiding the coppice technique are alternative choices that reduced water use and increased flow regulation. Different adopted forest management schemes directly affected water use, showing that in water-deficit tropical regions, management regime of fast-growing forest plantations controls water availability.

T2  - IGARSS 2024-2024 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM, IGARSS 2024
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
AB  - The Atlantic Forest (AF), an endangered biodiversity hotspot, requires vigilant monitoring of recent ecological restoration efforts. Taking advantage of Land Use Land Cover maps' capability to track changes in landscapes, this study investigates their potential in monitoring restoration sites in the AF. We used a large-scale dataset (6,796 polygons - totalling 164 km(2)) encompassing restoration polygons to validate the secondary forest maps of two internationally recognized LULC maps - MAPBIOMAS and JRC Tropical Moist Forest - in ecological restoration sites. Results reveal both maps usually failed in classifying restoration sites as forested lands. Additionally, mapping methodology and sensor spatial resolution limitations excluded half of the dataset's polygons, highlighting vulnerabilities of small-scale projects reliant on Landsat-like data. Addressing these challenges necessitates enhanced monitoring methods, involving the integration of higher-resolution data and the adoption of active remote sensing. These measures are crucial for advancing the precision of ecological restoration monitoring in tropical forests.

TI  - How do primates affect seed germination? A meta-analysis of gut passage effects on neotropical plants
T2  - OIKOS
AB  - Biotic seed dispersal is a key process maintaining biodiversity in tropical forests where most trees produce vertebrate-dispersed seeds. Existing meta-analyses suggest an overall positive effect of vertebrate gut passage on seed germination, but no significant effects for non-flying mammals. However, previous meta-analyses combined rodents (seed predators) and primates (seed dispersers) into the non-flying mammals category, which may confound specific effects of each group on seed germination. However positive effects of monkeys on germination had previously been found in some studies. Here we disentangle the role of Neotropical primates as contributors to seed dispersal in tropical forests by running a meta-analysis to determine the overall magnitude of gut passage effects on seed germination percentage and mean time to germination. We also compare effect sizes as a function of different feeding guilds, gut complexities, and seed size. Our results show a strong, positive effect of primates on seed germination percentage and on the number of days to first germination. Strictly frugivorous monkeys, the group most threatened by extinction, showed the highest dispersal quality, increasing germination percentage by 75%. Primates that include insects in their diets had no average effect on germination percentage or time. Gut passage had different outcomes on seeds with different sizes; both large and small seeds showed similar increases in germination percentages after gut passage, but only large seeds germinated faster than control seeds after gut passage. Our results show a relevant role for primates in providing high seed dispersal quality and as drivers of forest regeneration. The combined effects of defaunation and forest fragmentation may result in decreased regeneration of trees, which has the potential to affect negatively both forest structure and ecosystem processes. Finally, we provide general guidelines for standardizing research on seed dispersal by primates.

TI  - Melissopalynology of honey from the tropical central corridor of the Atlantic Forest, Bahia State, Brazil
T2  - GRANA
AB  - The Central Corridor of the Atlantic Forest is noted for its biodiversity of flora and fauna, with a high number of endemic species. Studies that characterise the tropical bee flora and bee products in these areas are scarce. This study therefore sought to characterise the pollen spectrum of honey from Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera, Apidae) in some municipalities found in the Central Corridor of the Atlantic Forest, in Bahia, Brazil. A total of 16 honey samples from Belmonte, Camacan, Eunapolis, Itabela, Itabuna, Ilheus, Medeiros Neto, and Valenca were analysed. The honey was acetolysed and the mounted slides were analysed under light microscopy, from which at least 500 pollen types per sample were counted. In total, 60 pollen types with botanically determined origin were found, comprising 52 genera in 24 families. For this study, pollen types having a prevalence equal to or greater than 10% in the samples were emphasised. Thus, we found 14 most representative pollen types, related to eight families. Fabaceae was the richest, with a total of four recorded pollen types, of which Mimosa pudica stood out, found in 56.2% of samples. Eucalyptus (Myrtaceae) had a high frequency distribution, especially in Belmonte, Eunapolis, Valenca, and Medeiros Neto, where it was a predominant pollen, due to reforestation with Eucalyptus spp. for commercial purposes in these municipalities. In addition, Alternanthera brasiliana and Chamaecrista were predominant pollen in samples from Camacan and Medeiros Neto, respectively. The similarity analysis revealed the environmental heterogeneity of this tropical region.

TI  - ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL FEASIBILITY OF INTERNATIONAL CARBON OFFSETS
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Forests are important in the global carbon cycle, forming a major sink for carbon. Deforestation is a significant source of carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere. There is some scope to enhance natural carbon sinks, and therefore reduce net emissions of greenhouse gases, through afforestation and conservation of existing forests. Such initiatives may be implemented to ''offset'' emissions of greenhouse gases from other sources. This may be undertaken by private companies, or by governments as part of bilateral agreements or multilateral arrangements. International carbon offsets may be cost effective in terms of reduction of carbon emissions achieved, and may also be one way to mobilise private capital to fund forest conservation. It is argued here that theoretically the international offset of emissions may lead to a resource saving, and that forest conservation, as opposed to afforestation, may bring about many other benefits. However, such international contracts are unlikely to be feasible or make a major contribution to the control of greenhouse gases. The reasons for this are monitoring, enforcement and scientific uncertainties, and the implicit change in property rights involved in ''selling'' carbon sequestration rights.

TI  - Tropical forest restoration: Tree islands as recruitment foci in degraded lands of Honduras
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Tropical forest recovery in pastures is slowed by a number of biotic and abiotic factors, including a lack of adequate seed dispersal and harsh microclimatic extremes. Accordingly, methods to accelerate forest recovery must address multiple impediments. Here, we evaluated the ability of "tree islands" to serve as "recruitment foci" 2 in a two-year study at three sites in northern Honduras. Islands of three sizes (64, 16, and 4 m) and at two distances to secondary forest (20 and 50 m) were created by planting 2 m tall vegetative stakes of two native species: Gliricidia sepium (Fabaceae) and Bursera simaruba (Burseraceae), each in monoculture. Open-pasture "islands" of equal sizes served as controls. Tree islands reduced temperature and light (PAR) extremes as compared to open pasture, creating a microenvironment more favorable to seedling establishment. Seed-dispersing birds (quantified at one site only) showed an overwhelming preference for islands; 160 visits were recorded to islands compared with one visit to open pasture. Additionally, frugivores visited large islands more often, and for longer time periods, than small islands, thereby increasing the likelihood of a dispersal event there. In total, 144 140 seeds belonging to 186 species were collected in islands; more than 80% were grasses. Tree islands increased zoochorous tree seed rain; seed density and species richness were greater in tree islands than in open pasture, and large islands had greater seed density than smaller islands (Gliricidia only), suggesting that they are more effective for restoration. Distance to forest did not affect seed rain. A total of 543 seedlings and 41 species established in islands; > 85% were zoochorous. Seedling density did not differ among treatments (mean 0.2 seedlings/m(2) for islands vs. 0.1 seedlings/m(2) for pasture), although an increasing trend in tree islands over the course of two years suggests that seedling recruitment is accelerated there. Lastly, similar seedling densities were censused in the I m perimeter surrounding islands, suggesting that islands can expand outward into pasture. Planting vegetative stakes to create tree islands in pastures accelerates forest recovery by overcoming a number of impediments, and presents a simple, broadly applicable alternative for facilitating forest regeneration in abandoned pastures.

TI  - Detecting and interpreting secondary forest on an old Amazonian frontier
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE
AB  - Land uses that replace tropical forests are important determinants of terrestrial carbon storage and biodiversity. This includes secondary forest growth after deforestation, which has been integrated into the REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) concept as a means to enhance current forest carbon stocks. Incorporating secondary forest into climate change mitigation efforts requires both accurate measurements and a means to target interventions to achieve additionality. We demonstrate how remote sensing and household survey data can be combined to meet these requirements in 'old frontiers' of the Brazilian Amazon and introduce the idea that annual land-cover transitions - measured at the pixel level and over time - can serve as leading indicators of secondary forest regrowth. The patterns we observe are consistent with the suggested tension between equity and additionality in REDD+: the poorest households on the poorest quality lots already allow forest regeneration. Policy interventions to encourage regeneration are likely to have the greatest additional impact on higher quality lots owned by better capitalized households.

TI  - Carbon stocks in coffee agroforests and mixed dry tropical forests in the western highlands of Guatemala
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Tree removal in Latin American coffee agroforestry systems has been widespread due to complex and interacting factors that include fluctuating international markets, government-supported agricultural policies, and climate change. Despite shade tree removal and land conversion risks, there is currently no widespread policy incentive encouraging the maintenance of shade trees for the benefit of carbon sequestration. In facilitation of such incentives, an understanding of the capacity of coffee agroforests to store carbon relative to tropical forests must be developed. Drawing on ecological inventories conducted in 2007 and 2010 in the Lake Atitlan region of Guatemala, this research examines the carbon pools of smallholder coffee agroforests (CAFs) as they compare to a mixed dry forest (MDF) system. Data from 61 plots, covering a total area of 2.24 ha, was used to assess the aboveground, coarse root, and soil carbon reservoirs of the two land-use systems. Results of this research demonstrate the total carbon stocks of CAFs to range from 74.0 to 259.0 Megagrams (Mg) C ha(-1) with a mean of 127.6 +/- A 6.6 (SE) Mg C ha(-)A(1). The average carbon stocks of CAFs was significantly lower than estimated for the MDF (198.7 +/- A 32.1 Mg C ha(-1)); however, individual tree and soil pools were not significantly different suggesting that agroforest shade trees play an important role in facilitating carbon sequestration and soil conservation. This research demonstrates the need for conservation-based initiatives which recognize the carbon sequestration benefits of coffee agroforests alongside natural forest systems.

TI  - Assessing carbon stocks using indigenous peoples' field measurements in Amazonian Guyana
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Accurate estimations of carbon stocks across large tracts of tropical forests are key for participation in programs promoting avoided deforestation and carbon sequestration, such as the UN REDD+ framework. Trained local technicians can provide such data, and this, combined with satellite imagery, allows robust carbon stock estimation across vegetation classes and large areas. In the first comprehensive survey in Guyana conducted by indigenous people, ground data from 21 study sites in the Rupununi region were used to estimate above ground tree carbon density across a diversity of ecosystems and land use types. Carbon stocks varied between village sites from 1 Tg to 22.7 Tg, and these amounts were related to stem density and diameter. This variation was correlated with vegetation type across the region, with savannas holding on average 14 MgC ha(-1) and forests 153 MgC ha(-1). The results indicated that previous estimates based on remotely sensed data for this area may be inaccurate (under estimations). There were also differences in carbon densities between village sites and uninhabited control areas, which are presumably driven by community use. Recruiting local technicians for field work allowed (a) large amounts of ground data to be collected for a wide region otherwise hard to access, and (b) ensured that local people were directly involved in Guyana's Low Carbon Development Strategy as part of REDD+. This is the first such comprehensive survey of carbon stocks, carbon density and vegetation types over a large area in Guyana, one of the first countries to develop such a program. The potential inclusion of forests held by indigenous peoples in REDD+ programs is a global issue: we clearly show that indigenous people are capable of assessing and monitoring carbon on their lands.

TI  - Anthropogenic disturbance of tropical forests threatens pollination services to acai palm in the Amazon river delta
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. The acai palm Euterpe oleracea Mart. in the Amazon river delta has seen rapid expansion to meet increased demand for its fruit. This has been achieved by transforming lowland forest habitats (floodplains) into simplified agroforests and intensive plantation in upland areas. As acai palm makes an important contribution to the economy and food security of local communities, identifying management approaches that support biodiversity and ecosystem processes that underpin fruit production on acai farms is essential.
   2. We compared flower-visitor communities and acai fruit production in floodplain forests and upland plantations, across gradients of local management intensity (i.e. acai density per ha) and surrounding forest cover. The relative contribution of biotic pollination and degree of pollen limitation were assessed using insect exclusion and hand-pollination experiments.
   3. We found that acai flower visitors are highly diverse (c. 200 distinct taxa) and had variable responses to disturbance. Bee visitation was higher in floodplains and positively related to surrounding forest cover, but other flower visitors, including specialised curculionid beetles, were unresponsive to changes in surrounding forest cover. However, intensive management practices (i.e. high acai palm densities) in floodplains and uplands had contrasting effects on flower-visitor communities, with flower-visitor richness being lower on intensively managed floodplain farms and ant densities being higher on intensive upland farms.
   4. Pollination experiments revealed acai palm to be highly dependent on biotic pollination. Fruit set in open-pollinated inflorescences was positively related to flower-visitor richness and specialised curculionid beetle visitation, whereas the presence of ants on inflorescences had a negative effect.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that pollinators are essential for acai fruit production, but that intensive farming practices have eroded the relationship between surrounding forest cover and ecosystem function in floodplains (i.e. conversion of native forest into simplified agroforests) and increased the frequency of antagonistic interactions in uplands (e.g. high ant densities). These findings underline the value of extensive management practices, such as the maintenance of other tree species within farms and adjacent unmanaged forest patches, to ensure the long-term sustainability of acai fruit production in the Amazon river delta.

TI  - Sacred fig trees promote frugivore visitation and tree seedling abundance in South India
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
AB  - While sacred groves (forest fragments protected for religious reasons) are widely acknowledged to have a beneficial effect on biodiversity conservation, the ecological benefits of individual sacred trees remain unknown. Fig trees are present as sacred trees in human-dominated landscapes across South Asia and are considered keystone species for wildlife in tropical forests. If frugivores continue to visit fig trees in disturbed landscapes, they may deposit seeds of other tree species beneath fig canopies, ultimately facilitating forest regeneration. We studied whether sacred fig trees in Tamil Nadu, India can facilitate seed dispersal in human-dominated landscapes. We quantified abundance of sacred fig trees at the study site, assessed whether seed-dispersing frugivore visitation to fig trees is affected by human disturbance, and compared tree seedling density beneath fig trees and open areas. We found that some species of frugivorous birds and bats will visit large fig trees in conditions of high human disturbance and that tree seedling density is significantly higher under sacred trees compared to open areas. By promoting frugivore activity, sacred fig trees may have a beneficial effect on biodiversity conservation in human-dominated landscapes.

TI  - The paradox of forest conservation in South Africa
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - It would appear from the proportion of South African forests in protected areas that the habitats of vertebrate species are well protected. However, this simple figure is misleading. Firstly, the small total area of remaining forests (3000 km(2)) alters the vulnerability of the fauna. Secondly, a large proportion of the threatened fauna is restricted to forests and many are found in regions subject to heavy human exploitation. The apparent complacency regarding forest vertebrate conservation in South Africa requires re-evaluation in the light of this new information. The vulnerability of fauna must be carefully evaluated before management recommendations can be made, particularly for threatened species.

TI  - REALU vs. REDD plus : Carbon and biodiversity in the Afromontane landscapes of SW Ethiopia
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - A major constraint to current REDD+ initiatives is the arbitrariness of the operational definition of 'forest'. The UN-REDD+ framework ignores the high potential of other (tree containing) land uses for carbon sequestration and the generation of co-benefits, in contrast to a whole landscape approach known as 'Reducing Emissions from All Land Uses' (REALU). To indicate this potential, carbon stocks and biodiversity were assessed at the landscape scale around Jimma, SW Ethiopia. Notwithstanding the indigenous forests' high carbon stocks per hectare (336.96 +/- 120.6 Mg C ha(-1)) 80% of the total carbon stock of the 10(6) ha assessed landscape window was found to be stored in non-forest land uses. Especially local agro-forestry systems, such as managed semi-forest coffee production fragments (179.92 +/- 38.5 Mg C ha(-1)), homegardens (106.26 +/- 16.8 Mg C ha(-1)) and pole wood plantations (112.36 +/- 23.9 Mg ha(-1)) store large amounts of carbon. Together with local maize fields (69.45 +/- 12.3 Mg C ha(-1)), teff fields (69.51 +/- 6.5 Mg C ha(-1)) and grazing lands (76.90 +/- 10.3 Mg C ha(-1)) these non-forest land uses play an important role in a prospective 'high-carbon-stock rural-development' under a REALU framework. A REDD+ approach, applying a stringent forest definition that disqualifies for agriculture and a 30% canopy cover threshold, would only account for 24 Gg C in the 10(6) ha landscape window. Applying the canopy cover threshold alone, would triple the amount to 72 Gg C, while a REALU project would account for the whole 116 Gg landscape carbon. The biodiversity assessment, based on tree community composition and Hill's diversity indices, indicated important biodiversity co-benefits under a REALU approach. Biodiversity indices such as the Hill's Ni diversity of abundant tree species showed a strong positive correlation with local carbon stocks (R-2 = 0.56). Since the cover of indigenous forest is reduced to only 7% of the landscape window's area, most of the remaining trees and biodiversity can be found within the surrounding landscape mosaic. Semi-forest coffee production fragments for example still harbour almost half of all encountered native tree species. An interesting result of the simultaneous biodiversity assessment was that a regrouping of plots based on tree biodiversity provides a more precise and cost efficient way to assess carbon stocks, reducing the number of plots needed with 23%, to achieve the same precision level.

TI  - Taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic bird diversity response to coffee farming intensity along an elevational gradient in Costa Rica
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The expansion of the agricultural frontier in the species-rich tropical regions of the world has generated conflicts between the need to secure food production and the conservation of biodiversity. As natural areas give way to farmlands, the future of sensitive taxa may depend on how intensively the crops are cultivated. In order to better understand the response of avian diversity to cultivation intensity in tropical farmlands, analyses of species richness are increasingly being complemented with information about the birds' functional roles and evolutionary history. In this study, we analysed the association of several features of vegetation composition and structure, as indicators of cultivation intensity in coffee farms in Costa Rica, on the taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic dimensions of avian biodiversity at the local scale across an approximately 2000 m elevational gradient. Bird detections and vegetation measurements were conducted at 120 randomly selected circular plots of 25 m radius, across 51 coffee farms. Using regression modelling and multi-model inference, we related six vegetation features to five biodiversity metrics in this system and evaluated whether the results differed among elevational zones. The most influential vegetation feature was the number of trees with a diameter-at-breast height larger than 30 cm, promoting higher richness, functional redundancy and phylogenetic structure of avian species. Shade from canopy cover and the number of non-coffee crops increased species and phylogenetic richness, respectively. The effect of individual vegetation features on particular biodiversity metrics varied across elevation, possibly due to the idiosyncratic response of each dimension to the elevation gradient or because of local ecological processes. We conclude that vegetation features related to cultivation intensity have effects on avian diversity, but that these effects differ among biodiversity metrics and are sensitive to the environmental context. Consequently, targeted conservation management should be based on more comprehensive studies that include more than one biodiversity dimensions as well as variation in relevant environmental context. In general, our results suggest that, when designing conservation strategies for birds in coffee-dominated landscapes, there is likely no "one-size-fits-all" strategy.

TI  - Composition and diversity of northwestern Amazonian rainforests in a geoecological context
T2  - AMAZONIA: LANDSCAPE AND SPECIES EVOLUTION: A LOOK INTO THE PAST
AB  - The northwestern Amazonian landscape includes most of the representative landscape units that characterize Amazonia, and for this reason it constitutes an excellent place to investigate relationships between the abiotic environment (geology, geomorphology, soils) and biodiversity. In this review we assess these relationships on three temporal/spatial scales. At the macroscale, the geology of this area includes the sub-Andean zone in the west, the Guiana Shield to the north, and the varied Neogene substrate and river valleys. These geological units account for much of the habitat variation that can be linked to species distributions. For instance, observations of different tree species communities in Ecuadorian or Peruvian Amazonia are explained by variations in soils and geological substrate. Mesoscale abiotic heterogeneity is reflected in the spatial configuration of different land units, which create conditions for habitat-specific forest types. Experimental field studies are needed to compare effects of the abiotic environment (water and soil nutrients) with those related to dispersal and species interactions. At microscales, processes in the biotic environment probably contribute most strongly to pattern formation in diversity and composition of floras or plant communities.

TI  - Incorporating a palaeo-perspective into Andean montane forest restoration
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - Reference ecosystems used in tropical forest restoration lack the temporal dimension required to characterise a mature or intact vegetation community. Here we provide a practical 'palaeo-reference ecosystem' for the eastern Andean forests of Ecuador to complement the standard 'reference ecosystem' approach. Pollen assemblages from sedimentary archives recovered from Ecuadorian montane forests are binned into distinct time periods and characterised as 1) Ancient (pre-human arrival), 2) Pre-European (Indigenous cultivation), 3) Successional (European arrival/Indigenous depopulation), 4) Mature (diminished human population), 5) Deforested (re-colonisation), and 6) Modern (industrial agriculture). A multivariate statistical approach is then used to identify the most recent period in which vegetation can be characterised as mature. Detrended correspondence analysis indicates that the pollen spectra from CE 1718-1819 (time bin 4 - Mature (diminished human population)) is most similar to that of a pre-human arrival mature or intact state. The pollen spectra of this period are characterised by Melastomataceae, Fabaceae, Solanaceae and Weinmannia. The vegetation of the 1700s, therefore, provides the most recent phase of substantial mature vegetation that has undergone over a century of recovery, representing a practical palaeo-reference ecosystem. We propose incorporating palynological analyses of short cores spanning the last 500 years with botanical inventory data to achieve more realistic and long-term restoration goals.

TI  - Measuring and explaining the willingness to pay for forest conservation: evidence from a survey experiment in Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Recent research suggests that there is substantial public support (including willingness to pay) for forest conservation. Based on a nationwide survey experiment in Brazil (N = 2500) the largest and richest of the world's tropical developing countries, we shed new light on this issue. To what extent does the public in fact support forest conservation and what factors are influencing support levels? Unlike previous studies, our results show that the willingness to pay for tropical forest conservation in Brazil is rather low. Moreover, framing forest conservation in terms of biodiversity protection, which tends to create more local benefits, does not induce more support than framing conservation in terms of mitigating global climate change. The results also show that low levels of trust in public institutions have a strong negative impact on the public's willingness to pay for forest conservation, individually and/or via government spending. What could other (richer) countries do, in this context, to encourage forest conservation in Brazil and other tropical developing countries? One key issue is whether prospects of foreign funding for forest conservation are likely to crowd out or, conversely, enhance the motivation for domestic level conservation efforts. We find that prospects of foreign funding have no significant effect on willingness to pay for forest conservation. These findings have at least three policy implications, namely, that the Brazilian public's willingness to pay for forest conservation is very limited, that large-scale international funding is probably needed, and that such funding is unlikely to encourage more domestic effort, but is also unlikely to crowd out domestic efforts. Restoring public trust in the Brazilian government is key to increasing public support for forest conservation in Brazil.

TI  - Afforestation to mitigate climate change: impacts on food prices under consideration of albedo effects
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Ambitious climate targets, such as the 2 degrees C target, are likely to require the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Afforestation is one such mitigation option but could, through the competition for land, also lead to food prices hikes. In addition, afforestation often decreases land-surface albedo and the amount of short-wave radiation reflected back to space, which results in a warming effect. In particular in the boreal zone, such biophysical warming effects following from afforestation are estimated to offset the cooling effect from carbon sequestration. We assessed the food price response of afforestation, and considered the albedo effect with scenarios in which afforestation was restricted to certain latitudinal zones. In our study, afforestation was incentivized by a globally uniform reward for carbon uptake in the terrestrial biosphere. This resulted in large-scale afforestation (2580 Mha globally) and substantial carbon sequestration (860 GtCO(2)) up to the end of the century. However, it was also associated with an increase in food prices of about 80% by 2050 and a more than fourfold increase by 2100. When afforestation was restricted to the tropics the food price response was substantially reduced, while still almost 60% cumulative carbon sequestration was achieved. In the medium term, the increase in prices was then lower than the increase in income underlying our scenario projections. Moreover, our results indicate that more liberalised trade in agricultural commodities could buffer the food price increases following from afforestation in tropical regions.

TI  - Resilient fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages across a Caatinga dry forest chronosequence submitted to chronic anthropogenic disturbance
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
AB  - Interest in forest regeneration has increased as secondary forests in regeneration process are cited as the forests of the future. However, remaining forests are subjected to chronic anthropogenic disturbances, which may reorganize tropical biodiversity. This paper investigates the recovery of fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages following slash-and-burn agriculture in the Caatinga dry forest, assessing the roles that chronic disturbances, tree species richness and biomass play in their taxonomic and functional recovery during secondary succession. Butterflies were recorded monthly across old-growth forest stands and areas previously subjected to slash-and-burn agriculture, and with differing times since abandonment. While there was a high degree of similarity in community-level attributes among regenerating forests of different ages, secondary and old-growth forests supported relatively distinct assemblages, both taxonomically and functionally. As expected, chronic disturbance, forest biomass and trees species richness were excellent predictors of taxonomic and functional changes. Specifically, large-bodied and canopy-inhabiting butterflies reached higher abundances in more disturbed habitats, while those ocellus-bearing species that fly in the understory and feed on monocot as larvae responded negatively to disturbance, but benefited from increased forest biomass and tree species richness. Our findings suggest that although regenerating secondary forests can recover values of community-level attributes of fruit-feeding butterflies similar to those of old-growth forests, chronic anthropogenic disturbances across the landscape may be selecting only specific ecological groups that are tolerant to adverse conditions.Implications for insect conservationChronic disturbance can taxonomically and functionally alter butterfly assemblages across forest regeneration and consequently impact their ecological functions.

TI  - Conversion of a tropical forest into agroforest alters the fine root-related carbon flux to the soil
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Large areas of remaining tropical forests are affected by anthropogenic disturbances of various intensities. These disturbances alter the structure of the forest ecosystem and consequently its carbon budget. We analysed the role of fine root dynamics in the soil carbon budget of tropical moist forests in Southeast Asia along a gradient of increasing disturbance intensity. Fine root production, fine root turnover, and the associated carbon fluxes from the fine root system to the soil were estimated with three different approaches in five stands ranging from an old growth forest with negligible anthropogenic disturbance to a cacao agroforestry system with planted shade trees. Annual fine root production and mortality in three natural forest sites with increasing canopy openness decreased continuously with increasing forest disturbance, with a reduction of more than 45% between the undisturbed forest and the forest with large timber extraction. Cacao agroforestry stands had higher fine root production and mortality rates than forest with large timber extraction but less than undisturbed forest. The amount of carbon annually transferred to the soil carbon pool through fine root mortality was highest in the undisturbed forest and generally decreased with increasing forest use intensity. However, root-related C flux was also relatively high in the plantation with planted shading trees. In contrast, the relative importance of C transfer from root death in the total above- and below-ground C input to the soil increased with increasing forest use intensity and was even similar to the C input via leaf litter fall in the more intensively managed agroforest. We conclude that moderate to heavy disturbance in South-east Asian tropical moist forests has a profound impact on fine root turnover and the related carbon transfer to the soil.

TI  - The effect of ecological restoration methods on carbon stocks in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Restoring degraded areas is an effective strategy to reestablish the environmental services provided by the forests including global warming mitigation by carbon sequestration. Restoring lands is especially important in the Atlantic Forest, a global hotspot in Brazil threatened by deforestation. To successfully restore degraded lands, it is necessary to apply the most suitable method for each situation. However, studies comparing restoration techniques are scarce. This lack of information hampers the Atlantic Forest restoration and, given the original complexity of its ecological dynamics, restoration success is even more challenging in this ecosystem. This study aimed to assess carbon stocks (above and belowgmund), carbon content (%), and carbon isotope at 5-year old sites implemented by different restoration methods in southeastern Brazil. The restoration methods tested were active restoration (AR), assisted restoration (AsR), and passive restoration in an abandoned pasture (AP), which were compared to a nearby pasture (P) and a remaining forest fragment (RF). The assessed pools were: tree, coarse roots, fine roots, herbaceous, litter, standing dead wood, fallen dead wood, and soil (0-1 cm, 5-10 cm, 10-20 cm layers). Total carbon stock was higher on RF (152.304 Mg C ha(-1)), followed by the P (84.378 Mg C ha(-1)), AR (66.414 Mg C h(-1)) AsR (65.73 Mg C ha(-1)) and AP (65.581 Mg C ha(-1)). The restoration areas sites are still too young to show significant differences in total carbon stock as a result of different restoration methods. However, carbon stock and carbon content (%) differed among the pools according to the method and, in all cases, the largest carbon pool was soil, which shows the importance of sampling every pool for carbon stock and carbon content (%) estimation. Isotope analysis showed that carbon inputs in the soil had different sources, C3 or C4 plants, depending on the method. We concluded that these young secondary areas are already sequestering carbon, which helps mitigate global warming, and that monitoring every pool is important for a complete assessment, not only to restore secondary forests and understand growth but also for other land-uses such as pastures. Besides, the results obtained can be generalized to other tropical forest ecosystems with similar conditions (local and landscape), constituting a relevant contribution to forest restoration and carbon-sequestration related sciences.

TI  - Tropical forest subjected to intensive post-logging silviculture maintains functionally diverse dung beetle communities
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Commercially logged tropical forests hold high conservation value but are rapidly being converted to lucrative low-diversity plantations. Post-logging interventions that accelerate forest timber and carbon recovery-such as enrichment planting and cutting of woody vines-may reduce both the spatial extent of logging and economic pressures to convert forests, delivering considerable conservation benefits. However, they could also seriously undermine logged forest biodiversity, simplifying forest structure and removing important wildlife microhabitats. To date, no study has investigated the impact of post-logging interventions on invertebrates. Focusing on dung beetles, we explore the effects of intensive vine-cutting and enrichment planting within a largescale post-logging silvicultural project in northern Borneo. We find that for four measures of functional diversity (the facet of diversity that accounts for species traits and functions) and for species richness, treated forest communities are similar to those in unlogged and naturally regenerating forest. Moreover, although community composition in treated forest remains distinct from old-growth forest, it is no different than that in naturally regenerating forest and in fact more closely resembles old-growth than naturally regenerating forest in terms of effective diversity. Our results indicate that logged forests continue to host diverse and functioning dung beetle communities even after silvicultural intensification. Post-logging interventions could therefore play an important role in forest and biodiversity conservation via their incorporation into emerging agendas including REDD+ and the Bonn Challenge.

TI  - Limited effects of low-intensity forest management on ant assemblages in southwestern Amazonian forests
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - One important strategy to conciliate forest conservation and economic development is the use of reduced-impact logging techniques. Here we evaluated the effects of low-intensity forest management on ant assemblages and vegetation structure in a managed area in the southeast of Acre State, Brazil. Ground-dwelling and arboreal ants, and several forest-structure descriptors were sampled in nine paired areas located in control (unlogged) and logged areas in 2005, 2007 and 2009. None of the forest structure predictors were related with either the treatment or the time since logging. However, some ant assemblage' descriptors were related with logging activities. Arboreal and ground-dwelling ant species richness was similar between unlogged and logged areas, but more ground-dwelling ant species were found in areas logged in 2005 compared with areas logged in 2009. Ground-dwelling ant assemblage composition differed between treatments (logged and unlogged) and year of logging, but species composition heterogeneity was similar between areas. Arboreal ant assemblage composition was not related with treatment and year of logging, but assemblage composition was more heterogeneous in managed areas, suggesting that species that forage on the understory vegetation may be more resilient than ground-dwelling species. The general results of functional group approach suggest that changes of species composition between control and managed areas are more related with differences in ant species occurrence than ant species richness. Selective logging had limited effect on both vegetation descriptors and ant assemblage structure, suggesting that the conciliation of impact reduction techniques with low intensity extraction seems a promising alternative for sustainable logging activity in tropical forests.

TI  - National carbon model not sensitive to species, families and site characteristics in a young tropical reforestation project
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Reforestation and restoration offer critical contributions to addressing climate change and biodiversity decline. Enabling carbon credits to be derived from these activities is important for reforestation, particularly since reforestation does not come cheaply. Australia's Carbon Farming Initiative is a world-leading policy that allows carbon credits to be obtained by using published methods-based approaches. Here we apply two different approaches to a young mixed species reforestation project in the wet tropics of Queensland, Australia. One approach assesses carbon sequestration from published allometric equations requiring direct field measurements, and the other applies a national carbon accounting model, FulICAM. Using allometric equations, we found above-ground biomass was influenced significantly by family, species, size class, and the interaction of family and size class. Species in the family Proteaceae outperformed species in other families. Selection of species according to soil nutrient status could enhance growth rates, but if soil nutrients and species responses are not known, then a bet-hedging strategy using mixed species from a variety of families is probably the best option. For three year old forest plots, FulICAM modelled significantly more carbon mass of trees than published allometric models for mixed tropical forests, suggesting that FulICAM needs adjustment to more accurately reflect species, families, local conditions and small-scale sites. Current policy settings are at odds with the needs of carbon farmers, considering the importance of forests and landscape restoration in fighting climate change and biodiversity decline. Legislated national methods allowing the development of species-specific allometrics for small mixed plantations do not account for the costs of developing these allometrics, especially in markets that are marginal.

TI  - Mapped aboveground carbon stocks to advance forest conservation and recovery in Malaysian Borneo
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Forest carbon stocks in rapidly developing tropical regions are highly heterogeneous, which challenges efforts to develop spatially-explicit conservation actions. In addition to field-based biodiversity information, mapping of carbon stocks can greatly accelerate the identification, protection and recovery of forests deemed to be of high conservation value (HCV). We combined airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) with satellite imaging and other geospatial data to map forest aboveground carbon density at 30 m (0.09 ha) resolution throughout the Malaysian state of Sabah on the island of Borneo. We used the mapping results to assess how carbon stocks vary spatially based on forest use, deforestation, regrowth, and current forest protections. We found that unlogged, intact forests contain aboveground carbon densities averaging over 200 Mg C ha(-1), with peaks of 500 Mg C ha(-1). Critically, more than 40% of the highest carbon stock forests were discovered outside of areas designated for maximum protection. Previously logged forests have suppressed, but still high, carbon densities of 60-140 Mg C ha(-1). Our mapped distributions of forest carbon stock suggest that the state of Sabah could double its total aboveground carbon storage if previously logged forests are allowed to recover in the future. Our results guide ongoing efforts to identify HCV forests and to determine new areas for forest protection in Borneo.

TI  - Contribution of terrestrial ecosystems to carbon sequestration.
T2  - COMPTES RENDUS GEOSCIENCE
AB  - Contribution of terrestrial ecosystems to carbon sequestration. This article focuses on the contribution of natural ecosystems (forests, grasslands) and agrosystems to carbon sequestration either in biomass or in soil. Carbon stocks are important (650 Gt in biomass, 1500 to 2000 Gt in soils as compared with 750 for atmospheric CO2), and also fluxes that led to CO2 emissions in the past (due to deforestation or cultivation) and which now turn to carbon sequestration (2 Gt(C)/year). This article shows great spatial variations in stocks and fluxes and great measurement difficulties, especially for stock variations. Anthropic actions such as reforestation (mainly in the North), changes in land use or in crop management, can increase carbon sequestration in biomass or soil, with a residence time of several decades, which is not insignificant with respect to the Kyoto protocol and which also has other environmental (C) 2003 Academie des sciences.

TI  - Vegetation dynamics in a corridor between protected areas after slash-and-burn cultivation in south-eastern Madagascar
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Slash-and-burn cultivation is a major cause of deforestation in Madagascar, and abandonment leads to the secondary vegetation dynamics, i.e. colonization by herbaceous vegetation, shrubs and trees. The study was conducted in south-eastern Madagascar in a steep transition zone along an altitudinal and a sharp precipitation gradient between a high altitude rainforest and a lowland dry tropical forest. The restoration of gaps created by abandoned fields in this narrow, winding corridor could be essential to maintain connectivity between two areas (areas 1 and 2) of Andohahela National Park. Prior to implementing restoration, baseline ecological information is needed on the reference ecosystem and vegetation resilience must be studied to identify restoration needs. This study aims to (1) assess whether cultivation practices (irrigated rice vs. cassava, maize and sweet potato) influence vegetation dynamics after abandonment; (2) study vegetation dynamics and soils over time since abandonment, and (3) compare secondary forest vegetation and soils with those of mature forest patches. Surveys of vegetation and soil were conducted in 26 secondary forest patches abandoned from 3 to >25 years (synchronic approach) and in 19 adjacent mature forest patches (controls). No relationship between age of abandonment and vegetation species richness, composition or structure was found, but clear differences were detected between secondary and mature forest patches. Secondary forests are not colonized by species from mature forests, but instead their vegetation dynamics appear to lead to the establishment of thorny thickets dominated by Mimosa delicatula, which is absent from the mature forest.

TI  - Frugivory and Seed Dispersal Patterns of the Red-Ruffed Lemur, Varecia rubra, at a Forest Restoration Site in Masoala National Park, Madagascar
T2  - FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA
AB  - Frugivorous primates can play a critical role in the regeneration of degraded habitats by dispersing seeds of their food plants. We studied the diet and seed dispersal patterns of 3 groups of habituated red-ruffed lemurs (Varecia rubra) in a rain forest restoration site in Masoala National Park, Madagascar, to assess the species' seed dispersal effectiveness. Fruits accounted for 61% of the diet, with an average foraging time of 10 min per fruit patch per day. Seeds from 75% of the consumed fruit species were recovered in the collected V. rubra feces. We traced the potential parent plants of 20 dispersed-seed species to calculate a gut passage range (63-423 min; mean = 225, n = 35). The median seed dispersal distance from the potential parent plant was 48 m (mean = 83 m, range 0-568 m, n = 194). The home ranges of 2 of the 3 groups overlapped with the regenerating forest parcels. Although 92% of fecal samples with seeds were dispersed into the undisturbed forest, V. rubra fed on the fruits of the non-native pioneer shrub Clidemia hirta, while also dispersing native and non-native seed species into the regenerating forest parcels.

TI  - PHYTOSOCIOLOGY AND STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF WOODY REGENERATION FROM A REFORESTATION WITH NATIVE SPECIES IN SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
AB  - In Brazil, specifically in Sao Paulo State, there are guidelines based on the high diversity of tropical forests that instructs the restoration projects in the state (current SMA 32/2014). The main goal of this study was verify the importance and effectiveness of the high diversity of arboreal species originated from a reforestation, and its influence in a woody regenerating composition. We developed a phytosociologic study in a woody regenerating stratum of a nine year old reforestation at a Private Reserve of Natural Heritage (RPPN), in Mogi-Guacu, Sao Paulo State. All specimens with height >= 30 cm and Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) < 5 cm were evaluated. The woody regenerating diversity was smaller than the overstory diversity and the species composition was similar to the overstory. The Simpson index (1-D) was 0.85, Shannon index (H') was 2.46 and the Pielou index (J') was 0.60. The zoochoric dispersion syndrome was major among the species. Our results suggest that the use of high diversity of native seedlings in a reforestation leads to high diversity of species in woody regeneration stratum, after one decade of planting.

TI  - Forest fragmentation and its associated edge-effects reduce tree species diversity, size, and structural diversity in Madagascar's transitional forests
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Tropical forests are being cleared at an accelerating rate, despite being one of the most important habitats for global biodiversity. Many remaining tropical forest tracts are now highly degraded and fragmented, which presents a major problem for sensitive and threatened forest-dwelling species that depend on this habitat for survival. In this study, we assessed the impacts of forest fragmentation, and its associated edge-effects, on tree species diversity, tree size, and structural diversity within the transitional forests of north west Madagascar. Using data collected from 9,619 trees within 200 vegetation plots, we calculated species diversity indices, a range of dendrometry measurements, and Shannon-Weaver diversity indices of structure, which we compared among core and edge areas of a continuous forest and a fragmented forest. We found that species diversity, tree size, and structural diversity was significantly reduced in fragmented forest, and within forest edge areas in comparison to core, continuous forest. We also observed species diversity and structural diversity to be strongly influenced by the total size, core area size, and shape of forest fragments. Whilst we found fragmentation and edge-effects to individually impact tree species diversity, size and structural diversity, fragmentation and edge-effects are strongly correlated and affect natural forest synergistically. Our results provide evidence that forest fragmentation seriously degrades habitat quality and integrity of transitional forests, which is of great concern for the threatened species that inhabit them. Urgent conservation efforts are needed to halt ongoing forest fragmentation throughout the tropics, and reforestation and restoration efforts are required to reconnect isolated forest patches and to reduce forest edge area.

TI  - Landscape approaches; what are the pre-conditions for success?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
AB  - Landscape approaches are widely applied in attempts to reconcile tradeoffs amongst different actors with conflicting demands on land and water resources. Key principles for landscape approaches have been endorsed by inter-governmental processes dealing with climate change mitigation and adaptation and biodiversity conservation.
   We review experiences from seven landscapes located in the Congo Basin, Eastern Indonesia and Northern Australia. Landscape initiatives were applied in situations where large-scale extractive industries, local peoples' livelihoods and global biodiversity objectives were in conflict. We found that common published principles for landscape approaches are not applied systematically in the areas studied. Practitioners draw upon landscape approach principles selectively and adapt them to deal with local conditions. We consider that landscape approaches do not provide silver bullet solutions to these situations nor do they provide an operational framework for large-scale land management. Landscape approaches do, however, provide an organising framework for disentangling the complexity of the landscape and facilitating the investigation of impacts of different courses of action. They enable alternative scenarios for what future landscapes might look like to be investigated and they create the space for multi-stakeholder negotiations. Outcomes from landscape scale approaches are determined by the power differentials amongst stakeholders and the existence, or otherwise, of functional institutions to take decisions and enforce agreements. Landscape approaches cannot overcome disparities in power or entrenched interests nor can they substitute for institutions with authority to establish and legitimise property and resource rights. They can, however, provide a mechanism around which civil society can be mobilised to achieve better land use outcomes. Landscape approaches are successful when they have strong leadership, sustained long-term and facilitated processes, good governance, adequate budgets and adequate metrics for assessing progress. Private sector engagement is necessary and all parties must have sufficient shared interest in outcomes to motivate their participation.

TI  - The natural recovery of soil microbial community and nitrogen functions after pasture abandonment in the Amazon region
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
AB  - We assessed the impacts of forest-to-pasture conversion on the dynamic of soil microbial communities, especially those involved in the N-cycle, and their potential functions, using DNA-metagenomic sequencing coupled with the quantification of marker genes for N-cycling. We also evaluated whether the community's dynamic was reestablished with secondary forest growth. In general, the microbial community structure was influenced by changes in soil chemical properties. Aluminum and nitrate significantly correlated to community structure and with 12 out of 21 microbial phyla. The N-related microbial groups and their potential functions were also affected by land-use change, with pasture being clearly different from primary and secondary forest systems. The microbial community analysis demonstrated that forest-to-pasture conversion increased the abundance of different microbial groups related to nitrogen fixation, including Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi and Firmicutes. In contrast, after pasture abandonment and with the secondary forest regeneration, there was an increase in the abundance of Proteobacteria taxa and denitrification genes. Our multi-analytical approach indicated that the secondary forest presented some signs of resilience, suggesting that the N-related microbial groups and their potential functions can be recovered over time with implications for future ecological restoration programs.

TI  - Successional dynamics of a regenerated forest in a plantation landscape in Southern India
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - We monitored native forest regeneration over 11 y in a eucalyptus plantation and compared it with the neighbouring primary forest. For the plantation forest, we hypothesized that species richness, density, basal area and densities of old-growth species would increase over time, and compared to the primary forest, plantation forest would have higher species richness and density, but lower densities of old-growth species. In 2016, we repeated the protocol of a study that sampled the plantation forest in 2005, with thirty 10 x 10-m plots and enumerating trees (>= 10 cm diameter), saplings (>1 to <10 cm diameter) and seedlings (<1 cm diameter). In the plantation forest, for trees, the species richness, density of gap, bird-dispersed and mammal-dispersed species increased by 67%, 156%, 116% and 238% respectively; whereas for saplings, density of gap, bird-dispersed and small-seeded species declined by 45.2%, 51% and 18.2% respectively over time; and seedling densities did not change across functional groups. Stand basal area increased by 80.1% in the plantation forest. The primary forest had 446% greater density of closed-canopy trees compared with plantation forest. Contrary to our prediction, the plantation forest did not accumulate significant densities of old-growth species over time, probably due to demographic filters that prevent them from attaining maturity.

TI  - Ancient Maya Agroforestry Echoing Through Spatial Relationships in the Extant Forest of NW Belize
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Previous research has shown that ancient Maya 'forest gardens'-tree-dominated home gardens containing a diversity of tree species used for daily household needs-still resonate in the species composition of the modern forest. Centuries of positive interspecies interactions may enhance the reproductive and survival success of garden species selected and encouraged by experienced Maya forest gardeners. We hypothesized that such interaction may result in aggregated spatial patterns between 32 pre-selected, commonly utilized forest garden species. In this paper, we developed a novel randomization (Monte Carlo) method designed to measure and test if the spatial relationships among pairs of Maya 'forest garden' trees species differ between areas that experienced high and low ancient settlement density in northwestern Belize. A total of 28 high ancient settlement density and 27 low ancient settlement density plots containing a total of 2772 and 3134 trees, respectively, were used for this study. The analysis revealed that 58 pairs of forest garden species tended to 'cluster' together significantly more often in the high settlement density areas than would be expected in a random distribution. In low settlement density plots, only 12 pairs of species exhibited a significant clustered spatial relationship. The effect was not species specific, suggesting that some synergistic relationships, mediated by third-party agents such as dispersers, may occur at the community level. The impacts of ancient human land use, echoing across centuries of dispersal, colonization, disturbance, and biotic and abiotic interactions, can have important implications for understanding the current biodiversity patterns and processes.

TI  - Land use history and landscape forest cover determine tropical forest recovery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - To conserve biodiversity and combat climate change it is vital to restore forest ecosystems. Natural forest regrowth is a nature-based solution to restore forests, but it has rarely been evaluated how this is affected by the combination of previous land use intensity and surrounding forest cover, and how this varies between the two main tropical forest types; dry and wet forests. Thirty-three plots were established on abandoned agricultural fields in a dry (13 plots) and wet (20 plots) tropical forest in Mexico and monitored 3 years for the following tree community attributes: structure, diversity, regeneration mode, potential symbioses with N fixing bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi. Previous land use intensity was described using interviews, and landscape forest cover and fragmentation within a 1000 m radius surrounding the plots were quantified using satellite images. Variable importance analyses indicated that land use intensity was more important than forest cover and fragmentation for the state of the tree community attributes after 3 years. This suggests that previous land use impacts the start of succession and leaves important legacies on the vegetation. Land use intensity, forest cover and fragmentation were equally important in determining the change in tree community attributes over time, indicating that both management practices and dispersal shape subsequently community assembly. A higher land use intensity decreases tree richness recovery, while size of the largest forest patch decreases tree density and connectivity of these patches increases tree density. The dry forest had a faster increase in tree density recovery compared to the wet forest through a high initial resprouting capacity and abiotically dispersed trees. Synthesis and applications: Both a higher land use intensity and fragmented forest landscape decreases the speed of forest recovery, indicating that human actions and landscape transformation shape the course of succession. Restoration in fragmented forest landscapes through natural regeneration is more suitable in areas with low previous land use intensity, higher forest connectivity and abiotically dispersed species. Effective restoration should therefore consider both land use history and landscape forest cover and be tailored to local socio-ecological conditions.
   La restauració n de los ecosistemas forestales es esencial para conservar la biodiversidad y enfrentar el cambio climá tico. Aunque la regeneració n natural de los bosques es una solució n basada en la naturaleza para recuperar la superficie forestal, todaví a no se ha evaluado adecuadamente có mo este proceso se ve afectado por la combinació n de la intensidad del uso del suelo previo al abandono del terreno y la cubierta forestal circundante, y qué tanto difiere entre los dos principales tipos de bosques tropicales, es decir, los bosques tropicales secos y los hú medos. Se establecieron 33 parcelas en campos agrí colas abandonados en un bosque tropical seco (13 parcelas) y un bosque tropical hú medo (20 parcelas) en Mé xico para monitorear durante tres añ os los siguientes atributos de la comunidad arbó rea: estructura, diversidad, modo de regeneració n, y simbiosis potenciales con bacterias fijadoras de N y hongos micorrí cicos. La intensidad del uso del suelo se describió mediante entrevistas y se usaron imá genes de saté lite para cuantificar la cobertura forestal en el paisaje y la fragmentació n del bosque en un radio de 1000 m alrededor de las parcelas. El aná lisis de la importancia de las variables mostró que la intensidad del uso del suelo fue má s importante que la cobertura y fragmentació n del bosque para definir el estado de los atributos de la comunidad arbó rea despué s de tres añ os. Esto sugiere que el uso previo del suelo impacta el inicio de la sucesió n y deja importantes legados en la vegetació n. La intensidad del uso del suelo, la cubierta forestal y la fragmentació n del bosque fueron igualmente importantes para la determinació n del cambio en los atributos de la comunidad arbó rea a lo largo del tiempo, lo que indica que las prá cticas de manejo y má s adelante la dispersió n dan forma al ensamble comunitario. Al aumentar la intensidad del uso del suelo se reduce la recuperació n de la riqueza arbó rea, mientras que el tamañ o del parche forestal má s grande disminuye la densidad de á rboles y la conectividad entre parches de bosque aumenta la densidad de á rboles. En el bosque tropical seco la densidad de á rboles se recuperó má s rá pido que en el bosque hú medo gracias a una alta capacidad de rebrote inicial y a la presencia de á rboles con dispersió n abió tica. Sí ntesis y aplicaciones: Un uso del suelo má s intenso previo al abandono del terreno y un paisaje forestal má s fragmentado repercuten negativamente en la velocidad de recuperació n del bosque, lo que indica que tanto las acciones humanas como la transformació n del paisaje moldean al curso de la sucesió n. La restauració n de paisajes forestales fragmentados mediante la regeneració n natural es má s adecuada en á reas donde la intensidad del uso del suelo fue menor, y donde hay una mayor conectividad forestal y las especies tienen dispersió n bió tica.

TI  - Potential of slash-and-mulch system with legumes to conserve soil attributes and macrofauna diversity in Eastern Amazon
T2  - PEDOBIOLOGIA
AB  - Slash-and-burn agriculture has been practiced for thousands of years in the tropics and is sustainable in con-ditions of low population density, and long fallow. However, the population increase leads to intensification, and consequently the reduction of fallow, productivity, and sustainability. Then, public and private institutions with farmers, are seeking alternatives to replace this farming system. The slash-and-mulch technique for smallholder farmers is widespread in Central America and has the potential to be transferred to other regions. Nonetheless, little information is available about its potential for the eastern Amazon. The soil macrofauna is associated with soil quality and agricultural sustainability as it plays a key role in the provision of ecosystem services. Higher taxa of this fauna are often used to evaluate soil management, given that they are influenced by land-use and produce a fast response. Therefore, this study evaluates the short-term effects of the slash-and-burn or the slash -and-mulch system, after different durations of fallow on the composition, density, and diversity of the soil macrofauna higher taxa and selected physical and chemical attributes. Results are compared to old-growth forest and secondary forest fragments. The slash-and-mulch fields had soil fertility attributes similar to slash-and-burn and macrofauna diversity and composition were similar to forests. In particular, functional groups like ecosystem engineers or predators augmented with slash-and-mulch and were efficient indicators of land-use change. Despite its scarcity and their very high fragmentation, old-growth forest small remnants do conserve a more diverse and abundant soil invertebrates community of saprophages and predators, therefore their conservation is of utmost importance. This is the first study to show the potential of the slash-and-mulch system in this region to enhance the resilience of the smallholders' landscapes. Nonetheless, soil quality needs to be monitored to confirm the effective restoration of soil functionality and agriculture productivity.

TI  - Foliar methane and nitrous oxide fluxes in tropical tree species
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are critical biogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) with global warming potentials substantially greater than that of carbon dioxide (CO2). The exchange of these gases in tropical forests, particularly via foliar processes, remains poorly understood. We quantified foliar CH4 and N2O fluxes among tropical tree species and examined their potential association with the leaf economics spectrum (LES) traits. Sampling within Lawachara National Park, Bangladesh, we used in-situ measurements of foliar CH4 and N2O fluxes employing off-axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy (CH4, CO2 and H2O) and optical feedback-cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy (N2O) analyzers. Leaves were measured under dark, low, and high (0, 100, and 1000 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)) light conditions. Surveyed tree species exhibited both net foliar uptake and efflux of CH4, with a mean flux not different from zero, suggesting negligible net foliar emissions at the stand level. Plant families showed differences in CH4, but not N2O fluxes. Consistent efflux was observed for N2O, with a mean of 0.562 +/- 0.060 pmol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1). Pioneer species exhibited a higher mean N2O flux (0.81 +/- 0.17 pmol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)) compared to late-successional species (0.37 +/- 0.05 pmol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)). Pioneer species also showed a trend toward a higher mean CH4 flux (0.24 +/- 0.21 nmol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)) compared to mid-successional (-0.01 +/- 0.26 nmol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)) and late-successional species (-0.05 +/- 0.28 nmol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)). Moreover, among all leaf traits within the leaf economic spectrum, a significant positive relationship was observed between leaf N2O flux and total leaf nitrogen. Our results suggest that pioneer tree species significantly contribute to net CH4 and N2O emissions, potentially counteracting the carbon sequestration benefits in regenerating tropical forests. These findings indicate that accurate GHG budgeting should include direct measurements of foliar CH4 and N2O fluxes. Moreover, the results suggest that forest conservation and management strategies that prioritize late successional species will better mitigate GHG emissions.

TI  - The effects of non-timber forest product cultivation on the plant community structure and composition of a humid tropical forest in southern Mexico
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The planting of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) in the understory of tropical forests is promoted in many parts of the world as a strategy to conserve forested lands and meet the economic needs of rural communities. While many studies of NTFP management have focused on the effects of harvesting on wild populations, the impacts of understory NTFP plantations, or enrichment plantings, on forest community composition and structure have not been investigated. We assessed the effects of understory plantations of the palm Chamaedorea hooperiana Hodel, on community composition and structure of an old growth tropical rain forest in the Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve in southeastern Mexico. A blocked design consisting of four C. hooperiana plantation sites each paired with an adjacent site of unmanaged forest was used to compare the plant species richness and diversity, stem density, basal area and size class structure in plantations versus unmanaged forest. In each site, 12 10 m diameter plots were established for a total of 96 plots (4 blocks x 2 sites x 12 plots). Although the stem density, diversity, richness and basal area of large overstory trees (> 20 cm dbh) were unaffected by the establishment and management of understory palm plantations, the stem density, species richness and basal area of woody species in smaller size classes (< 10 cm dbh) were significantly lower in plantation sites than in similar unmanaged forest sites. The density of naturally occurring, economically valuable pahn species was unaffected by the C. hooperiana plantations, indicating that these understory species are spared when plantations are established and maintained. However, plantation sites showed significant reductions in the density of the midstory palm Astrocaryum mexicanum, the most abundant plant in unmanaged forest sites. The removal of vegetation in NTFP plantations may result in the fragmentation and/or elimination of local populations of understory and midstory plant species. In addition, changes to the composition of advanced regeneration due to the removal of canopy tree seedlings and saplings may have implications for future patterns of forest regeneration and composition. Nonetheless, NTFP cultivation offers a promising alternative to more destructive forms of land uses in the tropics and warrants further attention as a forest management strategy.

TI  - Designing cropping systems from nature
T2  - AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Despite huge gains in productivity, environmental impacts of industrial agriculture based on a few high-yielding crop cultivars and the massive use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides have led to a search for new pathways leading to more sustainable agriculture in both temperate and tropical regions. New strategies incorporating ecological knowledge gained from the observation of natural ecosystems is an alternative to design "ecologically intensive" agroecosystems. Such systems are indeed both ecological and productive. Designing ecologically intensive agroecosystems calls for in-depth knowledge of biological regulations in ecosystems, and for the integration of traditional agricultural knowledge held by local farmers. This article reviews the main initiatives underlying ecologically intensive agroecosystems, analyses basic concepts, and proposes a framework for action. The rainforest model, the dry forest model, and the American Prairie are exemplified as three main natural systems at the basis of the mimicry concept. The link between biodiversity and the mimicry hypotheses, and the use of the concepts of productivity, efficiency, stability, and resilience for agroecosystems are discussed. Six main principles for cropping system design based on natural ecosystem mimicry are identified. A three-step framework for action is proposed, including nature observation, experimental design, and participatory design. Although far from being a panacea, the mimicry approach can provide new ways for agroecosystem design both in temperate and tropical countries.

TI  - Decoding the drivers and effects of deforestation in Peru: a national and regional analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - High deforestation rates in tropical forests of South America lead to biodiversity loss, climate change and alterations in nature's contributions to people. Deforestation drivers vary across scales due to the heterogeneity of environmental and socioeconomic conditions and forest types. Here, we test the effects of deforestation drivers on deforestation rate from 2000 to 2020 at national and regional scales using Peru as a study case. To do that, we selected nine deforestation drivers commonly used in tropical deforestation analyses. We used the forest cover loss dataset of Global Forest Change to calculate deforestation rates. We conducted five path analyses, one for the national scale and the others for the four regions, using the district as a spatial unit. The national path model explained 34% of the total observed variance and showed that temperature, agriculture, transport network, precipitation, rural population and fire had a positive effect on deforestation, while the slope had a negative effect. The regional path models (63% of the total observed variance in the Coast region, 32% in the Andean, 60% in the High Rainforest and 75% in the Low Rainforest) showed that many national drivers remained at the regional scale. However, we found that the strength, relation (positive/negative) and type (direct/indirect) may vary. Therefore, identifying regional differences in deforestation dynamics is crucial for forest conservation planning and for addressing effective policies in tropical countries. However, improving the quality and availability of national data is essential for further advancing our understanding of this complex process.

TI  - Nutrient Addition Differentially Affects Soil Carbon Sequestration in Secondary Tropical Dry Forests: Early- versus Late-Succession Stages
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - There is considerable interest in the potential use of soils to sequester carbon for climate change mitigation. As such, there is a need to evaluate the potential for carbon accumulation in tropical regions. We compared the effects of three annual additions of nitrogen and/or phosphorus on soil carbon and nitrogen contents and pools (bulk soil, macro-, meso-, and microaggregates) of two regenerating secondary tropical dry forest differing in nutrient status and succession stage (10-year-old early-succession stage and approximately 60-year-old late-succession stage). The selected forest sites were located on a shallow calcareous soil in the Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico). The primary production is limited by nitrogen and phosphorus in early-succession stage and by phosphorus in late-succession stage. In each forest site, four independent plots (12 x 12 m2) were established, the treatments being: controls and plots fertilized during three consecutive years with nitrogen, phosphorus, or nitrogen plus phosphorus. In both forests, soil carbon and nitrogen contents were consistently high, with soil carbon:nitrogen ratios generally greater than 10. Results indicate that usually there are no significant increases of soil carbon stock associated to late succession but can be increased to 3.7 Mg center dot ha-1 center dot yr-1 with adoption of fertilizer practices. The potential soil carbon sequestration in early-succession forest was estimated to be 2.7 Mg center dot ha-1 center dot yr-1, and there is no indication that fertilization improves carbon sequestration. In short, results suggest that the soil potential for carbon sequestration in these ecosystems is high and depends on the specific nutrient status of the site.

TI  - Tree plantations on farms: Evaluating growth and potential for success
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Interest in native species is growing across the tropics as reforestation of degraded lands becomes more widespread. In this study four tree species native to Panama - Cedrela odorata, Pachira quinata, Samanea saman, and Tabebuia rosea - were grown on rural farms at two dry tropical sites in Panama for up to five years. Survivorship and growth data at these "on-farm" trials are compared to data recorded from nearby experimental or "species selection" trial sites and evaluated in terms of soil fertility and management. Participant farmers were also asked about their interest in planting trees in general as well as their interest in 61 species grown in the species selection trial.
   Although, on-farm survivorship was variable and generally lower than that found on the species selection trial, one species (S. saman) experienced high and consistent survivorship. High survivorship combined with growth data from farms at both sites for this species suggests it would be a good candidate for extension projects working with rural farmers. Survivorship of other species appears more sensitive to farmer management and/or local site conditions. Generally lower growth on the Los Santos farms as compared to the species-selection trial is attributed to the lower soil fertility (plant available P) at the on-farm sites compared to the species selection trial. In contrast, only one species - P. quinata - had a growth variable found to be significantly lower between the on-farm and species selection trial sites in Rio Hato. C. odorata, P. quinata T. rosea can all be used in on-farm conditions with consideration to specific site and management conditions.
   By 2009, approximately 80% of the farmers planting trees still wished to participate in tree planting activities. All of the farmers no longer wishing to continue with the project expressed slow growth rates of trees as a principal reason. All but one of these farmers had growth rates for his/her trees markedly below those of the species selection trial nearby. Some farmers wishing to continue had very high mortality rates (>70% for all species), suggesting non-tangible benefits for participating in project activities. Other species that were not tested on-farm but grew well in the species-selection trials and were of interest to local farmers are discussed.
   As long as specific site and management conditions are carefully considered, data from species selection trials can be useful in informing tree planting projects with rural farmers; however, care should be taken to manage expectations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Looking beyond parks: the conservation value of unprotected areas for hornbills in Arunachal Pradesh, Eastern Himalaya
T2  - ORYX
AB  - The loss of tropical forests and associated biodiversity is a global concern. Conservation efforts in tropical countries such as India have mostly focused on state-administered protected areas despite the existence of vast tracts of forest outside these areas. We studied hornbills (Bucerotidae), an ecologically important vertebrate group and a flagship for tropical forest conservation, to assess the importance of forests outside protected areas in Arunachal Pradesh, north-east India. We conducted a state-wide survey to record encounters with hornbills in seven protected areas, six state-managed reserved forests and six community-managed unclassed forests. We estimated the density of hornbills in one protected area, four reserved forests and two unclassed forests in eastern Arunachal Pradesh. The state-wide survey showed that the mean rate of encounter of rufous-necked hornbills Aceros nipalensis was four times higher in protected areas than in reserved forests and 22 times higher in protected areas than in unclassed forests. The mean rate of encounter of wreathed hornbills Rhyticeros undulatus was twice as high in protected areas as in reserved forests and eight times higher in protected areas than in unclassed forests. The densities of rufous-necked hornbill were higher inside protected areas, whereas the densities of great hornbill Buceros bicornis and wreathed hornbill were similar inside and outside protected areas. Key informant surveys revealed possible extirpation of some hornbill species at sites in two protected areas and three unclassed forests. These results highlight a paradoxical situation where individual populations of hornbills are being lost even in some legally protected habitat, whereas they continue to persist over most of the landscape. Better protection within protected areas and creative community-based conservation efforts elsewhere are necessary to maintain hornbill populations in this biodiversity-rich region.

TI  - Bird perches and artificial bat roosts increase seed rain and seedling establishment in tropical bracken-dominated deforested areas
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Tropical forests are being reduced by human activities. The use of fire for agricultural expansion generates areas dominated by the bracken fern Pteridium, where forest regeneration is slow. This may be caused by seed limitation, especially of animal-dispersed seeds, due to the absence of seed dispersers from the forest in deforested areas, calling for restoration strategies to assist forest regeneration. We installed bird perches and artificial bat roosts to evaluate their effect on the density, species richness, and composition of animal-dispersed seeds and seedlings of tree and non-tree species in bracken-dominated areas in the tropical montane forest of Bolivia. We found that perches and bat roosts increased the density and species richness of animal-dispersed seeds and established seedlings. The seeds and seedlings dispersed by birds were clumped under the perches, while the seeds and seedlings dispersed by bats were distributed around the roosts. Perches had a higher density and species richness of seeds and seedlings compared to bat roosts, suggesting that the use of perches could be a better option as a restoration tool in bracken-dominated areas. The increase in seed rain and seedling establishment of animal-dispersed species in perches and bat roosts supports seed limitation, hindering forest succession in bracken-dominated areas. The use of bird perches accompanying other restoration techniques is a promising restoration strategy to accelerate forest regeneration in tropical areas dominated by Pteridium, which are widely distributed.

TI  - Negotiation support models for integrated natural resource management in tropical forest margins
T2  - CONSERVATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Natural resource management research has to evolve from a focus on plans, maps, and regulations to an acknowledgment of the complex, sometimes chaotic, reality in the field, with a large number of actors making their own decisions. As outside actors, we can only try to facilitate and support a process of negotiation among the stakeholders. Such negotiation involves understanding the perspectives of all stakeholders, analyzing complementarities in views, identifying where differences may be settled by "science," where science and social action can bring innovative alternatives for reconciliation, and where compromises will be necessary to move ahead. We distinguish between natural resource management problems at village level, within country, or transboundary, and those that relate local stakeholder decisions to global issues such as biodiversity conservation. Tree-based systems at plot or landscape level can minimize conflicts between private and public interests in local environmental services, but spatial segregation of functions is an imperative for the core of global biodiversity values. The complex agroforests developed by farmers as alternatives to food-crop-based agriculture integrate local and global environmental functions, but intensification and specialization may diminish these non-local values. For local biodiversity functions, a medium-intensity "integrate" option such as agroforests may be superior in terms of resilience and risk management, Major options exist for increasing carbon stocks by expanding tree-based production systems on grasslands and in degraded watersheds through a coherent approach to the market, policy, and institutional bottlenecks to application of existing rehabilitation technologies. Agroforestry mosaics may be an acceptable replacement of forests in upper watersheds, provided they evolve into multistrata systems with a protective litter layer. Challenges to INRM research remain: how should the opportunities for adaptive response among diverse interest groups, at a number of hierarchical levels, be included in the assessment of impacts on the livelihoods of rural people?

TI  - Spatial patterns of degraded tropical forest and biodiversity restoration over 70-years of succession
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Landscape metrics have often been used to analyse the spatial dynamics of habitat fragmentation accompanying forest loss. However, there are few studies of the spatial dynamics of natural forest succession, especially over periods longer than the operational period of imaging satellites. This study applies spatial metrics to understand the spatial processes of a 70-year tropical secondary forest succession in Hong Kong, since World War 2. The highest rate of forest regeneration at 11% a year from 1989 to 2001 occurred when the landscape achieved greatest habitat diversity and juxtapositioning of habitat patches. This rapid regeneration occurred by infilling from remnant forest in adjacent valleys rather than by an advance along a broad forest front, and led to simplification of the landscape and declining habitat diversity. It was also accompanied by declines in species richness and abundance in regenerated forest patches. Thus both habitat and woody plant species diversity show a humped trend over the successional period as disconnected forest patches amalgamate, and shade-intolerant pioneers are shaded out by taller pioneers. From this point onwards, the birds of mixed habitats including bulbuls and hwamei known to disperse seed in the study area, may become less effective as forest patches consolidate, and only a few forest mammals remain. The observed improved connectivity within forest patches and reduced edge disturbances accompanying landscape simplification provide better conditions for dispersion within forest of light-intolerant climax species from the oldest, species-rich valley sites to the newly regenerated areas. However, in addition to the loss of forest dispersal agents, other natural dispersal agents such as gravity, flash floods and slope wash involving downward processes may be ineffective, as forest has regenerated upwards to higher elevations. Progression to a mature, biodiverse and stable forest ecosystem may depend on introduction of dispersal agents other than those which have operated over recent decades. Forest patches with high internal connectivity, indicated by high Mean radius of Gyration (MRG) and low Mean Perimeter-to-Area Ratio (MPAR) would appear to offer the best movement opportunities and least disturbance to such introductions.

TI  - Floristic diversity and carbon stocks in the periphery of Deng-Deng National Park, Eastern Cameroon
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
AB  - Carbon is continuously being removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis and stored in carbon pools (live, dead, and soil carbon) of forest ecosystems. However, carbon stock in dead wood and of trees with diameters at breast height (dbh) between 5 and 10 cm is often not considered in many studies carried out in the Congo Basin Forest. The relationship between tree diversity, life-forms and carbon stocks has received little attention. This study was carried out on the outskirts of Deng Deng National Park (DDNP) to determine tree diversity (dominant families, species richness and Shannon index), assess carbon stocks in the five carbon compartments (living tree, understory, fine roots, dead wood and litter) as well as to analyze the relationship between (1) carbon stocks and tree diversity; and, (2) between carbon stock and life-forms. The Shannon index of trees >= 10 cm dbh ranged from 2.6 in riparian forest to 4.3 in secondary forest; and for the tree between 5 and 10 cm, it ranged to 1.56 in riparian forest to 3.68 in the secondary forest. The study site housed 16 species, 7 genera and 3 families which are only found in trees of dbh between 5 and 10 cm. The average total carbon stock of the five compartments varied from 200.1 t ha(-1) in forest residues to 439.1 t ha(-1) in secondary forest. Dead wood carbon stock varied from 1.2 t ha(-1) in riparian forests to 12.51t ha(-1) in agroforests. The above ground carbon stocks for trees with diameter between 5 and 10 cm varied from 0.7 t ha(-1) in young fallow fields to 5.02 t ha(-1) in old secondary forests. This study reveals a low but positive correlation between species richness and total carbon stocks, as well as a significant positive relationship between life-forms and total carbon stocks. The findings highlight the need for more data concerning carbon content of dead wood, carbon of trees >= 5 cm < 10 cm dbh and the relationship between carbon stocks and tree diversity from other areas of the Congo Basin for a good understanding of the contribution of tropical forests to climate change mitigation.

TI  - Vascular Epiphyte Diversity in a Key Atlantic Forest Remnant from Minas Gerais State, Southeastern Brazil
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
AB  - Vascular epiphytes contribute significantly to the biodiversity of tropical forests. We aimed to identify the epiphyte species occurring in the Muriqui Trail at Serra do Brigadeiro State Park (SBSP), a priority area for Atlantic forest conservation in southeastern Brazil. We selected 10 phorophytes, from which we sampled epiphytes and took light intensity measurements at three strata: up to 4 m, 4 to 8 m, and above 8 m. Phorophytes represented eight species, eight genera, and six families. We found 25 epiphytic species from 17 genera and nine families. Ferns showed highest richness, especially Polypodiaceae. We report herein important data on epiphyte diversity in eastern Minas Gerais state (Zona da Mata), including the occurrence of species rarely cited in surveys. Fomenting local conservation along with environmental education may be pivotal for counteracting anthropic pressure on SBSP.

TI  - Relationships between biodiversity and carbon stocks in forest ecosystems: a systematic literature review
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - A systematic literature review was conducted to explore the relationships between multiple measures of biodiversity (e.g. species diversity, functional divergence and dominance) and carbon (C) stocks (both aboveground and soil organic) in different forest ecosystems. A total of 47 studies, searched in Web of Science or Knowledge, were selected based on different biodiversity indices, strength of the datasets and particularly focusing on C stocks. The majority of relationships between species diversity or richness and C stocks were positive, while only few were negative. The niche complementarity and the mass ratio hypotheses are the two major hypotheses for explaining the effect of functional diversity on C stocks. These two hypotheses did not contradict each other but reflect the two different sides of functional trait attribute i.e., dominance and divergence. The majority of studies suggested that strong dominance by tall and conservative species, rather than a set of coexisting species with diverse heights and acquisitive role, results in more C stocks in various forest ecosystems. Thus, most of the studies supported mass ratio hypothesis instead of the niche complementarity hypothesis in terms of increasing C stocks in forest ecosystems. We concluded that experimental works in other forest ecosystems have shown that each measure of biodiversity often increases C stocks, although the extent to which direct causal relationships exist between biodiversity and C stocks in subtropical forests are still uncertain. Thus, a little is understood how multiple measures of biodiversity affect C stocks, when also considering the effects of biotic and abiotic components of an ecosystem.

TI  - Tolerance of frugivorous birds to habitat disturbance in a tropical cloud forest
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - In view of the continued decline in tropical forest cover around the globe, forest restoration has become a key tool in tropical rainforest conservation. One of the main - and least expensive - restoration strategies is natural forest regeneration. By aiding forest seed influx both into disturbed and undisturbed habitats, frugivorous birds facilitate forest regeneration. This study focuses on the tolerance of a frugivorous bird community to anthropogenic habitat disturbance within the broader context of natural forest regeneration with conservation purposes. It was carried out in the tropical cloud forest of Costa Rica's Talamanca Mountains. Bird community response and tolerance to habitat disturbance was assessed by comparing bird presence and densities along a disturbance gradient, ranging from open pastures to closed mature forests. Birds were censused along nine transects applying the variable width line transect procedure. Forty relevant frugivorous bird species were observed during 102 h of survey time. Densities were calculated for 33 species; nine species responded negatively to increasing level of disturbance and nine others positively. Results indicate that large frugivores are generally moderately tolerant to intermediate, but intolerant to severe habitat disturbance, and that tolerance is often higher for medium and small frugivores. It appears that moderately disturbed habitats in tropical cloud forests are highly suitable for restoration through natural regeneration aided by frugivorous birds. Due to a lack of large forest seed dispersers, severely disturbed habitats appear less suitable. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A look at Intact Forest Landscapes (IFLs) and their relevance in Central African forest policy
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Tropical forests are major providers of natural resources and ecosystem services but their ecological functions are at threat, due to increasing human pressure linked to economic development. The identification of priority areas for conservation is crucial for land use planning to ensure the protection of biodiversity and ecological function. Intact Forest Landscapes (IFLs), as defined by Greenpeace and World Resources Institute (WRI), are areas of the forest ecosystems not subjected to human activities. They have been identified by mapping human disturbances through remote sensing. Contrary to similar global-scale concepts, IFLs have been integrated into the standards of the certification body Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and therefore have practical implications for forest management policies. The Motion 65, approved in the general assembly of FSC in 2014, mandates the protection of IFLs located in FSC certified logging concessions. Until the implementation of national standards, forestry operations are banished from 80% of the IFL area within each forest management unit. To trace the history and evaluate the suitability of IFLs in the Central African context, we searched for documents related to the IFL method, and related approaches focusing on the identification of areas devoid of human disturbances. The IFL method is simple and cost-effective and allows for a global assessment of the influence of human infrastructures and industrial exploitation on forests. However, the method does not consider the situation below the canopy and those forest components not visible by satellites. For example, hunting, one of the main threats faced by wildlife in Central African forests today, cannot be detected with satellite imagery. On the other hand, other anthropogenic activities which remote sensing may detect may be compatible with forest ecosystem conservation. To better tailor the IFL approach to Central African forests, we recommend (i) the consideration of wildlife communities in the intactness analysis, (ii) a thorough evaluation of the impacts of human activities on forest ecosystems, and (iii) the integration of local stakeholders and governments in the design of land management strategies to respond to social, economic and environmental needs.

TI  - Seedling growth and survival of five tree species in secondary forests and adjacent pastures in the montane rain forests of Southern Costa Rica
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - Successful forest restoration in tropical environments is limited by the paucity of studies on the initial establishment and early survival requirements of seedlings of most native tropical tree species under disturbed conditions. Here, we evaluated the initial growth responses and the regeneration potential of seedlings of five tree species native to Costa Rica (Hasseltia floribunda, Inga densiflora, Persea americana, Tapirira mexicana and Trichilia pittieri). Seedlings were grown in secondary forests and adjacent open pastures under contrasting conditions of light availability. We quantified seedling growth, survival and herbivory from August 2010 to August 2011 on a monthly basis, and measured differences in leaf mass per area (LMA) at the end of the experiment. We found significant variation in growth responses between the understory of secondary forests and pastures. Growth in height was highest in pastures across all species, with I. densiflora, P. americana and T. mexicana showing the most striking differences. In contrast, H. floribunda and T. pittieri did not show differences in diameter growth between environments. Except for T. mexicana, herbivory increased throughout the experiment in all the species. Herbivory increased faster in pastures for H. floribunda and T. pittieri and showed higher rates in the forest understory for 1, densiflora and P americana. Seedling survival showed significant differences for all species across environments. Survival of H. floribunda and I. densiflora was higher in secondary forests, whereas the other species showed higher survival in pastures. LMA showed higher values in the pastures across all species, showing that individuals exposed to high light conditions had great photosynthetic rate and great leaf construction capacity. Due to their rapid growth and high survival, I. densiflora and T. mexicana showed great potential to restore abandoned pastures and secondary forests. Increasing our knowledge on the response of seedlings under disturbed conditions in tropical ecosystems is critical for improving the restoration of altered environments by matching the ecological amplitude of native species with specific environmental conditions.

TI  - Using certified timber extraction to benefit jaguar and ecosystem conservation
T2  - AMBIO
AB  - The jaguar Panthera onca requires large areas of relatively intact habitats containing adequate amounts of prey to survive. Since a substantial portion of jaguar range occurs outside of strict protected areas, there is a need for economic incentives for habitat conservation, which carefully managed selective logging can provide. Forest Stewardship Council and Pan European Forest Council certifications intended to regulate wood extraction to maintain the ecological functions of forests require evidence of biodiversity and ecosystem conservation. We draw on twelve surveys across four countries and a range of biomes to present evidence that adequate logging management can maintain jaguar populations, but that they are at risk without efficient control of secondary impacts of access and hunting. Where resident, the presence of jaguars can serve as an indication that the ecological requirements of certified timber extraction are being met. We present a gradient of rigor for monitoring, recommending cost-effective options.

TI  - Forest restoration assessment in Brazilian Amazonia: A new clustering-based methodology considering the reference ecosystem
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Techniques for forest restoration have been widely developed over the past decades, allowing the reestablishment of vegetation in extreme cases such as surface mining. However, there are still issues related to management and monitoring that require further understanding, especially concerning comparisons with reference ecosystems. In this study, hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) with uncertainty estimation is proposed as a methodology for forest restoration assessment. For this purpose, analysis was made of phytosociological variables for 27 plots located in reforested closed mines and in the Amazon forest reference ecosystem. The technique grouped the reference ecosystem separately from the reclamation sites. The HAC was affected by dependency among the analyzed variables, and heterogeneity was observed for all the phytosociological parameters in the cluster groups formed by the mining locations. However, each group showed specific characteristics related to the different environmental conditions and the forest restoration performance. The results demonstrated that HAC with uncertainty estimation was more suitable for defining groups, compared to the classical approach, offering a promising methodology for evaluation of the outcomes of forest restoration and for guiding management actions in disturbed tropical forests.

TI  - A comparative assessment of the financial costs and carbon benefits of REDD plus strategies in Southeast Asia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - REDD+ holds potential for mitigating emissions from tropical forest loss by providing financial incentives for carbon stored in forests, but its economic viability is under scrutiny. The primary narrative raised in the literature is thatREDD+ will be of limited utility for reducing forest carbon loss in Southeast Asia, while the level of finance committed falls short of profits from alternative land-use activities in the region, including large-scale timber and oil palm operations. Here we assess the financial costs and carbon benefits of various REDD+ strategies deployed in the region. We find the cost of reducing emissions ranges from $9 to $75 per tonne of avoided carbon emissions. The strategies focused on reducing forest degradation and promoting forest regrowth are the most cost-effective ways of reducing emissions and used in over 60% ofREDD+ projects. By comparing the financial costs and carbon benefits of a broader range of strategies than previously assessed, we highlight the variation between different strategies and draw attention to opportunities where REDD+ can achieve maximum carbon benefits cost-effectively. These findings have broad policy implications for Southeast Asia. Until carbon finance escalates, emissions reductions can be maximized from reforestation, reduced-impact logging and investing in improved management of protected areas. Targeting cost-efficient opportunities for REDD+ is important to improve the efficiency of national REDD+ policy, which in-turn fosters greater financial and political support for the scheme.

TI  - Lessons from fragmentation research: Improving management and policy guidelines for biodiversity conservation
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - Ideally, science should inform policy development in all areas of human endeavor. Nowhere is this truer than in the case of human land use and our impact on the natural environment. Unfortunately, little recent science has percolated into policy guidelines for tropical forest management in areas facing serious threats. To help science inform policy we present six guidelines, which have been empirically proven important, for the management of fragmented landscapes: (1) incorporate protection measures as part of development projects; (2) protect large areas and prevent the fragmentation of currently contiguous large patches of forest; (3) manage forest edges when creating forest patches; (4) protect gallery forests along waterways to connect isolated forest patches; (5) control the use of fire and the introduction of exotic plant species and limit the use of toxic chemicals in areas near forest patches; and (6) promote reforestation and forest cover in critical areas of landscapes. Straightforward linkages between science and policy formulation can result in simple, yet powerful, changes in land-use patterns and have a concurrent positive effect on biodiversity and natural resources.

TI  - Forage Grasses Steer Soil Nitrogen Processes, Microbial Populations, and Microbiome Composition in A Long-term Tropical Agriculture System
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Forage grasses used in cropping no-till systems in tropical regions alter soil chemical properties, but their longterm impact on soil microbial processes of the nitrogen (N) cycle and microbial community abundance, composition and structure are unknown. Here, microbial functions related to nitrogen fixation, nitrification and denitrification as well as bacterial, archaeal and fungal populations were evaluated in a long-term field experiment in which tropical forage grasses palisade grass (Urochloa brizantha (Hochst. Ex A. Rich.) R.D. Webster) and ruzigrass (U. ruziziensis (R. Germ. and C.M. Evrard) Crins) were cultivated with or without N fertilization. Uncultivated soil was used as a control. Forage grasses, especially palisade grass, increased soil bacterial and fungal abundances, whereas the archaeal population was highest in uncultivated soil. In soils cultivated with forage grasses, N fertilization favored N-cycle-related genes; however, cultivation of palisade grass increased the abundances of amoA bacteria (AOB) and amoA archaea (AOA) genes associated with soil nitrification and decreased the abundances of genes nirS, nirK and nosZ genes related to denitrification, compared to ruzigrass and control, regardless of N input. In addition, abundances of total bacteria and total fungi were associated with the N cycle and plant biomass in soils cultivated with forage grasses. Forage cultivation clearly benefitted the soil nutrient environment (S-SO42-, Mg2+, total-C and -N, N-NO3- and N-NH4+) and microbiome (bacteria and fungi) compared with uncultivated soil. In soil cultivated with palisade grass, the microbial community composition was unresponsive to N addition. The high N uptake by palisade grass supports the competitive advantage of this plant species over microorganisms for N sources. Our results suggest that palisade grass has advantages over ruzigrass for use in agriculture systems, regardless of N input.

TI  - Finding and promoting a local conservation consensus in a globally important tropical forest landscape
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Can democratic processes favour conservation outcomes in the tropics? This study focuses on local viewpoints within a forested landscape of high conservation significance in East Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo). Stakeholders received posters displaying results from a previous study; these posters emphasised local priorities and views regarding local biodiversity. We assess local attitudes to this information, and consider some implications. Knowledge of, and agreement with, poster content increased among villagers, townspeople and civil servants after they received posters. All respondents appreciated the posters and all supported some form of forest conservation. All respondents agreed that biodiversity conservation and local views are vital in land-use planning. All agreed that logging companies need to be better controlled, while 80% consider them a "major environmental threat". These results bolster our belief that involving communities is not only an ethically defensible way to achieve conservation outcomes, but also a pragmatic opportunity to do so.

TI  - The case for improved forest management (IFM) as a priority REDD plus strategy in the tropics
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - We address the controversy over REDD+ financing for commercial loggers who reduce emissions by adopting improved forest management (IFM). We argue that REDD+ incentives should be available to commercial loggers who adopt IFM as long as carbon accounting is rigorous and safeguards are followed. Further, we argue that where full forest protection is not feasible, IFM should be advanced as a priority REDD+ strategy because it can (i) achieve robust emissions reductions without generating leakage or increasing the risk of non-permanence, (ii) generate a variety of local community benefits as a low-carbon development strategy, (iii) maintain native forest biodiversity, and (iv) reduce the likelihood of deforestation, particularly when forest management is community-based. We discuss solutions to some of the remaining challenges to creating incentives for IFM within a REDD+ mechanism. We encourage continued refinement of safeguards to ensure that verified climate benefits of IFM also generate social and biodiversity benefits. REDD+ financing is needed to catalyze the shift to IFM, but IFM should not be dependent (or at least not fully dependent) upon REDD+ financing for long-term financial viability. Measuring, monitoring, and validating emissions reductions from IFM have been a particular challenge, although new technologies and methods are promising. Technologies and methods used to account for avoided deforestation are usually not sensitive enough to detect changes in forest management practices. Funding is needed for research to develop and refine affordable methodologies for measuring, monitoring, and validating emissions reductions achieved through IFM.

TI  - Stabilization of Organic Matter by Biochar Application in Compost-amended Soils with Contrasting pH Values and Textures
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Food demand and soil sustainability have become urgent concerns because of the impacts of global climate change. In subtropical and tropical regions, practical management that stabilizes and prevents organic fertilizers from rapid decomposition in soils is necessary. This study conducted a short-term (70 days) incubation experiment to assess the effects of biochar application on the decomposition of added bagasse compost in three rural soils with different pH values and textures. Two rice hull biochars, produced through slow pyrolization at 400 degrees C (RHB-400) and 700 degrees C (RHB-700), with application rates of 1%, 2%, and 4% (w/w), were separately incorporated into soils with and without compost (1% (w/w) application rate). Experimental results indicated that C mineralization rapidly increased at the beginning in all treatments, particularly in those involving 2% and 4% biochar. The biochar addition increased C mineralization by 7.9%-48% in the compost-amended soils after 70 days incubation while the fractions of mineralized C to applied C significantly decreased. Moreover, the estimated maximum of C mineralization amount in soils treated with both compost and biochar were obviously lower than expectation calculated by a double exponential model (two pool model). Based on the micromorphological observation, added compost was wrapped in the soil aggregates formed after biochar application and then may be protected from decomposing by microbes. Co-application of compost with biochar may be more efficient to stabilize and sequester C than individual application into the studied soils, especially for the biochar produced at high pyrolization temperature.

TI  - Natural history collections reveal species richness on a small isolated tropical island: the bats of Siberut
T2  - ORYX
AB  - The paucity of biodiversity assessments in the Palaeotropics has constrained recommendations for tropical forest conservation in areas such as Siberut, one of the Mentawai Islands in Indonesia known for its high endemicity. Taking advantage of information from museum collections amassed from the Indo-Malaya archipelago from the early 20th century onwards, we show how species records available through online databases of natural history collections can be used to assess the state of biodiversity when used in conjunction with a field survey, using bat species on Siberut as a study case. We obtained a total of 15 years of records from 1903 to 2013 (following searches of databases up to 2020), documenting 20 bat species on Siberut. Of these, our field survey contributed records of three additional species not previously recorded on the island. The species accumulation curve has not levelled off, suggesting that future surveys may discover additional bat species and highlighting Siberut's importance as bat habitat and source of tropical biodiversity.

TI  - THE CARBON-SEQUESTRATION POTENTIAL OF A GLOBAL AFFORESTATION PROGRAM
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB  - We analyzed the changes in the carbon cycle that could be achieved with a global, large-scale afforestation program that is economically, politically, and technically feasible. We estimated that of the areas regarded as suitable for large-scale plantations, only about 345 million ha would actually be available for plantations and agroforestry for the sole purpose of sequestering carbon. The maximum annual rate of carbon fixation (1.48 Gt/yr) would only be achieved 60 years after the establishment of the plantations - 1.14 Gt by above-ground biomass and 0.34 Gt by below-ground biomass. Over the period from 1995 to 2095, a total of 104 Gt of carbon would be sequestered. This is substantially lower than the amount of carbon required to offset current carbon emissions (3.8 Gt/yr) in order to stabilize the carbon content of the atmosphere.

TI  - Above-ground carbon stocks and timber value of old timber plantations, secondary and primary forests in southern Ghana
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - High deforestation rates, especially in the tropics, currently result in the annual emission of large amounts of carbon, contributing to global climate change. There is therefore an urgent need to take actions to mitigate climate change both by slowing down deforestation and by initiating new sinks. Tropical forest plantations are generally thought to sequester carbon rapidly during the initial years but there is limited knowledge on their long-term potential. In this study, we assessed the carbon sequestration in old (42-47 years) timber plantations of Aucoumea klaineana, Cedrela odorata, Tarrietia utilis, and Terminalia ivorensis, and secondary forests of similar ages, by comparing their basal areas and above-ground carbon stocks (AGC) to that of nearby primary forests. Additionally, we estimated and compared timber volume and stumpage value in the three forest types.
   Systematic random sampling of ninety-three 20 m x 20 m plots in eleven forest sites (2 secondary forests, 2 primary forests, and 7 timber plantations) was undertaken to determine the effect of forest type on AGC, basal area, timber volume, and stumpage value.
   After 42 years of growth, mean AGC of the timber plantations (159.7 +/- 14.3 Mg ha(-1)) was similar to that of primary forests (173.0 +/- 25.1 Mg ha(-1)) and both were significantly higher than the mean AGC of the secondary forests (103.6 +/- 12.3 Mg ha(-1)). Mean basal area and timber volume of the timber plantations and secondary forests were similar to that of the primary forests, though in each case the timber plantations had significantly higher values compared to the secondary forests. Mean timber value of the plantations ($8577 ha(-1)) was significantly higher than both secondary ($1870 ha(-1)) and primary forests ($3112 ha(-1)). Contrary to our expectations, naturally regenerated trees (woody recruits) within the timber plantations had similar AGC levels, basal area, timber volume, and value compared to the secondary forests.
   Long-rotation tropical forest plantations under low-intensity management could achieve higher AGC levels and thus have higher climate change mitigation potential and timber values compared to naturally regenerated secondary forests, and are able to reach values similar to primary forests. Monoculture timber plantations could facilitate the successful colonization of their understoreys by native woody recruits that contribute considerably to stand AGC and timber values. Long-rotation forest plantations in the tropics therefore have a critical role to play in forest rehabilitation and climate change mitigation while having the potential to provide modest financial returns to landowners through selective harvesting of timber and/or payments for carbon sequestration.

TI  - Tree diversity promotes generalist herbivore community patterns in a young subtropical forest experiment
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Stand diversification is considered a promising management approach to increasing the multifunctionality and ecological stability of forests. However, how tree diversity affects higher trophic levels and their role in regulating forest functioning is not well explored particularly for (sub)tropical regions. We analyzed the effects of tree species richness, community composition, and functional diversity on the abundance, species richness, and beta diversity of important functional groups of herbivores and predators in a large-scale forest biodiversity experiment in south-east China. Tree species richness promoted the abundance, but not the species richness, of the dominant, generalist herbivores (especially, adult leaf chewers), probably through diet mixing effects. In contrast, tree richness did not affect the abundance of more specialized herbivores (larval leaf chewers, sap suckers) or predators (web and hunting spiders), and only increased the species richness of larval chewers. Leaf chemical diversity was unrelated to the arthropod data, and leaf morphological diversity only positively affected oligophagous herbivore and hunting spider abundance. However, richness and abundance of all arthropods showed relationships with community-weighted leaf trait means (CWM). The effects of trait diversity and CWMs probably reflect specific nutritional or habitat requirements. This is supported by the strong effects of tree species composition and CWMs on herbivore and spider beta diversity. Although specialized herbivores are generally assumed to determine herbivore effects in species-rich forests, our study suggests that generalist herbivores can be crucial for trophic interactions. Our results indicate that promoting pest control through stand diversification might require a stronger focus on identifying the best-performing tree species mixtures.

TI  - Monitoring carbon stocks in the tropics and the remote sensing operational limitations: from local to regional projects
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Current remote sensing technologies are effective tools for contributing to the estimation of terrestrial carbon stocks and carbon stock changes. This paper provides an overview of information requirements, sensor capabilities and limitations, and analysis approaches for the use of remotely sensed data in the generation of tropical carbon sequestration monitoring systems. While it is evident that remotely sensed data have tremendous utility for monitoring carbon stock changes, it is important to be aware of their limitations. Three critical limitations are: (1) the definition of methods and algorithms to accurately estimate forest age, (2) the provision of techniques that can yield accurate estimation of deforestation rates in both tropical dry and wet forest environments, and (3) the strong need to develop new approaches to link biophysical variables (e. g., leaf area index) to spectral reflectance to support spatially distributed carbon sequestration models. The validity of final estimates of carbon and carbon stock changes rests on complex issues at several levels, from the data themselves, to the analysis, interpretation, and validation of the data. Consideration of these issues, as well as the need for sound project planning and development within budget constraints, will be important in the development of carbon stock monitoring programs in the tropics.

TI  - Hydrological processes in major types of Chinese forest
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
CP  - Annual Hydrology Session Meeting of the Canadian-Geophysical-Union
AB  - Overexploitation of forest resources in China has caused serious concerns over its negative impacts on water resources, biodiversity, soil erosion, wildlife habitat and community stability. One key concern is the impact of forestry practices on hydrological processes, particularly the effect of forest harvest on water quality and quantity. Since the mid 1980s, a series of scientific studies on forest hydrology have been initiated in major types of forest across the country, including Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis), Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata), oak (Quercus mongolica), larch (Larix gmelinii), faber fir (Abies fabri), Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis), armand pine (Pinus arandi), birch (Betula platyphylla) and some tropical forests. These studies measured rainfall interception, streamflow, evapotranspiration and impacts of forest management (clearcutting and reforestation). This paper reviews key findings from these forest hydrological studies conducted over the past 20 years in China.
   Forest canopy interception rates varied from 15 to 30% of total rainfall, depending on forest canopy and rainfall characteristics. Stemflow is generally a small percentage (< 5%) of total rainfall, but it accounts for 15% in the oak forest in northeast China. The high amounts of stemflow, as well as higher amounts of nutrients contained in stemflow, may allow oak trees to adapt to a dry and nutrient-poor environment. Evapotranspiration was a significant component of the water budget in these Chinese forests studied, ranging from 80-90% of total rainfall in the northern temperate forests to 40-50% in the southern tropical forests. Forests substantially reduced surface runoff and erosion. However, no consistent response on total streamflows was observed. The reason for the inconsistency may be due to complexities of streamflow processes and the utilization of different methodologies applied at the various spatial scales.

TI  - The herpetofauna of the Baja California Peninsula and its adjacent islands, Mexico: composition, distribution, and conservation status
T2  - AMPHIBIAN & REPTILE CONSERVATION
AB  - herpetofauna of the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico, consists of 172 species, including 18 anurans, three salamanders, 140 squamates, and 11 turtles. Among the 10 recognized geographic regions, the total number of herpetofaunal species ranges from a low of 27 in the Baja California Coniferous Forest Region to 84 in the Gulf Islands Region. The individual species occupy from one to 10 regions (x = 3.3). The Gulf Islands Region is of the greatest significant conservation importance, inasmuch as it contains the largest overall number of species (84), the largest number of single-region species (39), and the greatest number of peninsular endemics (50). A similarity dendrogram based on the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Averages (UPGMA) indicates that the two most closely related regions are the Central Gulf Coast Region and the Arid Tropical Region, while the most distantly related region is the Baja California Coniferous Forest Region. Among the distributional categories, the greatest number of species are the non-endemics (81 of 172, or 47.1%), followed by the peninsular endemics (77, 44.8%), and finally, the non-natives (14, 8.1%). The principal environmental threats to the herpetofauna of the Baja California Peninsula are land conversion and habitat loss, water diversion and overuse, invasive species, livestock grazing, illegal trade, off-road activities, infectious diseases, and climate change. We assessed the conservation status of the native species by employing the SEMARNAT, IUCN, and EVS systems. Of the 158 native species, 85 are included in NOM-059-SEMARNAT, 15 are in the IUCN Threatened categories, and 76 have high EVS values. Two Relative Herpetofaunal Priority (RHP) methods were used to identify the rank order significance of the 10 geographic regions, and the highest ranks for both methods were obtained for the Gulf Islands Region. Thirty protected areas are located in the Baja California Peninsula, and they comprise almost one-half of the total area. All but eight of the 158 native herpetofaunal species are represented within the system of protected areas. Few herpetofaunal surveys of the protected areas have been completed thus far, so this is a major conservation goal for the future.

TI  - Responses to competition for nitrogen between subtropical native tree seedlings and exotic grasses are species-specific and mediated by soil N availability
T2  - TREE PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Competitive interactions between native tree seedlings and exotic grasses frequently hinder forest restoration. We investigated the consequences of competition with exotic grasses on the growth and net nitrogen (N) uptake capacity of native rainforest seedlings used for reforestation depending on soil N availability and N source. Tree seedlings and grasses were grown in the greenhouse in different competition regimes (one tree species vs one grass species) and controls (grass monocultures or single tree seedlings) at low and high soil N. After 8 weeks, we quantified net N uptake capacity using N-15-labelled organic (i.e., glutamine and arginine) and inorganic (i.e., ammonium and nitrate) N sources and biomass indices. Depending on soil N availability, we observed different species-specific responses to growth and N acquisition. Tree seedlings generally increased their net N uptake capacity in response to competition with grasses, although overall seedling growth was unaffected. In contrast, the responses to competition by the grasses were species-specific and varied with soil N availability. The different N acquisition strategies suggest the avoidance of competition for N between trees and grasses. Overall, the results highlight that quantifying underlying mechanisms of N acquisition complements the information on biomass allocation as a measure of responses to competition, particularly with varying environmental conditions.

TI  - An overview of forest loss and restoration in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - NEW FORESTS
AB  - Forest restoration is a strategy to reverse forest loss and degradation. We overviewed deforestation in the period 1975-2018 in the Brazilian Amazon and the projects, techniques, and scientific publications conducted to recover forest in the area by 2019. We used GIS to assess forest loss and a systematic data collection gathered from 12 universities, five major environmental agencies, and an ad-hoc bibliographic survey that rendered information from 405 restoration projects and 152 published studies. The Brazilian Amazon has undergone an accelerated deforestation in the last 43 years, resulting in 20% (788,353 km(2)) of its territory deforested by 2018. Deforestation rate was 27,033 km(2) yr(-1) between 1975 and 1987 and 14,542 km(2) yr(-1) between 1988 and 2018 (1.97% yr(-1) of forest loss between 1975 and 2018). In 2018, 41 Amazonian municipalities were classified as priority areas for monitoring and control deforestation and 21 additional municipalities were deemed as areas with controlled deforestation. Our survey identified 405 projects of forest restoration in 191 municipalities between 1950 and 2017. The majority (229) of these projects used seedling planting as the main forest restoration technique. Forest restoration projects based upon agroforestry systems (144), assisted natural regeneration (27), and natural regeneration (5) were also identified. Despite a considerable number of projects and publications, the region still lacks scientific studies that reinforce the choice of best practices for forest restoration, and the information currently available is not enough to quantify what has already been recovered or the potential area to be restored.

TI  - Exploring the gap between conservation science and protected area establishment in the Allpahuayo-Mishana National Reserve (Peruvian Amazonia)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Global assessments demonstrate that as a conservation measure protected areas (PAs) are incomplete, and tend to be poorly documented in the international scientific literature, hindering the assessment of their scientific and policy foundations. The step from mapping priority areas for biodiversity conservation based on scientific information to formulating the practical tools for conserving biological diversity is critical; several key aspects such as legislative frameworks, multi-scale politics and socioeconomic realities must be taken into account. With the planet's human population continuing to grow, this step is all the more crucial, as the designation of PAs is increasingly being forced alongside the development frontier. This paper examines the process of reserve establishment in the case of the Allpahuayo-Mishana National Reserve (AMNR) (Peruvian Amazonia). On the basis of interviews, document analysis and media studies, a series of actions and reactions worked to shape the ultimate categorization and management plan of the AMNR. While scientific knowledge played a central role in the initial selection of the AMNR site, a number of critical aspects such as estimated environmental services, unresolved land entitlements, use values and multi-scale politics needed to be addressed in order to meet the originally set objective of biodiversity conservation. The importance of several biophysical features of the AMNR was initially emphasized as a key argument for conservation, whereas potential benefits of the AMNR (such as environmental services, particularly at the regional scale) proved to be the ultimate driving factor. Between the AMNR's official establishment in 1999 and its approved categorization and management plan in 2004 and 2005, respectively, a substantial shift in argumentation was witnessed. This change was particularly influential in that, contrary to what was initially expected, the livelihood requirements of local communities that were strongly linked to land entitlements and natural resources management came to play an essential role in both the categorization process and in the elaboration of the management plan of the Reserve. The AMNR was only effectively established because of this shift in emphasis.

TI  - Endemic butterflies on Grande Comore: habitat preferences and conservation priorities
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - The island of Grande Comore (Comoro Islands, western Indian Ocean) has an endemic butterfly fauna threatened by rapid habitat change. Transect counts were used to assess the abundance and species richness of butterflies in different habitats, and along an elevational gradient. Species richness of non-endemic butterflies was highest in low elevation, man-modified habitats. In contrast, most endemic butterflies were confined to forest habitats, which only remain above 500 m elevation. Richness and abundance of endemic butterflies were highest at the lower elevational limits of the remaining forest. Controlling for elevation, the richness of endemic butterflies was highest in mature forest where the gross structure of the forest remained intact, lower in scrubby secondary forest, and lowest in pioneer forest on old lava flows. The survival of the majority of the endemic butterflies may depend on forest conservation measures in the rapidly diminishing areas of mature forest at mid elevations. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - Specific effects of tree species on soil carbon sequestration in a rice-tree association mesocosm experiment: Evidence from natural <SUP>13</SUP>C abundance
T2  - RHIZOSPHERE
AB  - Within agroforestry systems, trees greatly contribute to soil carbon (C) sequestration. We still know little about how this contribution varies according to tree species. Here, we quantified the soil C content derived from three main tree species, Eucalyptus robusta, Coffea arabica and Citrus clementina, used in rainfed rice-based agroforestry in the Highlands of Madagascar. A fully factorial controlled mesocosm experiment was performed, with seedlings of the tree species planted with or without rice in a Ferralsol. The natural C-13 abundance in the soil was measured to assess tree-and rice-derived C. One year after planting, Eucalyptus robusta was the species exhibiting the highest tree-derived C values, with 148 g C m(-2) on average. In contrast, Citrus clementina transferred only 12 g C m(-2) to the soil. No significant contribution of Coffea arabica to the soil C stock was found. The presence of rice affected neither the growth of tree seedlings nor their abilities to provide C to the soil. The difference in soil C sequestration among tree species was significantly correlated with differential root biomass. Tree root biomass was significantly correlated with soil delta C-13. This experimental assay highlighted the contrasting contributions of tree species to ecological processes such as soil C sequestration at the early stage of agroforestry establishment. Further studies considering tree density and spatial arrangement should be conducted under field conditions to gain further insights into tree contributions to soil C sequestration in agroforestry systems.

TI  - The diversity and distribution of lianas under various disturbance regimes in Chilimo dry Afromontane forest, Ethiopia
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Lianas contribute substantially to plant diversity and to local people's livelihood in tropical forests around the world. However, their species composition and the factors that determine their distribution in dry Afromontane forests are less explored. In this study, we quantified the diversity and density of lianas under various anthropogenic disturbance levels in Chilimo dry Afromontane forest of Ethiopia. We also assessed their importance to the local people. All woody species >= 10 cm and lianas having >= 1 cm diameter size at the point of measurement were recorded in 72, 20 m x 20 m plots distributed on seven transect lines with 2 km distance between transects. We found twenty-four woody vines that belong to 19 genera and 15 families, having an overall density of 1358 liana stems per hectare. These lianas contributed about 25% to the woody plant diversity of the study forest. Six liana-climbing modes were recorded. Stem twiners were predominant in terms of species richness while Scrambler armed climbers were the most abundant species. Liana species richness and abundance were significantly different among the low, moderate, and high forest disturbance levels (p < 0.05) and Liana diversity significantly reduced in highly disturbed forest plots (p < 0.01). Human disturbance indirectly hinders liana assemblage, as liana species richness and abundance showed a positive relationship (p < 0.05) with tree species richness and abundance. The five most abundant species were Carissa spinarum, Rubus steudneri, Rosa abyssinica, Jasminum abyssinicum, and Urera hypselodendron. All the enumerated liana species identified had medicinal, veterinary, food, fence, traditional house construction, fuelwood, grazing, artisan work, and honeybee forage importance to the local residents. Carissa spinarum, Clematis simensis, and Rosa abyssinica were found to be the most important species to the local people having 2, 1.54 and 1.53 importance value index, respectively. There is a need of implementing effective forest management through strengthening the ongoing participatory forest management program to reverse the negative impacts of anthropogenic forest disturbances and to sustain dry Afromontane lianas and their roles in biodiversity and socioeconomic aspects.

TI  - Reduction of emissions by avoided deforestation in andean high-land tropical forests
T2  - REVISTA DE CIENCIAS AGRICOLAS
AB  - Deforestation and forest degradation, mainly in areas with high carbon density, is one of the most important source of greenhouse gases (GHG). The impact of deforestation on carbon storage in total biomass and its CO2 emissions is analyzed in four land covers in the Santuario de Fauna y Flora Iguaque (SFFI), Boyaca, Colombia. A total of 32 temporal sampling plots (TSP) of 250m(2) was established to measure trees with diameter at breast height (dbh) >= 10 cm whereas 17 TSP of 36m(2) were established to measure total and stipe height of all frailejones (Espeletia boyacensis Cuatrec, E. tunjana Cuatrec and E. cf. Incana). Above and belowground biomass was estimated with allometric models, whereas carbon was calculated using the a fraction of 0.47. The sampling area was proportional to the area of each land cover: open heathlands and moorlands (OMH), dense heathlands and moorlands (DMH), broad-leaved forest with continuous canopy, not on mire (BFCC), natural grassland prevailingly without trees and shrubs (NSWT). BFCC and DMH showed higher carbon storage in biomass (55 and 27Mg C/ha, respectively). SFFI stored around 135.9Gg C, from which 25-38Gg CO(2)e could be emitted to the atmosphere in the 20 next years if the deforestation rates continue. BFCC and OMH are the covers with the highest potential of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Therefore, prioritizing the preservation of these ecosystems by Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) programs, is a key to counter the effects of climate change and ensure the supply of ecosystemic services that support local communities' livelihoods.

TI  - A framework for monitoring indicators of ecological sustainability in tropical forestry
T2  - CRITERIA AND INDICATORS FOR SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT AT THE FOREST MANAGEMENT UNIT LEVEL
CP  - Conference on the Criteria and Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management at the Forest Management Unit Level
AB  - Certifying ecologically acceptable forest management requires monitoring forest conditions and the environmental impacts of management activities. Through adaptive management, assessments that reveal excessive environmental impacts require revision of the management plan so that the ecological functions and attributes of forest ecosystems are maintained within acceptable limits. But how are these acceptable limits determined? And how can 'normal' or 'natural' conditions be defined when these are temporally or spatially variable. To determine the desired biological state of a forest indicator baseline values, together with some measure of variability under natural conditions, are needed. A useful Ecological Criteria and Indicator set should, therefore, provide objective standards for evaluation, and these standards should account for spatial and temporal variation in indicator states as well as resilience to anthropogenic disturbance. A framework is presented, within which the standards for assessing ecologically sustainable forest management might be defined. The published literature is drawn upon to determine the responses of selected indicators to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Using these values we can begin to predict expected ecological conditions of a sustainably managed forest given information on forest type, disturbance intensity and time since disturbance.

TI  - Carbon storage and emissions offset potential in an African dry forest, the Arabuko-Sokoke Forest, Kenya
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB  - Concerns about rapid tropical deforestation, and its contribution to rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, increase the importance of monitoring terrestrial carbon storage in changing landscapes. Emerging markets for carbon emission offsets may offer developing nations needed incentives for reforestation, rehabilitation, and avoided deforestation. However, relatively little empirical data exists regarding carbon storage in African tropical forests, particularly for those in arid or semi-arid regions. Kenya's 416 km(2) Arabuko-Sokoke Forest (ASF) is the largest remaining fragment of East African coastal dry forest and is considered a global biodiversity hotspot (Myers et al. 2000), but has been significantly altered by past commercial logging and ongoing extraction. Forest carbon storage for ASF was estimated using allometric equations for tree biomass, destructive techniques for litter and herbaceous vegetation biomass, and spectroscopy for soils. Satellite imagery was used to assess land cover changes from 1992 to 2004. Forest and thicket types (Cynometra webberi dominated, Brachystegia spiciformis dominated, and mixed species forest) had carbon densities ranging from 58 to 94 Mg C/ha. The ASF area supported a 2.8-3.0 Tg C carbon stock. Although total forested area in ASF did not change over the analyzed time period, ongoing disturbances, quantified by the basal area of cut tree stumps per sample plot, correlated with decreased carbon densities. Madunguni Forest, an adjoining forest patch, lost 86% of its forest cover and at least 76% of its terrestrial carbon stock in the time period. Improved management of wood harvesting in ASF and rehabilitation of Madunguni Forest could substantially increase terrestrial carbon sequestration in the region.

TI  - Beyond species loss: How anthropogenic disturbances drive functional and phylogenetic homogenization of Neotropical dung beetles
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Anthropogenic activities drive tropical forest loss and biodiversity decay. However, few studies have addressed how the biodiversity response varies between disturbance-adapted species (i.e., winners) and those highly susceptible to disturbance (i.e., losers), or whether such responses differ between the taxonomic, functional, or phylogenetic dimen-sions of diversity. Understanding these dynamics can help prevent or buffer biotic homogenization processes. Using a meta-analytical approach with dung beetles as model organisms, we evaluated how anthropogenic habitat distur-bances influence the multiple diversity dimensions of winner and loser species relative to conserved forest sites in the Neotropics. Habitats were organized according to a disturbance gradient ranging from second-growth forests, shaded agroforestry, lowly-shaded agroforestry, living fences, and pastures. Our database included 30 studies, from which we calculated nine metrics divided into three alfa diversity aspects: richness, evenness, and divergence. We also evaluated the beta-diversity response to disturbance and forest protection. All dimensions of dung beetle diversity decreased significantly with increasing disturbance levels, with phylogenetic diversity showing the highest losses, whereas evenness metrics increased in second-growth forests and agroforestry systems. Loser dung beetles showed high diversity loss as well as functional and phylogenetic clustering, reflecting a pervasive biotic homogenization in the most severely disturbed habitats, whereas winner species were insensitive to anthropogenic disturbances. Beta di-versity increased significantly with disturbance and forest protection. Our study showed that heavy disturbances erode and homogenized all diversity dimensions of loser dung beetles. However, second-growth forests and agroforestry sys-tems mitigated diversity loss and homogenization processes by favoring the coexistence between functional and phy-logenetically distant species and maintaining assemblages compositionally similar to those in conserved forests, highlighting their importance for conservation. We encourage natural resource managers to consider protection of dis-turbed off-reserve forests in management schemes as these are essential for maintaining biodiversity in an increasingly anthropized world.

TI  - Fuelwood collection and its impacts on a protected tropical mountain forest in Uganda
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Local communities who live close to protected tropical forests often depend on them for woodfuel, their main source of energy. The impacts of fuelwood extraction in humid forests are rarely studied, yet the extraction of wood for fuel can impact forest structure, function and biodiversity. We assessed the effects of fuelwood collection on the forest of Mt Elgon National Park (Uganda). We interviewed 192 households about fuelwood use and surveyed dead wood in 81 plots inside the park. Forest was the most important source of fuelwood. People collected on average between 1.1 and 2.0 m(3) of fuelwood per capita per year. Other activities involving wood fuel extraction from the forest included illegal commercial fuelwood harvesting and charcoal making. Quantities of dead wood were affected by fuelwood collection up to at least 1000 m inside the boundary of the park. Depletion of dead wood inside the park was greater in the sites where the population was most dense. Nevertheless, people who planted more trees on their own land perceived land outside the park to be important and valued old growth forest less as a source of fuelwood. Highly-preferred tree species were most depleted, particularly when they were also valued timber trees, such as Prunus africana, Popocarpus milianjianus, Allophylus abyssinicus and Olea spp. Locally dominant species were less affected. Impacts varied among sites depending on the history of agricultural encroachment and locally-specific forest uses, e.g. harvesting of trees for poles or use of the forest land for grazing. Allowing the collection of dead wood in forests is double-edged as it creates opportunities for other activities that are more damaging. Demand for wood fuel from tropical forests is still likely to grow in the foreseeable future. Our results indicate that the forest may become more degraded as a result, with negative consequences for the people who depend on the forest and for conservation. Research into local ecological and cultural contexts and perceptions concerning costs and benefits can help devise more sustainable management options, including alternative sources of fuel.

TI  - An Amazonian rainforest and its fragments as a laboratory of global change
T2  - BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
AB  - We synthesize findings from one of the world's largest and longest-running experimental investigations, the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP). Spanning an area of similar to 1000 km(2) in central Amazonia, the BDFFP was initially designed to evaluate the effects of fragment area on rainforest biodiversity and ecological processes. However, over its 38-year history to date the project has far transcended its original mission, and now focuses more broadly on landscape dynamics, forest regeneration, regional- and global-change phenomena, and their potential interactions and implications for Amazonian forest conservation. The project has yielded a wealth of insights into the ecological and environmental changes in fragmented forests. For instance, many rainforest species are naturally rare and hence are either missing entirely from many fragments or so sparsely represented as to have little chance of long-term survival. Additionally, edge effects are a prominent driver of fragment dynamics, strongly affecting forest microclimate, tree mortality, carbon storage and a diversity of fauna.
   Even within our controlled study area, the landscape has been highly dynamic: for example, the matrix of vegetation surrounding fragments has changed markedly over time, succeeding from large cattle pastures or forest clearcuts to secondary regrowth forest. This, in turn, has influenced the dynamics of plant and animal communities and their trajectories of change over time. In general, fauna and flora have responded differently to fragmentation: the most locally extinction-prone animal species are those that have both large area requirements and low tolerance of the modified habitats surrounding fragments, whereas the most vulnerable plants are those that respond poorly to edge effects or chronic forest disturbances, and that rely on vulnerable animals for seed dispersal or pollination.
   Relative to intact forests, most fragments are hyperdynamic, with unstable or fluctuating populations of species in response to a variety of external vicissitudes. Rare weather events such as droughts, windstorms and floods have had strong impacts on fragments and left lasting legacies of change. Both forest fragments and the intact forests in our study area appear to be influenced by larger-scale environmental drivers operating at regional or global scales. These drivers are apparently increasing forest productivity and have led to concerted, widespread increases in forest dynamics and plant growth, shifts in tree-community composition, and increases in liana (woody vine) abundance. Such large-scale drivers are likely to interact synergistically with habitat fragmentation, exacerbating its effects for some species and ecological phenomena. Hence, the impacts of fragmentation on Amazonian biodiversity and ecosystem processes appear to be a consequence not only of local site features but also of broader changes occurring at landscape, regional and even global scales.

TI  - Microsite determinants of variability in seedling and cutting establishment in tropical forest restoration plantations
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Plantations are frequently established on abandoned pasture lands to speed forest recovery. This strategy requires matching a tree species mix with the prevailing microenvironmental conditions. In four degraded pastures of the Mexican Lacandon rainforest, we planted 2,400 trees of 6 species (Guazuma ulmifolia, Inga vera, Ochroma pyramidale, Trichospermum mexicanum, Bursera simaruba, and Spondias mombin) to (1) test survival, initial growth, and establishment costs; (2) evaluate whether vegetative cuttings outperform direct seeding or transplants of nursery-raised seedlings; (3) determine tree response to herbaceous dominance and soil compaction; and (4) scrutinize the results' consistency across sites and sampling scales of tree-microenvironment interactions (individual tree vs. averaged plot responses). After 2 years, overall survival and growth rates were high for 2 of 3 nursery-raised species. Contrary to expectations, all seedlings outperformed the cuttings while direct seeding resulted in a cost-effective option of intermediate efficacy. The impact of soil resistance to root penetration on tree biomass accumulation was species dependent while bulk density was not relevant. Soil-covering, herbaceous vegetation accelerated growth in 3 of 4 tested species during the dry season. At this initial stage of forest restoration in abandoned pastures, Guazuma and Trichospermum were the most restoration-effective species. Costs can be reduced by using direct-seeding Inga and avoiding weeding during the dry season. Finally, our results demonstrate how species selection trials can be misleading due to site variations in tree response and to sampling scales that fail to account for small-scale environmental heterogeneity. We recommend ways to improve the design of restoration trials.

TI  - The geospatial modelling of carbon sequestration in Oluwa Forest, Ondo State, Nigeria
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The study assessed the amount of carbon being sequestrated in the Ondo State Afforestation Project in Oluwa Forest, south - west of Nigeria, with the view to determine the above ground biomass (AGB) and belowground biomass (BGB), estimate the total carbon content and evaluate the CO2 sequestered. Geospatial techniques and the non-destructive field observation method were used. The results showed that a total of 359 megatons of CO2 was estimated to have been sequestered using the non-destructive field measurements. In addition, the rate of change in land use land cover between 1984 and 2015 was determined. A geospatial database derived from field measurements was developed to monitor carbon content of the forest.

TI  - Agroforestry in Liberia: household practices, perceptions and livelihood benefits
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - In Liberia emphases have been placed on reducing deforestation and increasing food security through the transition of smallholder farmers from shifting cultivation to permanent agricultural systems, including tree cropping and agroforestry systems. A structured survey instrument was administered to 80 households in Bong and Lofa counties, Liberia to assess the socio-cultural feasibility of increasing tree cropping and agroforestry practices among smallholder farmers. The survey investigated household use, perceptions and impediments towards tree cropping and agroforestry and livelihood impacts of these practices, including income diversification and food security. Income was the driving motivation for tree cropping, and insecure land tenure was the most significant impediment. Tree cropping households tended to be male-headed, and differed in age distribution. Households that practiced tree cropping had improved income diversification, and those which used agroforestry practices experienced enhanced food security. Respondent perceptions regarding competition between tree crops and herbaceous crops often prevented incorporation of agroforestry practices. Nearly all households practiced shifting cultivation, independent of whether or not they cultivated trees. This suggests that a transition away from shifting cultivation to agroforestry systems will require greater efforts to address socio-political factors, including cultural perceptions and traditions, land tenure, gender, and household demographics.

TI  - Positive Effects of Scattered Trees on Soil Water Dynamics in a Pasture Landscape in the Tropics
T2  - FRONTIERS IN WATER
AB  - As a result of canopy interception and transpiration, trees are often assumed to have negative effects on the local hydrological budget resulting in reduced soil and groundwater resources. However, it has also been shown that trees can have positive effects through reducing surface run-off and improving soil infiltrability and groundwater recharge, especially in many tropical ecosystems characterized by high rain intensity and degradation-prone soils. In this study, we used isotopic measurements of soil water to better understand the main processes by which trees influence local soil water dynamics within a tropical pasture with scattered tree cover in the Copan River catchment, Honduras. We also determined the stable isotope signature of xylem water in grasses and trees to assess potential competition for water sources during the wet and dry seasons. During the wet season, when soil water availability was not limiting, both grasses and trees primarily utilized soil water near the soil surface (i.e., 0-10 cm). In contrast, during the dry season, we observed niche partitioning for water resources where grasses primarily utilized soil moisture at deeper soil depth (i.e., 90-100 cm) while trees relied heavily on groundwater. Moreover, isotopic data of soil water suggest that trees reduce evaporative water losses from the soil surface, as indicated by the lack of correlation between soil water content and lc-excess (line condition excess) values of surface soil water under trees, and enhance preferential flow as suggested by less negative lc-excess values under trees compared to open areas during the dry season. Taken together, our findings provide further support that trees can have positive effects on the local water balance with implication for landscape management, promoting the inclusion of scattered trees to provide water ecosystem services in silvopastoral systems, adding to other ecosystem services like biodiversity or carbon sequestration.

TI  - Forests and water-Ensuring forest benefits outweigh water costs
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
CP  - 22nd World Congress of the International-Union-of-Forest-Research-Organizations
AB  - Throughout the world forestry programmes are often promoted for their environmental, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, bio-fuel, timber production, amenity and social benefits. Not always are the water resource costs taken into account. This paper discusses the need for an improved forest impact assessment framework to assist policymakers and planners in making evidence-based decisions on forest and land use policy. Although forest hydrology has made major advances in recent years science findings have not always reached the policy domain. Examples of the need for the improved connection of science and policy are given for China, India, Panama, UK and Japan. New tools and approaches are suggested for helping to bridge the research to policy gap and to ensure that forest programmes are set in the context of lone-term sustainable land and water management. The paper echoes the call by the International Union of Forest Research Organisations for a task force on forest and water interactions to address these issues. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Fire and grazing modify grass community response to environmental determinants in savannas: Implications for sustainable use
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Tropical dry forests and savannas are important repositories of plant diversity and ecosystem services in the tropics. These ecosystems are also used extensively for grazing by livestock, and represent a critical element of the rural economy of many tropical countries. Fire is considered as a part of co-evolution in these ecosystems across the globe. However, in recent decades, there has been a shift in historical fire regime. Fire has become more frequent in these landscapes, and could be further enhanced under climate change. This poses threats to existing biodiversity, ecosystem processes, and rural economy. We asked how variability in fire frequency has influenced diversity and heterogeneity in grass species composition, and richness and abundance of grass species preferred by large herbivores (referred to as grazing acceptability) in a South Indian tropical savanna forest. We assumed that an increase in fire frequency acts as the active constraint and limits an ecosystem from attaining the maximum heterogeneity, and the maximum grazing acceptability (maximum richness and abundance of grass species preferred by herbivores) in its native settings. We used MODIS active fire and burned area products to estimate fire frequency across the landscape. A nested sampling approach was used to collect information on vegetation and soil at different fire frequencies. Quantile regression analyses indicated that diversity and heterogeneity in grass species composition as well a's grazing acceptability decreased with increasing fire frequencies. We found that livestock grazing intervened with the observed vegetation patterns; grass species diversity and heterogeneity, and grazing acceptability increased with grazing intensity at lower quantiles. Other measured covariates, rainfall, and soil-fertility, alone were not able to explain the observed vegetation patterns in the landscape. The results show a need to control annual fires but allow and manage intermittent fires in this landscape. A complete suppression of fire is not desirable as fire releases nutrients from burning of deeper-rooted vegetation and thus acts as a periodic nutrient pump. It also played an important role in maintaining the grass cover by reducing shrub cover. Hence, it is important to consider the complex interactions between fires-grazers-soil-vegetation to develop effective management practices. We conclude that fire frequency should be managed at low to intermediate levels (one fire in every 5-9 years, resembling the native settings), and grazing regulated, in order to sustain wild and domestic herbivores, biodiversity, and other key ecosystem processes and services over the long-term.

TI  - Community managed forests and forest protected areas: An assessment of their conservation effectiveness across the tropics
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - This paper assesses the role of protected and community managed forests for the long term maintenance of forest cover in the tropics. Through a meta-analysis of published case-studies, we compare land use/cover change data for these two broad types of forest management and assess their performance in maintaining forest cover. Case studies included 40 protected areas and 33 community managed forests from the peer reviewed literature. A statistical comparison of annual deforestation rates and a Qualitative Comparative Analysis were conducted. We found that as a whole, community managed forests presented lower and less variable annual deforestation rates than protected forests. We consider that a more resilient and robust forest conservation strategy should encompass a regional vision with different land use types in which social and economic needs of local inhabitants, as well as tenure rights and local capacities, are recognized. Further research for understanding institutional arrangements that derive from local governance in favor of tropical forest conservation is recommended. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of management strategies in a nucleation experiment in a tropical dry forest
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Cost-effective, large-scale strategies are needed to restore degraded ecosystems worldwide. Applied nucleation is one technique that can accelerate succession in tropical forests. However, the effectiveness of irrigation and fertilization in the context of large-scale applied nucleation in tropical dry forests (TDFs) has not yet been tested. To this end, we established a large-scale experiment in southwestern Colombia on abandoned pastures. We planted 11,382 seedlings of 11 native species coupled with six management treatments that varied in the amounts of fertilizer and water. We monitored survival, height, and resprouting ability seedlings over 2 years. We also estimated the cost of seedling production, planting procedures, management, and monitoring, and assessed their cost-effectiveness using seedling survival as an indication of effectiveness. After 2 years, 73% (8,266) of seedlings planted survived, and species survival ranged from 5 to 99%. Individuals that received the lowest amount of fertilizer (25 g of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium [NPK]) with additional irrigation had the highest survival rates (>76%). Final height ranged from 52 to 330 cm across species. Seedlings that received the highest amount of fertilizer (50 g of NPK) without additional irrigation had the highest mean final height (174 +/- 9.0 cm). The control was cheapest ($7313/ha) and the most cost-effective method in terms of seedling survival. Our findings suggest that the best way to establish cost-effective, large-scale restoration projects in TDFs is to plant native species mixtures of locally adapted species without fertilization and irrigation and to invest in long-term monitoring.

AB  - Forest biomass is a key influence for future climate, and the world urgently needs highly scalable financing schemes, such as carbon offsetting certifications, to protect and restore forests. Current manual forest carbon stock inventory methods of measuring single trees by hand are time, labour, and cost intensive and have been shown to be subjective. They can lead to substantial overestimation of the carbon stock and ultimately distrust in forest financing. The potential for impact and scale of leveraging advancements in machine learning and remote sensing technologies is promising, but needs to be of high quality in order to replace the current forest stock protocols for certifications.
   In this paper, we present ReforesTree, a benchmark dataset of forest carbon stock in six agro-forestry carbon offsetting sites in Ecuador. Furthermore, we show that a deep learning-based end-to-end model using individual tree detection from low cost RGB-only drone imagery is accurately estimating forest carbon stock within official carbon offsetting certification standards. Additionally, our baseline CNN model outperforms state-of-the-art satellite-based forest biomass and carbon stock estimates for this type of small-scale, tropical agro-forestry sites. We present this dataset to encourage machine learning research in this area to increase accountability and transparency of monitoring, verification and reporting (MVR) in carbon offsetting projects, as well as scaling global reforestation financing through accurate remote sensing.

TI  - Recovery of soil phosphorus on former bauxite mines through tropical forest restoration
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Soil phosphorus (P) is a major driver of forest development and a critically limited nutrient in tropical soils, especially when topsoil is removed by mining. This nutrient can be present in soils in the form of different fractions, which have direct consequences for P availability to plants and, consequently, for restoration success. Therefore, understanding how the stocks of different soil P fractions change over the restoration process can be essential for guiding restoration interventions, monitoring, and adaptive management. Here, we investigated the recovery of soil P fractions by forest restoration interventions on bauxite mine sites in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We assessed the concentration of different fractions of soil organic and inorganic P at (1) a bauxite mine prepared for restoration; (2) two former bauxite mines undergoing forest restoration for 6 and 24 years; and (3) an old-growth forest remnant. Overall, restored areas recovered levels of labile organic P (P-o-NaHCO3) at 5-40 cm and of moderately labile organic P (P-o-NaOH) at different depths, exhibiting concentrations similar to those found in a conserved forest. The use of P-rich fertilizers and forest topsoil may have greatly contributed to this outcome. Some other fractions, however, recovered only after 24 years of restoration. Other inorganic P fractions did not differ among mined, restored, and conserved sites: nonlabile P-i(residual P and P-HCl), labile P-i(P-i-NaHCO3), and moderately labile P-i(P-i-NaOH). Forest restoration was able to promote efficient recovery of important soil P fractions, highlighting the value of restoration efforts to mitigate soil degradation by mining.

TI  - Pollination and seed dispersal are the most threatened processes of plant regeneration
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Plant regeneration is essential for maintaining forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, which are globally threatened by human disturbance. Here we present the first integrative meta-analysis on how forest disturbance affects multiple ecological processes of plant regeneration including pollination, seed dispersal, seed predation, recruitment and herbivory. We analysed 408 pairwise comparisons of these processes between near-natural and disturbed forests. Human impacts overall reduced plant regeneration. Importantly, only processes early in the regeneration cycle that often depend on plant-animal interactions, i.e. pollination and seed dispersal, were negatively affected. Later processes, i.e. seed predation, recruitment and herbivory, showed overall no significant response to human disturbance. Conserving pollination and seed dispersal, including the animals that provide these services to plants, should become a priority in forest conservation efforts globally.

TI  - Tree regeneration characteristics in limestone forests of the Cat Ba National Park, Vietnam
T2  - BMC ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Background The ability of overstory tree species to regenerate successfully is important for the preservation of tree species diversity and its associated flora and fauna. This study investigated forest regeneration dynamics in the Cat Ba National Park, a biodiversity hotspot in Vietnam. Data was collected from 90 sample plots (500 m(2)) and 450 sub-sample plots (25 m(2)) in regional limestone forests. We evaluated the regeneration status of tree species by developing five ratios relating overstory and regeneration richness and diversity. By examining the effect of environmental factors on these ratios, we aimed to identify the main drivers for maintaining tree species diversity or for potential diversity gaps between the regeneration and the overstory layer. Our results can help to increase the understanding of regeneration patterns in tropical forests of Southeast Asia and to develop successful conservation strategies. Results We found 97 tree species in the regeneration layer compared to 136 species in the overstory layer. The average regeneration density was 3764 +/- 1601 per ha. Around 70% of the overstory tree species generated offspring. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List, only 36% of threatened tree species were found in the regeneration layer. A principal component analysis provided evidence that the regeneration of tree species was slightly negatively correlated to terrain factors (percentage of rock surface, slope) and soil properties (cation exchange capacity, pH, humus content, soil moisture, soil depth). Contrary to our expectations, traces of human impact and the prevailing light conditions (total site factor, gap fraction, openness, indirect site factor, direct site factor) had no influence on regeneration density and composition, probably due to the small gradient in light availability. Conclusion We conclude that the tree species richness in Cat Ba National Park appears to be declining at present. We suggest similar investigations in other biodiversity hotspots to learn whether the observed trend is a global phenomenon. In any case, a conservation strategy for the threatened tree species in the Cat Ba National Park needs to be developed if tree species diversity is to be maintained.

TI  - A Novel Method of Boreal Zone Reforestation/Afforestation Estimation Using PALSAR-1,2 and Landsat-5,8 Data
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Nowadays, global remote sensing studies of tropical forest parameters are relevant for assessing carbon sequestration, whereas boreal forests receive little attention. This is due to the current idea that forests with greater aboveground biomass absorb more carbon. However, new research indicates that rapidly growing young forests take up more carbon than mature ones. Therefore, it is necessary to develop universal methods of remote reforestation/afforestation monitoring. The existing reforestation methods rely on the separate analysis of multispectral optical images and radar data. Here, we propose a method for analyzing the joint dynamics of NDVI (or the Normalized Burn Ratio, NBR) and the radar vegetation index (RVI) on a 2D plot for a test reforestation site. NDVI and NBR time series were derived from Landsat-5,8 data, and the RVI was derived from ALOS-1,2 and PALSAR-1,2 for 2007-2020 using the resources of Google Earth Engine. The quantitative parameters to evaluate the degree of reforestation and changes in the species composition of young trees have been suggested. The suggested method enables a more thorough evaluation of reforestation by measuring the coupled dynamics of the projective cover of young trees and aboveground biomass.

TI  - The Effect of Forest Management on the Avifauna of a Brazilian Dry Forest
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - The conversion of tropical habitats has dramatic implications on biodiversity and represents one of the greatest conservation challenges of our time. Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests (SDTF), which are disjointly distributed throughout the Neotropics, are especially susceptible to human activities. The Caatinga Dry Forest, located in the semi-arid interior of northeastern Brazil, represents not only the largest and most biologically diverse nucleus of SDTF, but also the world's most densely populated semi-arid region, with ever-growing pressure on its natural resources. To prevent illegal logging, conservation agencies looked at forest management, where an area is divided in smaller stands which are gradually logged and allowed to regrow for a period of time, when a new cutting cycle should reinitiate. The impacts of these management schemes on biodiversity, however, remain largely untested. We conducted standardized avian surveys to evaluate the effects of forest management on the avian community at a 1,670 ha privately owned property located on the Chapada do Araripe, northeastern Brazil. This area was divided in 22 forest stands, half of which had already been logged at the time of our sampling, creating a gradient of logged and natural forests and an 11-yr chrono-sequence of forest regeneration. Our results show that logged areas present fewer individuals, fewer species, and different avian assemblages than unlogged forests. Such differences are mostly driven by forest-dependent species, which were overwhelmingly affected by forest management. Our results show that although logged forests tend to recover its height after a decade, they do not recover the originally forest cover, measured by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Likewise, decade-long recovering stands continue to show lower species richness, lower bird abundance, and different avian composition than unlogged forests. We identified a set of bird species that are more affected by forest management (ecological losers) and a group of birds that apparently benefit from the referred changes in land use (ecological winners). We conclude that completely managing an entire area may cause the extirpation of several forest-dependent species. We therefore suggest keeping logged and unlogged plots intermingled, to avoid local extinctions and the complete modification of the original avifauna.

TI  - Generating carbon finance through avoided deforestation and its potential to create climatic, conservation and human development benefits
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Recent proposals to compensate developing countries for reducing emissions from deforestation ( RED) under forthcoming climate change mitigation regimes are receiving increasing attention. Here we demonstrate that if RED credits were traded on international carbon markets, even moderate decreases in deforestation rates could generate billions of Euros annually for tropical forest conservation. We also discuss the main challenges for a RED mechanism that delivers real climatic benefits. These include providing sufficient incentives while only rewarding deforestation reductions beyond business-as-usual scenarios, addressing risks arising from forest degradation and international leakage, and ensuring permanence of emission reductions. Governance may become a formidable challenge for RED because some countries with the highest RED potentials score poorly on governance indices. In addition to climate mitigation, RED funds could help achieve substantial co-benefits for biodiversity conservation and human development. However, this will probably require targeted additional support because the highest biodiversity threats and human development needs may exist in countries that have limited income potentials from RED. In conclusion, how successfully a market-based RED mechanism can contribute to climate change mitigation, conservation and development will strongly depend on accompanying measures and carefully designed incentive structures involving governments, business, as well as the conservation and development communities.

The amount and type of coverage, along with the specific land use and land use change in a given area, determines whether carbon is stored or released into the atmosphere. The aim of this study was to evaluate the traditional silvopastoral systems (TSPS) through quantitative analysis of biomass and soil carbon storage whilst simultaneously qualitatively determining the ecological structure in terms of tree richness and diversity. The study was carried out in Matiguas, a sub-humid tropical region of Nicaragua, on five land use types: shrubland; intervened secondary forest; pasture with high tree density; pasture with low tree density and degraded pasture. Biomass carbon was estimated by allometric equations and soil organic carbon was evaluated at four depths (0-10, 10-20, 20-40 and 40-100cm). Of the land uses studied, shrubland had the highest diversity. The biomass carbon ranged from 1.9 to 13.2tCha(-1) for degraded pasture and intervened secondary forest, respectively. The highest soil organic carbon (SOC) storage at 1m depth was for intervened secondary forest (163tCha(-1)), whereas degraded pastures had the lowest value (76tCha(-1)). Since SOC was the largest pool of total carbon in all cases, it should be evaluated down to a depth of at least 1m. Increasing tree coverage in degraded and low-tree density pastures can contribute not only to enhance carbon sequestration but also to restore degraded lands in livestock landscapes.

TI  - Pastures as natural climate solutions: A socioecological study of tree carbon and beef production trade-offs
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Sustainable management strategies that facilitate the incorporation of trees into cattle pastures are widely recognized as emerging natural climate solutions. However, their potential to dually improve ecological functioning and human livelihoods has yet to be evaluated across regions on local scales, utilizing both ecological and sociological data. Further, the relationship between landowner participation in conservation management programs (CMPS) and their management priorities (i.e. production vs sustainability) also remains unclear. Therefore, the aims of this study were to evaluate the accuracy of past global-scale remote estimations of aboveground biomass and derived tree carbon density (MgC ha- 1) within pasturelands at the local scale in both temperate and tropical regions. We also sought to analyze how participation in CMPs related to the perceptions of stakeholders toward the ecological health of their system. We compared findings between farms in temperate (n = 26) and tropical (n = 16) ecosystems. We found that discrepancies exist between previous remote studies and current field estimations of tree carbon in the farms, and these differences were not regionally uniform. In contrast, stakeholders enrolled in CMPs had a higher value of trees in both regions. CMPs participants also had lower annual stocking rates than those that practiced conventional management but no differences in woody species diversity (H') or tree carbon (MgC ha- 1). We demonstrate the urgent need for local-scale studies to accurately estimate tree carbon in mosaic pasture systems and the importance of conservation management in shifting the priorities of landowners, which could eventually lead to more sustainable systems.

TI  - Carbon Depletion by Plowing and its Restoration by No-Till Cropping Systems in Oxisols of Subtropical and Tropical Agro-Ecoregions in Brazil
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The continuous use of plowing for grain production has been the principal cause of soil degradation. This project was formulated on the hypothesis that the intensification of cropping systems by increasing biomass-C input and its biodiversity under no-till (NT) drives soil restoration of degraded agro-ecosystem. The present study conducted at subtropical [Ponta Grossa (PG) site] and tropical regions [Lucas do Rio Verde, MT (LRV) site] in Brazil aimed to (i) assess the impact of the continuous plow-based conventional tillage (CT) on soil organic carbon (SOC) stock vis-a-vis native vegetation (NV) as baseline; (ii) compare SOC balance among CT, NT cropping systems, and NV; and (iii) evaluate the redistribution of SOC stock in soil profile in relation to soil resilience. The continuous CT decreased the SOC stock by 058 and 067MgCha(-1)y(-1) in the 0- to 20-cm depth at the PG and LRV sites, respectively, and the rate of SOC sequestration was 059 for the PG site and ranged from 048 to 130MgCha(-1)y(-1) for the LRV site. The fraction of C input by crop residues converted into SOC stock was 142% at the PG site and 205% at the LRV site. The SOC resilience index ranged from 029 to 079, and it increased with the increase in the C input among the NT systems and the SOC sequestration rates at the LRV site. These data support the hypothesis that NT cropping systems with high C input have a large potential to reverse the process of soil degradation and SOC decline.

TI  - Climatic Benefits From the 2006-2017 Avoided Deforestation in Amazonian Brazil
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Over three-fourths of Brazil's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions originate from land-use/cover change (LUCC). Alarming rates of forest loss in the Amazon region gained international attention in the past, but deforestation declined substantially since 2004 (although the rate has trended upwards since 2012). This result conforms to the GHG emission reduction targets set by the National Climate Change Plan, originally divided into three phases: 2006-2009; 2010-2013; and 2014-2017. According to the plan, emission reductions are measured against a deforestation baseline, initially corresponding to the average forest loss observed from 1996 to 2005 (reference period). We used an artificial neural network (ANN) model to spatialize the plan's original three-phase baseline and compare (i) the simulated carbon emissions from the baseline scenario to (ii) the emissions from observed deforestation during 2006-2017. Baseline spatialization was performed at the state level and informed by the 2000-2004 deforestation patterns in each state, resulting in nine state-specific calibrated ANNs. Simulated (baseline) and observed deforestation were compared to five biomass-density maps in order to estimate Brazil's GHG emission reductions. Our results indicate that forest loss during the study period was 62,321 km(2) lower than the baseline and associated with 1.5 +/- 0.4 Pg of avoided CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Virtually all emission reductions (93%) occurred in the states of Mato Grosso (74%) and Rondonia (19%). In contrast, Roraima, Amazonas, and Amapa states increased GHG emissions by 44.8, 36.7, and 14.7 Tg CO2, respectively. Lastly, we discuss the issue of attribution of deforestation reductions for results-based payments (REDD+) and the emission reduction certificates issued by the Amazon Fund.

TI  - The Importance of Ficus (Moraceae) Trees for Tropical Forest Restoration
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Forest restoration is an increasingly important tool to offset and indeed reverse global deforestation rates. One low cost strategy to accelerate forest recovery is conserving scattered native trees that persist across disturbed landscapes and which may act as seedling recruitment foci. Ficus trees, which are considered to be critically important components of tropical ecosystems, may be particularly attractive to seed dispersers in that they produce large and nutritionally rewarding fruit crops. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of remnant Ficus trees in inducing forest recovery compared to other common trees. We studied the sapling communities growing under 207 scattered trees, and collected data on seed rain for 55 trees in a modified landscape in Assam, India. We found that Ficus trees have more sapling species around them (species richness=140.19.9) than non-Ficus trees (79.5 +/- 12.9), and significantly more saplings of shrub and large tree species. Sapling densities were twice as high under Ficus trees (median=0.06/m(2)) compared to non-Ficus (0.03/m(2)), and seed rain densities of non-parent trees were significantly higher under Ficus trees (mean=12.73 +/- 3/m(2)/wk) than other fruit or non-zoochorous trees (2.19 +/- 0.97/m(2)/wk). However, our regression model found that canopy area, used as a proxy for tree size, was the primary predictor of sapling density, followed by remnant tree type. These results suggest that large trees, and in particular large Ficus trees, may be more effective forest restoration agents than other remnant trees in disturbed landscapes, and therefore the conservation of these trees should be prioritized.

TI  - Soil nutrients determine leaf traits and above-ground biomass in the tropical cloud forest of Hainan Island
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Identifying soil characteristics associated with the plant's resource use and acquisition strategy at different scales could be a crucial step to understanding community assembly and plant strategy. There is an increasing trend that plant functional properties can be an important driver of ecosystem functioning. However, major knowledge gaps exist about how soil abiotic properties, shape species diversity, above-ground biomass (AGB) and plant functional diversity in the Bawangling tropical forest (TCF) of Hainan island. Hence we hypothesized that plant functional traits and above-ground biomass would be strongly associated with soil abiotic factors given their direct relationship to soil resource acquisition and use. Here, we used 12 plant functional traits (FTs), above-ground biomass (AGB), and five soil nutrients in the Bawangling tropical cloud forest of Hainan Island by using a polynomial regression model and multivariate correlations to show relationship and identify how plants allocate their limited resources to adapt to their surroundings. Various phytosociological attributes were assessed and an Importance Value Index (IVI) value was calculated for each species to determine the dominant species. More than half of the total variations could be attributed to interspecific variations in H, DBH, LA, LMA, and LDW. From a taxonomic perspective; we found that species-level variance was more significant for plant functional traits and soil nutrients like TN, AP, TP, and OM. On the other hand, variation in specific stem density (SSD), leaf thickness (LT), leaf phosphorus (LP) and leaf soluble sugar (LS) was an exception for these tendencies. Among soil nutrients, soil nitrogen and phosphorus significantly impact the species and functional traits. Furthermore, the soil AN and TP we also found to have a comparatively strong positive relationship with above-ground biomass (AGB) as compared with other soil nutrients. The morpho-physiological functional traits showed a trade-off between conservative and acquisitive resource usage. These variations suggested that the relationships of functional traits, AGB, and species with soil nutrients mainly AN and TP in tropical cloud forests can directly affect the growth, reproduction, and survival of the species and are beneficial for the species co-existence and maintenance of biodiversity.

TI  - Guandu bean (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.) on tropical forest restoration
T2  - SEMINA-CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
AB  - This work aims to evaluate alternative models in forest restorations by means of agroforestry systems, where a leguminous species is incorporated to the system. The hypothesis is that guandu bean Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp., in combination and intercropped with native species, can promote restoration by decreasing mortality and increasing tree basal area and height. Cajanus cajan was planted in line with the forest seedlings in 2 x 4 m spacing. Four different treatments were analyzed; 1) control, with no Cajanus cajan 2) one seedling of Cajanus cajan between the forest seedlings in the plantation line; 3) two seedlings of Cajanus cajan between the forest seedlings in the plantation line; and 4) full harvest Cajanus cajan six months after plot implementation. In each treatment, 100 native trees (Fifty pioneer, and fifty non pioneer trees) were measured and evaluated in mortality rates, height, and basal diameter. Guandu planting reduced pioneer mortality, increased basal area, and tree height of all species. In spite of the mortality was not affected by guandu density, the density of one plant of guandu was associated with larger basal area and tree average height. The mortality reduction of non pioneers on the absence of guandu trees was interpreted as a response of antropic pioneers to the increased solar radiation. This result points to the differences in tree behavior between fertile gaps (on which the classification on sucessional stages was based) and degraded areas. The positive effects of guandu planting recommend its use for the ecological restoration cost reduction.

TI  - The value of primary, secondary, and plantation forests for a neotropical herpetofauna
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - Plantation forests and second growth forests are becoming dominant components of many tropical forest landscapes. Yet there is little information available concerning the consequences of different forestry options for biodiversity conservation in the tropics. We sampled the leaf-litter herpetofauna of primary, secondary, and Eucalyptus plantation forests in the Jari River area of northeastern Brazilian Amazonia. We used four complementary sampling techniques, combined samples from 2 consecutive years, and collected 1739 leaf-litter amphibians (23 species) and 1937 lizards (30 species). We analyzed the data for differences among forest types regarding patterns of alpha and beta diversity, species-abundance distributions, and community structure. Primary rainforest harbored significantly more species, but supported a similar abundance of amphibians and lizards compared with adjacent areas of second growth forest or plantations. Plantation forests were dominated by wide-ranging habitat generalists. Secondary forest faunas contained a number of species characteristic of primary forest habitat. Amphibian communities in secondary forests and Eucalyptus plantations formed a nested subset of primary forest species, whereas the species composition of the lizard community in plantations was distinct, and was dominated by open-area species. Although plantation forests are relatively impoverished, naturally regenerating forests can help mitigate some negative effects of deforestation for herpetofauna. Nevertheless, secondary forest does not provide a substitute for primary forest, and in the absence of further evidence from older successional stands, we caution against the optimistic claim that natural forest regeneration in abandoned lands will provide refuge for the many species that are currently threatened by deforestation.

TI  - Climate change mitigation policy in Ecuador: Effects of land-use competition and transaction costs
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - This paper develops an econometric model to estimate the economic determinants of forest land conversion in Esmeraldas, Ecuador and evaluates the effect that transaction costs have on incentive-based climate change mitigation activities. Using a logistic share model, the results show a high extent of competition for the use of land between agricultural production for palm oil processing and land-based carbon mitigation through avoided emissions from deforestation. Our results show that the current policy of introducing conservation payments in Ecuador is not sufficient to significantly reduce deforestation, but that payment levels based on a plausible international carbon price would make an appreciable difference in the net sequestration contribution of forests in northern Ecuador. Knowledge generated from this research can inform site-specific land use policy design aimed at addressing the opportunity costs of tropical forest conservation as an important component of climate mitigation strategies.

TI  - Empowering indigenous wisdom: co-creating forest inventory through citizen science in Royal Belum State Park, Malaysia
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Democratising science and bridging scientific data gaps with the reduction of emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD+) framework to strengthen the conservation capacity of forest communities requires empowering the indigenous people with the necessary technical competencies. Considering the value of indigenous knowledge, involving local communities in scientific data collection might benefit science and society. Nevertheless, the output quality has raised scepticism. This study aims to empower indigenous wisdom in citizen science by co-creating forest tree inventories in the Royal Belum State Park in Perak, Malaysia. The objectives are to identify the potential of involving indigenous communities in remote locations in scientific tree data collection, a locally-based tree census for carbon assessment, and to demonstrate the feasibility of location-based mobile smartphones in forest tree inventories. An established tropical forest protocol was adopted to estimate the above-ground biomass (AGB). A pantropic allometric model was employed, with tree diameter at breast height (DBH) and height. Unsupervised tree naming and tree positioning data collection was also performed with a smartphone. The information provided by the indigenous communities and professionals was compared. Trees that were taller and recorded bigger DBH demonstrated the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.965 cm and 4.616 m, respectively. Although the DBH measurements were of sufficient quality, the tree heights and names were subpar due to the different strategies employed. The mean absolute error (MAE) of the absolute positions recorded with the smartphone in relation to traverse surveying was 4.907 m (northing) and 5.817 m (easting). The percentage of trees that fall within the 20-m and 30-m quadrants is 67% and 79%, respectively. The results revealed that location-based smartphones might not be the best equipment for precise tagging individual tree positions. The equipment required established quadrants to confirm the tree locations. Nevertheless, the findings could contribute to Malaysian indigenous forest communities' ability to meet the REDD+ forest conservation targets, which is of international interest. The data procured in this study could also address the challenges of implementing locally-based carbon stock assessments in remote forests.

TI  - Biochar addition drives soil aggregation and carbon sequestration in aggregate fractions from an intensive agricultural system
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
AB  - Biochar application is deemed to modify soil properties, but current research has been mostly conducted on the degraded land in tropical regions. Using six consecutive years of biochar field trial, we investigated effects of biochar on soil aggregates, structural stability, and soil organic carbon (SOC) and black C (BC) concentrations in aggregate fractions. The findings have important implications in managing soil structure and SOC sequestration in high fertility soils of the temperate areas.
   The study had four treatments: control; biochar rate at 4.5 (B4.5) and biochar rate at 9.0 t ha(-1) year(-1) (B9.0); and straw return (SR). Soil samples were collected from 0-10-cm layer, and aggregate size distribution was determined with the wet-sieving method. Then, the mean weight diameter (MWD) of aggregates and the aggregate ratio (AR), i.e., the ratio of the > 250 mu m to the 53-250 mu m size were calculated to assess the structural stability. Total SOC and BC concentrations in bulk soil (< 2 mm) and separated fractions (i.e., > 2000, 250-2000, 53-250, and < 53 mu m) were measured.
   The B4.5 and B9.0 significantly increased macroaggregate (250-2000 mu m) and MWD and AR indices relative to the control. Comparing to the SR, the improvements in soil aggregation under biochar treatments were limited. Additionally, more SOC in larger fractions (> 2000, 250-2000, and 53-250 mu m) and BC in extracted fractions under biochar soils were observed. These results implied that biochar addition enhanced both native SOC and BC physical protection by aggregation.
   Biochar application is effective in mediating soil aggregation, and thus improves both native SOC and BC stabilization in an intensive cropping system of North China.

TI  - A botanical inventory of a tropical seasonal forest in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand: implications for fruit-frugivore interactions
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - The diversity of plants in tropical forests makes dietary studies of frugivores difficult. This paper provides a botanical inventory of a tropical seasonal forest community in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand. The forest is valuable from a conservation perspective because it is one of the last remaining intact forests in northeastern Thailand, and is an important refuge for many animal and plant species. A 4-ha inventory plot measuring 200 x 200 m was established and all plants greater than or equal to 10 cm in diameter at breast height (dbh) were measured and permanently labeled. We found 1610 stems belonging to 105 species, 76 genera and 35 families, with a combined basal area of 142.5 m(2). The community was dominated by species of Lauraceae, Cornaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Meliaceae, and Elaeocarpaceae. About one-third of the plant species ( 40 spp.) identified in this study were vulnerable to extinction because they were mostly dispersed by large frugivores, which were intolerant of human impact. If they disappear, these forests may become dominated by plant species that are dispersed by abiotic means and species with small-seeded fruits.

TI  - Tropical tree species composition affects the oxidation of dissolved organic matter from litter
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Plant species effects on soil nutrient availability are relatively well documented, but the effects of species differences in litter chemistry on soil carbon cycling are less well understood, especially in the species-rich tropics. In many wet tropical forest ecosystems, leaching of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the litter layer accounts for a significant proportion of litter mass loss during decomposition. Here we investigated how tree species differences in soluble dissolved organic C (DOC) and nutrients affected soil CO2 fluxes in laboratory incubations. We leached DOM from freshly fallen litter of six canopy tree species collected from a tropical rain forest in Costa Rica and measured C-mineralization. We found significant differences in litter solubility and nutrient availability. Following DOM additions to soil, rates of heterotrophic respiration varied by as much as an order of magnitude between species, and overall differences in total soil CO2 efflux varied by more than four-fold. Variation in the carbon: phosphorus ratio accounted for 51% of the variation in total CO2 flux between species. These results suggest that tropical tree species composition may influence soil C storage and mineralization via inter-specific variation in plant litter chemistry.

TI  - Use Forests or Lose Them? Regulated Timber Extraction and Tree Cover Loss in Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMISTS
AB  - A growing set of researchers and policy makers argue, somewhat counterintuitively, that regulated timber extraction can help conserve forests in developing countries by discouraging illegal logging and land-use change. However, rigorous tests of that hypothesis are rare. We use matched difference-in-differences models to measure the net effect on tree cover loss of awarding timber extraction permits to Mexican communal land-holding organizations. Our findings suggest that permits do not have large systematic effects on tree cover loss. We are able to discern statistically significant effects only in select subgroups of forest management units, not in our national sample. Moreover, subgroup effects are relatively modest and vary in sign. Subgroups in which permits have discernible effects are defined by, among other things, levels of privation and the opportunity costs of retaining forest cover-results that suggest forest governance and the demand for cleared land moderate permits' effects.

TI  - A Matrix-Calibrated Species-Area Model for Predicting Biodiversity Losses Due to Land-Use Change
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - Application of island biogeography theory to prediction of species extinctions resulting from habitat loss is based on the assumption that the transformed landscape matrix is completely inhospitable to the taxa considered, despite evidence demonstrating the nontrivial influence of matrix on populations within habitat remnants. The island biogeography paradigm therefore needs refining to account for specific responses of taxa to the area of habitat "islands" and to the quality of the surrounding matrix. We incorporated matrix effects into island theory by partitioning the slope (z value) of species-area relationships into two components: gamma, a constant, and sigma, a measure of taxon-specific responses to each component of a heterogeneous matrix. We used our matrix-calibrated model to predict extinction and endangerment of bird species resulting from land-use change in 20 biodiversity hotspots and compared these predictions with observed numbers of extinct and threatened bird species. We repeated this analysis with the conventional species-area model and the countryside species-area model, considering alternative z values of 0.35 (island) or 0.22 (continental). We evaluated the relative strength of support for each of the five candidate models with Akaike's information criterion (AIC). The matrix-calibrated model had the highest AIC weight (w(1) = 89.21%), which means the weight of evidence in support of this model was the optimal model given the set of candidate models and the data. In addition to being a valuable heuristic tool for assessing extinction risk, our matrix-calibrated model also allows quantitative assessment of biodiversity benefits (and trade-offs) of land-management options in human-dominated landscapes. Given that processes of secondary regeneration have become more widespread across tropical regions and are predicted to increase, our matrix-calibrated model will be increasingly appropriate for practical conservation in tropical landscapes.

TI  - Assessing Carbon Pools of Three Indigenous Agroforestry Systems in the Southeastern Rift-Valley Landscapes, Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The role of agroforestry (AF) systems in providing ecosystem services is very crucial. The greatest considerable increase in carbon (C) storage is often attained by moving from lower biomass land-use systems to tree-based systems such as AF. However, for estimation of C stocks in indigenous AF systems of southeastern Rift-Valley landscapes, Ethiopia, the data are scarce. This study was aimed to investigate the biomass, biomass carbon (BC), and soil organic carbon (SOC) stock of Enset-based, Enset-Coffee-based, and Coffee-Fruit-tree-Enset based AF systems. Comparison of SOC stock of AF systems against their adjacent monocrop farms was also investigated. Research questions were initiated to answer whether C stocks among the three AF systems vary because of different management systems and how biomass C stock is influenced by species abundance, diversity, and richness in the AF systems. The study was carried out at three selected sites in the Dilla Zuria district of Gedeo zone. Twenty farms (total of 60) representative of each AF system were arbitrarily selected and inventoried, and the biomass C stocks estimated. Ten adjacent monocrop farms which were related to each AF system were selected in a purposive manner for comparison of SOC stock. Inventory and soil sampling were employed in the 10 x 10 m farm plot. The mean AGB ranged from 81.1 to 255.9 t ha(-1) and for BGB from 26.9 to 72.2 t ha(-1). The highest C stock was found in Coffee-Fruittree-Enset based (233.3 +/- 81.0 t ha(-1)), and the lowest was in Coffee-Enset based AF system (190.1 +/- 29.8 t ha(-1)). The result showed that SOC stocks were not statistically significant between the three AF systems, although they showed a significant difference in their BC stock. The C stocks of the investigated AF systems are considerably higher than those reported for some tropical forests and AF systems. The SOC of AF systems is significantly higher than the ones for the adjacent monocrop farms. Therefore, it can be understood that the studied AF systems are storing significant amounts of C in their biomass as well as in soil. This considerable C storage by these systems might contribute to climate change mitigation.

TI  - Dung removal by dung beetles in tropical livestock-dominated landscapes: Role of livestock grazing abandonment, local environment, and community attributes
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Cattle farming is a prominent economic activity in tropical ecosystems. However, this system can lead to biodiversity loss and decreased ecosystem functions. Due to land degradation or changes in farming practices, areas with different times after cattle grazing removal are new and common habitats in tropical landscapes. Therefore, understanding the impact of livestock grazing abandonment on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function is crucial for tropical pastureland livestock production. We assessed the influence of livestock grazing abandonment (cattle removal time), local environmental conditions (herbaceous vegetation density, sand content, and soil compaction), and dung beetle community attributes (biomass and functional dispersion) on dung removal rates in pasturelands. We conducted this study at 24 natural grassland sites in the Brazilian Pantanal, a tropical landscape dominated by livestock. Our findings reveal that community attributes primarily explain the variation in dung removal rates, while the effects of local environment and cattle removal time were insignificant. The relationships between dung beetle functional diversity and ecosystem functioning may show substantial context-dependent variation. Biomass was particularly important in explaining shifts in dung removal. These results underscore the direct link between the decline of biomass of larger-bodied dung beetles and the loss of ecosystem services associated with dung removal, such as parasitic control and soil fertilization. Therefore, conserving dung beetle biomass of larger-bodied dung beetles through effective management plans is vital to sustain ecological functions in tropical livestock-dominated landscapes.

TI  - Use of agroecosystem matrix habitats by mammalian carnivores (Carnivora): a global-scale analysis
T2  - MAMMAL REVIEW
AB  - Less than a quarter of Earth's terrestrial ecosystems remain intact. Protected areas (PAs) are far exceeded in area by natural habitats that have been transformed for agriculture, and PAs are too small to safeguard viable wildlife populations. It is therefore imperative to understand the use of agricultural matrix habitats by native wildlife. In this study we seek to understand how the world's mammalian carnivore species (order Carnivora) use agricultural land. We assessed relationships between agroecosystem type, carnivore species traits and conservation status, and carnivore occurrence at agricultural sites, investigated the prevalent human-carnivore conflicts in anthropogenic landscapes, and identified knowledge gaps. We reviewed 129 studies reporting agroecosystem use by native carnivores to understand which agroecosystem types are used by different species, and which factors may affect their occurrence in these habitats. We uncovered records of 97 wild and two domesticated carnivore species within 41 types of crop in temperate and tropical regions that we classified into four agroecosystem types (agroforestry, tree plantations, perennial cropland, and annual cropland). Non-threatened carnivore species were more likely to use agricultural ecosystems than threatened species. Adult body mass, energetic trophic level, and locomotion mode were significant predictors of carnivore occupancy in agricultural lands. Our results depict a globally consistent pattern, in which the use of agroecosystem landscapes by mammalian carnivores is related to both species traits and habitat quality. We emphasise the rarity of threatened carnivore and apex predator species in agroecosystems, which strengthens the paramount importance of retaining native habitat within agricultural landscapes. Understanding the role of agricultural habitat matrices, the influence of management intensification, and the threshold areas of native habitats within anthropogenic landscapes are essential for prescribing ways to prevent further erosion of the world's carnivores in human-modified landscapes.

TI  - Carbon sequestration potential in natural forests of Himachal Pradesh, India
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
AB  - Natural forests play a key role in the mitigation of atmospheric carbon dioxide by sequestering it in their biological system as well as in the soil. In the present study we have assessed the carbon sequestration potential of different natural forests of Bilaspur district, Himachal Pradesh, India, which were subjected to different levels of anthropogenic activities. Above-and below-ground carbon stock present in standing vegetation was analysed at six different forest sites of subtropical forests utilizing the non-destructive method. The stem density in the present study ranged from 474.75 to 799.75 trees/ha. The result shows that carbon stock was highest at site II (131.95 t C/ha) and lowest at site I (70.34 t C/ha), although highest tree density was observed at site I and lowest at site V. The average carbon stock of the study area was recorded as 107.35 t C/ha. The results suggest that tree density and carbon stock in these subtropical forests differ significantly and with proper management strategies and afforestation of the degraded areas, the potential of carbon storage can be enhanced further.

TI  - Natural forest regeneration over a fallow age chronosequence in central African moist forests
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - A better understanding of the natural regeneration in tropical forests could help develop more effective restoration strategies. This study examined relationships in structural and diversity attributes of natural regeneration in five forest fallow ages after slash-and-burn agriculture (6 months, 2 years, 5 years, 10 years, and 15 years) in the Republic of Congo. For each fallow age, all stems with a diameter >= 1 cm and below 5 cm (height >= 130 cm), corresponding to natural forest regeneration, were identified to the species level, and measured (diameter and height) in 12 plots (10 m x 10 m). Three structural attributes (stem density, maximum diameter, and maximum height) and five diversity indices (species richness, Shannon diversity, Simpson diversity, Fisher's alpha and Pielou's evenness) were estimated at the plot level. Our results revealed an increase in structural and diversity attributes with fallow ages, except stem density. The young fallow (6 months, 2 years and 5 years) had greater stem density (61 +/- 48 stems), while the old fallow (10 years and 15 years) had higher maximum height (5.39 +/- 2.36 m) and Shannon's index (0.94 +/- 0.18). These results provided new insights into natural regeneration between young and old secondary forests.
   Une meilleure comprehension de la regeneration naturelle dans les forets tropicales pourrait aider a developper des strategies de restauration plus efficaces. Cette etude a examine les relations entre les attributs structurels et de diversite de la regeneration naturelle dans cinq ages de jachere forestiere apres l'agriculture sur brulis (6 mois, 2 ans, 5 ans, 10 ans et 15 ans) en Republique du Congo. Pour chaque age de jachere, toutes les tiges d'un diametre >= 1 cm et inferieur a 5 cm (hauteur >= 130 cm), correspondant a la regeneration naturelle de la foret, ont ete identifiees au niveau de l'espece et mesurees (diametre et hauteur) dans 12 parcelles (10 m x 10 m). Trois attributs structurels (densite des tiges, diametre maximal et hauteur maximale) et cinq indices de diversite (richesse des especes, diversite de Shannon, diversite de Simpson, alpha de Fisher et regularite de Pielou) ont ete estimes au niveau de la parcelle. Nos resultats ont revele une augmentation des attributs structurels et de la diversite avec l'age de la jachere, a l'exception de la densite des tiges. Les jeunes jacheres (6 mois, 2 ans et 5 ans) avaient une plus grande densite de tiges (61 +/- 48 tiges), tandis que les vieilles jacheres (10 ans et 15 ans) avaient une hauteur maximale plus elevee (5,39 +/- 2,36 m) et un indice de Shannon plus eleve (0,94 +/- 0,18). Ces resultats ont permis de mieux comprendre la regeneration naturelle entre les jeunes et les vieilles forets secondaires.

TI  - Limits to forests-based mitigation in integrated assessment modelling: global potentials and impacts under constraining factors
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Forests-based measures such as afforestation/reforestation (A/R) and reducing deforestation (RDF) are considered promising options to mitigate climate change, yet their mitigation potentials are limited by economic and biophysical factors that are largely uncertain. The range of mitigation potential estimates from integrated assessment models raises concerns about the capacity of land systems to provide realistic, cost-effective and permanent land-based mitigation. We use the Global Change Analysis Model to quantify the economic mitigation potential of forests-based measures by simulating a climate policy including a tax on greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, forestry, and other land uses. In addition, we assess how constraining unused arable land (UAL) availability, forestland expansion rates, and global bioenergy demand may influence the forests-based mitigation potential by simulating scenarios with alternative combinations of constraints. Results show that the average forests-based mitigation potential in 2020-2050 increases from 738 MtCO2.yr-1 through a forestland increase of 86 Mha in the fully constrained scenario to 1394 MtCO2.yr-1 through a forestland increase of 146 Mha when all constraints are relaxed. Regional potentials in terms of A/R and RDF differ strongly between scenarios: unconstrained forest expansion rates mostly increase A/R potentials in northern regions (e.g., +120 MtCO2.yr-1 in North America); while unconstrained UAL conversion and low bioenergy demand mostly increase RDF potentials in tropical regions (e.g., +76 and +68 MtCO2.yr-1 in Southeast Asia, respectively). This study shows that forests-based mitigation is limited by many factors that constrain the rates of land use change across regions. These factors, often overlooked in modelling exercises, should be carefully addressed for understanding the role of forests in global climate mitigation and defining pledges towards the Paris Agreement.

TI  - Effects of afforestation on soil nitrous oxide emissions in a subtropical montane agricultural landscape: A 3-year field experiment
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - Afforestation, through the conversion of upland cropland to forest, is of great significance to land use change in montane (hilly) agricultural landscapes worldwide. Such afforestation is Implemented to improve soil and water conservation and facilitate terrestrial carbon sequestration. However, particularly for subtropical and tropical regions, the effects of afforestation on soil N2O emissions have not been well investigated. Therefore, a three-year field experiment was conducted to simultaneously monitor N2O emissions from three paired sites of afforestation with cypress (Cypressus funebris) and adjacent cropland under a wheat-maize rotation system. The experiment was carried out in a subtropical montane agricultural landscape in southwest China. In both forest and cropland ecosystems, the N2O emissions exhibited a pronounced spatial and temporal variability. These variations in N2O emissions can be well explained by the spatiotemporal dynamics of environmental variables, such as soil temperature, WFPS, soil NH4+ or NO3- availability, because these environmental variables correlated significantly with the N 2 0 emissions across different experimental sites and years. The average annual N2O fluxes were 2.69 kg N ha(-1) for cropland and 0.13 kg N ha(-1) for afforestation. It is noteworthy that the annual N2O fluxes for afforestation found in the present study constitute one of the lowest recorded N2O fluxes for unfertilized forest ecosystems globally. Overall, across all experimental sites and years, afforestation with cypress (Cypressus funebris) stands significantly decreased N2O fluxes by over twenty times relative to the adjacent cropland. This outcome suggests that afforestation could be an effective mitigation strategy for soil N2O emissions in a subtropical montane agricultural landscape.

TI  - Combining long-term land cover time series and field observations for spatially explicit predictions on changes in tropical forest biodiversity
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Combining spatially explicit land cover data from remote-sensing and faunal data from field observations is increasingly applied for landscape-scale habitat and biodiversity assessments, but without modelling changes quantitatively over time. In a novel approach, we used a long-term time series including historical map data to predict the influence of one century of tropical forest change on keystone species or indicator groups in the Kakamega-Nandi forests, western Kenya. Four time steps of land cover data between 1912/13 and 2003, derived from Landsat satellite imagery, aerial photography and old topographic maps, formed the basis for extrapolating species abundance data on the army ant Dorylus wilverthi, the guild of ant-following birds and three habitat guilds of birds differing in forest dependency. To predict the species' spatio-temporal distribution, we combined spatially explicit geographical information system (GIS)-based modelling with statistical modelling, that is, ordinary least square (OLS) regression models for D. wilverthi and simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models for ant-following birds. We directly related bird habitat guilds to five forest classes as distinguished in the land cover time series. Extrapolation results over time predict dramatic losses in abundance for D. wilverthi (56%), ant-following birds (58%) and forest bird individuals in general (47%) due to a forest loss of 31% and small-scale fragmentation within the past century. Extrapolations based on a scenario of further deforestation revealed the negative consequences of clearing and splitting up continuous forest into isolated patches, whereas a reforestation scenario suggests the positive impact of natural forest regrowth and indigenous-tree planting. This study demonstrates the high potential of integrating remotesensing and field-based faunal data for landscape-scale quantitative assessments over time. In addition, it shows the suitability of extrapolation studies for evaluating measures of forest conservation.

TI  - Assessment of community-based initiatives in sustainable management of Indian dry deciduous forests
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
AB  - The introduction of the Joint Forest Management (JFM) programme in India as a part of community forestry initiatives from the late 1980s was an internationally recognised successful effort in forest restoration. Its achievements were most pronounced in the Sal (Shorea robusta)-dominated tropical dry deciduous forests of eastern and south-eastern states of India. However, these forests, and consequently the marginal people dependent on them for their livelihood, have increasingly faced multidimensional challenges in the past 15 years in the context of sustainable forest management. An overall assessment of the management scenario for these community forests and formulation of some guidelines towards better management was carried out on the basis of intensive case studies in the Nayagrain Forest Range of West Bengal, India. Socio-economic as well as ecological aspects of sustainable forestry were analysed on the basis of criteria and indicators of community-oriented forestry. Functioning of a forest protection community as a cohesive group was found to be the major determinant in achieving sustainability in forest management. Maintenance of such institutional sustainability is recommended for better conservation of these highly stressed forest lands.

TI  - High and Far: Biases in the Location of Protected Areas
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background: About an eighth of the earth's land surface is in protected areas (hereafter "PAs''), most created during the 20(th) century. Natural landscapes are critical for species persistence and PAs can play a major role in conservation and in climate policy. Such contributions may be harder than expected to implement if new PAs are constrained to the same kinds of locations that PAs currently occupy.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Quantitatively extending the perception that PAs occupy "rock and ice'', we show that across 147 nations PA networks are biased towards places that are unlikely to face land conversion pressures even in the absence of protection. We test each country's PA network for bias in elevation, slope, distances to roads and cities, and suitability for agriculture. Further, within each country's set of PAs, we also ask if the level of protection is biased in these ways. We find that the significant majority of national PA networks are biased to higher elevations, steeper slopes and greater distances to roads and cities. Also, within a country, PAs with higher protection status are more biased than are the PAs with lower protection statuses.
   Conclusions/Significance: In sum, PAs are biased towards where they can least prevent land conversion (even if they offer perfect protection). These globally comprehensive results extend findings from nation-level analyses. They imply that siting rules such as the Convention on Biological Diversity's 2010 Target [to protect 10% of all ecoregions] might raise PA impacts if applied at the country level. In light of the potential for global carbon-based payments for avoided deforestation or REDD, these results suggest that attention to threat could improve outcomes from the creation and management of PAs.

TI  - Stratification ratio of organic matter pools influenced by management systems in a weathered Oxisol from a tropical agro-ecoregion in Brazil
T2  - SOIL RESEARCH
AB  - Enhancement of organic matter plays an essential role in improving soil quality for supporting sustainable food production. Changes in carbon stocks with impacts on emissions of greenhouse gases may result from the stratification of organic matter as a result of soil use. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of soil management systems on soil carbon stocks and stratification ratios (SR) of soil organic matter pools. Total organic carbon (TOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), mineral-associated organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen, basal respiration, and particulate organic matter nitrogen (PON) were determined. The field experiment comprised several tillage treatments: conventional tillage, no-till with biannual rotation, no-till with biannual rotation combined with a second crop, no-till with annual rotation, and pasture. The labile fractions indicated a high level of variation among management systems. Pasture proved to be an excellent option for the improvement of soil carbon. While the conventional tillage system reduced total carbon stocks of the soil (0-40 cm), no-tillage presented TOC stocks similar to that of native vegetation. Sensitivity of the TOC SR varied from 0.93 to 1.28, a range of 0.35; the range for POC was 1.76 and for MBC 1.64. The results support the hypothesis that the labile fractions (POC, MBC, and PON) are highly sensitive to the dynamics of organic matter in highly weathered soils of tropical regions influenced by different management systems. Reductions to SRs of labile organic matter pools are related to the impacts of agricultural use of Cerrado soils.

TI  - Planting Seedlings in Tree Islands Versus Plantations as a Large-Scale Tropical Forest Restoration Strategy
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Planting tree seedlings in small patches (islands) has been proposed as a method to facilitate forest recovery that is less expensive than planting large areas and better simulates the nucleation process of recovery. We planted seedlings of four tree species at 12 formerly agricultural sites in southern Costa Rica in two designs: plantation (entire 50 x 50 m area planted) and island (six patches of three sizes). We monitored seedling survival, height, and canopy area over 3 years. To elucidate mechanisms influencing survival and growth, we measured soil and foliar nutrients, soil compaction, and photosynthesis. Survival of all species was similar in the two planting designs. Seedling height and canopy area were greater in plantations than islands at most sites, and more seedlings in islands decreased in height due to damage incurred during plot maintenance. Survival, height, and canopy area were both site- and species-specific with the two N-fixing species (Inga edulis and Erythrina poeppigiana) greater than the other species (Terminalia amazonia and Vochysia guatemalensis). Foliar N was higher in Terminalia and Vochysia in sites where Inga growth was greater. Soil nutrients, however, explained a small amount of the large differences in growth across sites. Leaf mass per area was higher in islands, and P use efficiency was higher in plantations. Our results show advantages (good seedling survival, cheaper) and disadvantages (more seedling damage, slightly lower growth) to the island planting design. Our study highlights the importance of replicating restoration strategies at several sites to make widespread management recommendations.

TI  - Toward Sustainable Cultivation of Pinus occidentalis Swartz in Haiti: Effects of Alternative Growing Media and Containers on Seedling Growth and Foliar Chemistry
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Haiti has suffered great losses from deforestation, with little forest cover remaining today. Current reforestation efforts focus on seedling quantity rather than quality. This study examined limitations to the production of high-quality seedlings of the endemic Hispaniolan pine (Pinus occidentalis Swartz). Recognizing the importance of applying sustainable development principles to pine forest restoration, the effects of growing media and container types on seedling growth were evaluated with the goal of developing a propagation protocol to produce high-quality seedlings using economically feasible nursery practices. With regard to growing media, seedlings grew best in compost-based media amended with sand. Topsoil, widely used in nurseries throughout Haiti, produced the smallest seedlings overall. Despite a low water holding capacity and limited manganese, compost-based media provided adequate levels of essential mineral nutrients (particularly nitrogen), which allowed for sufficient seedling nutrition. Seedling shoot and root growth, as well as the ratio of shoot biomass to root biomass, were greater in polybags relative to D40s. Results indicate that economically feasible improvements to existing nursery practices in Haiti can improve the early growth rates of P. occidentalis seedlings.

TI  - Assessing innovations for upscaling forest landscape restoration
T2  - ONE EARTH
AB  - There is an increasing urgency to implement large-scale ecosystem restoration to mitigate the biodiversity and climate crises. These efforts must be scaled up to counteract the widespread degradation of the world's forests, although restoration costs can often limit their application. Thus, there is a pressing need to identify cost-effective approaches that catalyze landscape-scale ecological recovery. Here, we highlight seven assisted restoration innovations with demonstrated local-scale results that, once upscaled, hold promise to rapidly regenerate forests. We comprehensively assessed how each approach facilitated forest, woodland, and/or mangrove recovery across 143 studies. Our results reveal techniques with a marked ability to catalyze vegetation recovery compared to "business-as-usual"approaches. However, the context-dependent costbenefit ratio and feasibility of applying particular approaches requires careful consideration. Our assessment emphasizes that we already have many of the tools necessary to drive the terrestrial restoration movement forward. It is time to implement and assess their efficacy at scale.

TI  - The essential role of biodiversity in the key axes of ecosystem function
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Biodiversity is essential for maintaining the terrestrial ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF). Recent studies have revealed that the variations in terrestrial ecosystem functions are captured by three key axes: the maximum productivity, water use efficiency, and carbon use efficiency of the ecosystem. However, the role of biodiversity in supporting these three key axes has not yet been explored. In this study, we combined the (i) data collected from more than 840 vegetation plots across a large climatic gradient in China using standard protocols, (ii) data on plant traits and phylogenetic information for more than 2,500 plant species, and (iii) soil nutrient data measured in each plot. These data were used to systematically assess the contribution of environmental factors, species richness, functional and phylogenetic diversity, and community-weighted mean (CWM) and ecosystem traits (i.e., traits intensity normalized per unit land area) to EMF via hierarchical partitioning and Bayesian structural equation modeling. Multiple biodiversity attributes accounted for 70% of the influence of all the variables on EMF, and ecosystems with high functional diversity had high resource use efficiency. Our study is the first to systematically explore the role of different biodiversity attributes, including species richness, phylogenetic and functional diversity, and CWM and ecosystem traits, in the key axes of ecosystem functions. Our findings underscore that biodiversity conservation is critical for sustaining EMF and ultimately ensuring human well-being.

TI  - Comparing the Performance of Tree Stakes and Seedlings to Restore Abandoned Tropical Pastures
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Tree seedlings are commonly planted to restore abandoned agricultural lands, whereas vegetative plantings have received little study. We evaluated the ability of 10 tree species to establish and survive over 3 years by planting 2-m-tall vegetative stakes at three sites in southern Costa Rica. We quantified above- and belowground stake and seedling biomass for two species (Erythrina poeppigiana and Gliricidia sepium) after 1 year and canopy cover and height of E. poeppigiana stakes and saplings at 3 years. We also compared economic, logistical, and ecological advantages of each methodology. Erythrina poeppigiana and E. berteroana had the highest number of live stakes by the study's conclusion (> 90%) and were among species with largest canopies. Most others ranged between 40 and 70% with highly site-specific survival and growth rates, whereas three species did poorly. Four species developed fruit by year 3, including Ficus pertusa and Acnistus arborescens, that are consumed by frugivores. Above- and belowground biomass was 7-50 times greater in stakes (65-125 g) than seedlings (2-15 g). Stake roots were considerably more extensive and reached lengths more than 6 m. Erythrina poeppigiana stakes had higher canopy cover than saplings after 3 years but not height. Seedlings are 2-10 times more expensive to establish, although transporting stakes is more cumbersome and the suite of species that establish vegetatively is limited. This underused technique should be included in the growing repertoire of tropical forest restoration tools. Given tradeoffs in propagation methods, a combination is likely to be most efficient and successful.

TI  - REDD plus , transformational change and the promise of performance-based payments: a qualitative comparative analysis
T2  - CLIMATE POLICY
AB  - Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) has emerged as a promising climate change mitigation mechanism in developing countries. This article examines the national political context in 13 REDD+ countries in order to identify the enabling conditions for achieving progress with the implementation of countries' REDD+ policies and measures. The analysis builds on a qualitative comparative analysis of various countries' progress with REDD+ conducted in 12 REDD+ countries in 2012, which highlighted the importance of factors such as already initiated policy change, and the presence of coalitions calling for broader policy change. A follow-up survey in 2014 was considered timely because the REDD+ policy arena, at the international and country levels, is highly dynamic and undergoes constant evolution, which affects progress with REDD+ policy-making and implementation. Furthermore, we will now examine whether the 'promise' of performance-based funds has played a role in enabling the establishment of REDD+. The results show a set of enabling conditions and characteristics of the policy process under which REDD+ policies can be established. The study finds that the existence of broader policy change, and availability of performance-based funding in combination with strong national ownership of the REDD+ policy process, may help guide other countries seeking to formulate REDD+ policies that are likely to deliver efficient, effective and equitable outcomes.
   Policy relevance Tropical forest countries struggle with the design and implementation of coherent policies and measures to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Evidence on which factors and configurations are crucial to make progress towards these challenging policy objectives will be helpful for decision makers and practitioners at all levels involved in REDD+. Key findings highlight the importance of already initiated policy change, and the availability of performance-based funding in combination with strong national ownership of the REDD+ process. These findings provide guidance to REDD+ countries as to which enabling conditions need to be strengthened to facilitate effective, efficient and equitable REDD+ policy formulation and implementation.

TI  - Influence of Environmental Factors on the Aboveground Biomass of Mature and Postmining Forests in Chocó
T2  - LIFE-BASEL
AB  - Environmental factors control the accumulation of aboveground biomass (AB) in tropical forests, along with the role of AB in climate change mitigation. As such, the objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of factors such as forest type, succession, abundance of individuals, species richness, height, diameter, texture, and soil nutrient levels on the AB in mature and postmining forests in Choc & oacute;, Colombia. Five plots each were set up in primary and postmining forests with 15 and 30 years of regeneration, in which the amount of AB was measured and related to the environmental factors. The AB was 178.32 t ha-1 in the mature forests and 35.17 and 56.3 t ha-1 after 15 and 30 years of postmining regeneration, respectively. Furthermore, the general AB level was determined by the ecosystem type, diameter, richness, abundance, Shannon evenness, and Margalef diversity. In mature forests, the AB amount was positively influenced by height and richness, and negatively influenced by dominance and evenness; in areas degraded by mining, the AB level was positively related to richness and equity, and negatively related to species diversity and soil silt. In summary, environmental factors determine the carbon storage in the forests in Choc & oacute;. Mining reduces the function of these ecosystems in mitigating climate change.

TI  - Carbon sequestration in the bio-edaphic ecosystem of National Highway-27 in Guwahati, Assam, India
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Vehicular pollution in cities is engendering the need to enhance the sequestration of CO2 through bio-edaphic factors, such as trees and soil. Hence, this pioneering study aimed to analyze the interdependencies of the bioedaphic ecosystem during carbon sequestration on a national highway in Guwahati, Assam, India. To quantify the tree carbon stock, soil physicochemical properties, soil nutrients, bulk density, organic carbon, and soil carbon stock, trees with diameters at breast height (dbh) >= 2 cm and soil samples from different depths (0-15 cm, 15-30 cm, and 30-45 cm) were taken from six areas spread over 36 plots of equal size (2 >= 10 m) arranged in a zig-zag manner. The studied parameters were compared among the different areas. It was found that the tree and soil carbon stock, along with soil nutrients, were greater in the Garchuk-Lokhra area (sample area-4). A significantly strong correlation was observed between the soil carbon stock and the above and below-ground biomass of trees (AGB, r = 0.865; BGB, r = 0.847), which indicated the co-dependencies of the bio-edaphic ecosystem in accumulating carbon. Peltophorum ferrugineum (Decne.) Benth is recommended for planting because it has emerged as a tolerant species and has the greatest carbon storage potential. The bio-edaphic ecosystem of the national highway is now on a carbon-friendly trajectory that follows the UNFCCC guidelines and the REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) strategy. However further research on carbon budgeting is required.

TI  - Spatial-temporal changes of China's mangrove forests over the past 50 years: An analysis towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
AB  - Mangrove forests are tropical trees and shrubs that grow in sheltered coastlines, mudflats, and river banks in many parts of the world. These forests are rated amidst the most productive natural ecosystems on the earth, and are ecologically and socioeconomically important because of their crucial roles in coastal ecosystem protection. However, these forests are declining at an alarming rate, which is possibly more rapid than that of inland tropical forests. This serious loss has prompted a worldwide movement to protect and promote the sustainable use of mangrove forests. Recently, many governments adopted the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs present an opportunity for nations to set realistic targets for achieving sustainable use of natural resources and environmental capital. Relevant to mangrove conservation, a range of targets were established for implementation by the year 2020, including Targets 6.6, 14.2, 14.5, and 15.2. To date, mangrove forests have been protected and restored for decades in China. However, little is known about achievements of China's SDGs implementation on mangrove forests. The issue highlighted the need for a long-term holistic view of China's mangrove forests dynamics. Although there have been multiple national datasets of China's mangrove forests, few studies focused specifically on mangrove forests and their surrounding land covers. Thus, the objectives of this study are: (1) to apply a systematic remote sensing method across the entire coast of China, and build a new dataset of long-term China's mangrove forests and surrounding land covers in 1973, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2015 (the first year of SDGs), and 2020 (the complete year of mangrove related SDGs); (2) to quantify the spatial-temporal changes of mangrove forests and conversion between mangrove forests and other coastal land covers; and (3) to discuss the achievements of China's SDGs implementation on mangrove forests. In this study, we applied a hybrid object-based and hierarchical classification method to Landsat series imagery and achieved a high accuracy dataset of China's mangrove forests and surrounding land covers. Results showed that: (1) on national scale, area of mangrove forests declined from 48801 to 18602 ha between 1973 and 2000, then partially recovered to 28010 ha in 2020; (2) the lost mangrove forests were mainly changed to croplands and aquaculture ponds, while the restored mangrove forests were mainly converted from tidal flats; and (3) during 2015-2020, China government restored 25% of national mangrove forests. To Sep. 2020, the area of mangrove nature reserves accounted for 16% of mangrove growth zone, and 77% of China's mangrove forests grew inside these nature reserves. A batch of relevant laws and regulations has been formulated to prohibit mangrove forests destruction. The protection and restoration of mangrove forests in China have already met Targets 6.6, 14.2, 14.5, and 15.2. However, since illegal logging is strictly prohibited and the awareness of protecting mangrove ecosystem has been increased continuously, losses of mangrove forests in some areas were mainly caused by natural disasters, such as extremely low temperature, hurricane, biological invasions, and insect outbreaks. For example, according to the Guangxi Mangrove Research Center, in March 2008 numbers of Avicennia plants along the coasts of Guangxi were killed by extremely low temperature, and in Guangxi Shankou Mangrove Nature Reserve, more than 167 ha of Spartina alterniflora (an invasive species) were discovered in 2005.
   The classification method and datasets of this study can support the evaluation of SDG 6.6 implementation, and provide important information for SDGs 13, 14, and 15 evaluation. In addition, the results of this study can serve as an important scientific basis and fundamental data for formulating China's mangrove protection and restoration strategies.

TI  - The importance of microhabitat structure in maintaining forest mammal diversity in a mixed land-use mosaic
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - The Indian Ocean Coastal Belt (IOCB) of South Africa is a natural forest-grassland mosaic, nested within an anthropogenic, mixed land-use matrix. Given the ongoing threat of agricultural expansion and urbanisation, we assessed the value of a buffer habitat (Coastal dense bush) for conserving forest species. We investigated the influence of microhabitat complexity on mammal communities within forest and dense bush habitats, using occupancy modelling. We found vertical stratification gradients as observed in studies of tropical forest chronosequence, i.e. increased foliage density in lower habitat layers and decreased foliage density in higher habitat layers for dense bush, and vice versa for forest. Structural composition suggests that dense bush is within a successional stage of secondary forest regeneration. Bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) occupancy was higher in forest than dense bush, while the opposite was true for blue duiker (Philantomba monticola). Large-spotted genet (Genetta tigrina), Cape porcupine (Hystrix africaeaustralis) and marsh mongoose (Atilax paludinosus) occupancy remained constant between habitats. Grey duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia) occupancy varied greatly between dense bush (0.48 +/- 0.01) and forest (0.16 +/- 0.01). Dense bush appeared to maintain natural forest assemblages, and may play a crucial role in buffering IOCB forest patches, given their highly-restricted distribution. However, dense bush habitats have no protection status, but play a role in the conservation of forest plants and animals. Therefore, we advocate the inclusion of dense bush habitats in conservation networks focused on forests.

TI  - Thermally buffered microhabitats recovery in tropical secondary forests following land abandonment
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Given the dramatic loss of tropical forests and accelerating climate change, secondary forest regeneration is increasingly recognised as being an important method for reversing losses in biodiversity and carbon stocks. The recolonisation of biodiversity within secondary forests depends in part upon the recovery of forest structure, including the range of microhabitats used by diverse local communities. Here, we investigate the return of critical microhabitats along a successional gradient of secondary forest in the Tropical Andes of Colombia. We measured the abundance of live (bromeliads, tree ferns and moss) and dead (deadwood and leaf litter) microhabitats across three landscapes, each encompassing primary, and young (4-18 yr old) and old secondary forests (19-35 yr old). Considering the increasing rate of climate warming in the region, we also explored whether these microhabitats provide thermally buffered microclimates. We found that secondary forests have different composition and lower complexity of microhabitats than primary forests, but microhabitats appear to be recovering towards primary forest levels. Furthermore, in all forest types, microhabitats had lower maximum temperatures and higher minimum temperatures, thereby serving as thermal buffers that reduced exposure to extreme temperatures. These benefits exist despite ambient temperatures in secondary forests surpassing those of primary forests by 1-2 degrees C on average. The protection of secondary forest and promotion of further forest regrowth in the Tropical Andes should represent an urgent investment for conservation, and the value of these forests for offering critical microhabitats and buffered microclimates under climate change should not be overlooked.

TI  - Primate Seed Dispersal: Old and New Challenges
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
AB  - Primate seed dispersal plays crucial roles in many ecological processes at various levels of biological organization: from plant population genetics and demography to community assembly and ecosystem function. Although research on primate seed dispersal has advanced significantly in the last 20-30years, many aspects are still poorly understood. Here, we discuss some new challenges that we need to address, as well as some old ones that still need our attention, highlighting examples from the Neotropics. Despite new analytical tools from network theory, research on primate seed dispersal rarely takes a community-wide approach, thus limiting our understanding of its evolutionary, ecological, and conservation implications. Of particular relevance for conservation are changes caused by landscape-scale processes (e.g., forest loss and fragmentation), but these effects need to be assessed using a landscape approach, which is currently absent in primate seed dispersal research. Agroecosystems can play a key role in maintaining primate seed dispersal in anthropogenic landscapes, but this topic remains poorly studied. Primate seed dispersal research will need to play a role in refaunation projects aimed at restoring plant-animal interactions. Old challenges that we still need to address include the long-term effects of primate declines on plant populations and communities, and the role of primate seed dispersal in the regeneration of degraded habitats. If we take advantage of all tools provided by modern science, from powerful methods of data analyses to molecular techniques, and combine them with strong multidisciplinary collaborations, the future of primate seed dispersal research will indeed be exciting.

TI  - USE AND MANAGEMENT OF SECONDARY VEGETATION IN A HUMID-TROPICAL AREA
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - This work deals with-the experimental management of secondary succession in a tropical forest region in Uxpanapa, Veracruz, Mexico. The goal is to establish a system of 'diversifield units', which will maintain production and biodiversity while obtaining valuable products, primarily for self-sufficiency, and secondarily as cash crops. Three different diversifield units of production have been identified: a) the traditional 'milpa', maize polyculture, b) the diversified home orchard and c) the enriched fallows. These units were established in three secondary forests areas, where once thinned or cleared, valuable annual and perennial species were introduced.
   Total biomass and product yields were analyzed, also labour invested on each production unit was recorded, units were compared on an efficiency basis. Maize yield of polyculture is low but total production is more than twice that of maize monoculture. Efficiency in the polyculture is also higher and its weeds were better controlled. After three years the 'milpa' has become an orchard with more than 150 individual fruit trees belonging to 10 different species. Enriched secondary forests show the highest biomass production in the open treatment, 68% transmittance, and the highest survivorship in the moderate shade treatment, 37%. Schizolobium parahybum and Cordia alliodora were the most successful forest species due to their fast growth.

TI  - Is the alien tree species Maesopsis eminii Engl. (Rhamnaceae) a threat to tropical forest conservation in the East Usambaras, Tanzania?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
AB  - The East Usambara mountains are globally important for biodiversity conservation. The work reported here aimed to clarify whether plantations of Maesopsis eminii, an introduced pioneer tree, are a source of alien tree invasion or a temporary element in a protected conservation forest ecosystem in these mountains. The natural regeneration dynamics of M. eminii and indigenous primary tree species were assessed in ill. eminii plantations which were up to 35 years old, using clustered systematic sampling. A total of 103 and 95 woody species were observed in the sapling and lower canopy layers, respectively. Both layers showed an abundance of Cephalosphaera usambarensis, a local species also used in plantations. M. eminii was virtually absent in the sapling layer, and its frequency decreased in the lower canopy with time. Abundant spontaneous regeneration of native primary forest species occurred under M. eminii. The sapling density of Allanblackia stuhlmannii, Beilschmiedia kweo and Greenwayodendron suaveolens increased, and that of Newtonia buchananii decreased, with time. In the lower canopy, the density of G. suaveolens, Parinari excelsa and Strombosia scheffleri increased in relation to plantation age. Therefore, no active, risky eradication of Maesopsis is needed in the conservation area, but a priority management task should be to avoid canopy gaps.

TI  - Dynamic Impacts of Economic Growth and Forested Area on Carbon Dioxide Emissions in Malaysia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This study measures the relationship and dynamic impacts of economic growth and forested area on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Malaysia. Time series data over the period of 1990 to 2016 were used by employing the dynamic ordinary least squared (DOLS) approach. The results of DOLS estimation indicate that the coefficient of economic growth is positive and significant with CO2 emissions, meaning that RM1 million increase in gross domestic product (GDP) is associated with an increase in CO2 emissions of 0.931 kilo tons. Instead, the long-run coefficient of forested area found negative and significant, which implies that declining one hectare of forested area (i.e., deforestation) has an impact of three kilo tons of CO2 emissions rise in Malaysia. Our study findings indicate that economic growth and deforested area have an adverse effect on Malaysia's carbon emissions where GDP growth fosters carbon emissions at a faster rate. Thus, the effective implementation of policy measures and economic instruments including afforestation and reforestation, forest conservation, sustainable forest management, REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation plus) mechanism and other emission reduction mechanisms inter alia could be useful for reducing carbon emissions while decreasing deforestation and maintaining the long-term economic growth in Malaysia.

TI  - From wild harvesting to agroforest cultivation: A Chamaedorea palm case study from Chiapas, Mexico
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Non-timber forest products (NTFP) commercialisation usually modifies the livelihoods and economic strategies of forest people to make room for NTFP cultivation systems. This paper analyzes livelihood changes, new production techniques and future challenges of a case study in a South-eastern Mexican community where Chamaedorea palm cultivation is displacing wild harvesting. The results illustrate the fast adoption of palm plantations due to salient improvements in the economic return to effort. The change was led by richer households, although communal structures have allowed the middle income households to participate in the process. While palm producers do not tend to have beans and corn subsistence plots, landless poorer members have been left out of palm activities, basically remaining as subsistence farmers.

TI  - Improved models for estimating temporal changes in carbon sequestration in above-ground biomass of mixed-species environmental plantings
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Plantings of mixed native species (termed 'environmental plantings') are increasingly being established for carbon sequestration whilst providing additional environmental benefits such as biodiversity and water quality. In Australia, they are currently one of the most common forms of reforestation. Investment in establishing and maintaining such plantings relies on having a cost-effective modelling approach to providing unbiased estimates of biomass production and carbon sequestration rates. In Australia, the Full Carbon Accounting Model (FulICAM) is used for both national greenhouse gas accounting and project-scale sequestration activities. Prior to undertaking the work presented here, the FulICAM tree growth curve was not calibrated specifically for environmental plantings and generally under-estimated their biomass. Here we collected and analysed above-ground biomass data from 605 mixed-species environmental plantings, and tested the effects of several planting characteristics on growth rates. Plantings were then categorised based on significant differences in growth rates. Growth of plantings differed between temperate and tropical regions. Tropical plantings were relatively uniform in terms of planting methods and their growth was largely related to stand age, consistent with the un-calibrated growth curve. However, in temperate regions where plantings were more variable, key factors influencing growth were planting width, stand density and species-mix (proportion of individuals that were trees). These categories provided the basis for FulICAM calibration. Although the overall model efficiency was only 39-46%, there was nonetheless no significant bias when the model was applied to the various planting categories. Thus, modelled estimates of biomass accumulation will be reliable on average, but estimates at any particular location will be uncertain, with either under- or over-prediction possible. When compared with the un-calibrated yield curves, predictions using the new calibrations show that early growth is likely to be more rapid and total above-ground biomass may be higher for many plantings at maturity. This study has considerably improved understanding of the patterns of growth in different types of environmental plantings, and in modelling biomass accumulation in young (<25 years old) plantings. However, significant challenges remain to understand longer-term stand dynamics, particularly with temporal changes in stand density and species composition.

TI  - Agroforestry in Shade Coffee Plantations as an Emission Reduction Strategy for Tropical Regions: Public Acceptance and the Role of Tree Banking
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH
AB  - Support for the adoption of climate change mitigation measures in low-income regions depends on how such activities contribute to generating household income and gaining confidence from the local community. The planning of mitigation measures or pro-environmental activities need to consider the cost of deployment, customization of activities according to local conditions, and socio-cultural background and perceptions of people. This paper analyses the incentive induced "agroforestry" or "planting trees in farmland" as part of the Carbon Neutral Programme supported by the Government of Kerala in Meenangadi Grama Panchayath, Wayanad district. An increase in tree cover is proposed as a strategy for increasing carbon sequestration. Planting more trees in farmland (except grain cultivated areas) along with crops, according to farmers, may reduce crop yield and discourage farmers' participation. The Government of Kerala put forward the concept of a tree banking/tree incentive program to attract farmers to expand tree cover. A survey was conducted among 100 individuals from the Meenangadi Grama Panchayath to assess the perceptions and concerns of farmers about the proposed "Agroforestry"/Tree Banking program. The sample size was chosen from the population assuming a 9.98% error tolerance. Tree Banking Programme designed to encourage farmers to plant trees has gained public interest, and the study also documented the factors influencing the willingness of farmers for planting trees. The study revealed that the majority of the individuals (93% of the survey participants) residing in the region are interested in supporting the activities for climate change mitigation. Financial incentives announced under tree banking generated interest among farmers. 89% of the survey participants consider the incentive scheme to be an attractive option, as it can compensate for the short-term loss in crop productivity. However, farmers were very selective in choosing the tree species to be planted on their farms. Incentivization helps to make sure that a large proportion of the planted saplings will grow into mature trees. Overall, it can be concluded that afforestation in the form of agroforestry could be potentially attractive to the farmers and contribute towards achieving carbon neutrality for tropical agricultural areas.

TI  - Estimating biomass stocks and potential loss of biomass carbon through clear-felling of rubber plantations
T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
AB  - When latex production declines after 35-40 y, clear-felling of rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations is a common management practice around the world. Although clear-felling can lead to significant losses in system carbon (C), such losses have not been adequately quantified in rubber plantations in India. The objectives of this work are to (1) develop and test models for estimating rubber tree biomass and C storage in situations where diameter at breast height (D 1.3 m) cannot be measured precisely due to the tapping artefact, and (2) estimate losses in biomass C due to clear-felling of mature plantation. Five biomass estimation models were tested using a total of 54 trees destructively sampled from 35 to 40 y old plantations in North East India. Then the amount of biomass and the potential C losses following clear-felling were estimated. The tree biomass predicted by our models was within 0.2 and 5% of our measured tree biomass. The mean biomass was estimated at 376.9 and 23.9 kg per tree for above and below ground parts, respectively. On an area basis, total tree biomass was estimated at 286.1 Mg ha(-1), which was more than that under jungle rubber (147 Mg ha(-1)) but lower than the forests (384 Mg ha(-1)) in the tropical regions. According to our estimate clear-felling of mature plantation can on an average remove C at a rate of 135 Mg ha(-1), which represents most of the C stored in aboveground tree biomass. In order to conserve the biomass C and to maintain environmental integrity, we recommend selective felling of 20% of total growing stock starting from plantation age of 35 years and replanting at two year cycle.

TI  - Microclimate determines community composition but not richness of epiphytic understory bryophytes of rainforest and cacao agroforests in Indonesia
T2  - FUNCTIONAL PLANT BIOLOGY
AB  - Management intensification in cultivated, tropical forests drives changes in the microclimate that can threaten native forest. ora and fauna. In this study, we use epiphytic bryophytes, known to be sensitive to microclimatic changes due to their lack of a protective cuticle and the exposed habitat, to investigate the predictive power of microclimate for changes in species richness and composition. Bryophytes were sampled from understory trees in natural forest and cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) trees in two types of cacao agroforests (natural shade trees and planted shade trees) in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. The microclimate in the agroforests was characterised by low air humidity and high air temperature during the afternoon. Bryophyte species richness did not differ between habitat types but species composition changed markedly from the natural forest to the cacao agroforests. Although no correlation between species richness and microclimate values could be found, a series of matrix-based analyses revealed a significantly positive relationship between similarities in species composition and inmaximum values for temperature and minimum values for humidity, which suggests that microclimatic changes are a good predictor for high turnover of bryophyte community composition from natural forests to cacao agroforests.

TI  - Evaluating Plantation Forest vs. Natural Forest Regeneration for Biodiversity Enhancement in Hong Kong
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Global trends predict a continuous increase in the proportion of forest occupied by plantations up to the end of the 21st century, while a dramatic loss of biodiversity is foreseen as a result of anthropogenic exploitation and climate change. This study compares the role and performance of plantation policies in Hong Kong, with natural regeneration of secondary forest, using detailed spatio-temporal data extracted from a previous study. The study extends over a 70-year period from 1945 to 2014 using aerial photographs and satellite images of five time periods to document spatio-temporal trends in plantation forestry and natural forest succession. Field data on species richness and woody biomass at different stages of forest succession are compared with available data from plantations in the same study area. Results indicate that plantation forests support relatively few native species in the understory, with much lower species richness than naturally regenerated forest, even after 6 to 7 decades. Time-sequential maps of habitat change show that natural forest succession from barren grassy hillsides, progressed at an annual rate of 7.8%, from only 0.2% of the landscape post WWII, to over 37% today. Plantation forestry on the other hand has been less successful, and has even acted as a barrier to natural forest regeneration, as mono-cultural plantations from the late 1960s to 1980s are still plantations today, whereas other similar areas have succeeded naturally to forest. The theory of plantations acting as a nurse crop for a woody native understory is not supported, as Pinus massoniana plantations, destroyed by two deadly nematodes during the 1970s, apparently had no woody understory, as they were seen to have reverted to grassland in 1989 and are still mainly grassland today.

TI  - Data Collection Survey on Forest Conservation in Mahavir Swami Wildlife Sanctuary for Addressing Climate Change
T2  - HACQUETIA
AB  - Tropical forest serves as an important pivotal role in terrestrial biological diversity. The Data Collection Survey on Forest Conservation aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current state of forests and evaluate the effectiveness of conservation efforts. This survey integrates advanced data collection methods, including remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), to monitor forest health, biodiversity, and threats. This study makes an attempt to data collection surveying methods to assess forest management in Mahavir Swami Wildlife Sanctuary (MSWS), Lalitpur, UP, India, using Sentinel-2A sensor data. We selected tree samples from thirty transects in MSWS through random sampling. A method of collecting tree measurement factors based on height and DBH with a variety of high-precision methods is proposed. The data collection survey used in this study can help forest managers, environmentalist, and conservationist for formulating policies for management of forest ecosystem at various scales.

TI  - Testing the effectiveness of the forest integrity assessment: A field-based tool for estimating the condition of tropical forest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS AND EVIDENCE
AB  - Global targets to halt biodiversity losses and mitigate climate change will require protecting rainforest beyond current protected area networks, necessitating responsible forest stewardship from a diverse range of companies, communities and private individuals. Robust assessments of forest condition are critical for successful forest management, but many existing techniques are highly technical, time-consuming, expensive or require specialist knowledge. To make assessment of tropical forests accessible to a wide range of actors, many of whom may be limited by resources or expertise, the High Conservation Value Resource Network (HCVRN), with the SE Asia Rainforest Research Partnership (SEARRP), developed a South East Asian version of the Forest Integrity Assessment (FIA) tool as a rapid (< 1 hour) method of assessing forest condition in the field, where non-experts respond to 50 questions about characteristics of the local environment while walking a site transect. Here, we examined the effectiveness of this survey tool by conducting similar to 1000 assessments of forest condition at 16 tropical rainforest sites with varying levels of disturbance in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We found good agreement (R-squared range: 0.50-0.78) between FIA survey scores and independent measures of forest condition, including biodiversity, vegetation structure, aboveground carbon and other key metrics of ecosystem function, indicating that the tool performed well. Although there was variation among assessor responses when surveying the same forest sites, assessors were consistent in their ranking of those sites, and prior forest knowledge had a minimal effect on the FIA scores. Revisions or further training for questions where assessors disagree, for example, on the presence of fauna at a site, could improve consistency. We conclude that the FIA survey tool is a robust method of assessing forest condition, providing a rapid and accessible means of forest conservation assessment. The FIA tool could be incorporated into management practices in a wide range of forest conservation schemes, from sustainability standards, to community forestry and restoration initiatives. The tool will enable more organizations and individuals to understand the conservation value of the forests they manage and to identify areas for targeted improvements.

TI  - Reconciling timber extraction with biodiversity conservation in tropical forests using reduced-impact logging
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Over 20% of the world's tropical forests have been selectively logged, and large expanses are allocated for future timber extraction. Reduced-impact logging (RIL) is being promoted as best practice forestry that increases sustainability and lowers CO2 emissions from logging, by reducing collateral damage associated with timber extraction. RIL is also expected to minimize the impacts of selective logging on biodiversity, although this is yet to be thoroughly tested.
   2. We undertake the most comprehensive study to date to investigate the biodiversity impacts of RIL across multiple taxonomic groups. We quantified birds, bats and large mammal assemblage structures, using a before-after control-impact (BACI) design across 20 sample sites over a 5-year period. Faunal surveys utilized point counts, mist nets and line transects and yielded >250 species. We examined assemblage responses to logging, as well as partitions of feeding guild and strata (understorey vs. canopy), and then tested for relationships with logging intensity to assess the primary determinants of community composition.
   3. Community analysis revealed little effect of RIL on overall assemblages, as structure and composition were similar before and after logging, and between logging and control sites. Variation in bird assemblages was explained by natural rates of change over time, and not logging intensity. However, when partitioned by feeding guild and strata, the frugivorous and canopy bird ensembles changed as a result of RIL, although the latter was also associated with change over time. Bats exhibited variable changes post-logging that were not related to logging, whereas large mammals showed no change at all.
   4. Indicator species analysis and correlations with logging intensities revealed that some species exhibited idiosyncratic responses to RIL, whilst abundance change of most others was associated with time.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates the relatively benign effect of reduced-impact logging (RIL) on birds, bats and large mammals in a neotropical forest context, and therefore, we propose that forest managers should improve timber extraction techniques more widely. If RIL is extensively adopted, forestry concessions could represent sizeable and important additions to the global conservation estate - over 4 million km(2).

TI  - Effects of tree guards and weed mats on the establishment of native tree seedlings: Implications for forest restoration in Hong Kong, China
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - The effects of tree guards and weed mats on establishment and growth of native tree seedlings, Thick-leaved oak (Cyclobalanopsis edithiae (Skan) Schott., Fagaceae), planted in an exposed hillside grassland in Hong Kong, were investigated. The natural regeneration of C. edithiae is poor due to a lack of seed dispersal agents and high seed predation, and therefore, this species is often targeted for forest restoration. The experiment lasted for 3.5 years during which the height, basal diameter, and crown diameter of individual seedlings were measured and survivorship recorded. The use of weed mats alone did not have a significant effect, but a combination of tree guards and weed mats led to a significant improvement in establishment, survivorship, and growth of the seedlings during the experimental period. Initially, the guards promoted rapid height growth of the seedlings, although lateral growth and secondary stem thickening were compromised. After the seedlings grew over the tree guards, the basal diameter and crown diameter increased at a notably faster rate. The combined effect of the tree guard and weed mat on the seedling growth pattern was found to be beneficial and contributed to the high survivorship of the seedlings. Comparing the survivorship data and the costs of various treatments, the use of tree guards in combination with the weed mats was demonstrated to be more cost-effective than planting the seedlings without tree guards or weed mats. The potential for applying the technique in afforestation programs with native tree species for forest restoration in Hong Kong and other tropical regions is discussed.

TI  - The impact of grazing on biodiversity and forest succession in the Brazilian dry forest region is constrained by non-equilibrium dynamics
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The impacts of grazing on rangelands have historically been studied within the framework of the equilibrium model, which predicts significant impacts of grazing on ecosystems. However, in recent decades, studies have observed a non-equilibrium pattern, suggesting that abiotic factors play a primary role compared to grazing. These studies are primarily focused on rangelands, despite animal husbandry occurring in other biomes, such as seasonally dry tropical forests. Our study examines the influence of goat grazing on biodiversity and forest succession in the Brazilian dry forest ( Caatinga ). Considering its high interannual precipitation variability, we hypothesize a response that aligns with the non-equilibrium paradigm. We established a gradient of grazing intensity and history in areas at different stages of vegetation succession. A survey of tree- shrub and herbaceous species was conducted at each site and the biomass of both strata was quantified. Linear mixed models and Permanova were employed to assess differences in richness, composition, structure, and biomass among the areas. Our results suggest that grazing (history and intensity) and forest fallow age did not affect species richness, but only species composition. Low and high grazing intensity drive ecosystems toward similar compositions, which align with the non-equilibrium model predictions. Biomass in the herbaceous layer remained unaffected by grazing history, intensity, or forest fallow age, whereas woody biomass was influenced by grazing intensity in older forest fallows. Although trees in low-intensity grazing sites were significantly taller compared to those in other levels, overall, grazing did not disrupt the natural succession process. Older forest fallows exhibited greater diversity and higher basal area compared to new forest fallows, irrespective of grazing intensity. Our findings suggest that: a) grazing has minimal effects on biodiversity and biomass due to non-equilibrium dynamics, and b) with appropriate management, grazing can coexist with the conservation of the Caatinga.

TI  - TANZANIAS VANISHING RAIN-FORESTS - ASSESSMENT OF NATURE CONSERVATION VALUES, BIODIVERSITY AND IMPORTANCE FOR WATER CATCHMENT
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The rain forests of Tanzania occupy small areas, mostly confined to isolated mountains. Except for some isolated volcanic mountains (Mt. Kilimanjaro, Mt. Meru, the Ngorongoro Crater), most of the rain forests are confined to the so-called Eastern Arc mountains with old crystalline bedrocks. The Eastern Arc rain forests are characterized by high biodiversity, and have large numbers of endemic and rare taxa of plants and animals. The submontane and montane rain forests are extremely important water catchments, providing water for major cities and densely populated rural areas. Most of the rain forest catchments are forest reserves, but still the human impact around and inside the reserves is considerable. Intensive cultivation due to heavy population pressure affects the reserves from all sides, leaving the forests isolated, fragmented 'islands' surrounded by the cultural landscape. Former timber production and logging programs initiated by the State and some foreign development organizations have depleted large areas of rain forests, e.g. in the Usambara Mountains. Extensive, destructive, legal and illegal activities such as, e.g. logging, pit-sawing and grazing have taken place inside most of the forest reserves. Some research programs on rain forest catchments are now being carried out in Tanzania, forming a basis for future management and monitoring of the forest reserves. The forest authorities are currently much concerned about the problems, giving catchment forest management highest priority in the Tropical Forestry Action Plan.

TI  - Fallow to forest: Applying indigenous and scientific knowledge of swidden cultivation to tropical forest restoration
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Rotational swidden cultivation systems, with fallow periods long enough for the regeneration of secondary forests are capable of maintaining forest cover and plant diversity in a dynamic balance in swidden cultivation landscapes. Regeneration of secondary forests through several successional stages and by a combination of coppicing and seedling development is still poorly understood, especially the influence of different swiddening practices and the role of animals as seed dispersers. Swidden cultivators possess a vast knowledge of plants growing in swidden fallows and of fallow dynamics as well. Forest restoration in Thailand has been carried out mainly on the basis of experimental research on the potential of indigenous tree species to promote natural forest regeneration and biodiversity recovery; the so-called framework species. Another viable source of knowledge for forest restoration can be the study of the semi-natural revegetation processes in fallows and the indigenous knowledge of swiddeners of these processes. The research presented here was carried out to attain a better understanding of forest regeneration on fallow swiddens under different swiddening regimes and how it may be applied to practical forest restoration, We investigated the vegetation characteristics of from various stages of secondary succession in fallow swiddens of the Karen and Lawa ethnic groups in the Mae Chaem watershed, Chiang Mai province, northern Thailand. Indigenous knowledge on the use of species and traditional ecological processes in swiddening was recorded by questioning key informants. The data were analyzed and discussed with respect to their application in forest restoration and participatory forest management. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Principle and practice of the buffer zone in biosphere reserves: from global to local - general perspective from managers versus local perspective from villagers in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - TROPICAL RAINFORESTS AND AGROFORESTS UNDER GLOBAL CHANGE: ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC VALUATIONS
AB  - The establishment of buffer zones as part of protected areas within biosphere reserves but also national parks is central to conservation strategies designed to safeguard remaining biodiversity, mainly left in tropical forests. However, the real-world situation of protected areas reveals a range of problems. This study seeks to identify the diverse ways of thinking among relevant actors in order to address these issues.
   In the present work, characteristics of the global perspective of managers are contrasted with findings from a field study in the forest biosphere reserve Lore Lindu, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. In this context, the differences between the villagers' point of view regarding the implementation of sustainable-development activities in the buffer zones and the managers' perspective on the sustainability of human uses in the same areas are highlighted. This paper follows two complementary approaches, combining quantitative and qualitative research tools when examining the respective positions of both managers and villagers.
   Quantitative analysis of a global survey among biosphere reserve managers revealed that human uses in the buffer zones are generally considered to be sustainable (mean value for evaluation of 6.4 on a scale from 1 to 10). Besides a significant negative correlation (-0.3) between number of residents in the buffer zone and accordance to sustainability of human uses, no meaningful relation was computed either in respect to country income or tropical forest regions.
   Because of this lack of conclusive data, we zoomed in on the local level and included the villagers' perspective. Factors influencing the implementation of sustainable-development activities in the buffer zone were the central issue of the field study. A completely different perception was found in Lore Lindu. The villagers expressed the opinion that basic management activities such as nonexistence of boundary demarcation and lack of law enforcement are the most crucial factors in regard to how sustainable-development activities are implemented. Further barriers are insufficient awareness of forest conservation needs among groups of villagers and the ever-increasing number of immigrants. Furthermore, the results of this study point to the high relevance of a mediator in the communication process between the management body and local people. Clearly formulated rules and laws and abidance by enforcement of the law seem to play a major role in buffer-zone management. Moreover, the different ethnic groups have to be taken into account by the park management in communication processes. Local people should be considered as partners (in buffer-zone management) rather than as passive objects in this process.

TI  - Indigenous Sacred Forests as a Tool for Climate Change Mitigation: Lessons from Gedeo Community, Southern Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
AB  - Sacred forests are patches of remnant natural forests, protected through social laws by the local communities near their villages and are always dedicated to cultural purposes. They are playing a significant role in combating climate change and informal enhancing biodiversity conservation. The aim of this study was to estimate carbon stocks of sacred forests by quantifying the aboveground biomass (AGB), and belowground (BGB) carbon of trees. The estimation of carbon stocks was conducted across the three sacred forests of Bolocho sacred forest (BSF), Ejjerissa sacred forest (ESF), and Amba sacred forest (ASF). A total of 30 plots: 10 BSF, 10 ESF, and 10 ASF were sampled and trees with DBH >= 5 cm and a height of >= 3 m was considered for biomass-carbon determination. We compared tree biomass, carbon stocks, stem densities, basal area, and importance value index of trees. Nondestructive methods of woody species biomass measurement was used by using allometric equations developed for application in tropical forests and/ or agroforestry system. A total of 4216 individuals representing 87 different species and 44 families were recorded. Statistical the highest stem density was recorded. Total biomass considered as AGB+BGB, which is highest for ASF followed by ESF and BSF (one way ANOVA, F = 98.66, df, 2, p < .001). The estimated amount of AGB across the three sacred forests were (505 Mg ha(-1)), (267 Mg ha(-1)) and (202 Mg ha(-1)) in ASF, ESF, and BSF, respectively. Total biomass stored, both aboveground and belowground (AGB+BGB) significantly higher for ASF (637 Mg ha(-1)) followed by ESF (338 Mg ha(-1)) and BSF (255 Mg ha(-1)). Total biomass carbon (C) was 318.5 Mg C ha(-1) for ASF, 169 Mg C ha(-1) for ESF, and 127.5 Mg C ha(-1) for BSF. From the present study, it can be concluded that, sacred forests and indigenous way of forest protection has playing an enormous roles in carbon sequestration. Perhaps it could be accepted as best practices in climate change (CC) mitigation and reducing deforestation. Hence, it needs urge calls for an immediate attention for conservation, protections and documentation of indigenous knowledge.

TI  - Nesting local forestry initiatives: Revisiting community forest management in a REDD plus world
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Understanding the relationship between components of varied decentralized governance models for community or collaborative management and forest conservation outcomes has taken on renewed importance in the context of community engagement in forest conservation efforts through policies to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+). In this paper, we synthesize lessons front two comparative case studies of decentralized forest management in Mesoamerica and East Africa in order to examine the institutional factors that contribute to successful tropical forest management in developing countries and, draw insights for policymakers regarding how national policy initiatives. including REDD+, might better embed local level institutions for forest management within broader state institutions and promote more positive local livelihoods and forest conservation outcomes. The case studies presented in this synthesis used a consistent research framework to gather data on forestry reforms, governance processes, local forest institutions, household forest uses and forest conservation outcomes. Our synthesis suggests that successful sustained forest management depends on institutional arrangements that (1) establish local resident rulemaking autonomy, (2) facilitate the flow of external financial and institutional assistance for monitoring and enforcement of local rules, and (3) buffer residents and their respective local institutions from more powerful, and at times corrupt, actors and agencies involved in forest exploitation. The results particularly suggest a role for external, independent non-governmental organizations to help mediate demands on local forest governance systems in nested contexts. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Tree diversity and carbon important species vary with traditional agroforestry managers in the Indian Eastern Himalayan region
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Traditional agroforestry systems, one of the time tested and dominant land use from tropical to sub-tropical regions, were recognized for their contributions to food production, biodiversity conservation, and atmospheric carbon sequestration. Their management often varies from region to region. However, these systems frequently mimic economically managed land uses due to increased pressure on the monetary requirement of their managers. The present study aims to evaluate (i) tree density, (ii) tree diversity indices, and (iii) identify the biomass carbon important tree species managed by different communities of the Indian Eastern Himalayan region. We found that the Mizo community harbored the highest number of tree species (35) in the traditional agroforestry system with the highest tree diversity index (3.47). Total biomass carbon of tropical agroforestry systems managed by different communities ranged between 4.72 Mg ha(-1) (Meitei) and 29.26 Mg ha(-1) (Bengali). Similarly, in the sub-tropical traditional agroforestry system, the highest and the lowest biomass carbon was observed in Mizo- (10.93 Mg ha(-1)) and Angami- (6.05 Mg ha(-1)) managed systems. Of the 31 biomass carbon, important species found across the traditional agroforestry systems, Artocarpus heterophyllus, had the highest occurrence (50%), followed by Parkia timoriana (37.5) and Amoora rohituka, Delonix regia, Mangifera indica, and Toona ciliata (25% for each species). Farmers' preference to cash return of a species, trees density, and basal area were the determinant factors in the carbon stock potential of these systems. The present study suggests that the farmers' preferred and dominant species in their agroecosystems have a limited scope of enhanced biomass carbon storage. Therefore, improvement of traditional agroforestry systems through selective incorporation of biomass carbon important tree species is recommended to enhance the carbon sink capacity of these systems.

TI  - Locating international REDD plus power relations: Debating forests and trees in international climate negotiations
T2  - GEOFORUM
AB  - The Reduction of Deforestation and Forest Degradation initiative (REDD+) was initially hailed widely as a smart and cost-effective way to mitigate climate change and has moved quickly compared to other strands of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations. Much of the initiative's original appeal - and a good deal of subsequent controversy around it - relates to framing the world's tropical forests as carbon sinks and compensating developing countries that manage to reverse or avoid deforestation. REDD+ negotiations can thus be seen a site where the standard divisions between Annex 1 and non-Annex 1 ('developed' and 'developing') were being challenged and interrogated by the negotiating parties and the broader network of actors around the climate regime. This article suggests that such complex and changing global governance policy fields need to be analysed as 'places' in their own right, populated by actors engaged in field-specific power relations that may not reflect international hierarchies or power relations manifested in other international settings. Based in a unique set of interviews supplemented by primary data analysis, this article unpacks the power relations of REDD+ negotiations by examining how those involved seek to assume competence, designate and recognize leadership, and shape outcomes. In tracing the dynamics of claiming competence, the 'competition' between two disciplinary milieus around forests as an international policy object and also delegates' shifting between reliance on expert knowledge and political 'know-how' in the negotiations themselves are identified. To understand the politics of recognition - that is to have a claim to competence or position acknowledged by others - the perceived qualities and resources of recognized leadership are examined and the absence of global superpowers amongst REDD+ leadership is problematized and discussed. Finally, in terms of wielding influence over outcomes, the fate of two quite similar ideas - one that has become incorporated into REDD+ methodology and another that is failing to be - further illustrate how the field is marked by internal power practices and that not all actors are equally well-positioned to achieve desired outcomes.

TI  - Topoclimatic Zoning of Three Native Amazonian Forest Species: Approach to Sustainable Silviculture
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Anthropized areas in the Brazilian Amazon require detailed mapping to identify zones for sustainable use. This study developed a topoclimatic zoning framework to evaluate the conservation and agroforestry potential of three native species: Carapa guianensis (Andiroba), Dipteryx odorata (Cumaru), and Bertholletia excelsa (Amazon Nut). The hypothesis was that integrating topographic and climatic data can effectively identify high-potential areas for these species to support forest restoration and sustainable management. This study applied ecological modeling and Geographic Information System (GIS) tools to classify zones into high, medium, and low potential for each species. Results showed Carapa guianensis has high potential in 64% of anthropized areas, Dipteryx odorata in 72% of the Legal Amazon, and Bertholletia excelsa in 58%, highlighting their adaptability and strategic value for restoration efforts. The findings emphasize the importance of topoclimatic zoning as a tool for conservation and sustainable use strategies. By aligning with Brazil's Payment for Environmental Services (PES) Law, this approach can foster agroforestry practices, enhance biodiversity conservation, and strengthen the Amazon bioeconomy, ensuring ecological resilience and sustainable development.

TI  - Forest resources and forestry in Indonesia
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Forests serve as a dwelling place and source of livelihood for the people of Indonesia. This paper analyzed the forest resources and forestry in Indonesia. The forest area in Indonesia amounts to 137,090,468.18 ha consisting of 133,694,685.18 ha as terrestrial forest area and 3,395,783 ha as water area. Hard work by the Ministry of Forestry has succeeded in suppressing the average rate of forest degradation. For the purpose of enlarging the log production from natural production forest through the silvicultural system of TPTI (Indonesian Planting and Selection Cutting), an Intensive Silvicultural System has been introduced at 25 forest concessions with the total area of about 52,300 ha. On the other hand, owing to its geographical position in the Equator region between the Asian and Australian continents, Indonesian tropical forest possesses high biodiversity. Finally, to guarantee the local community's active participation in the sustainable forest management practice, the government has empowered the local communities that live within and surrounding the forest area through various programs, such as establishing community forest, village forest, conservation forest, production center of non-wood forest products, community-based forest management and an improvement program with forest concession companies. The government also introduced the General Service Agency for financial support for communities that want to establish a forest plantation.

TI  - Sustainable agricultural intensification: the role of cardamom agroforestry in the East Usambaras, Tanzania
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The East Usambaras in Tanzania are a tropical biodiversity hotspot where current agricultural management practices pose threats to forest conservation and development objectives. Promoting sustainable agricultural intensification (SAI) would improve long-term productivity and reduce pressure on forest reserves. The study objective was to identify household-level characteristics that influence adoption of improved management practices, specifically soil replenishment practices, in order to identify opportunities and constraints to scaling up SAI to landscape level. First, three common farming systems and a fourth agroforestry (AF) model were developed to estimate the relative profitability of incorporating fallow, manure, and non-timber forest product activities. Next, household surveys were conducted and a logistic regression analysis was used to measure the influence of socioeconomic characteristics, physical and financial assets, tenure security, and plot-specific attributes on adoption of soil replenishment practices that were specified in the model. Findings showed that the AF model was financially competitive but raises opportunity costs to labour when compared to common systems. Marital status, household size, remittances, credit access, and tenure security significantly influenced adoption of fallow and applying organic inputs. Significant plot-specific attributes included perceived fertility and distance from the homestead. Policies to scale up SAI should consider these factors and emphasize improving markets for AF species and extension services.

TI  - Demand and proximity: drivers of illegal forest resource extraction
T2  - ORYX
AB  - Illegal extraction from protected areas is often shaped by the surrounding socio-economic landscape. We coupled village-scale socio-economic parameters collected using household surveys with measured levels of illegal resource extraction proximate to study villages to investigate the socio-economic drivers of illegal extraction from Kibale National Park, Uganda. The level of illegal tree harvesting and the number of illegal entry trails into the Park were driven by subsistence demand from villages adjacent to the Park and by for-profit extraction to supply local urban markets, whereas grazing in the Park was linked to high livestock ownership. Capital asset wealth, excluding livestock, was found to mitigate illegal resource extraction from the Park. We also found high human population density to coincide spatially with park-based tourism, research and carbon sequestration employment opportunities. Conservation strategies should be integrated with national policy to meet the needs of local communities and to manage urban demand to reduce illegal extraction from protected areas.

TI  - Slow restoration of soil microbial functions in an Acacia plantation established on degraded land in Thailand
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Deforestation diminishes the ecological services that a forest provides (e.g., flood prevention). To restore such services, reforestation is often utilized. The full restoration of the original forest ecosystem, however, can take several decades. The present study was conducted to identify the missing key components for rehabilitation of a degraded plot of land in Thailand on which Acacia trees were planted 18 or 19 years ago. Canopy spectral and soil physicochemical profiles of the Acacia plantation plot showed more advanced rehabilitation than in the soil microbial functions, as represented by soil dehydrogenase activity and community-level physiological profiles, when compared with those of a natural evergreen forest. The slower restoration of the soil microbial functions was thought to: (1) be attributed to the loss of certain microbes that played important roles in the evergreen forest soil, and (2) restrict the restoration of the entire forest ecosystem which was found to be still progressing towards a full restoration of the land's original conditions. Finally, possible measures for further rehabilitation of the ecosystem were discussed.

TI  - Tree species diversity and utilities in a contracting lowland hillside rainforest fragment in Central Vietnam
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Background: Within the highly bio-diverse 'Northern Vietnam Lowland Rain Forests Ecoregion' only small, and mostly highly modified forestlands persist within vast exotic-species plantations. The aim of this study was to elucidate vegetation patterns of a secondary hillside rainforest remnant (elevation 120-330 m, 76 ha) as an outcome of natural processes, and anthropogenic processes linked to changing forest values.
   Methods: In the rainforest remnant tree species and various bio-physical parameters (relating to soils and terrain) were surveyed on forty 20 m x 20 m sized plots. The forest's vegetation patterns and tree diversity were analysed using dendrograms, canonical correspondence analysis, and other statistical tools.
   Results: Forest tree species richness was high (172 in the survey, 94 per hectare), including many endemic species (> 16%; some recently described). Vegetation patterns and diversity were largely explained by topography, with colline/sub-montane species present mainly along hillside ridges, and lowland/humid-tropical species predominant on lower slopes. Scarcity of high-value timber species reflected past logging, whereas abundance of light-demanding species, and species valued for fruits, provided evidence of human-aided forest restoration and 'enrichment' in terms of useful trees. Exhaustion of sought-after forest products, and decreasing appreciation of non-wood products concurred with further encroachment of exotic plantations in between 2010 and 2015. Regeneration of rare tree species was reduced probably due to forest isolation.
   Conclusions: Despite long-term anthropogenic influences, remnant forests in the lowlands of Vietnam can harbor high plant biodiversity, including many endangered species. Various successive future changes (vanishing species, generalist dominance, and associated forest structural-qualitative changes) are, however, expected to occur in small forest fragments. Lowland forest biodiversity can only be maintained if forest fragments maintain a certain size and/or are connected via corridors to larger forest networks. Preservation of the forests may be fostered using new economic incentive schemes.

TI  - Reforestation of agricultural land in the tropics: The relative contribution of soil, living biomass and debris pools to carbon sequestration
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Tropical regions of the world experience high rates of land-use change and this has a major influence on terrestrial carbon (C) pools and the global C cycle. We assessed land-use change from agriculture to reforested plantings (with endemic species), up to 33 years of age, using 10 paired sites in the wet tropics, Australia. We determined the impacts on 0-50 cm below-ground C (soil organic C (SOC), charcoal C, humic organic C, particulate organic C, resistant organic C), C stored in roots (fine and coarse), C stored in living above-ground biomass and debris C pools. Reforested areas accumulated ecosystem Cat a rate of 7.4 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1). Reforestation plantings contained, on average, 2.3 times more ecosystem C than agricultural areas (102 Mg ha(-1) and 233 Mg ha(-1), respectively). Most of the C accumulation was in living above-ground and below-ground biomass (60 and 30%, respectively) with a smaller amount in debris pools (16%). Apart from C in roots, soil C accumulation was not obvious across sites ranging from 8 to 33 years since reforestation, relative to the agricultural baseline. Differences in SOC (and associated SOC pools) to a depth of 50 cm, did exist between reforested areas and adjacent agriculture at some sites, however there was not a consistent trend in SOC associated with reforestation. Local site-based factors (e.g. soil texture and mineralogy, land-use history and microbial activity) appear to have a strong influence on the direction of the change in SOC. While reforestation in the tropics has great potential to accumulate C in biomass in living vegetation, and debris pools, it is likely to take approximately 50 years before C stocks of reforested areas resemble natural ecosystems. Accumulation of SOC through reforestation is difficult to achieve, highlighting the need to conserve carbon pools in remnant forests in the tropics. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Reassembly of ground-dwelling ant communities in reforestation plots in SW Costa Rica
T2  - INSECTES SOCIAUX
AB  - Due to agriculture and logging, Costa Rica has lost many primary forests, making reforestation an important task. To judge the progress of reforestation, it is important to follow the reassembly of organismal communities within restored habitats. The COBIGA project near La Gamba, in the Golfo Dulce region of Costa Rica, aims at reforestation of lowland sites with native tree species. Ants, as ubiquitous and highly abundant terrestrial organisms, have a substantial influence on tropical ecosystems. The multiple roles include scavenging, predation, herbivory, and mutualistic interactions. We examined ant community responses to reveal the status of community regeneration and functional integrity. We compared the composition and diversity of the ant assemblages at three different age reforestation sites (2, 8, and 10 years old) with those at an old-growth forest as a reference site. By offering canned tuna fish at ground level along replicated transects, we observed 43 ant species representing six functional groups during the 2 months of sampling. Most of the observed ant species were omnivorous, but old-growth forests harbored a substantial number of other functional groups, such as generalized predators, arboreal predators, and arboreal omnivores. In contrast, the youngest reforestation site harbored a severely impoverished ant assemblage comprising mostly generalized polygynous and polydomous ant species from lower trophic levels. The within-site heterogeneity of the ant assemblages increased from the youngest to the oldest forest. In addition, our results show the importance of monitoring the progress of forest recovery to avoid the spread of invasive species into primary habitats.

TI  - Assessing vegetation health in dry tropical forests of Rajasthan using remote sensing
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
AB  - The rich vegetation areas with a variety of biodiversity are designated under categories of protected areas. Protected areas on Earth are the biomes where the elements of nature function together and maintain the life cycle. These protected areas include forest cover, rivers, waterbodies, mangroves, etc. which are the origin of ecology and biodiversity and provide natural resources utilized for human needs. Maintaining protected area is an essential aspect of managing the forest covers and a key strategy for combating the negative effects of biodiversity loss and fragmentation. The research aims to assess the vegetation health in the protected areas with NDVI using remote sensing. The paper also explores the factors for vegetation degradation and related habitat areas. The decline in vegetation quality, related species variety, and effect on their habitat areas are checked with NDVI results. The protected areas are subjected to various anthropogenic pressures, including grazing, forest fire, and wood harvesting. The paper highlights the need for effective management strategies to mitigate the identified challenges and ensure the long-term conservation and sustainability of the protected areas. This will ensure more habitat availability, healthy vegetation, genetic exchange between species populations, and a reduction in human-wildlife conflict. The findings of this paper can inform the development of more effective management strategies to protect and conserve these valuable ecosystems.

TI  - Integrating farmers' decisions on the assessment of forest regeneration drivers in a rural landscape of Southeastern Brazil
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Forest regeneration at large-scales is one of the main paths to achieving the ongoing ambitious restoration commitments. Thus, the identification of the main drivers of this process in agricultural landscapes is critical to understand the drivers determining restoration success. A growing number of studies have explored the biophysical and, less often, the socioeconomic drivers of forest regeneration using remote sensing approaches, but have not directly considered the influence of farmers' decisions in spatial prediction models of forest regeneration. We explored the influence of biophysical and socioeconomic drivers on forest regeneration in a rural landscape of Southeastern Brazil, where native forest cover increased by 7.7%. We evaluated forest regeneration through the analysis of time series of multi-temporal satellite images and socioeconomic information obtained through a Social Survey with 47 landowners, using each farm as the study unit. Natural forest regeneration was mainly favored by lower land suitability for agriculture and higher proximity (lower distances) to forest remnants, as well by higher numbers of land-uses types in the farm and lower economic dependence of landowners from the farm income. Our results emphasize the importance of considering farmers' decisions on predictive models of natural forest regeneration, which are critically needed to guide the implementation of large-scale forest restoration initiatives in agricultural landscapes.

TI  - Evaluating tree survival and modeling initial growth for Atlantic Forest restoration
T2  - CIENCIA RURAL
AB  - Ecological restoration has become an important complementary practice to protect natural resources and preserve biodiversity. However, native species may be used in restoration programs in ways that do not optimize their performance. This research evaluated the survival and to model the initial growth of 15 native tree species planted in "filling" and "diversity" lines in the post-planting phase of a restoration experiment in the subtropics of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We measured survival rate (%) one year after planting and collar diameter (mm), total height (m), crown projection area (m(2)) and crown volume (m(3)) in the first 48 months after planting. Growth modeling for each variable and species was based on the non-linear mathematical Logistic, Gompertz, and Chapman-Richards models. Model selection for each variable/species was supported by the Akaike Information Criterion, standard error of the estimate, and coefficient of determination. The highest survival rates were reported for Cordia americana, Gochnatia polymorpha, Inga uruguensis, Peltophorum dubium, Prunus sellowii e Zanthoxylum rhoifolium (91.7%) and for Solanum mauritianum (90.3%). The species with faster growth were, by increasing order, Mimosa scabrella, Trema micrantha, Solanum mauritianum and Croton urucurana. With a better understanding of the initial developmental potential of tree species, it is possible to increase the species and functional diversity of the filling group. There was no single model capable of describing the variables analyzed and different models were needed to describe different characteristics and species.

AB  - Background: The conservation and restoration of forest landscapes is an important aspect of sustainable development. In semi-arid regions these practices are difficulted by the harsh climate of these environments, with low precipitation values and prolonged dry seasons. The objective of this study is to identify tree species from the south of the Brazilian state of Piaui that have potential to be used in forest restoration programs.
   Results: Data from forest inventory and tree characteristics were used to select eight tree species using target species definition, focusing on species with desirable wood properties, abundance in the study region, favorable dendrometric variables, seed availability, ease of seed germination and seedling growth in nursery and field conditions, among others. These species were then evaluated as candidates for restoration using a framework species approach focusing on the following attributes: (i) 70% or higher seedling survival in the field; (ii) seedling height of 45 cm or taller after the first growing season in the field and (iii) 70% or greater nursery seedling survival.
   Conclusion: The species Combretum glaucocarpum, Cenostigma macrophyllum, and Pityrocarpa moniliformis are suitable to be employed in forest restoration programs in the southern region of Piaui, Brazil. Further studies must be carried out to assess the behavior of these and other potential tree species in long term field conditions and under varying silvicultural regimes, a key aspect for forest restoration.

TI  - Carbon Stock Estimation by Forest Measurement Contributing to Sustainable Forest Management in Cambodia
T2  - JARQ-JAPAN AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY
AB  - A simplified method for estimating CID,, emissions from deforestation is the calculation of carbon stock change by monitoring forest land and periodically summing up the land area and its averaged carbon stock for important forest types. As a feasibility study for applying this methodology to a tropical dry-land forest, we estimated carbon stock and its chronosequential change in 4 carbon Pools (aboveground and belowground biomass, deadwood, and litter) of tropical dry-land natural forests in Cambodia. Carbon stock differed among, forest types. Most of the carbon stock (84 +/- 12% (SD)) existed in free biomass. Growth of carbon stock has a positive relationship to the carbon stock itself. By moderately classifying forest types, determining averaged free biomass of each forest type, and Using land-area data oil each forest type, a reasonably accurate estimation of carbon stock call be expected. However, considering that rapidly progressing deforestation and wood extraction may reduce the carbon stock in forests, systematic sampling With a sufficieny number of extra plots and frequent Updating of forest land area and averaged carbon stock data arc vital for an accurate estimation of CO(2) emissions from forests under pressure of land-use change and forestry activities.

TI  - Genetic diversity of two tropical tree species of the Dipterocarpaceae following logging and restoration in Borneo: high genetic diversity in plots with high species diversity
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY
AB  - Background: The impact of logging and restoration on species diversity has been well studied in tropical forests. However, little is known about their effects on genetic diversity within species.
   Aims: We assess the degree of genetic diversity among dipterocarp seedlings used for enrichment planting of selectively logged forests in Sabah, Malaysia, and compare it with diversity in naturally regenerating seedlings. Methods: We sampled young leaf tissues from seedlings of Shorea leprosula and Parashorea malaanonan for DNA genotyping, using microsatellite markers.
   Results: The levels of genetic diversity (expected heterozygosity and rarefied allelic richness) of naturally regenerating seedlings were statistically indistinguishable among unlogged, once logged and repeatedly logged forest areas. Enrichment-planted seedlings of P. malaanonan exhibited similar levels of genetic diversity to naturally regenerating seedlings whereas those of S. leprosula had significantly lower genetic diversity than natural seedlings. Interestingly, reduction of genetic variation was consistently observed in single-species plots relative to mixed-species plots among enrichment-planted seedlings.
   Conclusions: There was no reduction of genetic variation in naturally regenerating dipterocarp seedlings in areas of selective logging. However, genetic variation of enrichment-planted seedlings was lower in single-species plots relative to mixed-species plots. This suggests that enrichment-planting strategies should adopt diverse mixtures that should promote levels of both species richness and genetic diversity within species.

TI  - Assessing the potential of community-based forestry programs in Panama
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Community-based forestry (CBF) policies have been widely adopted as potentially-effective sustainable natural resource management strategies. Since communities can have local knowledge and a stake in the long-term sustainability of the resource base, CBF is thought to produce better social and environmental outcomes. In practice, though, successful implementation has been inconsistent. Panama, a country experiencing widespread degradation and loss of tropical forests and high rates of rural poverty, has been identified as potentially benefiting from CBF programs. As a result, prominent forest policy actors have been piloting CBF projects to assess the potential for upscaling. This paper reports on these initiatives and reflects on Panama's readiness to support widespread CBF program adoption. Using empirical data collected through key informant interviews, document analysis and observation, we apply an analytical framework originally developed for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) that identifies six "keys" that a country must possess to remove the major impediments to robust CBF. Based on our case study analysis, none of the keys to effective CBF could be assessed as fully present in Panama, and a seventh potential key labelled 'Economic Viability' was identified to assess market competitiveness and economic sustainability. Our results suggest that CBF's ability to drive sustainable rural development and forest conservation in Panama is likely limited. However, a dynamic policy environment and supportive government also suggest that the keys to effective CBF can be attained with time and effort.

TI  - Eucalypt plantations for forest restoration in a fire-prone mosaic of grasslands and forests in northern Argentina
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - In ecosystems with grassland-forest boundaries, tree plantations could be used to promote forest restoration. In the Humid Chaco region of central South America, fire is one of the main disturbances that shapes the landscape. As eucalypt plantations are flammable, the contribution they can make to forest restoration is questionable. We planted saplings of five native tree species in three different environments (forests, grasslands, and eucalypt plantations) and assessed microclimatic conditions likely to influence sapling survival and growth. After 1 year, accidental fires that affected much of the study area allowed us to investigate the susceptibility of different environments to fire occurrence and post-fire sapling survival. We planted 600 saplings in four plots per environment. We evaluated fire occurrence in the study area for 2 years and ask whether this factor affects sapling survival. In grasslands, microclimatic conditions were more extreme than in plantations. Plantations and forests showed high pre-fire sapling survival but growth was almost double in plantations, similar to grasslands for most species. In the study area, fire frequency was similar in plantations and grasslands, whereas forests plots never burnt during the 2-year study period. Fire reduced sapling survival in plantations, but not in grasslands where survival was low and similar in burned and unburned plots. For top-killed plants, post-fire resprouting ability was species-specific. While more firm conclusions await future studies with even larger sample sizes, our results indicate that fire management may be necessary in order to use eucalypt plantations as nurses in this fire-prone ecosystem.

TI  - Modern coffee agroecosystems and their relationship with butterflies conservation in fragmented landscapes
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - Land use change by the intensification of agriculture contributes to tropical forest fragmentation and biodiversity loss. In this sense, in comparison with traditional agroforestry systems (AFS), modern AFS are considered irrelevant for the conservation of biodiversity of tropical forest fragments. However, there is an increasing trend toward the establishment of different types of modern AFS. Owing to the sensitivity to environmental changes, we evaluated the biodiversity of butterflies in AFS with Coffea arabica and Erythrina poeppigiana (CP), and intermixed with Musa spp. (CPM) or Cordia alliodora (the only native species of AFS) (CPL), as well as premontane very humid forest fragments in the Volcanica Central-Talamanca Biological Corridor, Costa Rica. In six representative sites of each system we set up three parallel 80 m line-transects, separated by a distance of 25 m. Each coffee farm and forest fragment (FR) was surveyed during 1.5 hours to record butterflies. All sites were sampled once a month from May to July 2007. We obtained 4.5 hours of sampling/site, and 27 hours of sampling/habitat. Both CP and CPM together had a butterflies' species composition which differed from CPL and FR. The indicator species of both CP and CPM together were Hermeuptychia hermes and Anartia jatrophae which are typical of open areas. CPL resulted with the species of secondary forests Heliconius erato petiverana and Pareuptychia ocirrhoe as indicators. In contrast, FR resulted with several indicator species typical of closed canopy forests such as Pierella helvina incanescens, Caligo eurilochus, and Morpho peleides limpida. Moreover, the richness of species was similar among coffee AFS. Furthermore, the richness of species of each coffee AFS was lower in comparison with FR. However, among coffee AFS, CPL harbored higher diversity (Exp(H')) of forest butterflies than CP. Also, CPM was higher in abundance of frugivorous butterflies in relation with CP and CPL. In fragmented forests, coffee farms with exotic shade species combined at least with a native tree or fruit species, can be a better habitat for forest butterflies than those dominated by an exotic monospecific shade.

TI  - The drivers of tree cover expansion: Global, temperate, and tropical zone analyses
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - This paper uses new, high resolution satellite-derived data to explore recent cross-national differences in expanding tree cover. Increases in tree cover have concentrated in nations with recent histories of extensive deforestation, humid climates, high crop yields, and small numbers of farm workers. The associations of expanded tree cover with high yields for cereal crops and small populations of cultivators suggests a dynamic, sometimes referred to as a forest transition, in which urbanization and industrialization promote a long-term expansion in tree cover on certain types of land. The association of tree cover gains with tree cover losses and humid climates suggests a second dynamic, a churning, treadmill-like production of wood products from lands subjected to recurring harvests of wood products followed by tree cover gains in the recently harvested areas. The forest transition dynamic suggests that many smallholders would allow tree cover to expand on their lands if payments for environmental services were available. The salience of the treadmill dynamic of tree cover losses followed by tree cover gains underscores the importance of questions about the implications of commercial tree monocultures for biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and social justice.

TI  - Artificial light puts ecosystem services of frugivorous bats at risk
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - <list list-type="1" id="jpe12206-list-0001">
   Currently, tropical forests are transformed into pasture and agricultural areas at an unprecedented rate, yet converted areas are often abandoned by farmers because depleting soil fertility renders unprofitable any agricultural land use. Natural succession of abandoned land could counter the loss of biodiversity, but the rate of natural reforestation is slow.
   Neotropical frugivorous bats facilitate natural succession because they seem to tolerate habitat disturbance when dispersing seeds of pioneer plants. Under naturally dark conditions, bats produce a copious seed rain even in deforested habitats and connect distant forest fragments. Yet, artificial light at night may compromise bat-mediated seed dispersal if bats avoid lit areas. This may delay or jeopardize natural forest succession in fragmented tropical landscapes.
   We asked whether the foraging behaviour of Sowell's short-tailed bats Carollia sowelli, a specialist on infructescences of pepper plants (Piperaceae), is negatively affected by artificial light at night.
   First, in a dual choice experiment with captive bats, we demonstrate that food was less often explored and consumed in the dimly illuminated than in the dark compartment, indicating that artificial light alters the foraging behaviour of fruit-eating bats. Secondly, using observations in free-ranging bats, we found that infructescences were less likely to be harvested when plants were illuminated by a street lamp than under natural darkness.
   Synthesis and applications. Natural succession of deforested areas and connectivity of remaining forest patches may suffer due to artificial light at night through a reduction in nocturnal seed disperser activity in lit areas. This could have negative impacts on biodiversity and consequent effects on land erosion, particularly in developing countries of the tropics where light pollution increases rapidly with growing economies and human populations. Mitigation requires that the use of artificial light should be limited in space, time and intensity to the minimum necessary. The effectiveness of darkness corridors' to enhance fragment connectivity and to reduce species loss should be evaluated. Policy-makers of tropical countries should become aware of the potential detrimental effects of artificial lighting on wildlife and ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Spatially differentiated trends in urbanization, agricultural land abandonment and reclamation, and woodland recovery in Northern China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Uncovering magnitude, trend, and spatial pattern of land cover/land use changes (LCLUC) is crucial for understanding mechanisms of LCLUC and assisting land use planning and conservation. China has been undergoing unprecedented economic growth, massive rural-to-urban migration, and large-scale policy-driven ecological restoration, and therefore encountering enormous LCLUC in recent decades. However, comprehensive understandings of spatiotemporal LCLUC dynamics and underlying mechanisms are still lacking. Based on classification of annual LCLU maps from MODIS satellite imagery, we proposed a land change detection method to capture significant land change hotspots over Northern China during 2001-2013, and further analyzed temporal trends and spatial patterns of LCLUC. We found rapid decline of agricultural land near urban was predominantly caused by urban expansion. The process was especially strong in North China Plain with 14,057 km(2) of urban gain and -21,017 km(2) of agricultural land loss. To offset the loss of agricultural land, Northeast China Plain and Xinjiang were reclaimed. Substantial recovery of forests (49,908 km(2)) and closed shrubland (60,854 km(2)) occurred in mountainous regions due to abandoned infertile farmland, secondary succession, and governmental conservation policies. The spatial patterns and trends of LCLUC in Northern China provide information to support effective environmental policies towards sustainable development.

TI  - Effects of Bromelia pinguin (Bromeliaceae) on soil ecosystem function and fungal diversity in the lowland forests of Costa Rica
T2  - BMC ECOLOGY
AB  - Background: Bromelia pinguin (Bromeliaceae) is a terrestrial bromeliad commonly found under forest stands throughout the Neotropics that has been shown to have antifungal activity in vitro. We have hypothesized that this bromeliad would also have an effect on the fungal populations in nearby soil by decreasing fungaldiversity and negatively impacting C and N cycle-related activities. A previous study in the lowland forest of Costa Rica showed the soil beneath these bromeliads had decreased fungal ITS DNA and differences in C and N levels compared to adjacent primary forest soils.
   Results: In this follow-up study, we found that the bromeliad soils had lower rates of C and N biomass development and lower phenol oxidase activity (suggesting less decreased fungal decomposition activity). The results of T-RFLP and cloning-based taxonomic analyses showed the community level diversity and abundance of fungal ITS DNA was less in bromeliad soils. Sequence analysis of fungal ITS DNA clones showed marked differences in fungal community structure between habitats of Basidiomycota (Tremellales, Agricales, Thelephorales), Ascomycota (Helotiales), and Zycomycota populations.
   Conclusions: The data show there to be differences in the soil nutrient dynamics and fungal community structure and activity associated with these bromeliads, as compared to the adjacent primary forest. This suggests the possibility that the anti-fungal activity of the bromeliad extends into the soil. The bromeliad-dense regions of these primary forest habitats provide a unique natural micro-habitat within the forests and the opportunity to better identify the role of fungal communities in the C and N cycles in tropical soils.

TI  - Soil nutrients and climate seasonality drive differentiation of ecological strategies of species in forests across four climatic zones
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Aim Ecological strategies are the growth and survival tactics employed by species in response to various environmental conditions. We aimed to identify the abiotic drivers for variation in ecological strategies of species in forest vegetation across different climatic zones. Methods We established 50 0.04-ha forest dynamics plots in each of four forest vegetation types across different climatic zones respectively. Three leaf functional traits (leaf area, specific leaf area and leaf dry matter content) of woody plant species and 7 soil factors were sampled and measured. Based on competitor, stress-tolerator, ruderal (CSR) theory and the CSR ordination method (StrateFy), we classified plants into four groups according to their ecological strategies. Redundancy analysis was used to access the key drivers of variation in plant ecological strategies across different forest types. Results The proportion of C-strategists decreased with increasing latitude, from tropical to cold-temperate forests. Except for the tropical forest, the proportion of S-strategists increased while that of Int-strategists (the intermediate type of strategy between the competitor, stress-tolerator, and ruderal strategies) decreased with increasing latitude. Ten abiotic variables (soil pH, available phosphorus, available nitrogen, precipitation of the warmest quarter, temperature seasonality, annual temperature range, precipitation of the wettest month, mean temperature of the warmest quarter, elevation, and precipitation of the driest month) were significantly correlated with plant ecological strategies of species in different forest types. Conclusions Contrary to our expectation, soil nutrients were more important than seasonal climatic factors in determining the ecological strategies of species in forests across different climatic zones.

TI  - Integrating species and successional classes for wood production in a mixed forest restoration system in a neotropical region
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
AB  - As forests in neotropical regions, particularly in developing countries, are devastated, interventions to restore biodiversity and its ecological functions are needed. Rural producers have thus been encouraged to grow trees for wood production as an economic activity. The objective of this study was to quantify the increment of wood density of four forest species from different successional classes of a mixed system of restoration in a neotropical forest in Brazil. Tree discs were sampled at breast height and analyzed radially by X-ray densitometry to obtain apparent density and basic density. Three trees each of a species from the pioneer, early and late secondary successional stages and of the dominant species in the climax community. The radial profiles indicated increasing density from the pith to bark of trunks, except for some variations due to wood defects and growth. Average density was 0.576 g cm(-3), 0.655 g cm(-3), 0.706 g cm(-3) and 0.775 g cm(-3), respectively, for Peltophorum dubium, Schinus terebinthifolius, Cariniana estrellensis and Hymenaea courbaril. Radial profiles indicated higher amplitudes in the apparent densities for slow-growing species. X-ray densitometry generated parameters such as minimum, average and maximum densities, and radial density variations. These parameters are important for understanding the ecological functional role of successional classes of the Atlantic Forest from the Neotropical region.

TI  - An evaluation of the contribution of cultivated allspice (Pimenta dioca) to vertebrate biodiversity conservation in nicaragua
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Tropical deforestation has emerged as one of the most important conservation challenges of our time, both because of the high species diversity and rates of endemism of tropical forests, and because of the rapid rate at which this process is proceeding. Recent studies indicate that areas of low-intensity agroforestry have similar levels of vertebrate diversity as some primary habitats, leading some researchers and conservationists to conclude that this type of commodity production could contribute to the conservation of biodiversity. We compared the composition of bird, mammal and herpetofaunal communities in primary forest, secondary forest, and pasture-and within the allspice productive systems that have replaced pasture. We found that mammal species richness was higher in primary forest than all other habitats; however for resident and migrant birds, amphibians and reptiles, species richness was similar between primary forest and the other habitats. Despite similarities in overall numbers of species, there were numerous species that were encountered only in primary habitats. We conclude that the cultivation of allspice in a mixed productive system can offset some of the losses to biodiversity; however it should be complemented by the establishment and maintenance of protected areas to accommodate populations of primary forest specialists that are unable to persist in altered habitats.

TI  - MULTICRITERIA DECISION RULE FOR EVALUATING PHYSICAL VULNERABILITY OF SELECTED AREAS TO FOREST DEGRADATION IN OGUN STATE, NIGERIA.
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
CP  - 13th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology (CEST)
AB  - With the increasing occurrence of natural hazards, deterioration of our physical environment and also climate change, there has been an increased consciousness in the conservation of our forests. Forest cover and density have proven to be important indicators of ecological stability and they play a major role in the preservation of the natural world. In tropical regions, deforestation and forest degradation are gradual progressive processes that are advancing at worrisome rate, resulting in a consequent conversion of forest area into a mosaic of mature forest fragments, pasture, degraded soil and loss of biodiversity. Hence, increase in research that assesses the vulnerability of forests to changing environmental conditions. This study was carried out using geo-information techniques in evaluating various physical factors contributing to the degradation of forests in Ogun State. Datasets acquired include landuse/landcover data, soil data, population data, meteorological data such as Mean annual rainfall map, Rainfall intensity, Mean Onset of rainfall map, Mean Cessation dates of rainfall, and Hydrologic ratio. Weighted linear combination was used to analyze factors and implemented in a GIS system. A grid model was developed to partition the study area into equal grid cells and this serves as a platform for combining criterion weights, scale values, data evaluation and vulnerability values.
   The total land area studied was 1798.88km(2), using 2301 grid cells (900m by 900m). The very highly vulnerable zone was 20.65% (386.27 km(2)), highly vulnerable zone, 41.63% (760.86km(2)), moderate vulnerable zone, 17.27% (323.09km(2)) and the low vulnerable zone was 20.45% (328.66km(2)) of the total land area. The evaluation of biophysical factors with multi-criteria techniques reveals that the current land uses promote environmental degradation. Therefore to avoid further degradation sustainable land uses such as agro forestry, reforestation of degraded habitat, supervised logging, use of alternative sources for energy other than firewood should be encouraged.

TI  - Chaco region: Forest loss and fragmentation in the context of the territorial planning law. Remote sensing assessment in Formosa, Argentina application case
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Agricultural expansion is the primary cause of forest loss and fragmentation. It threatens the conservation of its biodiversity as well as the capability to provide ecosystem services. Land-use policies, such as zonation programs, have been traditionally used as a tool for promoting a sustainable natural resource management; however, we still lack standardized methodologies that can be applied world-widely to achieve this purpose. In the current context of rampant deforestation over the tropical forests, there is an urgent need of identifying policies that steer agricultural land-use change into a reduced pressure on forests. This study focuses on the outcomes of the first territorial planning law in the Province of Formosa (Argentina) located within the Chaco region, one of the world's deforestation hotspots. The research questions were: a) How did agriculture expand in Formosa before, during and after the enactment of the territorial planning law? b) Did the introduction of the law affect the spatial distribution of land-use change?; and c) How did the sanction of the law affect forest loss and forest fragmentation? Landsat imagery was used to map land-use change, and to calculate the cover loss and cover loss rate considering the zoning and physiognomic classification of the law. The forest fragmentation was evaluated in terms of forest loss spatial configuration, classified as perforation or shrinkage, forest edge generation, patch size distribution, and patch isolation. The territorial planning law effect over agricultural expansion was tested using a difference in difference model. After the law was passed, a reduced land-use pressure was observed for the forest within the conservation designated zone; however, the forest presented the highest cover loss rates among the physiognomic categories of the law. Land-use change within the conservation designated zone was predominantly made according to a perforation spatial configuration, which promoted the forest edge generation. The isolation between forest patches decreased and its size distribution changed towards a less large-patch-centered pattern, indicating that Formosa is experiencing an early fragmentation process. Overall, the territorial planning law in Formosa succeeded in the relief of land-use pressure on forest, but highlighted the need of incorporating spatial configuration guidelines for long-term forest conservation. The case of Formosa case could be useful in the design of future sustainable natural resource management policies and implies the importance of early natural resource planning.

TI  - Forest Resources Assessment of 2015 shows positive global trends but forest loss and degradation persist in poor tropical countries
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015 shows that deforestation has slowed and afforestation has increased globally during 1990-2015. Planted forests have increasingly provided goods and services hitherto derived from natural forests, and mosaic forests in agricultural landscapes are increasing. Forest gain is occurring at higher latitudes and in richer countries whilst forest loss continues in poor countries in the tropics. Some middle income tropical countries are now also transitioning to forest gain. These transition countries are characterised by reforms to forest management and improvements in agricultural practices but also by significant expansions of planted forest, which account for similar to 25-100% of gains. Forest-area estimates of the FRA align with satellite-derived estimates, with deviations of <=+/- 7% globally and <=+/- 17% for the tropics. Mosaics comprised of trees outside forests, remnant forest patches, and young regenerating forests constitute a modest proportion of the tropical forest estate and are seemingly well inventoried by the FRA. Extensive areas of forest experienced partial canopy cover reduction since 2000, particularly in the tropics where their area is similar to 6.5 times that deforested since 1990. The likelihood of the eventual loss of these forests and a decline in their capacity to provide goods and services is a matter of concern. Demand for industrial wood and fuelwood increased 35% in the tropics since 1990, principally in poorer countries, and growth in demand will accelerate into the future, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Notwithstanding significant increases in forests within protected areas since 1990 to 517 Mha (16.3%) globally and 379 Mha (26.6%) in the tropics, increasing demands for ecological services, forest products, and climate change mitigation is likely to be met from an expanding area of planted forests more than from the declining area of natural forests, particularly in Africa. The global rate of planted-forest expansion since 1990 is close to a target rate of 2.4% per annum necessary to replace wood supplied from natural forests in the medium term, though the expansion rate has declined to 1.5% since 2005. Multiple-use forests permitting both production and conservation account for 26% of the global forest area and 17% of the tropical forest area, and have increased by 81.8 Mha or 8.5% globally since 1990, with most gains in the tropics. Sustainable forest management in low-income and tropical countries remains modest, with only 37% low-income country forests covered by forest inventories. International support has proven effective at increasing this coverage since 2010. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license.

TI  - Attributes of stand-age-dependent forest determine technosol fertility of Atlantic forest re-growing on mining tailings in Mariana, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
AB  - Understanding how soil fertility changes due to environmental conditions and stand-age-dependent forest attributes is important for local-scale forest restoration. We evaluated the effects of stand-age-dependent forest attributes (plant community composition and litter stock) on soil and technosol fertility across two second-growth Atlantic forests (SGF) after the deposition of mining tailings in Mariana, southeastern Brazil. We hypothesized that technosol fertility in the SGF tailings is positively affected by plant community composition variability, stand age, and litter stock. We used total exchangeable bases and organic matter as fertility indicators for technosol and soil, and species composition and litter stock as stand-age-dependent forest attributes. Our results showed significant differences in the stand-age-dependent forest attributes and soil chemical properties between the two forest patches (SGF tailing and SGF non-tailing) evaluated. Thus, there was a marked gradient of litter storage and fertility between soil and technosol that can be important forest recovery indicators for the affected plant communities. Furthermore, according to the tested models, we corroborated the hypothesis that technosol fertility is positively affected by stand age, plant community composition variability, and litter stock, which may contribute considerably to forest recovery on tailings. Our results demonstrate that the fertility predictors analyzed to explain the forest recovery on tailings can also be considered as ecological indicators for assessing forest restoration in areas impacted by mining tailings in Mariana.

TI  - Carbon payments as a safeguard for threatened tropical mammals
T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
AB  - One reason for the rapid loss of species-rich tropical forests is the high opportunity costs of forest protection. In Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo), the expansion of high-revenue oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantations currently threatens 3.3 million ha of forest. We estimate that payments for Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD) could offset the costs of stopping this deforestation at carbon prices of US$ 10-33 per tonne of CO2, or $ 2-16 per tonne if forest conservation targets only cost-efficient areas. Forty globally threatened mammals are found within these planned plantations, including the Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) and Borneo pygmy elephant (Elephas maximus borneensis). Cost-efficient areas for emissions reductions also contain higher-than-average numbers of threatened mammals, indicating that there may be synergies between mitigating climate change and conserving biodiversity. While many policy and implementation issues need clarification, our economic assessment suggests that REDD could offer a financially realistic lifeline for Kalimantan's threatened mammals if it is included in future climate agreements.

TI  - Silvicultural performance of Plathymenia reticulata with phosphorous addition in Forest Atlantic, Brazil
T2  - MADERA Y BOSQUES
AB  - The objective of this study was to analyse the initial medium-term growth of a P. reticulata settlement under different phosphorus doses. The experiment was carried out in an area of Atlantic Forest, Sooretama, Northern Espirito Santo State, Brazil. Five doses of P per each tree (0 g, 27 g, 47 g, 67 g and 87 g) were tested in a randomized block design with three replicates and 18 plants per plot. At 3 months, 9 months and 15 months, height and diameter were measured at the soil level. At 36 months height, diameter at breast height, survival, basal area, and nutritional evaluation of the trees were measured. A logistic model was also used to model the growth in height of individual trees and a logistic model considering fixed effects and mixed form (fixed and random effects), in order to verify if the inclusion of the random effect (tree) would result in gains in terms of accuracy in the estimation of the future height of P. reticulata trees. The species presents potential for use in reforestation programs under edaphoclimatic conditions tested and under similar conditions. The species was not very demanding in P, and the addition of this nutrient promotes negative effects on its growth in the short and medium term. Regarding the model of growth in height, the logistic model adjusted in the mixed form showed to be superior to the traditional adjustment.

TI  - Comparison of water-use characteristics of tropical tree saplings with implications for forest restoration
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Tropical forests are experiencing reduced productivity and will need restoration with suitable species. Knowledge of species-specific responses to changing environments during early stage can help identify the appropriate species for sustainable planting. Hence, we investigated the variability in whole-tree canopy conductance and transpiration (G(t) and E-L) in potted saplings of common urban species in Thailand, viz., Pterocarpus indicus, Lagerstroemia speciosa, and Swietenia macrophylla, across wet and dry seasons in 2017-2018. Using a Bayesian modeling framework, G(t) and E-L were estimated from sap flux density, informed by the soil, atmospheric and tree measurements. Subsequently, we evaluated their variations with changing vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and soil moisture across timescales and season. We found that G(t) and E-L were higher and highly variable in L. speciosa across seasons than S. macrophylla and P. indicus. Our results implied that water-use in these species was sensitive to seasonal VPD. L. speciosa may be suitable under future climate variability, given its higher G(t) and E-L across atmospheric and soil moisture conditions. With their lower G(t) and E-L, P. indicus and S. macrophylla may photosynthesize throughout the year, maintaining their stomatal opening even under high VPD. These findings benefit reforestation and reclamation programs of degraded lands.

TI  - Soil greenhouse gas fluxes from tropical coastal wetlands and alternative agricultural land uses
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - Coastal wetlands are essential for regulating the global carbon budget through soil carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas (GHG - CO2, CH4, and N2O) fluxes. The conversion of coastal wetlands to agricultural land alters these fluxes' magnitude and direction (uptake/release). However, the extent and drivers of change of GHG fluxes are still unknown for many tropical regions. We measured soil GHG fluxes from three natural coastal wetlands - mangroves, salt marsh, and freshwater tidal forests - and two alternative agricultural land uses - sugarcane farming and pastures for cattle grazing (ponded and dry conditions). We assessed variations throughout different climatic conditions (dry-cool, dry-hot, and wet-hot) within 2 years of measurements (2018-2020) in tropical Australia. The wet pasture had by far the highest CH4 emissions with 1231 +/- 386 mgm(-2) d(-1), which were 200-fold higher than any other site. Dry pastures and sugarcane were the highest emitters of N2O with 55 +/- 9 mgm(-2) d(-1) (wet-hot period) and 11 +/- 3 mgm(-2) d(-1) (hot-dry period, coinciding with fertilisation), respectively. Dry pastures were also the highest emitters of CO2 with 20 +/- 1 gm(-2) d(-1) (wet-hot period). The three coastal wetlands measured had lower emissions, with salt marsh uptake of -0.55 +/- 0.23 and -1.19 +/- 0.08 gm(-2) d(-1) of N2O and CO2, respectively, during the dry-hot period. During the sampled period, sugarcane and pastures had higher total cumulative soil GHG emissions (CH4 C N2O) of 7142 and 56 124CO(2-eq) kg ha(-1) yr(-1) compared to coastal wetlands with 144 to 884CO(2-eq) kg ha(-1) yr(-1) (where CO2-eq is CO2 equivalent). Restoring unproductive sugarcane land or pastures (especially ponded ones) to coastal wetlands could provide significant GHG mitigation.

TI  - The global exposure of species ranges and protected areas to forest management
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
AB  - Aim Many vertebrate species globally are dependent on forests, most of which require active protection to safeguard global biodiversity. Forests, however, are increasingly either being disturbed, planted or managed in the form of timber or food plantations. Because of a lack of spatial data, forest management has commonly been ignored in previous conservation assessments. Location Global. Methods We combine a new global map of forest management types created solely from remote sensing imagery with spatially explicit information on the distribution of forest-associated vertebrate species and protected areas globally. Using Bayesian logistic regressions, we explore whether the amount of forested habitat available to a species as well as information on species-specific threats can explain differences in IUCN extinction risk categories. Results We show that disturbed and human-managed forests dominate the distributional ranges of most forest-associated species. Species considered as non-threatened had on average larger amounts of non-managed forests within their range. A greater amount of planted forests did not decrease the probability of species being threatened by extinction. Even more worrying, protected areas are increasingly being established in areas dominated by disturbed forests. Conclusion Our results imply that species extinction risk and habitat assessments might have been overly optimistic with forest management practices being largely ignored so far. With forest restoration being at the centre of climate and conservation policies in this decade, we caution that policy makers should explicitly consider forest management in global and regional assessments.

TI  - Similarity analysis of Cedrela sp trees under different growth conditions in eastern state of Acre, Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
AB  - The biodiversity of tropical forests depends on certain level of environmental disturbances, such as the natural fall of trees providing clearings, seed germination, growth and development of plants that environment. On the other hand, forest management intervenes in this natural cycle, by removing larger trees of the species which are of great commercial value. However, little is known about natural growth and regeneration of the. hundreds of tropical species; and this constitutes a gap and obstacle to the implementation of sustainable forest management, by permitting the maintenance of biodiversity. In this regard, this study aims to determine the age and growth periodicity of stem of native Cedrela sp. trees in-Acre under different growth conditions (sites and microsites) to provide subsidies to sustainable forest management in this region. Trees of Cedrela sp were selected at three sites: Experimental Reserve Catuaba (REC) (three microsites), Farm Sao Jorge (FSJ) Zoobotanic Park (PZ). Wood samples were collected at DBH of the trunk for the dendrochronological analysis. This was followed by the demarcation, counting and measuring the width of growth rings. Next, the Cofecha program was used for the quality control of the series of growth rings. Using the parameters: number, average width of the growth ring, standard deviation and the DBH of the tree stems, a similarity of trees Cedrela sp. in site and microsites was observed by multivariate statistical analysis Different growth conditions (sites and environments) significantly affected the radial growth of trees Cedrela sp, demonstrating the potential of dendrochronology as a tool for forest Management.

TI  - Germplasm movement zones of eight forest species and future projections in the face of climate change in the Southeast of Mexico
T2  - NEW FORESTS
AB  - Germplasm is required to meet the needs of national and international forest restoration programs. Delimitation of germplasm movement zones is an effective tool to address problems of maladaptation of these materials but, in Mexico, the current delimitation of seed movement zones defines very heterogeneous areas while the availability of reliable information of the current distribution of species remains insufficient. This study expands and updates the information regarding the potential distribution of eight forest species: Brosimum alicastrum, Bursera simaruba, Cedrela odorata, Cordia alliodora, Cordia dodecandra, Ochroma pyramidale, Swietenia macrophylla, and Tabebuia rosea, and redefines the germplasm movement zones in seven states of southeastern Mexico, evaluating future changes in the climatic conditions for the time horizons of 2030 and 2060 by combining species distribution modeling techniques and delimitation of germplasm movement zones. Four of the eight predictive variables used in the model construction were determinant in the distribution of all eight species. The germplasm movement zones presented in the Mexican norms and those obtained in the present study differ. The zones of the existing standard are larger and each covers several of the climatic zones proposed in this study, producing seed movement in areas with greater climatic differences. The results suggest a tendency towards an increase in the Refheldt's aridity index of 2.6 by the year 2060 and of 1.8 degrees C in the mean temperature of the coldest month, as well as a contraction in the potential distributions of seven of the eight species analyzed over the period 2021-2040.

TI  - Forest strata-dependent functional evenness explains whole-community aboveground biomass through opposing mechanisms
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - A positive biodiversity - aboveground biomass relationship is often attributed to the niche complementarity hypothesis. This hypothesis has received much less support when based on functional trait diversity and when tested in complex natural forests. Here, we hypothesized that niche complementarity (high trait diversity) in the understorey and niche overlap (low trait diversity) in the overstorey would drive whole-community aboveground biomass. To test this hypothesis, we used multiple linear regression models to evaluate how functional trait diversity (functional richness, evenness, divergence and dispersion) of overstorey, understorey, and whole community determine aboveground biomass across 125 plots in a 5-ha subtropical forest of Eastern China. A structural equation model was used to evaluate whether the functional trait diversity of overstorey affects the relationships between understorey functional trait diversity and whole-community aboveground biomass while considering for the effect of environmental factors. We additionally considered the effects of mass ratio (i.e. community-weighted mean of trait values) and stand structural complexity. The strong negative effect of overstorey functional evenness on aboveground biomass provides support to the functional dominance and/or niche overlap rather than niche complementarity effect. The negative effect of overstorey functional evenness on aboveground biomass was also partially mediated by its direct negative effect on understorey functional evenness. The weak positive effect of understorey functional evenness on aboveground biomass provides support to the niche complementarity effect. We conclude that functional evenness of overstorey and understorey strata affect whole-community aboveground biomass differently through opposing mechanisms, regardless of the effects of mass ratio and stand structural complexity.

TI  - Demographic analysis of Agave angustifolia (Agavaceae) with an emphasis on ecological restoration
T2  - BOTANICAL SCIENCES
AB  - We studied the demography of two populations of Agave angustifolia, one in a preserved tropical dry forest (Xochicalco), and the other one in a pastureland area used for cattle grazing (Tembembe), to test whether populations are likely to thrive on the deteriorated habitats left after cattle ranching. Seed germination and seedling survival experiments were carried out in different natural microsites (i.e. under tree canopies and in open microsites). We built Lefkovitch matrices and carried out prospective (elasticity) and retrospective (Life Table Response Experiments) analyses for both populations. Numerical simulations were performed to project the effect of inflorescences harvest and seedling introduction. Seedling survival and seed germination were highest in Tembembe. Population growth rate was slightly higher in Tembembe (lambda = 1.268) than in Xochicalco (lambda = 1.208). Prospective and retrospective analyses showed that stasis and growth contributed most to population growth rate and that the differences between the two populations were accounted for a lower fecundity and stasis in Xochicalco compared to Tembembe. Simulations of inflorescence harvest showed that lambda dropped below unity only when all inflorescences were eliminated. The simulated introduction of seedlings produced a substantial rise in lambda. As the lambda values reflect thriving populations at both sites, we suggest that this species could be successfully used in restoration programs.

TI  - The forest strata-dependent relationship between biodiversity and aboveground biomass within a subtropical forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The relationships between biodiversity and aboveground biomass in forest ecosystems have been intensively studied in recent decades. Still, the mechanisms that underlie it remain highly debated. We hypothesized that overstorey species diversity and individual tree size variation contribute to aboveground biomass and understorey species diversity through the niche complementarity effect, while weaken the relationship between understorey aboveground biomass and individual tree size variation due to the mixed effects of tree development, biotic interaction and reduced available resources by over storey strata. The integrative relationships of species diversity and tree size variation (variation in diameter at breast height-DBH) with aboveground biomass were analysed at overstorey and understorey strata across 125 plots in a 5-ha subtropical forest in Eastern China. For comparison, we tested these relationships at individual strata (isolation modelling), and whole-community level, by using linear structural equation model while accounting for the effects of soil nutrients. The integrative modelling accounted for 35, 31, 16, 12, 4, and 0% of the variation in understorey aboveground biomass, overstorey aboveground biomass, overstorey DBH variation, overstorey species diversity, understorey species diversity, and understorey DBH variation, respectively. Overstorey DBH variation and species diversity had the positive direct effects on overstorey aboveground biomass. Overstorey species diversity significantly promoted the understorey species diversity, but DBH variation and aboveground biomass of overstorey strata had negligible effects on the diversity and aboveground biomass of understorey strata. Soil nutrients had positive direct effect on overstorey DBH variation, but negative direct effects on overstorey and understorey aboveground biomass and overstorey species diversity. These results provide strong evidence for the niche complementarity effect for driving positive relationships of species diversity and individual tree size variation with aboveground biomass at overstorey strata. The strong and consistent negative effects of soil nutrients on overstorey aboveground biomass and species diversity suggest an important mechanism that high species diversity of overstorey strata with great tree size variation on nutrient-poor soils is crucial for driving high aboveground biomass in subtropical forest ecosystems. In conclusion, this study suggests that no sole and ubiquitous relationship between biodiversity and aboveground biomass exists in a structurally complex forest, but rather that the magnitude and direction of this relationship is greatly dependent on the forest strata where available resources shift substantially. We argue that ecological models for predicting aboveground biomass would be improved by including separate effects of overstorey and understorey diversity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Light availability, soil phosphorus and different nitrogen forms negatively affect the functional diversity of subtropical forests
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Understanding the relationship between functional diversity (FD) and species diversity changes and the effects of environmental factors on FD during succession is useful to improve forest management, conservation and restoration strategies. In this study, we measured 9 environmental factors related to light availability, soil water content and nutrients, and 19 leaf functional traits related to leaf light and nutrient utilization, growth and defense, water-use efficiency, and leaf respiration strategies in the dominant species during subtropical forest succession in southern China. Logarithmic function analysis and linear mixed model were used to explore the relationships between FD and species diversity and between FD and environmental factors. The results showed that FD and species diversity were not linearly correlated during succession. The light availability (represented by leaf area index), soil phosphorus, and different nitrogen forms were negatively related to the FD, suggesting these factors were the main environmental factors affecting FD during succession in the subtropical forest. By dividing FD into components corresponding to the diversity of different plant strategies, this study improves our understanding of the roles of light availability and soil nutrients in plant community functional structure, and provides useful information for forest conservation and restoration.

TI  - Effectiveness of Africa's tropical protected areas for maintaining forest cover
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - The effectiveness of parks for forest conservation is widely debated in Africa, where increasing human pressure, insufficient funding, and lack of management capacity frequently place significant demands on forests. Tropical forests house a substantial portion of the world's remaining biodiversity and are heavily affected by anthropogenic activity. We analyzed park effectiveness at the individual (224 parks) and national (23 countries) level across Africa by comparing the extent of forest loss (as a proxy for deforestation) inside parks to matched unprotected control sites. Although significant geographical variation existed among parks, the majority of African parks had significantly less forest loss within their boundaries (e.g., Mahale Park had 34 times less forest loss within its boundary) than control sites. Accessibility was a significant driver of forest loss. Relatively inaccessible areas had a higher probability (odds ratio >1, p<0.001) of forest loss but only in ineffective parks, and relatively accessible areas had a higher probability of forest loss but only in effective parks. Smaller parks less effectively prevented forest loss inside park boundaries than larger parks (T = -2.32, p<0.05), and older parks less effectively prevented forest loss inside park boundaries than younger parks (F-2,F-154 = -4.11, p<0.001). Our analyses, the first individual and national assessment of park effectiveness across Africa, demonstrated the complexity of factors (such as geographical variation, accessibility, and park size and age) influencing the ability of a park to curb forest loss within its boundaries.

TI  - Variation of soil fertility and carbon sequestration by planting Hevea brasiliensis in Hainan Island, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB  - The development of rubber industry depends on the sustainable management of rubber plantation. To evaluate the environmental effects of planting Hevea brasiliensis on a subsystem of tropical forest ecosystem, the variation of soil. fertility and carbon sequestration under rubber plantation within 30-year life period were investigated in Hainan Island. Results showed that (1) with the increase of stand age of rubber plantation, soil fertility decreased all along. From 1954 to 1995, soil organic matter, total N, available K and available P decreased by 48.2%, 54.1%, 56.7% and 64.1%, respectively. (2) If the complete return of litters was considered without additional fertilizer application to the soil of the rubber plantations, the consumption periods for P, N, K, Mg were only 825 years, 329 years, 94 years and 65 years, respectively. To improve soil fertility is essential for rubber plantation development. (3) The C sequestration of rubber trees per hectare accounts for 272.08 t within 30-year life period and 57.91% of them was fixed in litters. In comparison with C sequestration by rain forest (234.305 t/hm(2)) and by secondary rain forest (150.203 t/hm(2)), rubber forest has more potentials for C fixation. On the base of above results, the following measures would benefit the maintenance of soil fertility and the development of rubber industry, including applying fertilizer to maintain the balance of soil nutrients, intercropping leguminous plant to improve soil fertility, reducing the collection of litters, optimizing soil properties to improve element P availability such as applying CaCO3. The information gathered from the study can be used as baseline data for the sustainable management of rubber plantation elsewhere.

TI  - Asymmetric forest transition driven by the interaction of socioeconomic development and environmental heterogeneity in Central America
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Forest transitions (FT) have been observed in many developed countries and more recently in the developing world. However, our knowledge of FT from tropical regions is mostly derived from case studies from within a particular country, making it difficult to generalize findings across larger regions. Here we overcome these difficulties by conducting a recent (2001-2010) satellite-based analysis of trends in forest cover across Central America, stratified by biomes, which we related to socioeconomic variables associated with human development. Results show a net decrease of woody vegetation resulting from 12,201 km(2) of deforestation of moist forests and 6,825 km(2) of regrowth of conifer and dry forests. The Human Development Index was the socioeconomic variable best associated with forest cover change. The least-developed countries, Nicaragua and Guatemala, experienced both rapid deforestation of moist forests and significant recovery of conifer and dry forests. In contrast, the most developed countries, Panama and Costa Rica, had net woody vegetation gain and a more stable forest cover configuration. These results imply a good agreement with FT predictions of forest change in relation to socioeconomic development, but strong asymmetry in rates and directions of change largely dependent upon the biome where change is occurring. The FT model should be refined by incorporating ecological and socioeconomic heterogeneity, particularly in multicountry and regional studies. These asymmetric patterns of forest change should be evaluated when developing strategies for conserving biodiversity and environmental services.

TI  - Traits of the host trees, not community diversity, drive epiphytes abundance in tropical seasonal forests
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - Epiphytes are considered indicators of forest ecological integrity, but the factors that explain their abundance are still not well understood. We here evaluated tree colonization by epiphytes in old-growth monospecific reforestation stands of Astronium urundeuva (M.Allem & atilde;o) Engl. (Anacardiaceae) and Eucalyptus saligna Sm. (Myrtaceae), in comparison to a neighbor seasonal tropical forest fragment under similar environmental conditions. In each forest type, we identified and measured all trees (planted and colonizers) from 5 -cm stem diameter in five 200 m 2 plots and quantified all vascular epiphytes per tree. Tree species were categorized by bark roughness, canopy deciduousness and growth rate. The abundance of epiphytes and the frequency of host trees were higher in the A. urundeuva plantation than in the native forest, with the E. saligna stand in an intermediate position. Also, we found that host traits influenced the abundance of epiphytes in their trunks. Host trees had average stem perimeter and height both higher than non-hosts, which indicates that colonization is more likely to occur in older trees. The average abundance of epiphytes per tree was higher in species with rough bark, but no relationship was found with canopy deciduousness or tree growth rate. We evidenced, therefore, that forest plantations, even if monospecific, can provide habitat for epiphytes. However, at community level, colonization success, either in native or restored forest, depends on the relative abundance of species whose bark type favors epiphytes establishment.

TI  - Diversity, distribution and resource values of woody climbers in tropical forests of southern Eastern Ghats, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
AB  - We investigated the distribution and resource values of liana species assessed in six hill complexes of southern Eastern Ghats, India. 143 liana species (DBH (diameter at breast height) >= 1.5 cm) and 32,033 liana individuals were recorded from 110 transects (0.5 ha each covering 55 ha area) in the study sites. The resource values of lianas were broadly categorized into ecological and economic importance. About 90% (129) of liana species and 96% (30,564) of liana individuals were established ecological/economic values. Fruit rewards provided by 76 species and 20,325 individuals constituted the major resource of ecological importance. 82 species and 21,457 liana individuals are of economic importance as medicine, edible fruits, edible and medicinal values, and yet others are used for different domestic purposes including furniture, fuel wood, rope making etc.. Ecologically, the prevalence of succulent diaspores in lianas of Indian Eastern Ghats indicates the animal dependence of many liana species for dispersal and underlines the need for a holistic and whole-forest conservation approach in maintaining forest biodiversity.

TI  - Geomorphological landscape features explain floristic patterns in French Guiana rainforest
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Geomorphic landscape features have been suggested as indicators of forest diversity. However, their explanatory power has not yet been explicitly tested at a regional scale in tropical rainforest. We used forest inventories conducted according to a stratified sampling design (3,132 plots in 111 transects at 33 sites) and holistic multi-scale geomorphological mapping derived from a Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model to describe and explain spatial patterns in floristic composition across French Guiana (80,000 km(2)). We measured and identified 123,906 trees with DBH a parts per thousand yen20 cm and used constrained and unconstrained ordinations to analyze variations in the abundance of 221 taxa and 51 families. Variance partitioning and variograms were used to detect spatial patterns in species composition, compare the explanatory power of spatial and environmental factors, and select the variables that best explain forest composition. Strong floristic patterns corresponded to a major latitudinal gradient and significant sub-regional floristic structure. Geomorphological landscapes shaped by historic climate fluctuations and major geological events successfully captured these patterns and explained the variation in abundance of 80 taxa, corresponding to 65 % of the inventoried trees. Our findings suggest that long-term forest dynamics are under substantial "geomorphographic control". A geomorphological perspective on landscapes that incorporates current and past environmental filters and historical biogeographical processes could thus be used more systematically in tropical regions for regional planning and forest conservation.

TI  - Long-term stability of sapling dynamics is regulated by soil phosphorus availability in subtropical forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - The abiotic and biotic factors that regulate stability in species-rich forests are poorly resolved, and this limits the ability to predict how climate change and other perturbations impact forest dynamics. Phosphorus limitation and nitrogen deposition are important factors affecting the dynamics and functioning of tropical and subtropical forests, but how long-term temporal stability of tree communities is affected by availability and heterogeneity of soil phosphorus and nitrogen remains unclear.We collected annual dynamic data of 20,768 regenerating saplings, which were censused from 2008 to 2019 in a subtropical forest, to investigate how soil nutrients affect the temporal stability of productivity at both population and community levels.We found that concentrations of soil inorganic phosphorus were significantly and positively correlated with sapling richness and phylogenetic diversity, leading to significantly higher species asynchrony and community temporal stability. By contrast, higher concentrations of organic phosphorus weakened community stability via a negative effect on species richness. Structural equation models provide further strong evidence that increasing concentrations of soil inorganic phosphorus strongly promoted community temporal stability via increased species diversity, species asynchrony and population stability, while organic phosphorus displayed opposite effects. Meanwhile, soil concentrations of available and unavailable forms of nitrogen showed much weaker and negative associations with community stability.Synthesis. Using a 12-year data set of sapling demography from a subtropical forest of south China, our study demonstrates that soil phosphorus is an important determinant of the long-term stability of sapling dynamics and consequently the whole-community structure, and the composition of soil phosphorus pools predicts the temporal stability and diversity of tree communities in phosphorus-limited forests.
   Using a 12-year field monitoring on the demography of over 20,000 individual seedlings in a subtropical forest, this study demonstrates that soil phosphorus availability is an important determinant of the long-term stability of sapling dynamics and consequently the whole-community structure, which highlights the importance of considering different forms of soil nutrients when predicting the temporal stability and diversity of tree communities.image

TI  - Alterations in Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Community Along a Chronosequence of Teak (Tectona grandis) Plantations in Tropical Forests of China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi play a crucial role in promoting plant growth, enhancing plant stress resistance, and sustaining a healthy ecosystem. However, little is known about the mycorrhizal status of teak plantations. Here, we evaluated how the AM fungal communities of rhizosphere soils and roots respond to different stand ages of teak: 22, 35, 45, and 55-year-old from the adjacent native grassland (CK). A high-throughput sequencing method was used to compare the differences in soil and root AM fungal community structures. In combination with soil parameters, mechanisms driving the AM fungal community were revealed by redundancy analysis and the Mantel test. Additionally, spore density and colonization rates were analyzed. With increasing stand age, the AM fungal colonization rates and spore density increased linearly. Catalase activity and ammonium nitrogen content also increased, and soil organic carbon, total phosphorous, acid phosphatase activity, available potassium, and available phosphorus first increased and then decreased. Stand age significantly changed the structure of the AM fungal community but had no significant impact on the diversity of the AM fungal community. However, the diversity of the AM fungal community in soils was statistically higher than that in the roots. In total, nine and seven AM fungal genera were detected in the soil and root samples, respectively. The majority of sequences in soils and roots belonged to Glomus. Age-induced changes in soil properties could largely explain the alterations in the structure of the AM fungal community along a chronosequence, which included total potassium, carbon-nitrogen ratio, ammonium nitrogen, catalase, and acid phosphatase levels in soils and catalase, acid phosphatase, pH, and total potassium levels in roots. Soil nutrient availability and enzyme activity were the main driving factors regulating the shift in the AM fungal community structure along a chronosequence of the teak plantations.

TI  - Spatial and temporal analyses of burned areas 1998, 2003 and 2015 in Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve, Chiapas, Mexico
T2  - BOSQUE
AB  - In southeastern Mexico, forest fires threaten the biodiversity in tropical rainforests. The aim of this work was to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of burned areas in Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve and its area of influence over three years: 1998, 2003 and 2015. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and the Burnt Area Index for MODIS (BAIM) were extracted from near-infrared and shortwave-infrared Landsat imagery; their accuracy was validated with ASTER images. As a result, 1,628 polygons of burned areas larger than 10 ha were delimited, covering 86,500 ha and representing 11.2 % of the study area: 7.7 % in 1998, 3.2 % in 2003 and 0.4 % in 2015. Burned areas of under 50 ha are of common occurrence each year, whereas the largest polygons (1,000 - 3,000 ha) are considered exceptional and are present only under the severe influence of El Nino weather phenomenon. The highest proportion of burned areas (54.7 %) affected agricultural lands, followed by secondary vegetation (34 %), tropical forests (7.6 %), temperate forests (2.1 %), savannah (1 %) and tular marshlands (0.6 %). Regarding burned areas, 20 % occurred within the protected area. The decreasing tendency of burned areas confirms their relationship with the intensity of ENSO. Cartographic representation of burned areas is an effective means of evaluating the effects of fire management programs and biodiversity conservation of tropical rainforests in protected areas.

TI  - Green deserts, but not always: A global synthesis of native woody species regeneration under tropical tree monocultures
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Tree monocultures constitute an increasing fraction of the global tree cover and are the dominant tree-growing strategy of forest landscape restoration commitments. Their advantages to produce timber are well known, but their value for biodiversity is highly controversial and context dependent. Therefore, understanding whether, and in which conditions, they can harbor native species regeneration is crucial. Here, we conducted meta-analyses based on a global survey of the literature and on a database created with local, unpublished studies throughout Brazil to evaluate the regeneration potential of native species under tree monocultures and the way management influences this regeneration. Native woody species regeneration under tree monocultures harbors a substantial fraction of the diversity (on average 40% and 68% in the global and Brazilian surveys, respectively) and abundance (on average 25% and 60% in the global and Brazilian surveys, respectively) of regeneration observed in natural forests. Plantations with longer rotation lengths, composed of native tree species, and located adjacent to forest remnants harbor more species. Pine plantations harbor more native individuals than eucalypt plantations, and the abundance of regenerating trees is higher in sites with higher mean temperatures. Species-area curves revealed that the number of woody species under pine and eucalypt plantations in Brazil is 606 and 598 species, respectively, over an aggregated sampled area of ca. 12 ha. We highlight that the understory of tree monocultures can harbor a considerable diversity of regenerating native species at the landscape and regional scales, but this diversity strongly depends on management. Long-rotation length and favorable location are key factors for woody regeneration success under tropical tree monocultures. Therefore, tree monocultures can play a role in forest landscape restoration and conservation, but only if they are planned and managed for achieving this purpose.
   In this study, we assessed the woody natural regeneration under tree monocultures reported in studies conducted in the tropical region. We found out that native tree monocultures, tree plantations adjacent to forest remnants, and longer rotation lengths harbor more species, while the abundance of regenerating trees is higher in sites with higher mean temperatures. According to our results, tree monocultures can play a role in forest landscape restoration and conservation, but only if they are planned and managed for achieving this purpose.image

TI  - Evaluating the Role of Community-Managed Forest in Carbon Sequestration and Climate Change Mitigation of Tripura, India
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB  - Community-based forest management provides an opportunity to build a sustainable link with ecology for meeting future needs. A study was carried out to understand the effect of management strategies on the biodiversity, soil nutrient, and carbon stock of two community forests practiced by Jamatia (JCF) and Halam (HCF) tribes of Tripura, northeast India. The forest managed by Jamatia is community conserved, whereas the Joint Forest Management (JFM) regulation issued by the Government of India was implemented in Halam community-based forest. JCF showed higher tree diversity (2.741) than HCF (2.176), while there was no significant variation in the total number of species in these forests. Anogeissus acuminata, Schima wallichii, and Terminalia bellirica were the most dominant species in JCF and HCF. A relatively higher amount of organic matter, nitrogen, and phosphorus content was found in JCF soils. JCF showed higher carbon stock (342.9 Mg C ha(-1)) than HCF (158.7 Mg C ha(-1)). A positive and significant correlation of SOC concentration was observed with soil moisture, SOM, and soil nutrient content. The results show that both stands were at developmental stages; however, regular extraction of biomass from HCF was attributable to lower carbon stock. We found that the Jamatia communities are proactively involved in the conservation of forests and sustainable management of biodiversity under their control. The results reveal that the agent of management can play a vital role in enhancing tree diversity, soil properties, and carbon stock in community forests.

TI  - Stand dynamics, nitrogen accumulation, and symbiotic nitrogen fixation in regenerating stands of Acacia koa
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Recently, abandonment of montane cattle pastures in Hawaii has stimulated interest in forest restoration both for expansion of habitat for native species and for plantation forestry. Acacia koa is one of the most common forest trees in Hawaii, the most abundant native legume, and the most economically valuable native tree; it could be important to restoration efforts in many areas.
   Using an age sequence of even-aged, 6- to 20-yr-old stands of A. koa, we evaluated stand characteristics, N accumulation, and rates of N fixation. Average diameter at breast height (dbh) and height increased linearly during the first 20 yr of tree growth, while stem density, dbh increment. and leaf area index declined. An experimental thinning in the 9-yr-old stand more than doubled dbh increment, suggesting that high tree densities could constrain tree growth. In contrast. N fertilization did not affect dbh increment. Nodule biomass was more than an order of magnitude less in the 20-yr-old stand than in the 6-yr-old stand, which corresponded to a similar decline in estimated input of N via fixation. Neither thinning nor N fertilization affected nodule biomass, but measurements of foliar and root phosphorus (P) suggest that a decline in P availability over time may have contributed to the decline in N fixation. In these stands, large amounts of decomposing litter remaining from stand establishment may have provided much of the N that accumulated in koa biomass. In more degraded sites. N fixation by A. koa may play a relatively more important role in restoration and in soil and ecosystem development.

TI  - Mining in the Amazon: Importance, impacts, and challenges to restore degraded ecosystems. Are we on the right way?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Mining is one of the main economic activities in the Amazon region, contributing substantially to the economy of countries that share its territory. This activity, however, brings environmental aftermaths as vegetation suppression, soil destruction, hydrological instability, and faunal displacement, making restoration of degraded ecosystems a challenge. In this sense, the objective of our study was to present the economic importance, the main restoration methods, and the bottlenecks to obtain successful restoration trajectories in degraded areas by industrial mining in the Amazon. We listed eight possible relevant procedures for successful restoration after mining and discussed worldwide adopted restoration methods such as seedling planting, inducing natural regeneration, hydroseeding, and nucleation. Despite the great development of restoration methods after mining, there are still barriers to obtain inputs, which include seedlings, and qualified labor to plan and develop restoration projects. These issues come in addition to operational restrictions, technical incapacity, deficient or inflexible legal basis, and lack of law enforcement. We suggest the selection of key species for planting, associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and biochar, establishment of lists with ecological indicators and reference values, usage of organic waste, and monitoring through unmanned aerial vehicles with high sensors resolution to correct revegetation failures and estimate aboveground biomass and carbon.

TI  - Landscape assessment of tree communities in the northern karst region of Puerto Rico
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
AB  - The northern karst of Puerto Rico is a unique formation that contains one of the island's largest remaining forested tracts. The region is under ever-increasing human pressure, but large portions of it are being considered for conservation. Forest classification of the region is at a coarse scale, such that it is considered one vegetation type. We asked whether there were distinct tree assemblages which would necessitate targeted conservation strategies to ensure their protection. We examined tree species and communities across the region at three different major topographic positions along mogotes, or haystack-shaped hills. We found distinct tree communities on hilltops and valleys, with significantly more non-native species in valleys and significantly more endemic species on hilltops and hillsides. At a landscape level, we identified at least four different communities within each topographic position. Two mogote top communities were separated geographically (west and south) within the region, while two others co-occurred in the east-central part of the region. Mogote side and valley communities were less distinct geographically. Temperature, elevation, and precipitation were important variables in separating some communities, suggesting that abiotic stress may play an important role in the distribution of some species. In contrast, the lack of geographic separations of other communities suggested that variables such as soil conditions, land use and biotic interactions such as dispersal limitation may also be important. Conservation planning strategies should target the south, west, and east-central areas that harbor distinct mogote top plant communities to ensure protection of the widest range of tree species and communities in the karst region.

TI  - Eucalyptus PLANTATION BENEFITS TO PATCH SIZE AND SHAPE OF FORESTED AREAS IN SOUTHEAST ATLANTIC FOREST
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
AB  - The adoption of mixed plantation systems (exotic and native species) is viable and represents an important alternative in the context of forest and landscape restoration. This study evaluated whether Eucalyptus cultivation is associated with changes in native forest cover and fragment connectivity in the region from 1987 to 2017. The study region (Southeast Atlantic Forest) has been undergoing a forest transition process. Based on land use/land cover maps obtained from satellite images and a pair-wise comparison, it was detected that the dynamics in one land cover were not necessarily associated with the other one. It was verified an increase in Eucalyptus cover since 2007, possibly related to the New Forest Code that allows the use of exotic species in reforestation, provided it does not exceed 50% of the total area. An increase in the native vegetation cover was also observed, highlighting the importance of restoration actions and national regulations. In addition, forest patches were larger and less complex with Eucalyptus presence, indicating that this land cover is potentially beneficial for the landscape connectivity.

TI  - The diversity and abundance of ants in relation to forest disturbance and plantation establishment in southern Cameroon
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Tropical biodiversity is seriously threatened by deforestation but few studies have quantified its impact. We aimed to measure the impact of forest clearance and different methods of establishing Terminalia Norensis (Combretaceae) forest plantations on the abundance, richness and composition of ants. the most abundant group of arthropods in tropical forest canopies, in the Mblamayo Forest Reserve in Cameroon. For canopy ants, we quantified the effects of different methods of plantation establishment by sampling two sets of plots subjected to complete clearance, partial mechanical clearance and partial manual clearance relative to uncleared forest reference plots. For leaf-litter ants, we quantified the impacts of different levels of forest disturbance along a gradient from near primary forest to complete forest clearance.
   2. A total of 97 ant species was recorded from the canopy (from approximately 48 500 individuals), at an average of 213 (+/-45) ants m(-2). Jack-knife estimates of species richness showed that at one site. Bilik. 87% more species occurred in the partial manual clearance plot than the complete clearance plot, with the partial mechanical clearance plot intermediate. At the other site. Ebogo, ant richness did not vary between treatments. Ants were 20 times more abundant in the partial manual clearance plot in Ebogo than the partial manual clearance plot in Bilik, largely due to a numerous Technomyrmex species that might have reduced ant richness on this plot.
   3. Cluster analysis of the similarities in ant species composition between plots, calculated by the Morisita index, showed that site and treatment affected species composition. Neither treatment nor site affected the relative number of species in different nesting categories.
   4. A total of I I I ant species (from 3650 individuals) was recorded from the leaf litter, at an average of 52 (+/-4.6) ants m(-2). Species numbers were greatest in the two partial clearance plots in Ebogo (52-53 species), lowest in the two complete clearance plots (37), and intermediate and most variable in the three uncleared forest plots (40-52). Cluster analysis showed that species composition was not affected by treatment, while neither treatment nor site affected the relative number of ant species in different feeding categories.
   5. Despite some local effects by dominant species, our results support the view that deforestation can reduce arthropod species richness. This study is unique in showing that reforestation methods (using a single tree species) can have a marked effect on arthropod species richness and composition. Specifically, it reveals that ant species richness can be greater in plantations established after partial manual clearance than complete clearance.

TI  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Derived Canopy Gaps in the Old-Growth Beech Forest of Mount Pollinello (Italy): Preliminary Results
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ITS APPLICATIONS, ICCSA 2021, PT VII
CP  - 21st International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications (ICCSA)
AB  - Forest canopy gaps caused by natural disturbances represent the primary driver of forest regeneration dynamics, modifying several ecological factors such as the light environment within an ecosystem. Canopy openings constantly change the shape and structure of forests as well as tree species diversity. The analysis of forest canopy gap spatial patterns in old-growth forests can provide helpful information for their conservation. Moreover, it can be an important reference for outlining sustainable forest management to restore and maintain the original biodiversity and accelerate forest succession towards old-growth characteristics. The main goal of this research was to assess a first forest gap size distribution and analyze their spatial pattern in an old-growth beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest in the Pollino National Park (Italy) strict reserve, with no human influence in at least the past 70 years due to its remote location. Using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based canopy height model (CHM), we detected and classified 196 canopy gaps ranging from 10 to 343 m(2). The gap size-frequency reflected a power-law distribution. Using second-order statistics, following the K and L Ripley's function, we found that the canopy gaps were spatially clustered distributed. These preliminary results show the predominance of small-scale disturbances, confirmed by the spatial structure analyses highlighting the single tree nature of these processes influenced by site-specific conditions.

TI  - Assessment of Above-Ground Biomass in Pakistan Forest Ecosystem's Carbon Pool: A Review
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Climate change is acknowledged as a global threat to the environment and human well-being. Forest ecosystems are a significant factor in this regard as they act both as a sink and a source of carbon. Forest carbon evaluation has received more attention after the Paris Agreement. Pakistan has 5.1% forest cover of its total land area, which comprises nine forest types. This study covers the studies conducted on above-ground biomass and carbon stock in various forest types of Pakistan. Most of the studies on biomass and carbon stock estimation have been conducted during 2015-2020. The non-destructive method is mostly followed for carbon stock estimation, followed by remote sensing. The destructive method is used only for developing allometric equations and biomass expansion factors. The information available on the carbon stock and biomass of Pakistan forest types is fragmented and sporadic. Coniferous forests are more important in carbon sequestration and can play a vital role in mitigating climate change. Pakistan is a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol and still lacks regional and national level studies on biomass and carbon stock, which are necessary for reporting under the Kyoto Protocol. This study will help researchers and decision-makers to develop policies regarding Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+), conservation, sustainable forest management and enhancement of forest carbon stocks

TI  - Capacity for Timber Management in Small and Medium Forest Enterprises: A Case Study from the Peruvian Amazon
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
AB  - With the implementation of a new legal framework for more responsible forest management in Peru, private small-medium forest enterprises (SMFEs) have become the most important social actors engaged in commercial forestry in the Peruvian Amazon. Despite the role of SMFEs in contributing to employment and local economic growth, there is little information with respect to their economic performance and capacities. This is a hindrance to efforts aimed at better characterizing this important sector and its influence on the development and conservation of tropical forests. For this study, 29 private SMFEs were surveyed to inventory their capital assets in order to evaluate their capacities to carry out timber management. Results indicate that SMFEs vary greatly in terms of their produced and natural capital assets, and consequently in their forest management capabilities as well. While most SMFEs lack adequate capacity for sustainable forest management, those that had more valuable timber resources and physical infrastructure attained forest certification. SMFE capacities depend greatly on external mechanisms to ensure consistent technical and financial assistance.

TI  - Bird conservation in extremely small tropical rainforest patches in southwest China
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Tropical forests support high levels of avian diversity but these areas have been impacted by extensive deforestation. The lowland tropical rainforest of Xishuangbanna in southwest China is one such impacted hotspot. In this region, rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations have replaced most of the original forest, but numerous small fragments of forest remain. To assess the value of these fragments to avian diversity, we classified the fifteen selected remnant forest patches into three size categories, <1 ha, 1-3 ha, and 36 ha, and conducted avifauna surveys. We found that 97 bird species inhabit the fragments and that bird diversity increases with patch area. The resident species composition similarity index was low among forest patches, both within and across size categories, and also low between the wet and dry seasons. Ground insectivores, frugivores and large bird species were the most vulnerable to habitat fragmentation. Our study encouragingly shows that fragments can play an important role in bird conservation in regions that now lack large tracts of natural forest; however, current patches are too small to support stable annual populations of some species, while others are more tolerant of fragmentation. We discuss these findings and provide conservation strategies to improve bird conservation within rubber plantations in southern China. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - HOW TO SELECT POTENTIAL SPECIES FOR ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION OF RAIN FOREST - SOUTHERN BRAZIL
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Monitoring of natural regeneration can provide information on potential species for use in ecological restoration projects, as well as provide indications of the area resilience after degradation. In order to analyze variations of natural regeneration in two successional stages and to subsidize the indication of species for planting and enrichness, two abandoned pastures were sampled in Serra do Itajai National Park (PNSI), Santa Catarina state, Southern Brazil. In the analysis of the main components, the plots differed according to the change in the quantitative variables of the species (Monte Carlo, P <= 0.05), and two groups were segregated: the first one constituted by the vegetation in the initial stage, and the second one, by intermediate stage vegetation. Twenty-one species were sampled and the intermediate stage showed the greatest richness (n = 19). The pioneer species were predominant in both stages, especially Vernonanthura discolor, Piptocarpha regnellii and Myrsine coriacea. The results demonstrate that the initial stage does not have indicator species, because all species occur frequently in the intermediate stage. However, the intermediate stage was distinguished by the presence of eight indicator species, which are potentially recommended for reforestation and enrichment plantations of Montana Ombrophilous Dense Forest in the PNSI.

TI  - How effective are perches in promoting bird-mediated seed dispersal for natural forest regeneration? A systematic review protocol
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE
AB  - BackgroundForest landscape restoration (FLR), often through tree planting, is one of the priorities in many global and national initiatives for carbon offsetting as part of climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation. However, active efforts to meet FLR objectives entail substantial costs for the procurement of planting stocks and require an experienced workforce for planting and nurturing tree seedlings. Alternatively, restoration projects can be more cost-effective and potentially may have greater biodiversity gain through assisting and accelerating natural forest regeneration. The use of perches is one of the strategies under Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR) and is used to attract avian seed dispersers to degraded habitats for increased tree seed supply and seedling establishment. This systematic review and potential meta-analysis aim to determine the effectiveness of artificial and natural perches in promoting natural forest regeneration. Specifically, we will evaluate their effectiveness in driving seed richness, seed density, seedling richness, and seedling density. The results will synthesize available evidence on the topic, identify knowledge gaps we need filling to upscale the strategy, and inform their use in concert with other ANR strategies.MethodsThe search strategy was informed through a literature scan and discussions with stakeholders and experts. A total of eight databases, which include an organizational library and a web-based search engine, will be searched using the refined search string in English. The search string was formed using keywords corresponding to the PICO structure of the research question, and its comprehensiveness was evaluated using 10 benchmark articles. The search results will be screened by the review team (composed of a primary and at least two secondary reviewers) using the set eligibility criteria at the title and abstract level, followed by the full-text screening. The screened studies will then undergo critical appraisal using the assessment criteria based on risk of bias and methods. Data from the accepted studies will be extracted to the standard data sheet for meta-analysis. Effect size (Hedges' g) will be computed to determine whether perches are effective in increasing seed dispersal and seedling establishment in degraded sites. The effect of potential modifiers relating to the landscape will be explored via mixed models.

TI  - Space-use patterns of Malay civets (Viverra tangalunga) persisting within a landscape fragmented by oil palm plantations
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB  - Context Agricultural land use is expanding and is a major driver of the biodiversity crisis. Land use planning initiatives seeking to optimize wildlife conservation are hindered by a lack of baseline data quantifying species' tolerance to human-modified landscapes. Objectives We explored the influence of landscape characteristics on the fine-scale space-use patterns of a model generalist carnivore, the Malay civet (Viverra tangalunga), within degraded tropical forests and oil palm plantations. Methods We collected over 20,000 GPS locations from 21 male civets in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo to evaluate the species' space-use patterns and habitat utilization processes. We used movement-based modeling to determine home ranges, and combined the results with high-resolution remotely sensed habitat characteristics. We developed resource utilization functions to determine individual and population-level functional responses to proximity to plantation edge, distance to water, terrain ruggedness, forest structure, and functional diversity. Results Civets foraged within oil palm plantations, yet all animals utilized forests. Home ranges scaled with proportion of plantation within both total and core ranges. Resource utilization functions reported individualism in the species' responses to habitat characteristics. At the population-scale, civets consistently and more intensely used habitats closer to plantation edges and taller tree canopies. Conclusions Although plantations did not pose an inhospitable matrix, oil palm agriculture is a less suitable habitat than remnant forests for civets. Proximity measures and forest structure influenced the spatial behaviors of this adaptable generalist, highlighting the importance of protected areas. We recommend land-sparing and -sharing approaches to facilitate carnivore persistence across oil palm degraded landscapes.

TI  - The Changes in China's Forests: An Analysis Using the Forest Identity
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Changes in forest carbon stocks are a determinant of the regional carbon budget. In the past several decades, China has experienced a pronounced increase in forest area and density. However, few comprehensive analyses have been conducted. In this study, we employed the Forest Identity concept to evaluate the changing status of China's forests over the past three decades, using national forest inventory data of five periods (1977-1981, 1984-1988, 1989-1993, 1994-1998, and 1999-2003). The results showed that forest area and growing stock density increased by 0.51% and 0.44% annually over the past three decades, while the conversion ratio of forest biomass to growing stock declined by 0.10% annually. These developments resulted in a net annual increase of 0.85% in forest carbon sequestration, which is equivalent to a net biomass carbon uptake of 43.8 Tg per year (1 Tg = 10(12) g). This increase can be attributed to the national reforestation/afforestation programs, environmentally enhanced forest growth and economic development as indicated by the average gross domestic product.

TI  - Functional identity of overstorey tree height and understorey conservative traits drive aboveground biomass in a subtropical forest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - The niche complementarity hypothesis has received empirical support but species differ in functional strategies for their contribution to ecosystem function, as predicted by the mass ratio hypothesis. Our understanding of how functional identity of conservative and acquisitive strategies of trees predicts aboveground biomass across forest strata (i.e. overstorey and understorey) remains unclear. Aboveground biomass, community-weighted mean (CWM - functional identity) of trait values (6 leaf and 2 stem traits), and soil physicochemical properties were estimated for 125 plots in a 5-ha subtropical forest in Eastern China. We used multiple linear regressions models to relate aboveground biomass to CWM indices at overstorey and understorey strata separately, and whole-community level. We finally employed the structural equation model to test for the effects of overstorey on understorey strata, in addition to the effects of soil physicochemical properties. Forest strata optimal models showed that overstorey strata had high aboveground biomass when they are dominated by functional identity of tree height, whereas high aboveground biomass in understorey strata was driven by functional identity of dense wooded conservative strategy. Whole-community optimal model showed that communities dominated by functional identity of leaf dry matter content and mean leaf area had high aboveground biomass. Aboveground biomass was negatively related to soil nutrients across forest strata and whole-community level. The structural equation model showed that CWM of overstorey tree height did not affect understorey functional identity and aboveground biomass, when soil physicochemical properties were accounted. Soil nutrients had positive effect on functional identity of overstorey tree height whereas negative effect on functional identity of understorey dense-wooded strategy. This study highlights the fundamental roles of forest strata where overstorey and understorey strata contribute to their corresponding aboveground biomass with contrasting functional strategies across a range of soil nutrients. High aboveground biomass was potentially driven by functional identity of tree height through making use of plentiful soil nutrients at overstorey strata, whereas by conservative strategy at understorey strata through enduring nutrient-poor soils. To better understand the roles of functional identity of conservative and acquisitive strategies in driving ecosystem functions, it is worth to analyse forest strata separately.

TI  - Assessment of land use dynamics and vulnerability to land degradation in coal-mined landscapes of central India: implications for ecorestoration strategies
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Introduction: Anthropogenic disturbances resulting from extensive mining activities in tropical regions pose significant threats to native land use, leading to deforestation, biodiversity loss, climate change impacts, environmental degradation, health risks, landscape fragmentation, compromised ecological security, and societal wellbeing. Monitoring Land Use and Land Cover Change (LULCC) becomes imperative for evaluating the extent and nature of land degradation in mined areas.Methods: This study examined and compared land cover change patterns across three coalmined sites: Sohagpur (Site-I), Jamuna & Kotma (Site-II), Bishrampur (Site-III) in Central India over 3 decades using Landsat satellite imagery from 1994, 2007, and 2022. The Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithm, within a supervised classification framework, was applied to discern mining impacts on decadal land use shifts.Results and discussion: The analysis revealed that 7.32%-17.61% of forest cover, 5.0%-10% of water bodies, and 3%-5% of agricultural lands were lost due to mining activities, with Site three and Site two experiencing greater losses compared to Site 1. Overall, native land cover diminished by 35% between 1994 and 2022. Indices including Soil Index, Climate Index, Terrain Index, Land Utilization Index, and Vegetation Index were derived to assess land degradation patterns. These indices were integrated using a weighted index model in ArcGIS to generate the Land Degradation Vulnerability Index (LDVI). Vulnerability notably escalated with mining expansion, particularly pronounced at Site 3 (Bishrampur) and lower at Site 1 (Sohagpur). The "extremely vulnerable" class encompassed a substantial area (25%-40%), while the "low vulnerable" class was less than 5% across all sites. This study's comprehensive analysis aids policymakers, planners, and managers in prioritizing targeted interventions and implementing sustainable land management 175 practices for ecorestoration, aligning with the goal of Zero Net Land Degradation 176 (ZNLD) in coal-mined landscapes.

TI  - Edge Effects and Seedling Bank Depletion: The Role Played by the Early Successional Palm Attalea oleifera (Arecaceae) in the Atlantic Forest
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - In this study, we examined the impacts of Attalea oleifera on the structure of seedling bank and discuss potential mechanisms of palm influence. Seed rain, seedling bank, and palm leaf fall were assessed beneath the canopy and in the vicinity of 16 adult palms across the edges of a large fragment (3500 ha) of the Atlantic forest. Moreover, we examined A. oleifera impacts on seed germination and seedling mortality by experimentally submitting seeds and seedlings to prolonged palm-leaf covering. As expected, seedling bank beneath the adults exhibited reduced abundance and species richness at local and habitat scale. Small to large seeds (3.1-30 mm) were underrepresented in the seed rain below adults palms, while experimental leaf covering drastically reduced both seed germination and seedling survivorship. A. oleifera leaf fall occurred over the whole year (3.6 +/- 2.7 leaves/individual/yr), which resulted in deep leaf litter mounds (10.7 +/- 9.2 cm). Finally, adult palm density (21.6 +/- 11.9 individuals/ha) correlated negatively with seedling density across Attalea clusters. Our results suggest that A. oleifera exerts negative effects on the seedling bank by reducing seedling abundance and richness as a consequence of two complementary mechanisms: impoverished and size-biased seed rain plus reduced seed germination and increased seedling mortality due to prolonged covering by fallen leaves.

TI  - OPTIONS FOR MITIGATING GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS IN VENEZUELA FOREST SECTOR - A GENERAL OVERVIEW
T2  - INTERCIENCIA
AB  - The objective of this paper is to analyze alternatives within the forest sector for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing carbon sinks in Venezuela. Forest clearing represents a major source of carbon emissions in the country, accounting for more than 40% of carbon dioxide and 33% of carbon monoxide emissions.
   The first section of the paper provides a general description of the forest resources and the forest sector in Venezuela and a brief summary of the estimated greenhouse gas emissions associated with forest clearing. The second section presents a detailed analysis of two case studies based on ongoing forest projects, an industrial plantation and a managed protected area. Our analysis assesses the value of these two projects as mitigation options. The third section provides an overview of Venezuela's potential for conserving and sequestering carbon based on technically available land where several options could be implemented The results of the case studies are used here to provide a very rough estimate of the carbon sequestration potential at a national level, based on native forest management, plantations, agroforestry, and forestry protection. Our preliminary results indicate that forest management and forest protection might be the most promising mitigation options for Venezuela. However, given the broad scope of the study and the data uncertainties, the results of our analysis should be viewed as a first attempt to evaluate the carbon benefits derived from the adoption of such measures.

TI  - Quantifying phyllostomid bats at different taxonomic levels as ecological indicators in a disturbed tropical forest
T2  - ACTA CHIROPTEROLOGICA
AB  - With the aim of quantitatively evaluating the usefulness of phyllostomid bats as ecological indicators, we compared intra-family levels and feeding guilds between tropical old-growth forest and patches of secondary vegetation growing where the land had been used for shifting agriculture. There were significant differences between vegetation types in bat species composition, with the frugivore guild most abundant in secondary vegetation and the animalivore guild most abundant in the old-growth forest. These results are congruent with the findings for other Neotropical zones and appear to be associated with the type of soil management that allows secondary vegetation to grow. Using the Indicator Value method, two subfamilies, five genera and five species were found to have a significant indicator value. However, these numbers only represent a small proportion of the five subfamilies, 20 genera and 28 species recorded, indicating that under the disturbance conditions that characterize the study area, phyllostomid bats were poor ecological indicators. Even so, some species and subfamilies are useful as disturbance detectors.

TI  - Sources of anthropogenic fire ignitions on the peat-swamp landscape in Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - Fire disturbance in many tropical forests, including peat swamps, has become more frequent and extensive in recent decades. These fires compromise a variety of ecosystem services, among which mitigating global climate change through carbon storage is particularly important for peat swamps. Indonesia holds the largest amount of tropical peat carbon globally, and mean annual CO2 emissions from decomposition of deforested and drained peatlands and associated fires in Southeast Asia have been estimated at, similar to 2000 Mt y-1. A key component to understanding and therefore managing fire in the region is identifying the land use/land cover classes associated with fire ignitions. We assess the oft-asserted claim that escaped fires from oil palm concessions and smallholder farms near settlements are the primary sources of fire in a peat-swamp forest area in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, equivalent to around a third of Kalimantan's total peat area. We use the MODIS Active Fire product from 2000 to 2010 to evaluate the fire origin and spread on the land use/land cover classes of legal, industrial oil palm concessions (the only type of legal concession in the study area), non-forest, and forest, as well as in relation to settlement proximity. We find that most fires (68-71%) originate in non-forest, compared to oil palm concessions (17%-19%), and relatively few (6-9%) are within 5 km of settlements. Moreover, most fires started within oil palm concessions and in close proximity to settlements stay within those boundaries (90% and 88%, respectively), and fires that do escape constitute only a small proportion of all fires on the landscape (2% and 1%, respectively). Similarly, a small proportion of fire detections in forest originate from oil palm concessions (2%) and within close proximity to settlements (2%). However, fire ignition density in oil palm (0.055 ignitions km(-2)) is comparable to that in non-forest (0.060 km-2 ignitions km(-2)), which is approximately ten times that in forest (0.006 ignitions km(-2)). Ignition density within 5 km of settlements is the highest at 0.125 ignitions km(-2). Furthermore, increased anthropogenic activity in close proximity to oil palm concessions and settlements produces a detectable pattern of fire activity. The number of ignitions decreases exponentially with distance from concessions; the number of ignitions initially increases with distance from settlements, and, around from 7.2 km, then decreases with distance from settlements. These results refute the claim that most fires originate in oil palm concessions, and that fires escaping from oil palm concessions and settlements constitute a major proportion of fires in this study region. However, there is a potential for these land use types to contribute substantially to the fire landscape if their area expands. Effective fire management in this area should therefore target not just oil palm concessions, but also non-forested, degraded areas where ignitions and fires escaping into forest are most likely to occur.

TI  - Diversity and composition of tropical butterflies along an Afromontane agricultural gradient in the Jimma Highlands, Ethiopia
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Afromontane landscapes are typically characterized by a mosaic of smallholder farms and the biodiversity impacts of these practices will vary in accordance to local management and landscape context. Here, we assess how tropical butterfly diversity is maintained across an agricultural landscape in the Jimma Highlands of Ethiopia. We used transect surveys to sample understory butterfly communities within degraded natural forest, semi-managed coffee forest (SMCF), exotic timber plantations, open woodland, croplands and pasture. Surveys were conducted in 29 one-hectare plots and repeated five times between January and June 2013. We found that natural forest supports higher butterfly diversity than all agricultural plots (measured with Hill's numbers). SMCF and timber plantations retain relatively high abundance and diversity, but these metrics drop off sharply in open woodland, cropland and pasture. SMCF and timber plantations share the majority of their species with natural forest and support an equivalent abundance of forest-dependent species, with no increase in widespread species. There was some incongruence in the responses of families and sub-families, notably that Lycaenidae are strongly associated with open woodland and pasture. Adult butterflies clearly utilize forested agricultural practices such as SMCF and timber plantations, but species diversity declines steeply with distance from natural forest suggesting that earlier life-stages may depend on host plants and/or microclimatic conditions that are lost under agricultural management. From a management perspective, the protection of natural forest remains a priority for tropical butterfly conservation, but understanding functioning of the wider landscape mosaic is important as SMCF and timber plantations may act as habitat corridors that facilitate movement between forest fragments.

TI  - Expert review of the science underlying nature-based climate solutions
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
AB  - Viable nature-based climate solutions (NbCS) are needed to achieve climate goals expressed in international agreements like the Paris Accord. Many NbCS pathways have strong scientific foundations and can deliver meaningful climate benefits but effective mitigation is undermined by pathways with less scientific certainty. Here we couple an extensive literature review with an expert elicitation on 43 pathways and find that at present the most used pathways, such as tropical forest conservation, have a solid scientific basis for mitigation. However, the experts suggested that some pathways, many with carbon credit eligibility and market activity, remain uncertain in terms of their climate mitigation efficacy. Sources of uncertainty include incomplete GHG measurement and accounting. We recommend focusing on resolving those uncertainties before broadly scaling implementation of those pathways in quantitative emission or sequestration mitigation plans. If appropriate, those pathways should be supported for their cobenefits, such as biodiversity and food security.
   Nature-based climate solutions are widely incorporated into climate change mitigation plans and need firm scientific foundations. Through literature review and expert elicitation, this analysis shows that for some major pathways there is strong support, while for others their efficacy remains uncertain.

TI  - Plant and bird diversity in rubber agroforests in the lowlands of Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Plant and bird diversity in the Indonesian jungle rubber agroforestry system was compared to that in primary forest and rubber plantations by integrating new and existing data from a lowland rain forest area in Sumatra. Jungle rubber gardens are low-input rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) agroforests that structurally resemble secondary forest and in which wild species are tolerated by the farmer. As primary forests have almost completely disappeared from the lowlands of the Sumatra peneplain, our aim was to assess the contribution of jungle rubber as a land use type to the conservation of plant and bird species, especially those that are associated with the forest interior of primary and old secondary forest. Species-accumulation curves were compiled for terrestrial and epiphytic pteridophytes, trees and birds, and for subsets of 'forest species' of terrestrial pteridophytes and birds. Comparing jungle rubber and primary forest, groups differed in relative species richness patterns. Species richness in jungle rubber was slightly higher (terrestrial pteridophytes), similar (birds) or lower (epiphytic pteridophytes, trees, vascular plants as a whole) than in primary forest. For subsets of 'forest species' of terrestrial pteridophytes and birds, species richness in jungle rubber was lower than in primary forest. For all groups, species richness in jungle rubber was generally higher than in rubber plantations. Although species conservation in jungle rubber is limited by management practices and by a slash-and-burn cycle for replanting of about 40 years, this forest-like land use does support species diversity in an impoverished landscape increasingly dominated by monoculture plantations.

TI  - Derivation and validation of a pedotransfer function for estimating the bulk density of tropical forest soils
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Bulk density (rho(b)), a soil physical property critical for estimating soil carbon storing potentials, is often under-reported in many tropical soil databases because of the difficulty and tedious nature of its measurement in the field. In this study, a pedotransfer function was developed to estimate the bulk density of topsoils (0-30 cm) of Nimbia Forest Reserve, Nigeria. Easily measured soil variables including sand content, total organic carbon and moisture contents were used as predictor variables. A pedotransfer function (PTF) was derived based on multiple linear regression model. Bulk density values for the forest soils varied from 0.78 to 1.28 g/cm(3) with a mean value of 1.03 g/cm(3). All the metrics used for the validation of the pedotransfer function show the model is statistically significant confirming its usefulness. The RMSE, R-squared and MAE of the pedotransfer function are 0.07498, 0.42231 and 0.058934, respectively. Given that this is the first PTF developed for bulk density estimation in the study area, we recommend a comparison of this new model with others that can be developed using machine learning algorithms and other statistical techniques. The PTF developed in this study will find application in the calculation of the soil organic carbon stocks in the Nimbia Forest Reserve to provide baseline estimates-a decision support tool for sustainable soil management and possible climate change mitigation.

TI  - Secondary forest buffers the effects of fragmentation on aerial insectivorous bat species following 30 years of passive forest restoration
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Passive forest restoration can buffer the effects of habitat loss on biodiversity. We acoustically surveyed aerial insectivorous bats in a whole-ecosystem fragmentation experiment in the Brazilian Amazon over a 2-year period, across 33 sites, comprising continuous old-growth forest, remnant fragments, and regenerating secondary forest matrix. We analyzed the activity of 10 species/sonotypes to investigate occupancy across habitat types and responses to fragment size and interior-edge-matrix (IEM) disturbance gradients. Employing a multiscale approach, we investigated guild (edge foragers, forest specialists, flexible forest foragers, and open space specialists) and species-level responses to vegetation structure and forest cover, edge, and patch density across six spatial scales (0.5-3 km). We found species-specific habitat occupancy patterns and nuanced responses to fragment size and the IEM disturbance gradient. For example, Furipterus horrens had lower activity in secondary forest sites and the interior and edge of the smallest fragments (1 and 10 ha) compared to continuous forest, and only two species (Pteronotus spp.) showed no habitat preference and no significant responses across the IEM and fragment size gradients. Only the Molossus sonotype responded negatively to vegetation structure. We uncovered no negative influence of forest cover or edge density at guild or species-level. Our results indicate that reforestation can buffer the negative effects of fragmentation and although these effects can still be detected in some species, generally aerial insectivorous bats appear to be in recovery after 30 years of passive forest restoration. Our findings reinforce the need to protect regenerating forests while conserving vast expanses of old-growth forest.

TI  - Geometrid Moth Species Richness, Distribution and Community Composition in Different Forest Types of Papua New Guinea
T2  - CASE STUDIES IN THE ENVIRONMENT
AB  - As the major group of herbivorous insects, moths are highly significant in natural ecosystems. In collaboration with the Papua New Guinea (PNG) multipurpose National Forest Inventory (NFI) survey, this study investigates the species richness, distribution and community composition of Geometrid moths (Lepidoptera) in PNG's tropical forests and analyses environmental drivers of the geometrid community structure. By providing a baseline assessment of an important order of insects that can serve as an indicator for broader biodiversity, this study informs how biodiversity assessments can be better integrated into the planning of forest conservation initiatives, particularly those related to REDD+ and forest carbon offset developments. The research was conducted over 3 years at 38 NFI clusters throughout six provinces: Eastern Highlands, Western Highlands, Morobe, Madang and West New Britain and Central Province. Moths were collected from dusk to before midnight (18:00 h to 22:00 h) using a manual light trapping method for four nights per site, with a total of 152 light trap samples. Results included a total of 11,830 specimens from 1,108 morphological species from lowland and montane forests in disturbed (degraded and/or logged) and primary forests. Elevation and forest disturbance are the main variables that influence the distribution of species. Species richness was low in montane undisturbed forests compared with lowland (disturbed and primary) forests and montane disturbed forests. Species similarity between light trap samples tends to decrease as elevation increases. Geometrid moth species were arranged into two main orders of community composition according to the forest types: montane (disturbed and/or primary) forests species and lowland (disturbed and/or primary forest) species as per the samples.

TI  - Patterns of forest community diversity, regeneration potential and carbon storages along an altitudinal gradient in Eastern Himalaya, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
AB  - This study showed changing patterns in the plant species composition, diversity, and carbon storage potential of different forests along altitudinal gradients (i.e. 100 - 1900 m) in Eastern Himalayan India. Different tree, shrub and herb species were sampled along the altitudinal gradients ranging from tropical to temperate forests through Nested Plot design. In each forest, vegetation sampling was made by establishing a permanent plot of 250 m x 250 m as per ISRO-GBP/NCP-VCP protocol. Individuals of trees >= 10 cm girth at breast height (GBH), shrubs and herbs were recorded in 4, 8 and 16 subplots of 31.62 m x 31.62 m, 5 m x 5 m and 1 m x 1 m, respectively. Community attributes such as species richness, density, basal area, diversity indices and biomass and carbon storages were computed for each study site. A total of 5 forest communities (2 each from tropical and subtropical and one from temperate forest) were identified. The woody species diversity was highest in the subtropical forest followed by tropical and temperate forest. Altitude played an important role in the Eastern Himalayan Mountains in the establishment and distribution of forest community. Forest community composition changes with elevation, for instance, the dominant communities like Dipterocarpus retusus-Phoebe goalparensis-Schima wallichii (D-PS), Gmelina arborea-Schima wallichii-Duabanga grandiflora (G-S-D), Schima wallichii-Duabanga grandiflora-Alstonia scholaris (S-D-A), Alstonia scholaris-Terminalia myriocarpa-Bischofia javanica (A-T-B) and Acer thomsonii-Rhodendron arboreum-Quercus lamellose (A-R-Q) were present at elevational ranges of 100-300 m, 300-700 m, 700-1100 m, 1100-1500 m and 1500-1900 m, respectively. The study showed that about 41-57% of the tree species exhibited good regeneration followed by 23-30% as fair, 6-16% as poor, and 6-21% species did not show regeneration along the altitudinal gradient. The total biomass carbon (Mg C ha-1) varied from 84.74 to 163.56 in tropical, 103.12 - 156.41 in subtropical and 133.05 in temperate forest. In conclusion, community composition, regeneration pattern and biomass carbon storage changes along altitude because of altered biophysical characteristics. However, despite variations in elevation, factors for forest disturbance at different altitudes significantly contributed to the community attributes and overall accumulation of biomass carbon. Hence, the traditional management practices carried out by local communities also play a crucial role in shaping the structure, composition, and carbon dynamics of forest ecosystems. Understanding the impacts of these practices is essential for promoting sustainable forest management by conserving forests and preserving carbon stocks for mitigating climate change in future. This study emphasizes the importance of long-term forest monitoring to promote biodiversity conservation and formulate conservation strategies that support sustainable forest management policies to which ensure continuous provision of ecosystem services in the region.

TI  - Forest protection and permanence of reduced emissions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Tropical forests are essential for climate change mitigation. With growing interest over the use of credits from reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) and other natural climate solutions within both voluntary and compliance carbon markets, key concerns about the long-term durability of the reductions, or their permanence, arise for countries, corporations, regulators, and policy makers. This paper seeks to analyze the longevity of emissions reductions from different policies to slow down and stop deforestation. To establish conditions of permanence, we conduct numerical analyses using a model based on a cellular automata algorithm that learns from historical deforestation patterns and other spatial features in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. First, we simulate increased law enforcement to curb deforestation at a jurisdictional scale from 2025 to 2034, followed by potential policy rollbacks from 2035 to 2050. Second, we consider alternative scenarios to avoid potentially legal deforestation coupled with reforestation. We find spatial and path dependence - a successful policy intervention may permanently change the deforestation trajectory even after potential policy reversals. Hence, permanence depends both on the probability of policy reversals and the risk of emissions overshooting. Our results are important for advancing the understanding around the unsettled debate on the permanence of avoided emissions. Further, this paper argues that as policies to prevent deforestation or reduce emissions otherwise are reversible, permanence should be understood and discussed in a probabilistic and time-dependent framework.

TI  - Carbon stocks of above- and belowground tree biomass in Kibate Forest around Wonchi Crater Lake, Central Highland of Ethiopia
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Forests play an important role in the global carbon (C) balance, but their biomass has decreased globally mainly because of deforestation and a reduction in forest cover. However, little is known about the C stock of tree biomass related to environmental factors in the remnant forest patches. Thus, the present study aimed at assessing the status of C stocks of tree biomass using an allometric equation in Kibate Forest (Ethiopia). Sixty-six plots (30x30 m) were laid out at 100 m interval distance along the altitudinal gradients in five transects. The results revealed that the highest C stocks (67.4%) per species were contributed by Juniperus procera, Ilex mitis var. mitis, Nuxia congesta, and Olea europaea subsp. cuspidata. The mean total tree biomass was 91.9 +/- 10.01 Mg ha(-1). The mean total C stock was 45.9 +/- 5.17 Mg ha(-1), out of which 38.3 +/- 4.31 and 7.7 +/- 0.91 Mg ha(-1) were stored in above- and belowground C pools, respectively. Anthropogenic factors were negatively associated with the C-stock distribution in the study area. Thus, the status of the C stock of tree biomass related to anthropogenic factors indicates that sustainable forest management practice is needed in the study area to conserve biodiversity and mitigate climate change.

TI  - Carbon storage and sequestration in Southeast Asian urban clusters under future land cover change scenarios (2015-2050)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Land-use land-cover (LULC) changes are occurring rapidly in Southeast Asia (SEA), generally associated with population growth, economic development and competing demands for land. Land cover change is one of the vital factors affecting carbon dynamics and emissions. SEA is an important region to study urban-caused LULC emissions and the potential for nature-based solutions (NBS) and nature climate solutions (NCS), as it is home to nearly 15% of the world's tropical forests and has some of the world's fastest rates of urban growth. We present a fine-scale urban cluster level assessment for SEA of current (2015) and future (2050) scenarios for carbon sequestration service and climate mitigation potential. We identified 956 urban clusters distributed across 11 countries of SEA. Considering the urban expansion projected and decline in forests, this region could see a carbon loss of up to 0.11 Gigatonnes (Scenario SSP4 RCP 3.4). Comparing carbon change values to urban emissions, we found that the average offset value ranging from -2% (Scenario SSP1 RCP 2.6) to -21%. We also found that a few medium and large urban clusters could add to more than double the existing carbon emissions in 2050 in the SSP3 and SSP4 RCP 3.4 scenarios, while a minority of clusters could offset their emissions under SSP1. Our study confirms that NCS, and particularly reforestation, are in many cases able to offset the direct emissions from land cover conversion from SEA urban clusters. Hence, documenting the plausible LULC transitions and the associated impacts gains significance in the SEA region as the results can be useful for informing policy and sustainable land management.

TI  - Effects of wildfire on vegetation and understory avian communities in montane rainforests, north-eastern Tanzania
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - The Eastern Arc Mountains are part of the Eastern Afromontane global biodiversity hotspot with a remarkable concentration of endemic species. Wildfire is among the major threats to biodiversity of forested mountains. This study assessed the effect of forest fire on the vegetation and understory birds in the Magamba montane forest, 5 years post a major fire outbreak. Mist-net transects were used to sample understory birds. During the breeding season, active bird nests were searched using the time-constrained method in both burnt and unburnt forests. Vegetation plots were sampled along the mist-net transects, and shrubs and trees were identified and counted. The diversity of trees and shrubs, tree density per plot and canopy cover were significantly higher at unburnt than burnt sites with no difference in shrub density per plot. Bird species composition and number of nests between burnt and unburnt forests differed significantly with a considerable decline of forest interior bird specialists in burnt areas. An invasive plant species, Acacia melanoxylon, was found in dense groves within burnt sites and if not controlled, would escalate the fire regimes to further affecting plants and avian communities. Fire management, restoration and rehabilitation of burnt areas are among the immediate recommended actions.

TI  - Markedly divergent estimates of Amazon forest carbon density from ground plots and satellites
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB  - Aim The accurate mapping of forest carbon stocks is essential for understanding the global carbon cycle, for assessing emissions from deforestation, and for rational land-use planning. Remote sensing (RS) is currently the key tool for this purpose, but RS does not estimate vegetation biomass directly, and thus may miss significant spatial variations in forest structure. We test the stated accuracy of pantropical carbon maps using a large independent field dataset.
   Location Tropical forests of the Amazon basin. The permanent archive of the field plot data can be accessed at: http://dx.doi.org/10.5521/FORESTPLOTS.NET/2014_1
   Methods Two recent pantropical RS maps of vegetation carbon are compared to a unique ground-plot dataset, involving tree measurements in 413 large inventory plots located in nine countries. The RS maps were compared directly to field plots, and kriging of the field data was used to allow area-based comparisons.
   Results The two RS carbon maps fail to capture the main gradient in Amazon forest carbon detected using 413 ground plots, from the densely wooded tall forests of the north-east, to the light-wooded, shorter forests of the south-west. The differences between plots and RS maps far exceed the uncertainties given in these studies, with whole regions over-or under-estimated by > 25%, whereas regional uncertainties for the maps were reported to be < 5%.
   Main conclusions Pantropical biomass maps are widely used by governments and by projects aiming to reduce deforestation using carbon offsets, but may have significant regional biases. Carbon-mapping techniques must be revised to account for the known ecological variation in tree wood density and allometry to create maps suitable for carbon accounting. The use of single relationships between tree canopy height and above-ground biomass inevitably yields large, spatially correlated errors. This presents a significant challenge to both the forest conservation and remote sensing communities, because neither wood density nor species assemblages can be reliably mapped from space.

TI  - Assessment of major pools and fluxes of carbon in Indian forests
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB  - The major pools including phytomass, soil, litter, and fluxes of carbon (C) due to litterfall and landuse changes were estimated for Indian forests. Based on growing stock-volume approach at the state and district levels, the Indian forest phytomass was estimated in the range of 3.8-4.3 PgC. The total soil organic pool in the top 1m depth was estimated as 6.8 PgC, using estimated soil organic carbon densities and Remote Sensing (RS) based area by forest types. Based on 122 published Indian studies and RS-based forest area, the total litterfall carbon flux was estimated as 208.8 MgC ha(-1) yr(-1). The cumulative net carbon flux (1880-1996) from Indian forests (1880-1996) due to landuse changes (deforestation, afforestation and phytomass degradation) was estimated as 5.4 PgC, using a simple book-keeping approach. The mean annual net C flux due to landuse changes during 1985 1996 was estimated as 9.0 TgC yr(-1). For the recent period, the Indian forests are nationally a small source with some regions acting as small sinks of carbon as well. The improved quantification of pools and fluxes related to forest carbon cycle is important for understanding the contribution of Indian forests to net carbon emissions as well as their potential for carbon sequestration in the context of the Kyoto protocol.

TI  - The Dilemma of Maintaining Intact Forest Through Certification
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Intact forests are natural and often extensive forests free from apparent anthropogenic degradation. Intact forests have important intrinsic and societal values, making their protection a high conservation priority. They are, however, vulnerable to being lost and degraded due to high opportunity costs and a lack of positive incentives to their preservation. Market-based mechanisms, such as voluntary certification, might provide a means to conserve intact forests while maintaining income through sustainable forest uses. Yet possibilities to ensure strict protection of large areas of intact forests through certification remain limited as long as premiums from certification are bound to the units of forest products that are sold. We explore challenges for incorporating intact forests into certification processes, and of maintaining intact forests within forest management units. To circumvent these challenges, it might be necessary to create a form of compensation payment scheme to overcome the foregone costs of intact forest preservation. Alternatively, certification systems might need to consider permitting some degree of regulated extraction in exchange for recognition and implementation of stringent forest preservation. This will require a re-evaluation of the way intactness is treated within current certification standards and the requirements for forestry within intact forests. Eventually, intact forest conservation and socially and economically viable forest management can only be reconciled on the landscape scale.

TI  - The potential of REDD plus for carbon sequestration in tropical forests: Supply curves for carbon storage for Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - We study the potential of tropical multi-age multi-species forests for sequestering carbon in response to financial incentives from REDD+. Following existing carbon crediting schemes, the use of reduced impact logging techniques (RIL) allows a forest manager to apply for carbon credits whereas conventional logging (CL) does not. This paper is the first to develop a Hartman model with selective cutting in this setting that takes additionality of carbon sequestration explicitly into account. We apply the model using data for Kalimantan, Indonesia, for both private and government forest managers. The latter have a lower discount rate and are exempt from taxes. RIL leads to less damages on the residual stand than CL and has lower variable but higher fixed costs. We find that a system of carbon credits through REDD+ can increase carbon stored per hectare by 15.8% if the forest is privately managed and by 22% under government management if the carbon price equals the average 2015 price in the European Union's Emission Trading Scheme. Interestingly, awarding carbon credits to carbon stored in end-use wood products does not increase the amount of carbon stored, nor Land Expectation Value. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Linking climate change research with food security and poverty reduction in the tropics
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
CP  - Conference on Food and Forestry: Global Change and Global Challenges
AB  - Climate change is a reality and will affect the poor in developing countries in many ways. The effectiveness of global change research could be substantially improved by linking International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) study with Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) centres based in the tropics. These centres are carrying interdisciplinary research and development on how to achieve food security and reduce rural poverty through the innovative management of natural resources. A CGIAR intercentre working group on climate change (ICWG-CC) identified joint opportunities that take advantage of the comparative advantages of both institutions. CGIAR centres will focus on adaptation and mitigation research in developing countries. A natural resource management research approach is suggested, which consists of six steps: (1) identifying and quantifying the extent of food insecurity, rural poverty and resource degradation; (2) conducting technological and policy research on economic and environmental functions; (3) optimising the trade-offs between global environmental benefits and private farmer benefits; (4) extrapolating and disseminating results, including research on policy implementation; (5) assessing impact and (6) providing feedback.
   Two examples of current CGIAR research illustrate this approach. Agroforestry alternatives to slash and burn (ASB) agriculture at tropical forest margins were identified and the trade-offs between carbon sequestration and farmer profitability provided options to policy makers. Land tenure problems were resolved with participatory policy research. Agroforestry practices sequester an additional 57 Mg C per ha, three times that of croplands or grasslands are able to do. Soil nutrient capital is being replenished in subhumid tropical Africa through improved leguminous tree fallows, rock phosphate and biomass transfers of Tithonia diversifolia, helping farmers to attain food security. Afterwards, when farmers shift to high-value tree or vegetable crop production, poverty is reduced. The transformation of low productivity croplands to sequential agroforestry is estimated to triple system carbon stocks in 20 years. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Bacuru Droa: Indigenous forest custody as an effective climate change mitigation option. A case study from Darien, Panama
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CLIMATE
AB  - Efforts to naturally remove atmospheric CO2 demand that largely intact forests be maintained. Our inter-cultural research initiative tested the hypothesis that Indigenous custody of the land is compatible with the maintenance of intact forests. Here we combined traditional knowledge, phytolith analysis, remote sensing, and tree inventories to study old-growth forests in Panama's Darien. Phytoliths served to elucidate historical vegetation, remote sensing revealed the current and past Indigenous footprints while tree stature and identity characterised the forest. Until now there has been very little to no human impact within these forests and current Indigenous footprint is both small and stable. Large trees accounted for 13% of trees in the plots that we established. For over half of the species, the measured tree height was taller than previously published maximum heights, leading us to conclude that these forests are a truly exceptional ecological refugium. Noting that the local communities are not rewarded for their custody of these exceptional forests we call to revisit the Good Practice Guidance for Land Use Land Use Change and Forestry to include intact forest land. In the context of sub-optimal carbon finance options, we also propose matching as a methodology that could prove additionality of forest conservation initiatives in climate mitigation portfolios.

TI  - The legitimacy of incentive-based conservation and a critical account of social safeguards
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB  - Incentive-based conservation has become a significant part of how tropical forests are being governed. Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) is a mechanism to mitigate climate change that many countries have started to implement. REDD+, however, is criticized for its potential negative impacts on local populations and Indigenous people. To prevent and mitigate the negative impacts, safeguards are increasingly being used to prevent and shift the focus toward 'non-carbon' elements of forest conservation. We discuss the legitimacy of these types of projects from a stakeholder perspective. Using a normative framework, we assess the Ecuadorian Socio Bosque conservation program, concentrating more specifically on the level of input and output legitimacy. Results show that Socio Bosque in its current form has shortcomings in both input and output legitimacy. We argue that an encompassing conception of legitimacy, including input and output criteria, particularly from a local stakeholder perspective, is essential for the future success of incentive-based conservation and particularly for REDD+ projects.

TI  - Alleviating forest degradation in the Lancang-Mekong Region requires closing management-measurement gaps
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
AB  - Deforestation and forest degradation are having profound negative impacts on social-ecological systems in the emerging economies across the tropics. Consequently, interest in restoring and rehabilitating degraded forests has been growing. This paper explores current issues related to addressing forest degradation in the Lancang-Mekong Region (LMR) of Southeast Asia through a review of the use of criteria and indicators for forest degradation and rehabilitation. Forest degradation must be understood in the context of its underlying drivers, which are numerous and complex. Understanding these underlying drivers of degradation requires diagnosing the entwined political, social, economic, and environmental systems that affect forests. Landscapes are the relevant scales to diagnose and intervene for improved forests. Interventions to restore or rehabilitate forests should be process-driven, focused on the underlying social, ecological and political processes that degrade landscapes. Interventions should also include negotiation among all actors influencing and competing for natural resource claims in forest landscapes. Criteria and indicators for forest landscape restoration should therefore help to improve the governance of forest landscapes. Criteria and indicators provide measures of the biophysical outcomes of degradation, in addition to processes, but these should be adapted to changing contexts and emerging challenges, and should rectify any pre-existing flawed change-logic. Restoration activities should synthesize, integrate, and build upon the rich history of pre-existing restoration guidelines, but should be adaptable in order to be applied effectively in the contexts of local landscapes. This project is facilitating a dialogue around the use of criteria and indicators to help solve the degradation challenge in the LMR. We will trial the use of the criteria and indicators generated through this research in the LMR to learn what works and what doesn't. This will provide an opportunity to build consensus around the ways in which restoration investments made by governments, civil society, and the private sector can influence sustainability.

TI  - Integrating remotely sensed fires for predicting deforestation for REDD
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Fire is an important tool in tropical forest management, as it alters forest composition, structure, and the carbon budget. The United Nations program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) aims to sustainably manage forests, as well as to conserve and enhance their carbon stocks. Despite the crucial role of fire management, decision-making on REDD+ interventions fails to systematically include fires. Here, we address this critical knowledge gap in two ways. First, we review REDD+ projects and programs to assess the inclusion of fires in monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems. Second, we model the relationship between fire and forest for a pilot site in Colombia using near-real-time (NRT) fire monitoring data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The literature review revealed fire remains to be incorporated as a key component of MRV systems. Spatially explicit modeling of land use change showed the probability of deforestation declined sharply with increasing distance to the nearest fire the preceding year (multi-year model area under the curve [AUC] 0.82). Deforestation predictions based on the model performed better than the official REDD earlY-warning system. The model AUC for 2013 and 2014 was 0.81, compared to 0.52 for the early-warning system in 2013 and 0.68 in 2014. This demonstrates NRT fire monitoring is a powerful tool to predict sites of forest deforestation. Applying new, publicly available, and open-access NRT fire data should be an essential element of early-warning systems to detect and prevent deforestation. Our results provide tools for improving both the current MRV systems, and the deforestation early-warning system in Colombia.

TI  - Lime and gypsum application increases biological activity, carbon pools, and agronomic productivity in highly weathered soil
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The application of lime and gypsum has been recognized as an important strategy for correcting soil acidity and for improving soil fertility, soil aggregation, and agronomic productivity in highly weathered soils. We hypothesized that the combined application of lime and gypsum would create favorable conditions for biological activity and result in increased SOC storage and agronomic productivity. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term (i.e., 15 years) impact of lime and gypsum application on the biological activity, SOC stocks, and agronomic productivity of plots under no-till soil management. The experiment was established in 1998 at a site with clayey Oxisol in southern Brazil, and was designed with a split-plot arrangement, completely randomized blocks, and three replicates. The main plot was subject to three lime treatments: (i) control (no lime); (ii) incorporated lime (IL):incorporation of 4.5 Mg lime ha(-1) to a depth of 0-20 cm by; and (iii) surface lime (SL): surface application of 4.5 Mg lime ha(-1), which was equally divided among three annual applications during the first three years of the experiment. The subplots were comprised by surface applications of gypsum at 0, 3, 6, or 9 Mg ha(-1). Soil samples were collected in 1998, before of the experiment, and in October 2013, in order to evaluate soil enzyme activities, SOC pool stocks, crop productivity, C-biomass input, and soil fertility attributes. Both forms of lime application significant improved the stocks of several SOC pools, crop productivity, biomass-C input rates, soil fertility attributes, and enzyme activity. The SOC stocks were positively correlated with Ca2+ content and biomass-C input, demonstrating the potential of calcium to improve C accumulation. Enzyme activities were significantly affected by both soil fertility and SOC pools, with increases in hot water extractable organic C yielding the greatest increases in enzyme activity. In addition, we also found that gypsum application significantly increased the stocks of labile SOC pools and arylsulfatase activity. However, effects of gypsum application were less apparent than those of lime application and the combination of surface lime (4.5 Mg ha(-1)) and gypsum (9 Mg ha(-1)) application yielded the greatest long-term increase in the stock of total organic C stock. Thus, the results of the present study suggest that lime and gypsum application, along with no-till management and biomass-C input, constitutes an efficient strategy for improving the biological activity, C stocks, and productivity of agricultural soils.

TI  - Balancing the Principle of Permanent Sovereign over Natural Resources and Sustainable Forest Management: Indonesian Experiences
T2  - JOURNAL OF EAST ASIA AND INTERNATIONAL LAW
AB  - Most scholars argue that the principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources (PSNR) has been used by developing countries as a legal basis to exploit their natural resources, including forests, for the sake of economic development. Land conversion and forest burning are the primary causes of forest degradation and deforestation in Indonesia. Thus, the biodiversity of Indonesian tropical forests is decreasing tremendously. This article aims to comprehensively analyze the experiences of the Indonesian government to balance the principle of PSNR and sustainable forest management (SFM). The paper argues that the implementation of the PSNR principle in SFM faces many challenges, such as deforestation, forest degradation, and the failures in implementing laws, as well as weak law enforcement. Therefore, to balance the PSNR principle with SFM, the Indonesian government needs to undertake various efforts, such as strengthening law enforcement, carrying out social forest management, and exercising mandatory forest certification. Moreover, all these efforts need to be further improved.

TI  - Testing hypotheses for the success of different conservation strategies
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - Evaluations of the success of different conservation strategies are still in their infancy. We used four different measures of project outcomes-ecological, economic, attitudinal, and behavioral - to test hypotheses derived from the assumptions that underlie contemporary conservation solutions. Our hypotheses concerned the effects of natural resource utilization, market integration, decentralization, and community homogeneity on project success. We reviewed the conservation and development literature and used a specific protocol to extract and code the information in a sample of papers. Although our results are by no means conclusive and suffer from the paucity of high-quality data and independent monitoring (80% of the original sample of 124 projects provided inadequate information for use in this study), they show that permitted use of natural resources, market access, and greater community involvement in the conservation project are all important factors for a successful outcome. Without better monitoring schemes in place, it is still impossible to provide a systematic evaluation of how different strategies are best suited to different conservation challenges.

TI  - Intra-specific patterns of δ<SUP>13</SUP>C, growth and wood density variation at sites of contrasting precipitation with implications for modelling carbon sequestration of tropical tree species
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Tropical agroforestry practices play a crucial role in mitigating global climate change by absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and storing carbon in their biomass. Assessing the effects of water stress on carbon sequestration as well as uncertainties in measurement, are important for implementing the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) programs and carbon trading. This study aims to understand how precipitation influences carbon sequestration of Tectona grandis, Acacia mangium and Eucalyptus camaldulensis growing in agroforestry (woodlot) plantations in Bangladesh. Wood cores were collected at two different sites with contrasting (low vs high) annual precipitation and analysed for radial growth, carbon isotope abundance (delta C-13) of cellulose and wood density. Site- and species-specific variation in delta C-13 was observed with higher values (less negative) detected at the low precipitation site. Trees at the low precipitation site showed lower growth rate and higher wood (basic) density compared to the trees at high precipitation site. Trees at the low precipitation site also showed significantly lower carbon sequestration rate (CSR) than those of the high precipitation site. delta C-13 reflects site- and species-specific water stress conditions. This study characterises intra- and inter-specific CSR variations in contrasting sites and confirms the importance of considering site-specific radial variation of wood density to render more accurate accounting of carbon sequestration and storage in tropical forests.

TI  - Ecophysiological responses of Cupuassu tree ecotypes ( Theobroma grandiflorum) in an agroforestry system designed with rubber trees in Colombian Amazon
T2  - XXXI INTERNATIONAL HORTICULTURAL CONGRESS, IHC2022: INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INNOVATIVE PERENNIAL CROPS MANAGEMENT
CP  - 31st International Horticultural Congress (IHC) - Horticulture for a World in Transition / International Symposium on Innovative Perennial Crops Management
AB  - Cupuassu [Theobroma grandiflorum (Willd. ex Spreng.) K. Schum] is a promising Amazonian fruit tree of great interest for implementation in sustainable agroforestry enrichment alternative models for the Colombian Amazon. The purpose of this study was to assess the diurnal and seasonality eco-physiological behavior of two distinctive ecotypes (i.e., Eco11 and Eco4) and a control ecotype (EcoCaq) in association with rubber plantations (clone FX 4098) in growth phase in two agro-climatic zones of Caqueta in the Colombian Amazon. Cupuassu was established in a completely random design with distances of 3.0x4.0 m in double rubber corridors, and the latter in turn with distances of 4.0x2.8x10.0 m. Linear models were used to analyze the daily courses of gas exchange and water potential of the plant, micro- climatic parameters and soil water potential. A biplot genotype x environment analysis was used to analyze the adaptability and stability of the three eco-types. The highest photosynthetic rates occurred between 9:00 and 12:00 h and in times of greater precipitation (wet and transition to dry season). The plants water potential was the eco-physiological parameter that best correlated with photosynthesis, and with climatic factors, positively with relative humidity and negatively with PAR (photosynthetically active radiation), temperature and VPD (vapor pressure deficit). Eco11 presented the highest photosynthetic performance therefore representing the best option for implementation of agroforestry enrichment arrangements with rubber plantations with potential for the Colombian Amazon

TI  - Direct seeding of late-successional trees to restore tropical montane forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Natural regeneration of large-seeded, late-successional trees in fragmented tropical landscapes can be strongly limited by a lack of seed dispersal resulting in the need for more intensive restoration approaches, such as enrichment planting, to include these species in future forests. Direct seeding may be an alternative low-cost approach to planting nursery-raised tree seedlings, but there is minimal information on its efficacy or when in the successional process this technique will be most successful. We tested directly seeding five native tree species into habitats representing passive and active restoration approaches: (1) recently abandoned pasture; (2) naturally establishing, young secondary forests; and (3) young, mixed-species (fast-growing N-fixers and commercially valuable species) tree plantations established to facilitate montane forest recovery in southern Costa Rica. We monitored germination, survival, growth, and above- and below-ground biomass over a 2-year period. Germination in pastures, secondary forests, and tree plantations was similar(-..43%). Seedling survival after one and two years was significantly higher under tree plantations (91% year 1, 75% year 2) compared to secondary forests (76.44%) or pastures (74, 41%). Moreover, seedlings had greater total biomass and lower root:shoot ratios in the plantations, suggesting higher nutrient availability in that treatment. Costs for direct seeding were 10- to 30-fold less per 100 seedlings after 2-year compared to nursery-raised seedlings planted at the same sites; however, there are important trade-offs to the two restoration approaches. Planting nursery-raised seedling is a more effective but higher cost approach for rapidly establishing canopy cover and restoring large areas whereas direct seeding is a more efficient way to enrich an existing system. We particularly recommend using direct seeding as a complimentary measure to the more intensive restoration approach of planting fast-growing and N-fixing trees. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Quantifying aboveground biomass in African environments: A review of the trade-offs between sensor estimation accuracy and costs
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Increased global recognition of the role of forests in regulating the biosphere-atmospheric carbon cycle through carbon sequestration, has resulted in a wide range of scientific studies on estimation, mapping, monitoring and the prediction of Aboveground Biomass (AGB) on various scales in sub-Saharan Africa. In many parts of the developing world, specifically in sub-Saharan Africa, the accurate quantification of AGB, although still a challenge, is important for national carbon accounting, REDD+ project payments, sustainable forest management and strategic policy-making. In this review, an overview of remote sensing applications in AGB estimation in sub-Saharan Africa, including research challenges and basic information related to the trade-offs between sensor estimation accuracy and costs, is provided. It is assumed that this review is timely, due to a relative increase in the number of remotely sensed forests carbon studies in the recent years (specifically the period between 1998 and 2013). Remotely sensed data is particularly appealing, due to its robustness, instantaneity and repeated spatio-temporal coverage and hence the ability to successful estimate and map AGB. However, estimation accuracy and image acquisition cost vary with sensor resolution and type. It is assumed that this study will provide guidance in future national carbon accounting studies, which is one of the main objectives of the Kyoto Protocol and the REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) project, housed under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), particularly for the developing world.

TI  - The significance of using satellite imagery data only in Ecological Niche Modelling of Iberian herps
T2  - ACTA HERPETOLOGICA
AB  - The environmental data used to calculate ecological niche models (ENM) are obtained mainly from ground-based maps (e.g., climatic interpolated surfaces). These data are often not available for less developed areas, or may be at an inappropriate scale, and thus to obtain this information requires fieldwork. An alternative source of eco-geographical data comes from satellite imagery. Three sets of ENM were calculated exclusively with variables obtained (1) from optical and radar images only and (2) from climatic and altitude maps obtained by ground-based methods. These models were compared to evaluate whether satellite imagery can accurately generate ENM. These comparisons must be made in areas with well-known species distribution and with available satellite imagery and ground-based data. Thus, the study area was the south-western part of Salamanca (Spain), using amphibian and reptiles as species models. Models' discrimination capacity was measured with ROC plots. Models' covariation was measured with a Spatial Spearman correlation. Four modelling techniques were used (Bioclim, Mahalanobis distance, GARP and Maxent). The results of this comparison showed that there were no significant differences between models generated using remotely sensed imagery or ground-based data. However, the models built with satellite imagery data exhibited a larger diversity of values, probably related to the higher spatial resolution of the satellite imagery. Satellite imagery can produce accurate ENM, independently of the modelling technique or the dataset used. Therefore, biogeographical analysis of species distribution in remote areas can be accurately developed only with variables from satellite imagery.

TI  - Quantifying uncertainty about forest recovery 32-years after selective logging in Suriname
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The inclusion of managed tropical forests in climate change mitigation has made it important to find the sustainable sweet-spot for timber production, carbon retention, and the quick recovery of both. Here we focus on recovery of aboveground carbon and timber stocks over the first 32 years after selective logging with the CELOS Harvest System in Suriname. Our data are from twelve 1-ha permanent sample plots in which growth, survival, and recruitment of trees >= 15 cm diameter were monitored between 1978 and 2012. We evaluate plot-level changes in basal area, stem density, aboveground carbon, and timber stock in response to average timber harvests of 15, 23, and 46 m(3) ha(-1). We use a linear mixed-effects model in a Bayesian framework to quantify recovery time for aboveground carbon and timber stock, as well as annualized increments for both. Our statistical models accounted for the uncertainty associated with the height and biomass allometries used to estimate aboveground carbon and Increased precision of annualized aboveground carbon increments by including data from forty-one plots located elsewhere on the Guiana Shield. The probabilities of aboveground carbon recovery to pre-logging levels 32 years after harvests of 15, 23 and 46 m(3) ha(-1) were 45%, 40%, and 24%, respectively. Net aboveground carbon increment for logged forests across all harvest intensities was 0.64 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), more than twice the rate observed in unlogged forests (0.26 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)). The probabilities of timber stock recovery at the end of the 32-year period were highest after harvest intensities of 15 and 23 m(3) ha(-1) (with 80% probability) and lowest after the harvest of 46 m(3) ha(-1) (with 70% probability). Timber stock recovery across all harvest intensities was driven primarily by residual tree growth. Application of the legal cutting limit of 25 m(3) ha(-1) will require more than 70 and 40 years to recover aboveground carbon and timber stocks, respectively, with 90% probability. Based on the low recruitment rates of the twelve species harvested, the 25 year cutting cycle currently implemented in Suriname is too short for long-term timber stock sustainability. We highlight the value of propagating uncertainty from individual tree measurements to statistical predictions of carbon stock recovery. Ultimately, our study reveals the trade-offs that must be made between timber and carbon services as well as the opportunity to use carbon payments to enable longer cutting rotations to capture carbon from forest regrowth.

TI  - Terrestrial carbon sinks in China and around the world and their contribution to carbon neutrality
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-LIFE SCIENCES
AB  - Enhancing the terrestrial ecosystem carbon sink (referred to as terrestrial C sink) is an important way to slow down the continuous increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and to achieve carbon neutrality target. To better understand the characteristics of terrestrial C sinks and their contribution to carbon neutrality, this review summarizes major progress in terrestrial C budget researches during the past decades, clarifies spatial patterns and drivers of terrestrial C sources and sinks in China and around the world, and examines the role of terrestrial C sinks in achieving carbon neutrality target. According to recent studies, the global terrestrial C sink has been increasing from a source of (-0.2 +/- 0.9) Pg C yr(-1) (1 Pg=10(15) g) in the 1960s to a sink of (1.9 +/- 1.1) Pg C yr(-1) in the 2010s. By synthesizing the published data, we estimate terrestrial C sink of 0.20-0.25 Pg C yr(-1) in China during the past decades, and predict it to be 0.15-0.52 Pg C yr(-1) by 2060. The terrestrial C sinks are mainly located in the mid- and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, while tropical regions act as a weak C sink or source. The C balance differs much among ecosystem types: forest is the major C sink; shrubland, wetland and farmland soil act as C sinks; and whether the grassland functions as C sink or source remains unclear. Desert might be a C sink, but the magnitude and the associated mechanisms are still controversial. Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration, nitrogen deposition, climate change, and land cover change are the main drivers of terrestrial C sinks, while other factors such as fires and aerosols would also affect ecosystem C balance. The driving factors of terrestrial C sink differ among regions. Elevated CO2 concentration and climate change are major drivers of the C sinks in North America and Europe, while afforestation and ecological restoration are additionally important forcing factors of terrestrial C sinks in China. For future studies, we recommend the necessity for intensive and long term ecosystem C monitoring over broad geographic scale to improve terrestrial biosphere models for accurately evaluating terrestrial C budget and its dynamics under various climate change and policy scenarios.

TI  - Forest use and vertical stratification in fruit-feeding butterflies of Sulawesi, Indonesia:: impacts for conservation
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Protected forest areas of Sulawesi are gradually being replaced by intensively used agroforestry systems and farmland, especially in lowland and sub-montane regions. Studies on the impact of these man-induced changes on biodiversity are of urgent conservation concern. We compared the fruit-feeding butterfly assemblage of a natural hill forest to that of a disturbed hill forest, representing a mosaic of old secondary forest and recently abandoned or active subsistence farms. Overall, species richness seemed highest in the disturbed site, but both abundance and diversity of endemic butterflies were significantly higher in the natural forest. Although the butterfly assemblage showed a clear vertical structure in the natural forest, vertical stratification was no longer pronounced at the disturbed site. Comparative studies based on diversity estimates from ground samples should consider not only the scale at which sampling is carried out and influences from nearby habitat patches in the surrounding landscape mosaic, but also possible behavioural changes in stratified species after forest modification. This study shows that higher overall species richness does not imply higher species distinctiveness, and indicates that the contribution of land-use systems to global biodiversity should be evaluated with caution, even when relatively high species richness estimates are found.

TI  - Biodiversity values of abandoned teak, Tectona grandis plantations in southern Western Ghats: Is there a need for management intervention?
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Abandoned plantations could potentially support a large number of native tree species through succession and restore the original tree community. In order to assess the ability of abandoned teak plantations to recover through regeneration, teak stands from 29 to 80 years old were sampled for seedling and sapling density, species richness and the use by large ungulates in the southern Western Ghats using 10 m circular plots. The influence of the forest-plantation edge was also studied. There was regeneration of a species-rich tree community in the understorey of abandoned teak plantations. However, regeneration was arrested, and thereby the large girth-class tree community remained species-poor. There was no significant change in the tree species richness with distance from natural forest, suggesting that the forest-plantation edge had little influence on the penetration of native tree species inside plantations. Asian elephant and Indian gaur dung densities were significantly lower in the plantations than in the forest. Indian gaur and sambar used the younger plantations intensively, and the density of their dung was negatively correlated with age of the plantation. Abandonment of mature teak stands arrested the succession of native trees. We provide evidence that abandoned teak plantations might not serve as suitable habitats for large herbivores during the dry months of the year in the region. The study highlights the need for active management of mature teak plantations inside wildlife reserves, in order to promote succession and improve the habitat for wild flora and fauna in the Western Ghats.

TI  - Conversion of rainforest into oil palm and rubber plantations affects the functional composition of litter and soil Collembola
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Rainforest conversion and expansion of plantations in tropical regions are associated with changes in animal communities and biodiversity decline. In soil, Collembola are one of the most numerous invertebrate groups that affect the functioning of microbial communities and support arthropod predators. Despite that, information on the impact of changes in land use in the tropics on species and trait composition of Collembola communities is very limited. We investigated the response of Collembola to the conversion of rainforest into rubber agroforestry ("jungle rubber"), rubber, and oil palm plantations in Jambi Province (Sumatra, Indonesia), a region which experienced one of the strongest recent deforestation globally. Collembola were sampled in 2013 and 2016 from the litter and soil layer using heat extraction, and environmental factors were measured (litter C/N ratio, pH, water content, composition of microbial community and predator abundance). In the litter layer, density and species richness in plantation systems were 25%-38% and 30%-40% lower, respectively, than in rainforest. However, in the soil layer, density, species richness, and trait diversity of Collembola were only slightly affected by land-use change, contrasting the response of many other animal groups. Species and trait composition of Collembola communities in litter and soil differed between each of the land-use systems. Water content and pH were identified as main factors related to the differences in species and trait composition in both litter and soil, followed by the density of micro- and macropredators. Dominant species of Collembola in rainforest and jungle rubber were characterized by small body size, absence of furca, and absence of intense pigmentation, while in plantations, larger species with long furca and diffuse or patterned pigmentation were more abundant. Overall, land-use change negatively affected Collembola communities in the litter layer, but its impact was lower in the soil layer. Several pantropical genera of Collembola (i.e., Isotomiella, Pseudosinella, and Folsomides) dominated across land-use systems, reflecting their high environmental adaptability and/or efficient dispersal, calling for studies on their ecology and genetic diversity. The decline in species richness and density of litter-dwelling Collembola with the conversion of rainforest into plantation systems calls for management practices mitigating negative effects of the deterioration of the litter layer in rubber plantations, but even more in oil palm plantations.

TI  - Identifying priority areas for Forest Landscape Restoration in Chiapas (Mexico): An operational approach combining ecological and socioeconomic criteria
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
AB  - The degradation of forest resources is a global issue and represents a considerable threat to both the functioning of ecosystems and the well-being of human communities. The recently introduced Forest Landscape Restoration approach focuses on building up a forest-based landscape that can improve biodiversity conservation, ecological functioning and the livelihoods of human communities. Reforestation, when properly planned, can mitigate the effects of the degradation process, protect biodiversity and enhance the provision of forest goods and services. To this purpose a sound identification of priority reforestation sites is fundamental. This study introduces a GIS-based methodology to identify reforestation priorities, design a number of landscape-scale reforestation options and evaluate them with respect to a set of ecological and socioeconomic criteria. The prioritisation is based on two main non-compensatory factors: the need for biodiversity conservation and the ecological feasibility of reforestation Suitability maps are generated for both factors through spatial multicriteria analysis and threshold pairs used to extract priority areas. The minimum suitability levels and the total area to be reforested are used as input parameters to generate a finite number of resulting reforestation options. These are assessed for their ability to conserve biodiversity and improve living conditions of local communities by introducing additional ecological and socioeconomic criteria. Finally, sensitivity analysis is used to test the robustness of the assessment. The methodology is applied to a case study in western Chiapas (Mexico) where conditions of forest degradation and widespread poverty occur. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - How do terrestrial wildlife communities respond to small-scale Acacia plantations embedded in harvested tropical forest?
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - To offset the declining timber supply by shifting towards more sustainable forestry practices, industrial tree plantations are expanding in tropical production forests. The conversion of natural forests to tree plantation is generally associated with loss of biodiversity and shifts towards more generalist and disturbance tolerant communities, but effects of mixed-landuse landscapes integrating natural and plantation forests remain little understood. Using camera traps, we surveyed the medium-to-large bodied terrestrial wildlife community across two mixed-landuse forest management areas in Sarawak, Malaysia Borneo which include areas dedicated to logging of natural forests and adjacent planted Acacia forests. We analyzed data from a 25-wildlife species community using a Bayesian community occupancy model to assess species richness and species-specific occurrence responses to Acacia plantations at a broad scale, and to remote-sensed local habitat conditions within the different forest landuse types. All species were estimated to occur in both landuse types, but species-level percent area occupied and predicted average local species richness were slightly higher in the natural forest management areas compared to licensed planted forest management areas. Similarly, occupancy-based species diversity profiles and defaunation indices for both a full community and only threatened and endemic species suggested the diversity and occurrence were slightly higher in the natural forest management areas. At the local scale, forest quality was the most prominent predictor of species occurrence. These associations with forest quality varied among species but were predominantly positive. Our results highlight the ability of a mixed-landuse landscape with small-scale Acacia plantations embedded in natural forests to retain terrestrial wildlife communities while providing an alternate source of timber. Nonetheless, there was a tendency towards reduced biodiversity in planted forests, which would likely be more pronounced in plantations that are larger or embedded in a less natural matrix.

TI  - Soil nutrients affect spatial patterns of aboveground biomass and emergent tree density in southwestern Borneo
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Studies on the relationship between soil fertility and aboveground biomass in lowland tropical forests have yielded conflicting results, reporting positive, negative and no effect of soil nutrients on aboveground biomass. Here, we quantify the impact of soil variation on the stand structure of mature Bornean forest throughout a lowland watershed (8-196 m a.s.l.) with uniform climate and heterogeneous soils. Categorical and bivariate methods were used to quantify the effects of (1) parent material differing in nutrient content (alluvium > sedimentary > granite) and (2) 27 soil parameters on tree density, size distribution, basal area and aboveground biomass. Trees >= 10 cm (diameter at breast height, dbh) were enumerated in 30 (0.16 ha) plots (sample area = 4.8 ha). Six soil samples (0-20 cm) per plot were analyzed for physiochemical properties. Aboveground biomass was estimated using allometric equations. Across all plots, stem density averaged 521 +/- 13 stems ha(-1), basal area 39.6 +/- 1.4 m(2) ha(-1) and aboveground biomass 518 +/- 28 Mg ha(-1) (mean +/- SE). Adjusted forest-wide aboveground biomass to account for apparent overestimation of large tree density (based on 69 0.3-ha transects; sample area = 20.7 ha) was 430 +/- 25 Mg ha(-1) stop. Stand structure did not vary significantly among substrates, but it did show a clear trend toward larger stature on nutrient-rich alluvium, with a higher density and larger maximum size of emergent trees. Across all plots, surface soil phosphorus (P), potassium, magnesium and percentage sand content were significantly related to stem density and/or aboveground biomass (R-Pearson = 0.368-0.416). In multiple linear regression, extractable P and percentage sand combined explained 31% of the aboveground biomass variance. Regression analyses on size classes showed that the abundance of emergent trees > 120 cm dbh was positively related to soil P and exchangeable bases, whereas trees 60-90 cm dbh were negatively related to these factors. Soil fertility thus had a significant effect on both total aboveground biomass and its distribution among size classes.

TI  - Forest certification in Amazonia: standards matter
T2  - ORYX
AB  - Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification promises international consumers that 'green-label' timber has been logged sustainably. However, recent research indicates that this is not true for ipe (Tabebuia spp.), currently flooding the US residential decking market, much of it logged in Brazil. Uneven or non-application of minimum technical standards for certification could undermine added value and eventually the certification process itself. We examine public summary reports by third-party certifiers describing the evaluation process for certified companies in the Brazilian Amazon to determine the extent to which standards are uniformly applied and the degree to which third-party certifier requirements for compliance are consistent among properties. Current best-practice harvest systems, combined with Brazilian legal norms for harvest levels, guarantee that no certified company or community complies with FSC criteria and indicators specifying species-level management. No guidelines indicate which criteria and indicators must be enforced, or to what degree, for certification to be conferred by third-party assessors; nor do objective guidelines exist for evaluating compliance for criteria and indicators for which adequate scientific information is not yet available to identify acceptable levels. Meanwhile, certified companies are expected to monitor the long-term impacts of logging on biodiversity in addition to conducting best-practice forest management. This burden should reside elsewhere. We recommend a clarification of 'sustained timber yield' that reflects current state of knowledge and practice in Amazonia. Quantifiable verifiers for best-practice forest management must be developed and consistently employed. These will need to be flexible to reflect the diversity in forest structure and dynamics that prevails across this vast region. We offer suggestions for how to achieve these goals.

TI  - Biodiversity Conservation and Indigenous Land Management in the Era of Self-Determination
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - Indigenous people inhabit approximately 85% of areas designated for biodiversity conservation worldwide. They also continue to struggle for recognition and preservation of cultural identities, lifestyles, and livelihoods-a struggle contingent on control and protection of traditional lands and associated natural resources (hereafter, self-determination). Indigenous lands and the biodiversity they support are increasingly threatened because of human population growth and per capita consumption. Application of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to tribal lands in the United States provides a rich example of the articulation between biodiversity conservation and indigenous peoples' struggle for self-determination. We found a paradoxical relationship whereby tribal governments are simultaneously and contradictorily sovereign nations; yet their communities depend on the U. S. government for protection through the federal-trust doctrine. The unique legal status of tribal lands, their importance for conserving federally protected species, and federal environmental regulations' failure to define applicability to tribal lands creates conflict between tribal sovereignty, self-determination, and constitutional authority. We reviewed Secretarial Order 3206, the U. S. policy on "American Indian tribal rights, federal-tribal trust responsibilities, and the ESA," and evaluated how it influences ESA implementation on tribal lands. We found improved biodiversity conservation and tribal self-determination requires revision of the fiduciary relationship between the federal government and the tribes to establish clear, legal definitions regarding land rights, applicability of environmental laws, and financial responsibilities. Such actions will allow provision of adequate funding and training to tribal leaders and resource managers, government agency personnel responsible for biodiversity conservation and land management, and environmental policy makers. Increased capacity, cooperation, and knowledge transfer among tribes and conservationists will improve biodiversity conservation and indigenous self-determination.

TI  - Timber production and plant Biodiversity conservation in a Costa Rican rain forest: An experimental study and its lessons for adaptive sustainability assessment
T2  - CRITERIA AND INDICATORS FOR SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT AT THE FOREST MANAGEMENT UNIT LEVEL
CP  - Conference on the Criteria and Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management at the Forest Management Unit Level
AB  - Progress towards sustainable forest management in the neotropics will eventually require greater emphasis on monitoring and an adaptive approach, for which baseline data on management effects on fundamentally important plant community characteristics are still required. During the first decade following intervention, a Costa Rican rain forest appeared resilient and productive, although mortality rates rose following silvicultural treatment. Intervention did not affect floristic diversity, but abundances of lianas and some non-commercial tree species were reduced. As in any forest, precaution and best practice can reduce some management impacts on plant biodiversity, and can be evaluated by input and process indicators. Some outcome indicators of floristic change, necessary for adaptive management, are costly to evaluate, and the case study casts doubt on the use of structural indicators as surrogates for floristic ones. Permanent sample plot protocols modified as in the case study, in combination with a focal species approach, are suggested for monitoring. Focal species would have priority if the robustness of floristic diversity is confirmed by further work. Policy and institutional mechanisms to make monitoring possible are urgently needed, and attributes of forest types (limited area, unusual characteristics and degree of threat) and management operations (type and intensity of intervention) should also be used in setting priorities for monitoring.

TI  - Soil organic carbon turnover following forest restoration in south China: Evidence from stable carbon isotopes
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - As over half of the world's tropical forests are reforested or afforested, understanding the resilience of carbon (C) pool in these forests is critical for global C balance. While most previous studies on the reforested lands have focused on C stock recovery, soil C turnover has largely been overlooked. We evaluated soil C turnover rate by calculating the isotopic enrichment factors of alpha (defined as the slope of the regression between the delta C-13 difference and /n-transferred C concentrations in mineral soil samples relative to the surface litter) and ji (defined as the slope of the regression between delta C-13 and log-transferred C concentrations) along 0-30 cm soil profiles in a 400-year-old monsoon evergreen broad-leaved forest (MEBF), a 51-year-old mixed-native plantation (NP1), a 31-year-old mixed-native plantation (NP2), a 31-year-old Acacia mangium plantation (AP), a 31-year-old mixedconifer plantation (CP), and a 31-year-old secondary forest with natural restoration (SF). Results showed that soil C stocks did not differ among the six forests. The estimated a values ranged from 1.0023 to 1.0086 and increased in the order of MEBF = NP1 < NP2 = AP = CP < SF. The estimated ji values ranged from -19.70 to -5.22 but showed an opposite trend to a values. Additionally, changes of the a and ji values among these forests were mainly regulated by soil water content and bulk density. Our findings demonstrate that forest restoration could enhance soil C stock equivalent to the undisturbed old-growth forests within a few decades, but the rate of soil C turnover in these restored forests were still higher.

TI  - Impacts of tropical selective logging on local-scale movements of understory birds
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Widespread selective logging in tropical forest causes structural damage and associated shifts in species composition, but we lack understanding of how selective logging impacts mechanistic processes that drive these biodiversity changes. Movement is a vital mechanistic process underpinning demographic, ecological, and evolutionary processes that likely determine species responses to logging. We assessed how tropical selective logging impacts local movements of 71 understory avian species in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, and determined whether movement patterns relate to species' conservation status, functional traits, sensitivity to logging and trophic position. We used a capture-mark-recapture methodology and a hierarchical Bayesian framework to model maximum observed local movement distances, accounting for spatial sampling heterogeneity. Across the avian community, we found a higher probability of moving shorter distances (up to 200 m) in logged forests, and higher movement probability at longer distances (above 200 m) in unlogged forests. Altered movement patterns after logging may reflect increased understory density, changed resource distribution and/or predation risks, and suggest smaller home-range sizes. Species' conservation status, body mass, foraging guild, logging sensitivity and trophic position were unrelated to the magnitude of movement change. The continued persistence of understory species in our sample after selective logging may depend on flexibility in movement behaviour, conferring resilience to habitat degradation and the retention of high conservation values. This lends further support for the protection of these logged forests for biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Contrasting range changes and drivers of four forest foundation species under future climate change in China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Forest foundation species, vital for shaping community structure and dynamics through non-trophic level interactions, are key to forest succession and sustainability. Despite their ecological importance, the habitat ranges of these species in China and their responses to future climate change remain unclear. Our study employed the optimal MaxEnt model to assess the range shifts and their essential drivers of four typical forest foundation species from three climatic zones in China under climate scenarios, including Acer tegmentosum, Acer pseudosieboldianum (temperate zone), Quercus glandulifera (subtropical zone), and Ficus hispida (tropical zone). The optimal MaxEnt model exhibited high evaluation indices (AUC values > 0.90) for the four foundation species, indicating excellent predictive performance. Currently, we observed that A. tegmentosum and A. pseudo-sieboldianum are predominantly inhabited temperate forest areas in northeastern China, Q. glandulifera is primarily concentrated in subtropical forests in southeastern China, and F. hispida is mainly distributed across the tropical forests in southern China. Climate factors, particularly temperature, emerged as the primary environmental factors influencing the potential range of forest foundation species. Moreover, precipitation strongly influenced the potential range of A. tegmentosum and A. pseudo-sieboldianum , while elevation exhibited a greater impact on the range of Q. glandulifera and F. hispida . Under future climate scenarios, suitable areas for A. tegmentosum and A. pseudo-sieboldianum tend to expand southward, F. hispida tends to expand northward, while Q. glandulifera exhibited a tendency to contract towards the center. This study advances our understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of forest foundation species in China under climate change, providing critical insights for conservation efforts and sustainable forest management practices.

TI  - Diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in undisturbed forest, slash-and-burn field, and monoculture forest of Indo-Burma megadiverse region
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Conversion of pristine forests to agricultural lands is one of the leading causes of biodiversity loss worldwide. To assess the impact of such forest disturbance on microbial diversity, we investigated the diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in the rich forests of Karbi Anglong hills of Assam, a biodiversity hotspot part of Indo-Burma region. AMF spore diversity was assessed in distinct study sites with different intensities of disturbances that encompassed a pristine undisturbed forest (UF), slash-and-burn field (SBF), and monoculture forest (MF). A total of 35 arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal species belonging to 9 genera were isolated. Species forming glomoid spores were dominant in all the three sites followed by acaulosporoid spores. Highest spore density was found in UF and lowest in MF. Multivariate analyses revealed similarity in UF and SBF. It was found that in MF, AMF diversity was significantly modified and reduced, resulting in an ecological degraded ecosystem. Our results show that natural UF and SBF contained similar and a high AM fungal diversity. The AM fungal diversity is not significantly affected by the slash-and-burn agricultural land use practices practised by the ethnic hilly tribes and, therefore, could be a component of a tropical forest "conservation-agriculture matrix.'' Also because of the high generic and species diversity found, this region can be considered as AMF hotspot and a priority place for conservation.

TI  - Responses of bird functional communities to anthropogenic disturbances in the naturally fragmented Southern Mistbelt Forests in the Midlands of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Forest disturbance poses major threats to biodiversity and forest ecosystem processes. Understanding bird species' responses to disturbed forests is important for species conservation and forest management. Here, we assessed the impact of selective logging history (similar to 150 years), livestock grazing, alien plant invasion and adjacent matrix-type surrounding forest patches on bird species richness and functional diversity in 14 Southern Mistbelt Forest patches in the Midlands of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The bird communities were surveyed using fixedradius point-counts. We quantified functional diversity using three functional indices functional richness, functional divergence, and functional evenness. None of the disturbance types assessed affected the richness of bird species. The size of the forest patch affected bird species. For functional diversity, FRic was significantly higher in disturbed forest patches for forest specialists, insectivores and cup or ball-nesting birds. Functional evenness for the forest-sensitive groups, like forest specialists and insectivores, was significantly lower in disturbed sites. The results of this study showed that responses of functional communities and forest specialist bird species varied depending on disturbance type and intensity. We recommend that future studies assessing forest disturbance impacts on bird species use taxonomic proxies with different functional diversity indices for forest bird species conservation and management.

T2  - REVISTA CUBANA DE CIENCIAS FORESTALES
AB  - In order to characterize the composition and structure of the forest formations of the Commune, Pital, Buffer zone of the Machalilla National Park, the structural characterization of four localities of the equatorial dry forest belonging to two plant formations was carried out, the spiny tropical hill and the premontane spiny mountain that go from 40 to 460 msnm. For the investigation, 28 temporary sampling plots of 50 x 20 m (0.10 ha) were established, the tree species e" 10 cm of DAP were measured. A total of 1,346 individuals represented in 89 species belonging to 82 genera and 42 families were identified and evaluated. The localities were compared statistically in terms of wealth, composition, structure and diversity. High alpha and beta diversity were found; Height above sea level, basal area and density are the variables that most influence the segregation of four types of forests that differ in their composition and forest structure. Significant, promising and rare species were identified, with the most important species being Cordia alliodora, Nectandra acutifolia and Ficus velutina. The family with the most species and genera is Fabaceae. Most individuals (58%) were recorded in the 10-20 cm diameter class for all four locations. The results obtained will allow projects aimed at sustainable forest management through the application of methods for ecological restoration and conservation of these tropical forests.

TI  - Anthropogenic Impacts on Bark and Ambrosia Beetle Assemblages in Tropical Montane Forest in Northern Borneo
T2  - INSECTS
AB  - Anthropogenic disturbances, such as forest conversion, have a profound impact on species distributions and biodiversity in tropical forests. This study aimed to determine the diversity and distribution of bark and ambrosia beetles (Curculionidae: Scolytinae and Platypodinae) across three forest types: Primary Forest (PF), Disturbed Forest (DF), and Rubber Plantation (RP) in southern Sabah, Malaysia. We analyzed biweekly data obtained from ethanol-baited traps over three years, from April 2017 to May 2020, which included 7257 individuals from 154 species. The dominant species remained the same across all forest types. However, species composition was highly stochastic and unpredictable between forest types. The abundance and number of species were highest in RP but lowest in DF. Indigenous forest use in DF mostly for fuel likely reduced the resources for the beetles. Open canopy structure in RP probably increased the number of flying beetles. Although adjacent to PF, RP displayed a distinct species composition predominantly associated with rubber trees. These findings underscore the anthropogenic impact on beetle assemblages due to forest use and emphasize the need for sustainable forest management practices to prevent biodiversity loss and maintain ecosystem stability.

TI  - Use of woody species in the Caatinga dry forest may lead to higher vulnerability to extirpation: An assessment based on ethnobiological, reproductive and conservation criteria
T2  - FLORA
AB  - Tropical forests play an important role in maintaining, replenishing and conserving a large portion of the planet's biodiversity. However, these forests have been converted into anthropic landscapes, threatening the persistence of wildlife. The exploitation of forest products can result in different ecological impacts at different levels of biological organization. In this study, we propose a vulnerability index to examine the susceptibility of woody plants used by locals in a human-modified landscape of the Caatinga dry forest (i.e., the Catimbau National Park). We contrasted patterns of (1) plant use by local people (risk of use, collection risk, local importance, and diversity of use), (2) plant reproductive strategies (pollination, sexual and reproductive systems, dispersal mode, flowering and fruiting phenology), and (3) the conservation status of the plant species. We combined this information to propose a vulnerability index expressing species sensitivity to human disturbances in 14 regenerating and 14 old-growth forest stands. We tested the hypothesis that regenerating forest stands will harbor more vulnerable plant species compared to old-growth forest stands. Among the 119 plant species registered in regenerating and old-growth forest stands, 80 species (67.2 %) were recorded as useful for local people in Caatinga. Specifically, about 71.8 % and 70.5 % are exploited by the rural population for some type of use in regenerating and old-growth forest stands, respectively. The most frequent type of use was medicinal, followed by construction and fuel in both regenerating and old-growth forest stands. Regarding the potentially collected plant parts, the total removal of the individual and collection of leaves exhibited similar and higher relevance in regenerating, while leaves were the most collected part in old-growth forest stands. Of the 80 plant species analyzed, 62 % and 58.5 %, respectively, were classified as exhibiting moderate and high vulnerability to extirpation in regenerating and old-growth forest stands; thus not supporting our hypothesis. Our results suggest that in the Caatinga dry forest, (1) woody plant species responsible for forest regeneration in the context of slash- and-burn agriculture are exploited for multiple uses, (2) medicinal use is the main type of use of woody plants occurring in regenerating and old-growth forest stands, (3) total removal of the individual and collection of leaves were the most collected plant parts, and (4) both regenerating and old-growth forest stands showed a high vulnerability to human disturbances in the study area. In the long term, the exploitation of vulnerable plant species may negatively affect the composition and structure of the community and, consequently, the rate and trajectory of succession. It can be expected that as populations of vulnerable plant species are reduced or extirpated from the community, ecological interactions such as pollination and dispersal, which are key to ecosystem maintenance, will change along with the services provided.

TI  - Land use effects on tree species diversity and soil properties of the Awudua Forest, Ghana
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Rubber plantation establishment is a common land use that can profoundly impact plant diversity and soil properties in tropical forest ecosystems, although empirical data on such effects are scarce in tropical Africa. In this study, we examined the effects of this land use on tree species diversity and soil physicochemical properties of the Awudua Forest in Ghana. We surveyed 60 25 m x 25 m plots, 20 in each of three land uses (i.e., primary forest, secondary forest and rubber plantation) of the study area. Within each plot, we identified and enumerated all trees (>= 10 cm diameter at breast height, dbh at 1.3 m) and collected soil samples at three depths (i.e., 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm) for the determination of soil physicochemical properties (bulk density, particle size distribution, pH, OC, TN, AP, K, Mg, Ca). Soil physicochemical properties; sand, OC, AP, K, Mg, Ca in the rubber plantation decreased by 4.4%, 24.9%, 40.0%, 16.7%, 50.0% and 20.2% respectively, whereas the primary forest recorded decreases in OC (42.2%), TN (25%), AP (71.1%), K (69%), Mg (59.6%), Ca (27%) from the surface to the sub layers. Results showed significantly lower tree species richness (S, 12), diversity (H', 0.37), evenness (E, 0.43), and basal area (BA, 2.86 m(2)/ha) in the rubber plantation compared to those of the secondary forest (36, 1.10, 0.85 and 0.93 m(2) ha(-1), respectively) and the primary forest (46, 2.28, 0.97, and 3.32 m(2) ha(-1), respectively). Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination also revealed distinct tree species composition among the land uses. Terminalia ivorensis (IVI = 7.1%), Musanga cecropoides (28.91%) and Hevea brasiliensis (72.03%) were the most dominant species in the primary forest, secondary forest and plantation respectively. Soil OC, TN, K, AP, Mg and bulk density differed among the land uses, but no differences were observed in pH and Ca. The findings confirmed the strong negative impacts of rubber plantation land use on plant diversity and soil properties, suggesting the need for mitigation measures such as afforestation and offsetting to ensure sustainable utilization and conservation of biodiversity in the reserve.

TI  - Modeling and Mapping Agroforestry Aboveground Biomass in the Brazilian Amazon Using Airborne Lidar Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Agroforestry has large potential for carbon (C) sequestration while providing many economical, social, and ecological benefits via its diversified products. Airborne lidar is considered as the most accurate technology for mapping aboveground biomass (AGB) over landscape levels. However, little research in the past has been done to study AGB of agroforestry systems using airborne lidar data. Focusing on an agroforestry system in the Brazilian Amazon, this study first predicted plot-level AGB using fixed-effects regression models that assumed the regression coefficients to be constants. The model prediction errors were then analyzed from the perspectives of tree DBH (diameter at breast height)height relationships and plot-level wood density, which suggested the need for stratifying agroforestry fields to improve plot-level AGB modeling. We separated teak plantations from other agroforestry types and predicted AGB using mixed-effects models that can incorporate the variation of AGB-height relationship across agroforestry types. We found that, at the plot scale, mixed-effects models led to better model prediction performance (based on leave-one-out cross-validation) than the fixed-effects models, with the coefficient of determination (R-2) increasing from 0.38 to 0.64. At the landscape level, the difference between AGB densities from the two types of models was similar to 10% on average and up to similar to 30% at the pixel level. This study suggested the importance of stratification based on tree AGB allometry and the utility of mixed-effects models in modeling and mapping AGB of agroforestry systems.

TI  - Rainforest-restoration success as judged by assemblages of soil- and litterd-welling mites (Arachnida: Acari)
T2  - ACAROLOGY XIII: PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS
CP  - 13th International Congress of Acarology (ICA)
AB  - Decline in rainforest cover in many areas of Australia is being countered by various methods of forest reestablishment, including ecological restoration plantings, timber plantations, and unmanaged regrowth. We used assemblages of soil-and litter-dwelling mites to determine which style most closely recaptures the assemblage structure of mites associated with intact rainforest at 84 tropical and subtropical sites in eastern Australia. The six habitat types surveyed were pasture (the typical 'pre-restoration' state), unmanaged regrowth, monoculture forestry, multi-species forestry, ecological restoration and intact rainforest (the 'target'state). Forestry and ecological restoration sites were 5-20 years old. Mites were extracted from soil/litter samples and (excluding Oribatida) identified to family or to finer levels. For two diverse but taxonomically difficult superfamilies characteristic of rainforest, Uropodoidea and Trombidioidea, identification was to morphotaxon. Presence/absence data were analyzed in several ways. First, we used our data to create a list of 'indicator taxa' for pasture and rainforest, and determined the abundance of these indicators in each of the four reforestation methods. We also calculatedmorphotaxon richness for uropodoids and trombidioids and compared these values among habitat types. In both of these analyses, ecological restoration was most similar to rainforest. We used ordination and ANOSIM to compare mite assemblages among habitat-types. Although mite assemblages clearly distinguished between rainforest and pasture sites, they did not identify any of the four reforestation methods as being consistently similar to rainforest. They did, however, indicate that monoculture forestry and multi-species forestry plantations were often not readily distinguishable from pasture. This may have as much to do with silvicultural methods common to these plantations (e.g., pruning, herbicide application, and maintenance of a relatively open canopy) as to the low diversity of trees present in plantations. We conclude with a brief discussion of the utility of mites in rapid bioassessment programs in Australia, and suggest that the most pragmatic approach involves focusing on a few easily recognized indicators rather than on entire assemblages.

TI  - Stone walls and sacred forest conservation in Ethiopia
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Many tropical forests worldwide are protected due to their sacredness to religious communities. In the south Gondar region of Ethiopia, most of the remaining native forests are tiny fragments (5.42 ha +/- 0.34) surrounded by pasture and agriculture that are protected because they encompass churches of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church (EOTC). A small number of communities have erected stone walls around the perimeter of the forests to demarcate the boundary, and/or protect the interior of the forest. We evaluated the effectiveness of these walls at protecting ecological conditions by examining tree and seedling communities among sacred forests with and without walls in Montane and Upper Montane sites. We found the wall to be an effective conservation tool as regeneration potential was higher in forests with a wall. The density and species richness of seedlings were significantly higher in forests with a wall and these effects were more pronounced in Upper Montane forests. Forests with a wall also had seedlings of many native tree species that were not found in forests without walls. As expected, there were few differences in tree communities in forests with and without a wall. Although rare on the landscape, the presence of a stone wall around these forests was effective at protecting the seedling community because it likely reduced access to the forests by grazers and directed human visitors to trails. The use of a stone wall may protect seedling communities in other sacred forest fragments, particularly for those that are small, isolated, surrounded by agriculture, and have a depleted seed bank.

TI  - Monitoring of a Seedling Planting Restoration in a Permanent Preservation Area of the Southeast Atlantic Forest Biome, Brazil
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - The Atlantic Forest biome is a biodiversity hotspot with only 13% of its native vegetation cover remaining in Brazil. Forest restoration is an important process for the re-establishment of biodiversity and the preservation of water resources in degraded areas, like riparian forests. Monitoring is an essential step of restoration, because the periodic evaluation of indicators allows researchers to analyze the effectiveness of applied techniques. This study aimed to evaluate the environmental quality of a seedling planting (active restoration) in a Permanent Preservation Area (PPA) of the Southeast Atlantic Forest biome, through a monitoring protocol, within a year. More specifically, we aimed to investigate the following questions: (1) do some ecological groups or families grow more than others? and (2) is the cover of exotic grasses negatively influencing forest regeneration? Data were collected during November 2017 and April (interval represents five months of wet season) and October 2018 (six months of dry season). Eight plots of 9 x 18 m were established and all individuals were identified and measured (diameter at ground level (DGL), height (H), and canopy diameter (CD)). Exotic grass cover and richness of regenerating species were also recorded. We registered 119 individuals during the three inventories, distributed in 35 species and 14 families. Results indicate an inverse association between exotic grasses and the presence of recruits in the area. Thus, exotic grass control may be needed while the forest canopy is not closed. A significant growth of individuals in the whole study period, especially during the wet season, was detected. Legumes grew more in trunk and canopy diameter (Anadenanthera colubrina (Vell.) Brenan and Inga vera Willd. subsp. affinis (DC.) T. D. Penn. had the biggest growth, respectively) than non-legumes during wetter months and within a year. Pioneers had greater height increase compared to non-pioneers only during wetter months. Legumes may be important species to be used in other young tropical forest restoration areas.

TI  - Land change in the central Albertine rift: Insights from analysis and mapping of land use-land cover change in north-western Rwanda
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - Land change was assessed in the Albertine rift region (ARR) using its central section of north-western Rwanda as case study. This region is one of Africa's most ecologically sensitive environments under severe pressure from human activities. The study maps and quantifies the spatial extent of land use-land cover (LULC) changes between 1987 and 2016 from Landsat images. Transitions between five major land classes were identified in order to understand the trajectory of observed changes. In terms of gains, the forest class, the urban built-up and bare land class increased by 9% and 4% respectively over the study period. The gains of forest were mainly derived from the afforestation of some agricultural lands in the southern part, whereas the gains of built-up and bare lands were mostly from cultivated land which was a net losing class. Forest increase is in line with government's policy to increase the national forest cover to 30% by 2020. Forest losses occurred mostly outside protected areas due to land conversion for settlement and agricultural purposes. Much needed information about changes in LULC over the last three decades is provided. This study demonstrates in a timely manner how to analyse and monitor LULC change and the drivers in an environment where field based research is a challenge due to the mountainous terrain. The ecological richness of the region, which coincides with heightened human population pressure, necessitates the monitoring of land change as input for improving land use planning with focus on conserving biodiversity.

TI  - A framework for integrating biodiversity concerns into national REDD+ programmes
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - The UNFCCC mechanism for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation in developing countries (REDD+) represents an unprecedented opportunity for the conservation of forest biodiversity. Nevertheless, there are widespread concerns surrounding the possibility of negative environmental outcomes if biodiversity is not given adequate consideration throughout the REDD+ process. We propose a general framework for incorporating biodiversity concerns into national REDD+ programmes based on well-established ecological principles and experiences. First, we identify how biodiversity distribution and threat data, together with data on biodiversity responses to forest change and management, can be readily incorporated into the strategic planning process for REDD+ in order to identify priority areas and activities for investment that will deliver returns for both carbon and biodiversity. Second, we propose that assessments of changes in biodiversity following REDD+ implementation could be greatly facilitated by paralleling, where possible, the existing IPCC architecture for assessing carbon emissions. A three-tiered approach is proposed for biodiversity assessment, where lower tiers can provide a realistic starting point for countries with fewer data and lower technical capacities. Planning and assessment of biodiversity safeguards for REDD+ need not overburden an already encumbered UNFCCC process. Immediate progress is already possible for a large number of developing countries, and a gradual, phased approach to implementation would minimise risks and facilitate the protection of additional biodiversity benefits from REDD+ activities. Greater levels of coordination between the UNFCCC and CBD, as well as other agencies and stakeholder groups interested in forest conservation are needed if biodiversity safeguards are to be fully adopted and implemented.

TI  - NDVI - alpha diversity relationship in tropical montane cloud forest of Ecuador
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - In tropical forest the biodiversity is in a constant threat, some species are listed in the IUCN as vulnerable, endangered or threatened with extinction. Thus, a fast method for biodiversity determination or monitoring can contribute to its conservation. Remote sensing has demonstrated to be a powerful tool, and together with the vegetation indexes, can determine the vegetation state of forest. Recently researches have correlated the normalized differentiated vegetation index (NDVI) with species richness, structure and biodiversity of forests obtaining successful results.
   This study, conducted in a Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (TMCF) of Ecuador, aims to correlate NDVI with alpha diversity estimators to understand its relationships. NDVI of Landsat OLI 8 Level 1 images in five months was determined. We considered a scene as valid in case of cloud coverage in the areas of interest below 25%. Radiometric and atmospheric corrections, with flaash tool, and the delimitation of the study site (ROI) were developed in ENVI 5.3 program. NDVI was calculated with ENVI 5.3 program (histograms allowed the determination of mean, maximum and minimum NDVI), and with ArcGIS 10.3 (for classification index). In field, species richness, Chao1, Shannon index, Simpson index, and biomass of three plots were quantified for trees with D13H >= 10 cm. Then, we calculate Pearson coefficient to correlate and disentangle the effects of altitude, diversity, richness, biomass and N DV I. A positive relationship was observed between Mean NDVI and Chao1 (p < 0.10) and Mean NDVI - richness (p < 0.05). In conclusion, NDVI can be considered useful to estimate richness and biodiversity and even to detect ecotone as was the case in this research. The application of this methodology could allow biodiversity assessment and monitoring in real time and low cost, which contributes in forest conservation programs.

TI  - Spatial variation in human disturbances and their effects on forest structure and biodiversity across an Afromontane forest
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB  - Context Human disturbances can have large impacts on forest structure and biodiversity, and thereby result in forest degradation, a property difficult to detect by remote sensing. Objectives To investigate spatial variation in anthropogenic disturbances and their effects on forest structure and biodiversity. Methods In 144 plots of 20 x 20 m distributed across a forest area of 750 km(2) in Southwest Ethiopia, we recorded: landscape variables (e.g., distance to forest edge), different human disturbances, forest structure variables, and species composition of trees and epiphyllous bryophytes. We then first assessed if landscape variables could explain the spatial distribution of disturbances. Second, we analysed how forest structure and biodiversity were influenced by disturbances. Results Human disturbances, such as coffee management and grazing declined with distance to forest edges, and penetrated at least a kilometer into the forest. Slope was not related to disturbance levels, but several types of disturbances were less common at higher elevations. Among human disturbance types, coffee management reduced liana cover and was associated with altered species composition of trees. The presence of large trees and basal area were not related to any of the disturbance gradients. Conclusions Although most anthropogenic disturbances displayed clear edge effects, surprisingly the variation in the chosen forest degradation indices were only weakly related to these disturbances. We suggest that the intersection between edge effects and forest degradation is very context specific and relies much on how particular societies use the forests. For example, in this landscape coffee management seems to be a key driver.

TI  - Change in Land Use Affects Soil Organic Carbon Dynamics and Distribution in Tropical Systems
T2  - SOIL SYSTEMS
AB  - Anthropogenic land cover change is directly responsible for the deforestation and degradation of tropical forests. In this context, assessing soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks is key to understanding the impact of anthropogenic activities on SOC so that we can implement management practices that effectively reduce emissions or promote carbon sequestration. Our objective was to assess the effect of land-use change on the dynamics and distribution of SOC in three systems (agriculture, pasture and agroforestry) after 40 years of deforestation in a tropical dry forest in the central-eastern region of Honduras. For this purpose, the bulk density, percentage of coarse fragments (>2 mm) and soil organic carbon content were determined at three depths (0.00-0.10 m, 0.10-0.20 m and 0.20-0.30 m). The results showed an increase in bulk density for all new uses, although soil compaction had not yet occurred. In terms of total soil organic carbon (TOC) stocks, deforestation caused a decrease from 17% to 48% in agricultural and agroforestry soils, respectively; on the other hand, grasslands did not show significant differences compared to tropical dry forest, suggesting that they have a high potential as carbon sinks in deforested tropical areas. However, this did not imply a better state of the system, as the greatest increases in bulk density were found in pastures.

TI  - Diversity and ecosystem functioning: Litter decomposition dynamics in the Atlantic Rainforest
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - The relationship between ecosystem functioning and species diversity is important for conservation and restoration management of endangered ecosystems. Here we experimentally analysed the effects of tree species richness and composition on the fundamental ecosystem process of leaf litter decomposition in the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest. We measured the decomposition rates of leaf litter of eight broad-leaved, native tree species either individually or in mixtures of two, four, or six species. Additionally, we analysed the effect of macro- and meso-invertebrate exclusion using coarse- and fine-meshed litter bags. Species composition, but not species richness, significantly influenced litter decomposition rates. Invertebrate exclusion also influenced litter decomposition, although this effect varied between species and mixtures. Overall, litter decomposition dynamics was non-additive, i.e. observed decomposition rates of litter mixtures differed from what would be expected from the decomposition rates of their component species. However, there were also differences between mixtures, which could be at least partly attributed to the varying influence of invertebrates. We conclude that the relationship between the decomposition subsystem and species diversity in the Atlantic Rainforest follows the idiosyncratic response hypothesis and not the rivet hypothesis. For conservation or reforestation management, our results emphasise the need to maintain or restore the composition of locally native tree species communities rather than to maintain only a high tree species richness.

TI  - Effects of an invasive tree on community structure and diversity in a tropical forest in Puerto Rico
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - We report the effects of an invasive tree (Syzgium jambos, Myrtaceace) on species composition, plant diversity patterns, and forest regeneration in primary and secondary forest in the Luquillo Mountains of northeastern Puerto Rico, including the area in and around the Caribbean National Forest (CNF) and the Luquillo Long Term Ecological Research site (Luquillo LTER). Land use history was reconstructed using aerial photographs from 1936 to 1989 and study sites were categorized into four groups that corresponded to their status in 1936: unforested, young secondary. mature secondary, and primary forests. In randomly selected forest stands in each forest type, we measured the abundance of invasive and native tree species, seedling recruitment for S. jambos as well as soil nutrient pools and tested for the effects of land use history on S. jambos density and diversity. A partial Mantel test was used to control for historical and elevational differences across study sites. The results indicate that S. jambos density was highest in habitats classified in 1936 as unforested, young, or mature secondary forests. Compared to all other forest classes, species diversity was significantly higher in primary forests. However, there was no statistically significant difference between observed and estimated species richness across the four forest types. S. jambos density and species diversity were strongly negatively correlated. even after controlling for land use history and elevation. There was significantly higher S. jambos seedling recruitment in areas that were either unforested or had young secondary forests in 1936. The results also indicate that S. jambos is able to establish viable populations in habitats with different soil nutrient status. S. jambos has also altered vegetation composition and diversity patterns in habitats where it is the dominant tree species. After nearly 185 years since its introduction to the island, S. jambos is not only well established within 30 in of stream channels. its presence does not appear to be limited by topographic, soil nutrient, or elevational conditions. This study suggests that land use change and subsequent plant invasions have produced a new vegetation assemblage that has led to potentially long-term changes in community structure, species composition. and successional trajectory in regenerating secondary forests in the Luquillo Mountains.

TI  - Demographic effects of collecting rattan cane and their implications for sustainable harvesting
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - Rattan, Old World climbing palm, is an extremely valuable nontimber forest product whose canes are gathered for both market and nonmarket uses. I evaluated the effects, of harvesting commercial rattan, Calamus zollingeri Becc., on genet survival and ramet demography in two primary forest sites near Lore Lindu National Park in Sulawesi, Indonesia. I monitored 168 permanently marked C. zollingeri genets for 4 years and surveyed random transects for C. zollingeri genet and ramet populations and evidence of cane harvesting in 1996 and 2000. Cane harvesting had no significant effect on genet survival or mean ramet densities. However, current cane extraction rates significantly reduced mean cane lengths and total available cane throughout the study period. Based on observed genet and ramet populations and average cane growth rates area during the stud of 1.4 m/year, the sustained-yield harvesting potential of C. zollingeri is approximately 101 m and 56 m/ha/year in the two study sites. Although C. zollingeri exhibits life-history traits well suited to sustained-yield harvesting, including production of multiple canes, cane resprouting following harvest, rapid cane growth, and widespread abundance below 1100 m, current harvest rates exceed growth and yield, and supplies of cane are being depleted. Rattan harvesting is widespread in Lore Lindu National Park. Approximately 18% of the park (42,000 ha) is likely subject to intensive and unsustainable extraction of C. zollingeri.

TI  - Habitat Associations and Community Structure of Dipterocarps in Response to Environment and Soil Conditions in Brunei Darussalam, Northwest Borneo
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Plant habitat associations are well documented in Bornean lowland tropical forests, but few studies contrast the prevalence of associations across sites. We examined habitat associations and community composition of Dipterocarpaceae trees in two contrasting Bornean lowland mixed dipterocarp forests separated by approximately 100 similar to km: Andulau (uniform topography, lower altitudinal range, sandy soils) and Belalong (highly dissected topography, higher altitudinal range, clay-rich soils). Dipterocarpaceae trees =similar to 1 similar to cm diameter at breast height (dbh) were censused in 20-m wide belt transects established along topographic gradients at each site. Dipterocarp density, evenness, species richness, and diversity were significantly higher at Andulau than Belalong. Significant site associations (with either Andulau or Belalong) were detected for 19 (52%) of the 37 dipterocarp species tested. Dipterocarpaceae community composition at Belalong correlated with soil nutrient concentrations as well as measures of vegetation and topographic structure, but community composition at Andulau correlated with fewer habitat variables. Within each site, dipterocarp density, species richness, and diversity were consistently higher on ridges than in slopes and valleys. Significant within-site associations to topographic habitats were less common at Andulau (10% of species tested) than at Belalong (15%). We conclude that edaphic and other environmental factors influence dipterocarp community composition at a local scale, and are more important drivers of community structure in the more variable environment at Belalong. Species richness and diversity of dipterocarps on small plots, however, were higher at Andulau, suggesting that factors other than environmental heterogeneity contribute to contrasts in dipterocarp tree species richness at small scales.

TI  - Altitudinal and aspect-driven variations in soil carbon storage potential in sub-tropical Himalayan forest ecosystem: assisting nature to combat climate change
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB  - Forest soils serve as the greatest sink of terrestrial carbon (C) and have a significant impact on worldwide or regional C cycling. By reducing emissions and enhancing the C storage in forests, the environmental monitoring function of a forest ecosystem may be ensured. The study focused on measuring the densities of major nutrients in soil to gain insight into the C and nitrogen dynamics of the Himalayan sub-tropical forest ecosystem of India besides supplementing the information about the C storage potential of these forest soils. The study examined the physico-chemical properties and nutrient densities across three altitudinal ranges viz., 600-800 m (A(1)), 800-1000 m (A(2)) and 1000-1200 m (A(3)) and two aspects, i.e. Northern (N) and Southern (S) in a randomized complete block design and data collection was done from 24 main sample plots (3 altitudinal ranges x 2 aspects x 4 replications). The soil pH, electrical conductivity, and bulk density observed a decreasing pattern with an increase in altitude, whereas a reverse trend was observed in soil organic C (SOC), total nitrogen and available phosphorus. The SOC and total nitrogen densities ranged from 20.08 to 48.35 Mg ha(-1) and 2.56 to 4.01 Mg ha(-1), respectively in an increasing trend from A(1) to A(3). The northern aspect exhibited significantly higher SOC and nitrogen densities than the southern aspects. The C storage potential of forest soils followed the order A(1) < A(2) < A(3) with significantly higher potential (nearly 1.5 times) compared to those on the southern aspect. There was a consistently significant increase in the C:N ratio (CNR) with a maximum value (10.51) at A(3) and minimum value (8.37) at A(1), however the effect of aspect remained insignificant. This research underscores the importance of considering altitude and aspect when planning forest restoration efforts, as these factors have a substantial influence on soil properties, C storage potential and CNR. Understanding the significance of CNR is critical, as it serves as a key indicator of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from forest soils. Ultimately, these findings empower policymakers and conservationists to make informed decisions that can contribute to the sustainable management of Himalayan forests and the global fight against climate change.

TI  - Reconciling policy instruments with drivers of deforestation and forest degradation: cross-scale analysis of stakeholder perceptions in tropical countries
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Cross-scale studies combining information on policy instruments and on drivers of deforestation and forest degradation are key to design and implement effective forest protection measures. We investigated the scale and country dependency of stakeholder perceptions about future threats to tropical forests (e.g. agriculture, logging, woodfuel) and preferred policy instruments (e.g. reforestation, protected areas, combat illegal logging), by interviewing 224 representatives of forest-related institutions. We conducted analysis of variance and principal component analysis for eighteen variables across three countries (Zambia, Ecuador and the Philippines) and four spatial levels (from international to local). We found that the overall alertness about commercial drivers and the confidence in policy instruments are significantly lower at subnational levels and also in Zambia. Stakeholder expectations about the most important drivers and the most effective policies in the coming decade follow regional narratives, suggesting that there are no one-size-fits-all solutions in international forest policy. However, we found an unexpected consensus across scales, indicating potential for collaboration between institutions operating at different geographical levels. Overall, agriculture remains the driver with the highest expected influence (43%), while a strong favoritism for reforestation and forest restoration (38%) suggests a paradigm shift from protected areas to a stronger focus on integrative approaches.

TI  - Social and Environmental Impacts of Forest Management Certification in Indonesia
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - In response to unsustainable timber production in tropical forest concessions, voluntary forest management certification programs such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) have been introduced to improve environmental, social, and economic performance over existing management practices. However, despite the proliferation of forest certification over the past two decades, few studies have evaluated its effectiveness. Using temporally and spatially explicit village-level data on environmental and socio-economic indicators in Kalimantan (Indonesia), we evaluate the performance of the FSC-certified timber concessions compared to non-certified logging concessions. Employing triple difference matching estimators, we find that between 2000 and 2008 FSC reduced aggregate deforestation by 5 percentage points and the incidence of air pollution by 31%. It had no statistically significant impacts on fire incidence or core areas, but increased forest perforation by 4 km(2) on average. In addition, we find that FSC reduced firewood dependence (by 33%), respiratory infections (by 32%) and malnutrition (by 1 person) on average. By conducting a rigorous statistical evaluation of FSC certification in a biodiversity hotspot such as Indonesia, we provide a reference point and offer methodological and data lessons that could aid the design of ongoing and future evaluations of a potentially critical conservation policy.

TI  - Impact of forest disturbance and land use change on soil and litter arthropod assemblages in tropical rainforest margins
T2  - STABILITY OF TROPICAL RAINFOREST MARGINS: LINKING ECOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONSTRAINTS OF LAND USE AND CONSERVATION
CP  - International Symposium on Stability of Tropical Rainforest Margins
AB  - Land use intensification at rainforest margins increases the pressure on the primary rainforest ecosystem, known for its high biodiversity and important functional role in global climate and carbon balances. Studying this system at different levels of disturbance increases our knowledge about its stability and mechanisms of diversity changes. While most studies investigating the effects of disturbance on animal populations focus on canopy communities, the present study reviews the driving factors for soil and litter arthropod communities. In addition, results from a study along a land use gradient in Central Sulawesi (Indonesia) will be discussed.
   Within natural forests, litter composition, patchiness and especially litter abundance seem to be key factors driving litter arthropod diversity and densities, by creating microhabitats for many species and individuals. With increasing levels of disturbance in tropical forests, and with forest conversion into agroforestry and agricultural systems, soil/litter temperature and moisture levels become extremely important, leading to reduced densities and species richness. Changes of soil pH, a reduction of the litter habitat and increased anthropogenic disturbance via site management practices add to degradation. In the present study, litter arthropod communities were compared between three levels of forest use (none, small and large timber extraction) and two types of cacao plantations (under natural shade trees and under a polyculture of planted shade trees). The negative effects of increasing gap fraction and thus increasing temperatures accompanied by decreasing moisture levels and litter depth could be confirmed. Abundances of Collembola, Oribatida and Symphyla in litter and soil and the number of ant species in the litter declined with increasing land use intensity. In contrast, spider density and ant activity increased when natural forest sites were compared with the two types of cacao plantations. This can be explained by the shifting community structure of these two taxa, indicating that few, but abundant species of open habitats, such as Lycosidae, were replacing forest species. Surprisingly, the decline in microarthropod abundances along the land use gradient was not linearly correlated with decreasing moisture and litter depth or increasing temperature or litter quality (C-to-N ratio). Rather low microarthropod densities were already measured in little disturbed natural forest sites with small timber extraction. A similar pattern was observed for fungal abundances and root production, indicating that even small levels of disturbance influence the litter and soil system in tropical forests. On the one hand, changing micro-climate, limited litter space, reduced availability of microbial resources and increased disturbance by plot maintenance inhibit higher densities of litter and soil animal populations. On the other hand, the simplified habitat structure favours populations of open habitats, especially predatory groups adapted to higher temperatures and/or lower soil moisture. It has to be investigated how a reduction of decomposers and an increase in predators could influence pest control and thus yields in these agroforestry systems.

TI  - Seed Rain in a Tropical Dry Forest and Adjacent Home Gardens in the Yucatan
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - Tropical home gardens are widely recognized as reservoirs of biodiversity. Typically, Maya home gardens have an area of intensive management and one of extensive management. In the latter, some wild plant species may find safe sites for establishment, since they exhibit a high degree of similarity (in terms in plant species composition) to the surrounding forest and are dominated by plants with fleshy fruit. Therefore, this may attract frugivorous animals, which in turn may generate some seed rain. The objective of our study was to compare seed rain in the extensively managed areas of home gardens and in the surrounding forest during the fruiting peak in a rural landscape in the Yucatan. We assessed seed rain using seed traps in two habitats: the extensively managed areas of home gardens and an adjacent tropical forest. Seed rain was more abundant, denser and more diverse in the home gardens than in the adjacent forest. Approximately one quarter of the seeds recorded are from species shared between the forest and home gardens, suggesting there is notable seed exchange between these habitats. Also 50% of the seed species exclusively found in home gardens are allochthonous, likely rare species from the forest. In general, our results suggest that home gardens-particularly their extensively managed areas-are effective seed traps for forest species.

TI  - Extent change of protected mangrove forest and its relation to wave power exposure on Aldabra Atoll
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Mangrove forests, vital for the conservation of biodiversity, protection of coastlines, and carbon capture, are decreasing globally at a rate higher than most other tropical forests. They are threatened by sea level rise, drought and storm surge, especially on low-lying islands where forests are directly exposed to the elements and have limited land area. We investigated changes in the spatial extent of mangroves on Aldabra Atoll, Seychelles - a protected area without direct human pressures, over 21 years using Landsat images. Over the 21-year study period, mean mangrove extent was 1283 ha with an overall net increase of 60 ha (0.23% year(-1)). The majority of extent changes were small (< 2 ha) and contiguous to the existing mangrove extent. We then assessed the relation of mangrove cover change along the lagoon coastline with wave power (rate of energy transfer by waves), using fetch measures and local wind data. We found lower wave power values for stable mangrove areas than for areas that had gained or lost mangroves from 1997 to 2018. We identified wave power thresholds of 2.3 W m(-1) for stable mangrove and 7.1 W m(-1) for mangrove occurrence. These thresholds might be valuable for assessing threats and sites with the greatest potential for mangrove restoration across similar areas worldwide. Our results highlight the importance of quantifying mangrove extent changes at a local scale to assist with planning for the protection and restoration of this ecologically important habitat, given its vulnerability to the pressures associated with climate change.

TI  - Genetic diversity and hybridization in the two species Inga ingoides and Inga edulis: potential applications for agroforestry in the Peruvian Amazon
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Slash and burn practices affect tropical forests. Our results showed strong introgression between Inga ingoides and Inga edulis in the species contact area. Interspecific hybridization could be sought to improve yield and tolerance to flooding and further increase the economic potential of the poorly drained Amazonian soils and minimize deforestation.
   Inga species are important components of tropical American forests, as well as a local food source. Little is known about the genetic structure of these species; in particular the amount of introgression among species remains unknown.
   We assessed the degree of genetic divergence and introgression among populations of I. ingoides (Rich.) Willd. and I. edulis Mart. (Fabaceae) from three Peruvian Amazon tributary rivers.
   Using microsatellite markers we determined the genetic structure of populations using an analysis of molecular variance and a Bayesian analysis of population structure in areas affected by seasonal river fluctuations and in 'terra firme' forests.
   Overall genetic differentiation was weak. The degree of genetic variation was similar in the two species. A putatively strong introgression was detected between the two species and an intense gene flow was identified among populations. This indicates that an intense gene flow had happened in the past, leading also to a small differentiation among populations within species.
   Selection of natural hybrids or artificial hybridization between I. edulis and I. ingoides could be applied to improve legume size and yield in the later species, while maintaining tolerance to flooding. Improved I. ingoides could be used in multipurpose agroforestry on open areas along the rivers, instead of using the usual slash and burn practice to create inland open areas.

TI  - Reference scenarios for deforestation and forest degradation in support of REDD: a review of data and methods
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Global climate policy initiatives are now being proposed to compensate tropical forest nations for reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation ( REDD). These proposals have the potential to include developing countries more actively in international greenhouse gas mitigation and to address a substantial share of the world's emissions which come from tropical deforestation. For such a policy to be viable it must have a credible benchmark against which emissions reduction can be calculated. This benchmark, sometimes termed a baseline or reference emissions scenario, can be based directly on historical emissions or can use historical emissions as input for business as usual projections. Here, we review existing data and methods that could be used to measure historical deforestation and forest degradation reference scenarios including FAO ( Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations) national statistics and various remote sensing sources. The freely available and corrected global Landsat imagery for 1990, 2000 and soon to come for 2005 may be the best primary data source for most developing countries with other coarser resolution high frequency or radar data as a valuable complement for addressing problems with cloud cover and for distinguishing larger scale degradation. While sampling of imagery has been effectively useful for pan-tropical and continental estimates of deforestation, wall-to-wall ( or full coverage) allows more detailed assessments for measuring national-level reference emissions. It is possible to measure historical deforestation with sufficient certainty for determining reference emissions, but there must be continued calls at the international level for making high-resolution imagery available, and for financial and technical assistance to help countries determine credible reference scenarios. The data available for past years may not be sufficient for assessing all forms of forest degradation, but new data sources will have greater potential in 2007 and after. This paper focuses only on the methods for measuring changes in forest area, but this information must be coupled with estimates of change in forest carbon stocks in order to quantify emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.

TI  - 15-year fertilization increased soil organic carbon stock even in systems reputed to be saturated like permanent grassland on andosols
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Previous long-term experiments conducted more than 10 years ago, showed that long-term application of organic fertilizer increased soil organic carbon (SOC) of grasslands. However, it was usually assumed that, independent of the successive additions of fertilizer, soils have an upper limit to their SOC due to the inability of the soil mineral phase to fix additional carbon. Andosols of the volcanic Reunion Island are typically very rich in carbon and are usually considered as saturated in SOC. To assess the long-term effect of different types of fertilization on SOC in these soils, SOC concentrations were recorded at yearly intervals for 15 years in one arenosol site and in two andosols sites across a topo-sequence. The types of fertilization tested included inorganic, organic, and a mix of inorganic and organic nutrient sources. The addition of organic fertilizers increased soil carbon in the top (0-15 cm) horizon in both the arenosol and the two andosols (up to +250% in the arenosol and up to +41% in the andosol), whereas inorganic fertilizers and the control treatment did not always result in a significant in-crease in SOC. After 15 years, no plateau was reached in C stocks even with the highest fertilization rates. Our results suggest that the increase in SOC was mainly caused by direct carbon inputs, while the effect of the in-crease in litter resulting from the increase in yield caused by fertilization, remained uncertain. In the andosol, all the fertilization treatments led to higher concentrations of carbon in the deeper layers. This suggests that SOC inputs lead to downward migration of OC to deep horizons. For C-rich soils like andosols, assessing the variations in carbon in the deep horizon is thus critical in estimating the effects of soil management on carbon sequestration.

TI  - Intraspecific alternative phenotypes contribute to variation in species' strategies for growth
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Ecologists have historically sought to identify the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of local species diversity. High-dimensional trait-based relationships, such as alternative phenotypes, have been hypothesized as important for maintaining species diversity such that phenotypically dissimilar individuals compete less for resources but have similar performance in a given environment. The presence of alternative phenotypes has primarily been investigated at the community level, despite the importance of intraspecific variation to diversity maintenance. The aims of this research are to (1) determine the presence or absence of intraspecific alternative phenotypes in three species of tropical tree seedlings, (2) investigate if these different species use the same alternative phenotypes for growth success, and (3) evaluate how findings align with species co-occurrence patterns. We model species-specific relative growth rate with individual-level measurements of leaf mass per area (LMA) and root mass fraction (RMF), environmental data, and their interactions. We find that two of the three species have intraspecific alternative phenotypes, with individuals within species having different functional forms leading to similar growth. Interestingly, individuals within these species use the same trait combinations, high LMA x\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\times$$\end{document} low RMF and low LMA x\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\times$$\end{document} high RMF, in high soil nutrient environments to acquire resources for higher growth. This similarity among species in intraspecific alternative phenotypes and variables that contribute most to growth may lead to their negative spatial co-occurrence. Overall, we find that multiple traits or interactions between traits and the environment drive species-specific strategies for growth, but that individuals within species leverage this multi-dimensionality in different ways for growth success.

TI  - The sustainable management and protection of forests: Analysis of the current position globally
T2  - AMBIO
AB  - The loss of forest area globally due to change of land use, the importance of forests in the conservation of biodiversity and in carbon and other biogeochemical cycles, together with the threat to forests from pollution and from the impacts of climate change, place forestry policy and practice at the center of global environmental and sustainability strategy. Forests provide important economic, environmental, social, and cultural benefits, so that in forestry, as in other areas of environmental policy and management, there are tensions between economic development and environmental protection. In this article we review the current information on global forest cover and condition, examine the international processes that relate to forest protection and to sustainable forest management, and look at the main forest certification schemes. We consider the link between the international processes and certification schemes and also their combined effectiveness. We conclude that in some regions of the world neither mechanism is achieving forest protection, while in others local or regional implementation is occurring and is having a significant impact. Choice of certification scheme and implementation of management standards are often influenced by a consideration of the associated costs, and there are some major issues over the monitoring of agreed actions and of the criteria and indicators of sustainability. There are currently a number of initiatives seeking to improve the operation of the international forestry framework (e.g., The Montreal Process, the Ministerial Convention of the Protection of Forests in Europe and European Union actions in Europe, the African Timber Organisation and International Tropical Timber Organisation initiative for African tropical forest, and the development of a worldwide voluntary agreement on forestry in the United Nations Forum on Forests). We suggest that there is a need to improve the connections between scientific understanding, policy development, and forestry practice, and also the cooperation between the various international initiatives and processes, so that the international framework is more effective and its influence is extended geographically.

TI  - Impacts of the forest definitions adopted by African countries on carbon conservation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - In this paper, we aim to assess the impacts of the forest definitions adopted by each African country involved in the global climate change programmes of the United Nations on national carbon emission estimations. To do so, we estimate the proportion of national carbon stocks and tree cover loss that are found in areas considered to be non-forest areas. These non-forest areas are defined with respect to a threshold on the percentage of tree cover adopted by each country. Using percent tree cover and aboveground biomass maps derived from remote sensing data, we quantitatively show that in many countries, a large proportion of carbon stocks are found in non-forest areas, where a large amount of tree cover loss can also occur. We further found that under the REDD+ framework (reduced deforestation, reduced degradation, enhancement and conservation of forest carbon stocks, sustainable management of forests), some partner countries have proposed activities related to only reducing deforestation, even when a large proportion of their carbon stocks are stored outside forests. This situation may represent a limitation of the efficiency of the REDD+ mechanism, and could be avoided if these countries choose a lower tree cover threshold for their definition of forests and/or if they were are engaged in other activities.

TI  - Biodiversity of Tamaulipan thornscrub in relation to fragmentation
T2  - NORTH AMERICAN SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM: TOWARD A UNIFIED FRAMEWORK FOR INVENTORYING AND MONITORING FOREST ECOSYSTEM RESOURCES
CP  - North American Science Symposium on Toward a Unified Framework for Inventorying and Monitoring Forest Ecosystem Resources
AB  - Tamaulipan thornscrub has often been removed in northeastern Mexico to give way to agriculture and induced grasslands for cattle. This results in over 90% of thornscrub being either removed or severely modified, with a few remaining fragments varying in size and distance to nearby fragments (isolation). Fragment size ranges from isolated trees in induced buffel grasslands to 300 ha of "continuous vegetation".
   Remaining fragments are by no means conserved, as they are over-utilized for grazing goats, extraction of timber, fuel-wood and medicinal plants. Ecosystem fragmentation and isolation of fragments has an impact on the dynamics of thornscrub by reducing population sizes, promoting genetic erosion, and perhaps local extinction of species with large habitat requirements.
   In here we present same measurements of plant, bird, ante, and beetles diversity, as well as some implications on seed parasitism, removal and dispersal Results contrast species richness under isolated Prosopis and Ebenopsis trees and thornscrub fragments from less than 10 to over 100 ha. Preliminary results imply that fragment size is not related to species number, but to ecosystem function. Seed removal rates were slower under isolated mesquite trees than under similar trees in continuous vegetation. Seed production was higher for isolated mesquite trees than for similar size ones inside continuous vegetation. Seed parasitism (while still inside the vines) was higher far the latter.

T2  - SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND ECO-BIOLOGICAL DIMENSIONS IN RESOURCE USE AND CONSERVATION: STRATEGIES FOR SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Assessing carbon sequestration by measuring above ground and below ground biomass with non destructive method is globally acknowledged. The studies from forest ecosystem have made a significant contribution in quantifying carbon stock. This type of study has now gaining importance in urban ecosystems. Most of the institutions and universities have natural forest and manmade plantations are now assessing carbon stocks in India and elsewhere. In the present study Kuvempu university campus which is a part of Central Western Ghats was assessed. The total area of the campus covers 326.21 acres with dry deciduous forest of Bhadra tiger reserve. A total of 5596 individuals were recorded with a carbon stock of 457.0 t ha(-1) and the dominant Terminalia paniculata contributed a total of 13% of carbon stock. The storing capacity varies with species diversity, disturbance gradient and phenology. This pilot study has made an attempt in advertising the present area in global carbon stock assessment. Therefore, every educational institutions/universities can easily contribute to global CO2 mitigation by restoring the native species in their campus and even it supports biodiversity and helps in future long term monitoring.

TI  - Rural household participation in illegal timber felling in a protected area of West Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Illegal logging is a threat to tropical forests in protected areas, yet the factors motivating it need to be better understood. Here, rural household participation in timber felling in the Barisan I Nature Reserve (West Sumatra) was described, the household contextual factors relating to this participation analysed and the importance of these activities to the household income assessed. Nearly 19% of the sampled households cut or hauled timber in the Reserve, and the demand for cash encouraged participation. Alternative livelihoods such as livestock raising and agroforestry intensification outside the Reserve could reduce the need for timber felling. Knowledge about legal status of the Reserve did not affect the odds of a household engaging in timber harvesting, but greater awareness of the Reserve resulted in lower levels of income from timber. Development policy that seeks to provide livelihood alternatives to timber felling households could reduce dependence on timber and contribute to forest conservation in the Reserve. Moreover, conservation outcomes should improve if control over the protection and enforcement of the Reserve is co-managed between the government and the local communities.

TI  - Extent and Area of Swidden in Montane Mainland Southeast Asia: Estimation by Multi-Step Thresholds with Landsat-8 OLI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Information on the distribution, area and extent of swidden agriculture landscape is necessary for implementing the program of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD), biodiversity conservation and local livelihood improvement. To our knowledge, explicit spatial maps and accurate area data on swidden agriculture remain surprisingly lacking. However, this traditional farming practice has been transforming into other profit-driven land use, like tree plantations and permanent cash agriculture. Swidden agriculture is characterized by a rotational and dynamic nature of agroforestry, with land cover changing from natural forests, newly-cleared swiddens to different-aged fallows. The Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard the Landsat-8 satellite has visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared bands, which are sensitive to the changes in vegetation cover, land surface moisture content and soil exposure, and therefore, four vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI). In this study, we developed a multi-step threshold approach that uses a combination of thresholds of four VIs and local elevation range (LER) and applied it to detect and map newly-opened swiddens and different-aged fallows using OLI imagery acquired between 2013 and 2015. The resultant Landsat-derived swidden agriculture maps have high accuracy with an overall accuracy of 86.9% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.864. The results of this study indicated that the Landsat-based multi-step threshold algorithms could potentially be applied to monitor the long-term change pattern of swidden agriculture in montane mainland Southeast Asia since the late 1980s and also in other tropical regions, like insular Southeast Asia, South Asia, Latin America and Central Africa, where swidden agriculture is still common.

TI  - The diversity of birds in the young oil palm agroforestry plot in Jambi, Indonesia
T2  - 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN AGROFORESTRY 2022
CP  - 4th International Conference in Agroforestry (ICAF) - Agroforestry for Sustainable and Resilient Communities
AB  - By 2010, Sumatera Island of Indonesia had lost the highest annual forest cover due to oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) expansion, leading to adverse environmental impacts. The introduction of oil palm agroforestry (OPAF) within the social forestry program was to reduce these environmental impacts, conserve biodiversity, enhance wildlife habitat, and improve smallholder household resilience. However, the information on OPAF implementation progress and its benefits and ecological impacts still need to be explored. This research aims to measure the diversity of birds in young OPAF by comparing birds' diversity in four land covers: young oil palm agroforestry (three years after establishment), old oil palm agroforestry (20 years after establishment), oil palm monoculture, and secondary forest. We indicated 43 bird species from 25 families across all land covers. The secondary forest had the highest valueof bird diversity index value of 2.80. The second was the first young oil palm agroforestry (2.42), followed by old OPAF, oil palm monoculture, and the second young OPAF with index values of 2.30, 2.19, and 2.16, respectively. Enrichment planting on oil palm monoculture through OPAF development could help restore tropical forests' structural complexity while also providing more suitable bird habitats.

TI  - Estimating Aboveground Biomass and Carbon Sequestration in Afforestation Areas Using Optical/SAR Data Fusion and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The growing population and the impacts of climate change present a major challenge to forests, which play a crucial role in regulating the carbon cycle. Pakistan, as a Kyoto Protocol signatory, has implemented afforestation initiatives such as the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) government's Billion Tree Afforestation Project (BTAP). Quantifying the environmental impacts of such initiatives is very important; however, carbon pool data for BTAP plantation regions remain unavailable and are underexplored. This study aims to quantify aboveground biomass (AGB) and carbon sequestration potential (CSP) in the BTAP plantation regions using remote sensing and field data. Random sampling of 310 circular plots (17.84 m radius) provided measurements for tree height and diameter, from which AGB was calculated using allometric equations. Remote sensing data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, combined with polarization rasters and vegetation indices, were used to train and evaluate multiple regression models including multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest regression (RFR). The RFR model outperformed the others (R2 = 0.766) when using combined optical and radar data, yielding a mean AGB of 4.77 t/ha, carbon stock of 2.24 t/ha, and CO2 equivalent of 10.36 t/ha. For BTAP plantations, the total biomass reached 1.19 million tons, with 2.06 million tons of CO2 equivalent sequestered, corresponding to an annual sequestration of 0.47 tC/ha/yr and a potential of 99.18 +/- 15 tC/ha. This research introduces innovative predictive models and a comprehensive carbon assessment framework for afforestation projects, providing critical insights for policymakers and climate change mitigation efforts.

TI  - Alternative field fertilization techniques to promote restoration of leguminous Acacia koa on contrasting tropical sites
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Field fertilization can promote early growth and survival of planted trees on degraded pastures and agricultural lands where low soil fertility and high herbaceous competition inhibit regeneration success. Controlled-release fertilizers (CRF) may improve the effectiveness of fertilization relative to that of immediately available fertilizers (IAF) because CRF gradually release nutrients directly to the root zone, thereby limiting nutrient losses. Despite past research in boreal and temperate landscapes, few studies have tested the efficacy of similar applications in tropical systems where year-round high temperatures can increase release rates of CRF and intensity of competing vegetation. On two contrasting sites on the Island of Hawaii, USA, we evaluated early growth and survival responses of koa (Acacia koa Gray), a fast-growing legume, using ten treatments: a control, four IAF formulations, and five rates of polymer coated CRF (15N-9P-12K; 15-75 g). At Pahala, a productive site, we detected no significant growth, survival, or foliar nitrogen (N) or phosphorous (P) responses to the fertilizer treatments. At Volcano, a rockier and cooler site on younger soil, height increased by 36-49% for the highest performing CRF and IAF relative to the control; diameter likewise increased by 55-92%. Growth responses appeared to be a result of P fertilization rather than N. The highest performing IAF had a reduced survival rate relative to the lowest CRF (46% vs. 83%). Although total nutrient application rates were much lower for CRF, our results suggest that on tropical restoration sites, CRF may promote seedling performance at least equally to that of IAF. There is a need to more carefully evaluate the effects of site-specific interactions that may determine field fertilizer responses, across a range of genera and functional groups.

Although agroforests are recognized as supplementary habitats for many species, it is still unclear whether this agricultural system can maintain multiple dimensions of species diversity.ObjectivesWe investigated the impact of landscape and local factors on the taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic richness and diversity of the herpetofauna in 30 cocoa agroforests located in three different regions of the Atlantic Forest.MethodsWe used Hill's numbers in orders 0 and 1 to estimate the richness and diversity of each dimension of amphibian and reptile communities. Using model selection approach, we evaluate the influence of landscape and local factors on the different dimensions of diversity of both groups.ResultsFor amphibians, we observed that pasture cover positively affects taxonomic richness and diversity, as well as phylogenetic richness. In contrast, forest edge density and number of forest fragments negatively affect richness and functional diversity, respectively. We also observed that the region with high forest cover exhibited lower amphibian functional richness. For reptiles, we found that forest cover and edge density positively affect species richness. We also noted that forest cover and edge density positively affect phylogenetic richness and diversity, respectively. Regarding local factors, only humidity positively affected functional richness and diversity, while temperature had a negative effect on reptile functional richness.ConclusionsOur study showed that the landscape context in which cocoa agroforests are located modulates the ability of this agricultural system to harbor multiple dimensions of amphibian and reptile diversity in human-modified landscapes.

TI  - Changes from pasture to a native tree plantation affect soil organic matter in a tropical soil, Panama
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Background and aims We examined changes in soil organic matter arising from conversion of a 45-year old pasture to a 10 yr. old native tree plantation in Panama, to evaluate the effect of monoculture and mixtures.
   Methods We intensively sampled the soil 0-10 cm depth in the pasture in 2001 and in 22 plantation plots in 2011, ranging from 5 monocultures to 3- and 6-species treatments; samples were also taken from an undisturbed forest site. Soil analyses included organic carbon (SOC) and delta C-13.
   Results Conversion of the pasture to tree plantation resulted in an overall loss of SOC of 0.6 kg m(-2) (18%) in the top 10 cm, but neither tree species nor diversity had a significant effect. End-member delta C-13 values suggested that the contribution of C-3 plants to SOC was increased from 26% in the pasture to 55% after 10 years of plantation and SOC turnover times were calculated to be 21-36 yr.
   Conclusions The magnitude of the loss in soil SOC is smaller than the increases in tree biomass (similar to 3 kg C m(-2)) and litter (similar to 0.3 kg C m(-2)) in the plantation, but still a significant part of the ecosystem C balance.

TI  - Tropical rainforest biodiversity and aboveground carbon changes and uncertainties in the Selva Central, Peru
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Tropical deforestation has reduced the extent of natural forests, which conserve biodiversity, provide essential resources to people, and reduce climate change by storing carbon. Forest conservation projects need tree species data to effectively manage biodiversity while greenhouse gas reduction programs require robust methods to estimate forest carbon. Here, we use field measurements, remote sensing, and Monte Carlo analyses to quantify tree biodiversity and aboveground carbon changes and uncertainties in 5200 km(2) of Amazonian and Yungas rainforest and other land around the Parque Nacional Yanachaga-Chemillen and two other protected areas in the Selva Central, Peru. Field inventories of 17 ha found 438 tree species in 156 families. Field measurements of 10,838 trees and Monte Carlo analyses of uncertainties in measurements, allometric equations, wood density, and the carbon fraction of biomass showed that aboveground live carbon densities were 93 +/- 39 Mg ha(-1) (mean +/- 95% confidence interval [CI]) in old-growth forest and 40 +/- 10 Mg ha(-1) in secondary forest. Carbon density was significantly correlated to tree species richness (P < 0.0001). Supervised classification of Landsat images showed a 1989-2005 net deforestation rate of 0.3% y(-1), reduction of forest cover from three-quarters of the area to two-thirds, and net degradation of additional forest equivalent to half the deforested area. A Monte Carlo analysis that combined carbon density and remote sensing uncertainties showed that forest changes caused statistically significant net emissions of 1.6 +/- 0.4 million Mg carbon. Allometric equations and remote sensing accounted for most of the uncertainty. Multivariate statistical analyses showed that, of six factors examined, distance to roads most explained historical deforestation patterns. The protected areas experienced no net deforestation, very low degradation, and very low change close to roads. Projection of potential forest cover to 2021 indicates that a Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) project could avoid gross emissions of 2.8 +/- 0.8 million Mg carbon. One-eighth of the area would be eligible for afforestation or reforestation under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), with credit for carbon storage occurring above a projected baseline gross reforestation rate of 1.8% y(-1). These activities could conserve tropical forest carbon and biodiversity. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Are we selecting appropriate metrics to assess human impacts on biodiversity?
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Biased and subjective choices of metrics to be used in ecological studies could lead researchers to reach misleading conclusions regarding patterns of biodiversity response to human disturbances. Nevertheless, little attention has been given to the choices of variables in the majority of studies published to date. Here, we used the literature concerning land use change effects on dung beetles to assess the extent to which variables commonly employed in ecological studies correspond to those deemed to be most important by researchers of the same studies. Specifically, we examined both biodiversity (response) and environmental (explanatory) metrics from a comprehensive literature review and compared their use with their relative importance, according to a survey of the authors of the studies. Our results highlight marked disparities between researchers opinion expressed in our survey and their choice of variables in published papers. We suggest that these disparities are due to the high costs of sampling and processing some variables, logistical constraints and different perceptions of importance amongst researchers. We highlight the importance of these issues for our understanding of the biodiversity consequences of land use change, and highlight some recommendations for alleviating this issue.

TI  - Positive forestry: The effect of rubber tree plantations on fruit feeding butterfly assemblages in the Brazilian Atlantic forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Agroforestry systems have increased in area in tropical regions in recent decades and many studies have sought to evaluate their impact on native biodiversity. Yet, few have assessed the impact of perennial plantations such as rubber-tree harvesting on native biodiversity. The goal of our study was to assess the effect of rubber tree plantations on fruit-feeding butterflies of the endangered Brazilian Atlantic Forest in Brazil. To do so, we sampled fruit-feeding butterfly species in a landscape mosaic composed of primary forest, rubber tree plantations under two management regimes (active production with intense management and undergrowth suppression and low management plantations with no undergrowth suppression), and forest fragments immersed in rubber tree plantation matrix. By trap-baiting butterflies for a year, we captured 5800 individuals of 85 butterfly species. Species richness was higher in unmanaged (no growth suppression) plantation and forest fragments (57-60 species) and lower in managed plantation (with growth suppression) (47) and primary forest (43). Ordination analysis suggests three main community groups formed by primary forest samples, a cluster combining unmanaged plantation and fragments, and managed plantation. There was substantial variation in butterfly abundance in the landscape, but our data suggest that several forest specialists species are able to occur along the mosaic on the landscape, and despite differences in management the entire landscape can contribute for a rich biota. Loss of understory vegetation led to simplified communities, with skewed dominance of a few species. By allowing understory development, a low impact management can provide adequate habitat for native butterflies. Yet, current rubber tree plantation technology does not normally use this method, opting to use the high management approach instead. We hypothesize that these minimally benign plantations may serve as conduits for butterflies in forest patches. Thus, we suggest that rubber tree plantations near Atlantic forest fragments should encourage understory development and establish a landscape mosaic, allowing forest fragments immersed in plantation matrix to be able to exchange individuals and colonize more complex plantation habitat. Intensive suppression of undergrowth should be avoided, except for trail maintenance, and isolation of fragments in this matrix should be kept to a minimum. If undergrowth suppression cannot be avoided, then establishment of stepping stones in plantation matrix should be encouraged to reduce isolation of fragments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Forest fragmentation in the Argentine Chaco: recruitment and population patterns of dominant tree species
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
AB  - The forest in the Central Argentine Chaco has been dramatically fragmented and persists only as isolated patches in an agricultural matrix. In this study, we evaluated the effects of fragmentation on total density, recruitment, and size-class structure of its dominant tree species, a key issue, although little explored, for forest conservation in the region. We particularly analyzed the effects of fragment size and forest cover at landscape level on seven of the most important tree species of the forest. Our results suggest that forest cover at landscape level is more important than fragment size to explain the population patterns of the main tree species. Fragment size was relevant in only one species, Cordia americana, whereas forest cover resulted relevant in five species. The size-class structure of Schinopsis balansae, one of the dominant species of the upper stratum, appeared to be affected in landscapes with less forest cover, showing lower densities of the smaller classes. Our results show that for the conservation of the forest it would be important to increase their protection degree against the expansion of agriculture, attempting to preserve as much of the forest as possible, to promote the forest cover at landscape level and give relevance even to the smallest fragments.

TI  - Phyllostomid Bat Occurrence in Successional Stages of Neotropical Dry Forests
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Tropical dry forests (TDFs) are highly endangered tropical ecosystems being replaced by a complex mosaic of patches of different successional stages, agricultural fields and pasturelands. In this context, it is urgent to understand how taxa playing critical ecosystem roles respond to habitat modification. Because Phyllostomid bats provide important ecosystem services (e. g. facilitate gene flow among plant populations and promote forest regeneration), in this study we aimed to identify potential patterns on their response to TDF transformation in sites representing four different successional stages (initial, early, intermediate and late) in three Neotropical regions: Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil. We evaluated bat occurrence at the species, ensemble (abundance) and assemblage level (species richness and composition, guild composition). We also evaluated how bat occurrence was modulated by the marked seasonality of TDFs. In general, we found high seasonal and regional specificities in phyllostomid occurrence, driven by specificities at species and guild levels. For example, highest frugivore abundance occurred in the early stage of the moistest TDF, while highest nectarivore abundance occurred in the same stage of the driest TDF. The high regional specificity of phyllostomid responses could arise from: (1) the distinctive environmental conditions of each region, (2) the specific behavior and ecological requirements of the regional bat species, (3) the composition, structure and phenological patterns of plant assemblages in the different stages, and (4) the regional landscape composition and configuration. We conclude that, in tropical seasonal environments, it is imperative to perform long-term studies considering seasonal variations in environmental conditions and plant phenology, as well as the role of landscape attributes. This approach will allow us to identify potential patterns in bat responses to habitat modification, which constitute an invaluable tool for not only bat biodiversity conservation but also for the conservation of the key ecological processes they provide.

TI  - The first rapid forest inventory and resource use assessment of Dashtijum Nature Reserve, Tajikistan: a mixed methods approach
T2  - ORYX
AB  - There is critical need for more information on the status of forests in Central Asia, to inform conservation management. Here we assess the status and use of the globally important, threatened walnut-fruit forests of Dashtijum Nature Reserve, Tajikistan. We use a mixed methods approach combining a semi-structured interview based socio-economic survey with statistical analysis. Thirty-three tree species were recorded, with Rosaceae the most common family. The mean basal area of the forest was 20.8 m(2)per ha and most tree species exhibited stable population structures. Resource use was prevalent throughout the community; most households harvested at least one fruit or nut species (78%), firewood (88%) and grazed livestock (85%). Most respondents noted declines in availability of fruits, nuts and firewood and reported a decrease in the overall area and quality of grazing. Statistical analysis and machine learning identified that distance to nearest settlement significantly affected forest total basal area, tree species richness and the Shannon index, a metric of diversity sensitive to rare species. Our results suggest that conservation management by the government and NGOs is partly effective but there is a need for increased enforcement of grazing restrictions, to prevent further forest degradation.

TI  - Understory colonization of Eucalyptus plantations in Hawaii in relation to light and nutrient levels
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Exotic tree plantations may serve as catalysts for native forest regeneration in agriculturally degraded landscapes. In 2001, we evaluated plant species regeneration in the understory of a 7-year-old experimental Eucalyptus saligna forest in Hawaii approximately 1 year after the cessation of 5 years of herbicide. These forests were organized in a 2 x 2-factorial design of planting density (1 x 1- or 3 x 3-m spacing) and fertilization (unfertilized control and regular fertilization), which resulted in varying resource availabilities. We found that understory biomass was highest under high light conditions, regardless of fertilization treatment, whereas species richness was lowest under fertilized 1 x 1-m plots. The understory was dominated by species exotic to Hawaii. The most common tree species, the noxious weed Citharexylum caudatum, was particularly successful because high light-saturated photosynthesis rates and a low light compensation point allowed for high growth and survival under both light conditions. To assess longer-term recruitment patterns, we resurveyed a portion of this site in 2006 and also surveyed five Eucalyptus plantations in this region of Hawaii that differed in age (5-23 years), species (E. saligna, E. grandis, E. cloeziana, E. microcorys), and management (experimental, industrial, nonindustrial stewardship); all were established on previous agricultural sites within approximately 3 km of native-dominated forest. Again, very few native species were present in any of the stands, indicating that within certain landscapes and for native species with certain life history traits, exotic plantations may he ineffective nursery ecosystems for the regeneration of native species.

TI  - EFFECTS OF SHORT ROTATION NATURAL FALLOW ON DIVERSITY OF PLANT SPECIES AND POPULATION OF SOIL MICROBES IN APONMU, ONDO STATE, NIGERIA
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - OKE DO. 2012. Effects of short rotation natural fallow on diversity of plant species and population of soil microbes in Aponmu, Ondo State, Nigeria. Bush fallowing is a common farming system in the humid zone of West and Central Africa. However, population pressures have resulted in shortened fallow periods with consequent effects on soil nutrients and biodiversity. To assess the effect of the shortened fallow period on plant species diversity, data were collected in a primary forest (forest reserve) and an adjoining 5-year-old bush fallow in Aponmu, Ondo State, Nigeria. Four plots of 25 x 25 m each were sampled from the forest reserve and one each from four abandoned fallow lands around the forest reserve. All trees with diameter at breast height greater than or equal to 5 cm were identified. A total of 0.25 ha of bush fallow and 0.25 ha of primary forest were surveyed. Ground vegetation was assessed from a subsample of 5 x 5 m in each of the sampled area. In the 0.25 ha of bush fallow surveyed, 64 individual trees were encountered (256 trees ha(-1)) representing 34.2% of the tree density found in 0.25 ha of primary forest, which contained 187 individual trees (748 trees ha(-1)). A higher value of Shannon's index (2.95) for the primary forest is an indication that it contains more variety of tree species per unit area than the bush fallow (2.37). There were slight differences in bacterial and fungal populations from the two ecosystems. This study indicated a lower number and variety of tree species under short rotation fallow. This may imply gradual loss of many of the benefits associated with trees.

TI  - Biomass allocation and growth indicators for quality evaluation of seedlings of native forest species
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
AB  - Procedures and methodologies for evaluating the quality and uniformity of seedlings are essential for homogenizing lots in forest nurseries and successful planting for reforestation. A study was made in order to evaluate the correlations between the allocation of biomass and the Dickson Quality Index (IQD) for seedlings from six native tree species of the Atlantic Forest as well as to select quality indicators that most affect the IQD and which can be used in a practical and precise fashion for the evaluation of native forest seedlings. Seedlings from six tropical forest species were used: Calophyllum brasiliense, Eriotheca macrophylla, Inga laurina, Psidium cattleyanum, Roupala montana and Sloanea obtusifolia. The following characteristics were evaluated: dry leaf (MSF), dry stem (MSC) and dry root (MSR) mass, as well as the aerial part height (H) and the stem diameter (D). Based on these variables, the following calculations were made: ratios of root (RMR), stem (RMC) and leaf (RMF) mass, as well as the total dry mass (MST), that of the aerial part (MSPA), the ratio of the aerial part dry mass to the dry root mass (MSPA/MSR), and that of the aerial part height to the stem diameter (H/D), and the IQD. The results were analyzed via correlation analyses. Based on the conditions of this study it is possible to conclude that: (a) the differences between the average IQD values of the species studied were not explained by the allocation pattern of biomass characterizing each species; (b) the MSR, MST and the D are the best variables for predicting the IQD of the seedlings from the forest species analyzed in this study; and (c) because it is a non-destructive method, D can be considered the best practical indicator for estimating IQD values for Atlantic Forest seedling species lots.

TI  - The Importance of Defining 'Forest': Tropical Forest Degradation, Deforestation, Long-term Phase Shifts, and Further Transitions
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - While research continues on the causes, consequences, and rates of deforestation and forest degradation in the tropics, there is little agreement about what exactly is being lost, what we want back, and to whom the 'we' refers. Particularly unsettling is that many analyses and well-intended actions are implemented in fogs of ambiguity surrounding definitions of the term 'forest'-a problem that is not solely semantic; with development of markets for biomass carbon, vegetation classification exercises take on new relevance. For example, according to the basic implementation guidelines of the Kyoto Protocol, closed canopy natural forest could be replaced by monoclonal plantations of genetically engineered exotic tree species and no deforestation would have occurred. Following these same guidelines, carbon credits for afforestation could be available for planting trees in species-rich savannas; these new plantations would count towards a country moving towards the 'forest transition,' the point at which there is no net 'forest' loss. Such obvious conflicts between biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration might be avoided if 'forest' was clearly defined and if other vegetation types and other ecosystem values were explicitly recognized. While acknowledging that no one approach to vegetation classification is likely to satisfy all users at all scales, we present an approach that recognizes the importance of species composition, reflects the utility of land-cover characteristics that are identifiable via remote sensing, and acknowledges that many sorts of forest degradation do not reduce carbon stocks (e. g., defaunation) or canopy cover (e. g., over-harvesting of understory nontimber forest products).

TI  - Soil properties of thickets and adjacent land use types in coastal savanna landscape of Ghana
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
AB  - Thicket vegetation may be of great importance in soil carbon (C) storage and in provision of other ecosystem services such as soil erosion control and biodiversity conservation. However, it is less studied in tropical ecosystems due to limited understanding of its ecological importance. This study reports soil C pools and nutrient concentrations [nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), exchangeable calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and potassium (K)] of unique thicket formations on Vertisol in comparison with adjacent land use types viz. rangeland, dry forest, and farmland at Kpong in the coastal Accra plains of Ghana. We also examined soil particle and nutrient distributions of termitarium associated with the thicket clumps on the Vertisols. Soils were sampled from each land use at 0-30 cm depth in addition to deep coring up to 100 cm. In the rangeland, forest and farmland, we demarcated 1600 m(2) area each and established 4 subplots measuring 20 x 20 m (400 m(2)) and selected for the thicket vegetation, 4 thicket clumps each of approximately 400 m(2) for soil sampling. The thicket clumps had greater soil total N, available P, exchangeable Ca and Mg concentrations than the rangeland and farmland but the levels in the thicket were similar (p > 0.05) to that of the adjacent dry forest. Soil C stock varied from 59 Mg ha(-1) in the rangeland to 111 Mg ha(-1) in the thicket clumps. The C stored in the silt + clay (S + C) fraction did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) in both the thicket and the dry forest, indicating similar C sequestration abilities. The S + C fraction contributed 89.6, 82.8, 81.3, and 73.7% to total soil organic C content in the rangeland, farmland, dry forest, and thickets, respectively. Soils of the termite mounds in the thickets were more clayey (ca. 38-41% clay) than the surrounding thicket soils (ca. 32% clay). We conclude that Vertisols in thicket areas store soil C and nutrients comparably as tropical dry forest, underscoring their ecological importance and the need for their conservation to enhance soil quality in the Anthropocene.

TI  - Evolution and Conservation of Central African Biodiversity: Priorities for Future Research and Education in the Congo Basin and Gulf of Guinea
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - The tropical forests of the Congo Basin and Gulf of Guinea harbor some of the greatest terrestrial and aquatic biological diversity in the world. However, our knowledge of the rich biological diversity of this region and the evolutionary processes that have shaped it remains limited, as is our understanding of the capacity for species to adapt or otherwise respond to current and projected environmental change. In this regard, research efforts are needed to increase current scientific knowledge of this region's biodiversity, identify the drivers of past diversification, evaluate the potential for species to adapt to environmental change and identify key populations for future conservation. Moreover, when evolutionary research is combined with ongoing environmental monitoring efforts, it can also provide an important set of tools for assessing and mitigating the impacts of development activities. Building on a set of recommendations developed at an international workshop held in Gabon in 2011, we highlight major areas for future evolutionary research that could be directly tied to conservation priorities for the region. These research priorities are centered around five disciplinary themes: (1) documenting and discovering biodiversity; (2) identifying drivers of evolutionary diversification; (3) monitoring environmental change; (4) understanding community and ecosystem level processes; (5) investigating the ecology and epidemiology of disease from an evolutionary perspective (evolutionary epidemiology). Furthermore, we also provide an overview of the needs and priorities for biodiversity education and training in Central Africa.

De ce fait, des efforts de recherche sont necessaires pour ameliorer les connaissances scientifiques actuelles sur la biodiversite de cette region, determiner les causes des processus de diversifications passees, evaluer le potentiel des especes a repondre aux changements environnementaux et identifier les populations cles pour la conservation dans le futur. Par ailleurs, lorsque la recherche dans le domaine de l'evolution est combinee aux efforts de suivi continu de l'environnement, elle peut aussi fournir un ensemble d'outils importants pour l'evaluation et l'attenuation des impacts des activites de developpement. S'appuyant sur une serie de recommandations elaborees lors de l'atelier international qui s'est tenu au Gabon en 2011, nous soulignons les axes majeurs pour la recherche future dans le domaine de l'evolution qui pourraient etre lies directement aux priorites de la conservation dans la region. Ces priorites de recherche s'articulent autour de cinq thematiques: (1) l'inventaire et la decouverte de la biodiversite; (2) l'identification des causes de la diversification; (3) le suivi des changements environnementaux; (4) la comprehension des processus au niveau des communautes et des ecosystemes; (5) l'etude ecologique et epidemiologique des maladies d'un point de vue evolutif (epidemiologie evolutive). Toutefois, nous donnons egalement un apercu des besoins et des priorites en matiere d'education et de formation dans le domaine de la biodiversite en Afrique centrale.

TI  - Potential for Farmers' Cooperatives to Convert Coffee Husks into Biochar and Promote the Bioeconomy in the North Ecuadorian Amazon
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - Featured Application
   Agricultural wastes generated in farmers' cooperatives constitute valuable resources for the bioeconomy and can be recycled into biochar to contribute to the implementation of economically and environmentally sustainable agricultural production in the forests of the Ecuadorian Amazon.
   Improving the livelihoods of communities living in fragile ecosystems, such as tropical forests, is among the main strategies to promote their conservation and preserve wildlife. In the Ecuadorian Amazon, farmers' cooperatives are recognized as an important mechanism to improve the socioeconomic conditions of local communities. This study analyzes the integration of pyrolysis processes to convert agricultural waste into biochar as a way to implement the bioeconomy in these organizations. We found that post-harvesting processes in the studied farmers' cooperatives are similar, and coffee husks are a potential feedstock to produce biochar. Although the environmental policies in Ecuador consider the valorization of agricultural waste, we did not find any specific standard to regulate the operation of pyrolysis facilities. Nonetheless, conversion of agricultural waste into biochar can contribute to (i) replacement of subsidized fossil fuels used in drying processes, (ii) prevention of environmental pollution caused by accumulation of waste, (iii) emergence of new income sources linked with the provision of carbon sequestration services, and (iv) the long-term maintenance of soil fertility. Currently, demonstration projects are needed to stimulate collaboration among farmers' cooperatives, academia, the government, international cooperation agencies, and existing forest conservation initiatives.

TI  - Forest buffer-strips mitigate the negative impact of oil palm plantations on stream communities
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The global area cultivated with oil palm has doubled in the past two decades, causing deforestation, land-use change, freshwater pollution, and species loss in tropical ecosystems worldwide. Despite the palm-oil industry been linked to severe deterioration of freshwater ecosystems, most studies have focused on terrestrial environments, while freshwa-ters have been significantly less studied. We evaluated these impacts by contrasting freshwater macroinvertebrate communities and habitat conditions in 19 streams from primary forests (7), grazing lands (6), and oil palm plantations (6). In each stream, we measured environmental characteristics, e.g., habitat composition, canopy cover, substrate, water temperature, and water quality; and we identified and quantified the assemblage of macroinvertebrates. Streams in oil palm plantations lacking riparian forest strips showed warmer and more variable temperatures, higher turbidity, lower silica content, and poorer macroinvertebrate taxon richness than primary forests. Grazing lands showed higher conductivity and temperature, and lower dissolved oxygen and macroinvertebrate taxon richness than primary forests. In contrast, streams in oil palm plantations that conserved a riparian forest, showed a substrate composition, temper-ature, and canopy cover more similar to the ones in primary forests. These habitat improvements by riparian forests in the plantations increased macroinvertebrate taxon richness and maintained a community resembling more the one in primary forests. Therefore, the conversion of grazing lands (instead of primary forests) to oil palm plantations can in-crease freshwater taxon richness only if riparian native forests are safeguarded.

TI  - A participatory approach to elucidate the consequences of land invasions on REDD plus initiatives: A case study with Indigenous communities in Panama
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Land tenure and tenure security are among the most important factors determining the viability and success of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) initiatives. The premise of the present paper is that territorial conflicts lead to forest loss and compromise the successful implementation of REDD+. Within this context, the main objectives of this paper are to (i) document, relying on participatory methods, the extent to which land conflicts drive deforestation and (ii) reflect on the legal context of REDD+ examining if, from an Indigenous perspective, it offers tools to resolve such conflicts. We used the Upper Bayano Watershed in eastern Panama as a case study of complex land tenure dynamics, and their effects on forest conservation in the context of REDD+. Combining a range of participatory methods including participatory mapping and forest carbon stock assessment, we estimated the consequences of land invasions on forest carbon stocks. Our analysis shows that invasions of Indigenous territories amounted to 27.6% of the total deforestation for the period of 2001-2014. The situation is of paramount concern in the Embera territory of Maje A where 95.4% of total deforestation was caused by colonist invaders. Using and validating the maps made freely available by the Global Forest Change initiative of the University of Maryland, we then developed a reference level for the watershed and carried out a back of the envelop estimation of likely REDD+ revenue, showing its potential to bring much needed income to Indigenous communities striving to protect their forest estate. Our analysis of current legislation in Panama highlights confusion and important legal voids and emphasizes the strong links between land tenure, carbon ownership, and territorial invasions. The options and shortcoming of implementing REDD+ in Indigenous territories is discussed in the conclusion taking our legal review into account.

TI  - COMMUNITY FOREST MANAGEMENT AND CARBON SEQUESTRATION - A FEASIBILITY STUDY FROM CHIAPAS, MEXICO
T2  - INTERCIENCIA
AB  - Although forestry and agroforestry are recognized as promising land-use alternatives for reducing the increasing levels of global atmospheric carbon, the viability of carbon sequestration projects at the land-user level has rarely been evaluated We present the results of a feasibility study to: (1) evaluate the interest of local communities in a carbon sequestration project and how they would organize themselves for the proposed forestry project; (2) identify the Carbon sequestration potential of the agroforestry/forestry systems that are both ecologically viable and preferred by local farmers (3) determine the social constraints of and potential for, such projects; and (4) assess the economic potential of the carbon offsets estimated for such systems. This project was carried out by an interdisciplinary team of scientists and farmers in two ecological regions: the Tojolabal and Tzeltal zones of Chiapas, Mexico.
   Five systems with high carbon sequestration potential were considered technically and socially viable for each region. Initially, all participants will plant trees on an individual basis in their coffee plantation, fallow, and pasture lands, or in their maize fields. The estimated amount of carbon sequestered ranged from 46.7 to 236.7 tons of carbon per hectare (tC/ha). Net income benefits due to converting fields from maize cultivation to farm forestry ranged from $500-1000/ha depending on the value assigned to the sequestered carbon.(1)
   Forests and farm woodlands that are sustainably managed have substantial economic and carbon sequestration potential. The principal barrier to communal forest management appears to be sociopolitical rather than economic. Because forest management requires longterm investments, good planning is essential and includes community control of projects, selection of appropriate tree species, and management techniques that are specific to the ecological and social conditions of the area.

TI  - Fire shapes mammal abundance at the Cerrado-Pantanal ecotone: Scale of effect, species traits and land-cover interaction
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
AB  - In tropical regions, which harbour the majority of the Earth's biodiversity, land-cover change emerges as the primary driver of biodiversity loss. However, despite the propensity for many tropical biomes to experience fires, and the rapidly accelerating pace of intensification in fire regimes, the role of fire in shaping ecological communities has largely been overlooked. We examined whether and how fire regime affected the abundance of mammal species, the scale at which these putative effects operated and how fire effect interacted with land cover. Using camera traps, we studied four mammal species with different ecological traits in the Kadiwe<acute accent>u indigenous territory, a Cerrado-Pantanal ecotone. Specifically, we used abundance models to analyse the response of mammal species to fire frequency, spatial extent, and time since fire. Our results showed that mammals responded to fire at scales that align with the scale of responses to land cover. We found that the type of response to fire, and the scale at which fire effects operate, depended on species and possibly on their traits. The smallest species Sylvilagus brasiliensis demonstrated a clear response to fire, as well as to the mean patch area of savanna, exclusively at the smallest scale studied (i.e., within 500-m radius buffers). The abundance of this species decreased with increasing proportion of land burned in the 12 months preceding the monitoring. In contrast, larger species, including Mazama gouazoubira and Tapirus terrestris, showed no response to fire, while Pecari tajacu would exhibit a marginal response, at the larger scale of 1000 m. Our results emphasize the importance of adopting trait-based approaches that consider the multiple aspects of fire regimes, at multiple scales, to disentangle the mechanisms governing the effects of fire on biodiversity. This should promote effective and sustainable fire management compatible with systemic conservation of species and ecological traits in fire-prone biomes.

TI  - Booming markets for Moroccan argan oil appear to benefit some rural households while threatening the endemic argan forest
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Morocco's argan oil is now the most expensive edible oil in the world. High-value argan markets have sparked a bonanza of argan activity. Nongovernmental organizations, international and domestic development agencies, and argan oil cooperatives aggressively promote the win-win aim of simultaneously benefiting local people and the health of the argan forest. This paper tests some of these win-win claims. Analysis of a panel of detailed household data suggests that the boom has enabled some rural households to increase consumption, increase their goat herds (which bodes poorly for the argan forest), and send their girls to secondary school. The boom has predictably made households vigilant guardians of fruit on the tree, but it has not incited investments in longer term tree and forest health. We evaluate landscape-level impacts of these changes using commune-level data on educational enrollment and normalized difference vegetation index data over the period from 1981 to 2009. The results of the mesoanalysis of enrollment are consistent with the microanalysis: the argan boom seems to have improved educational outcomes, especially for girls. Our normalized difference vegetation index analysis, however, suggests that booming argan prices have not improved the forest and may have even induced degradation. We conclude by exploring the dynamic interactions between argan markets, local institutions, rural household welfare, and forest conservation and sustainability.

TI  - Satellite based integrated approaches to modelling spatial carbon stock and carbon sequestration potential of different land uses of Northeast India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
AB  - The study aims to estimate and predict the aboveground biomass, carbon stock and carbon sequestration potential of different land uses of Northeast India and relate these estimates with the land use changes. Many applications such as carbon stock and sequestration monitoring, forest degradation monitoring, and climate change mitigation, require precise and timely estimation of forest biomass. Although traditional field inventory can reliably estimate forest biomass, remote sensing is emerging as an alternate and fast approach to cover larger area with relative precision for biomass estimation. In this study, a combined approach of field inventory and Landsat OLI derived vegetation indices were used in spatial modelling of aboveground biomass and carbon stock in different land uses. A stepwise multilinear regression algorithm was used to derive the model that used Landsat derived NDVI, SAVI and ARVI as predicators. The predicted AGB ranged from 14.32 to 185.95 Mg ha(-1) with an average of 148.78 Mg ha(-1). The developed model that used combined vegetation indices showed correlation of R-2 = 0.79 with an RMSE of 51.04 Mg ha(-1). The present study also applied the empirical model (CO2FIX) to simulate the future scenario of carbon stock and carbon sequestration potential of the different land uses. The carbon stock potential of different land uses were 182.31 Mg ha(-1), 158.91 Mg ha(-1), 134.98 Mg ha(-1), 169.26 Mg ha(-1), 133.84, 89.95 Mg ha(-1), 128.3 Mg ha(-1) and 61.36 Mg ha(-1) in Tropical forest, Subtropical forest, Temperate forest, Tropical plantation, Subtropical plantation, Temperate plantation, Shifting fallows and Agricultural land, respectively.

TI  - Exploring Local Perspectives for Conservation Planning: A Case Study from a Remote Forest Community in Indonesian Papua
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Reconciling conservation and livelihoods is a concern wherever forests are important in local people's lives. We plead for engaging these people in survey activities to clarify what is important to them, as a first step in conservation planning. This will help to address their priorities and gain their guidance and support for interventions. This paper presents the results of such a survey with the community of Kwerba in Mamberamo, a remote and little known part of Indonesian Papua. Views and priorities were explored through interviews, scoring exercises, community mapping and a field survey. Whereas small gardens provided most staple food, culture and livelihoods were linked to the forest. People scored primary forest highest for nearly all use categories. Primary forest was particularly highly valued as a source of construction materials, ornaments and rituals, and as a hunting place. We developed a list of the overall most important plants and animals. Many natural resources were used, but few were commercially exploited. The community had rules to control access to certain areas and resources. Taboos to restrict access to sacred places were also maintained. Our evaluation identified opportunities to achieve conservation outcomes jointly with the Kwerba people. In follow-up activities, the community presented local government with a land-use plan for their territory. The government recognized the value of our approach and requested training to implement it more widely in the region.

TI  - Woody Plant Conservation Value of Three Contrasting Forest Management Regimes in Southwest Ethiopia
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - The future of the Afromontane forest of southwest Ethiopia is highly influenced by coffee management intensity. The study was conducted to investigate the woody species conservation value of a human-modified forest in southwest Ethiopia. We assessed woody species composition, regeneration and forest stand structure across three different management regimes (i.e., natural forest, coffee forest and coffee agroforest using 189 plots of 400 m(2) (20 m x 20 m). A total of 64 species belonging to 33 families were identified and recorded across the three forest management regimes. About 83% of the recorded woody species were maintained in the coffee agroforest. The three forest types shared 61% of the recorded woody species. The coffee agroforest had maintained four strata or layers of stand structure. Nevertheless, the total abundance, density and basal area of woody species decreased from the natural forest to coffee forest and coffee agroforest. The Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM) showed significant difference between the natural forest, coffee forest and coffee agroforest (Global R-Anosim = 0.36, p < 0.001). Similar regeneration patterns were recorded under the forest management regimes. Coffee agroforests simplify the woody plant composition and stand structure of the Afromontane forest in southwest Ethiopia.

TI  - Fertilization and seasonality influence on the photochemical performance of tree legumes in forest plantation for area recovery in the Amazon
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - N-fixing leguminous species can reach atmospheric dinitrogen gas (N-2), having an advantage under N-limited degraded environments. These N-fixers are constantly used as facilitative species. Chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChF) acknowledges how different species take up and use light energy during photosynthesis. These techniques assess stress and performance responses to photosynthesis and are used for the selection of species with potential for reforestation. Six Fabaceae species were selected for this study: three nonfixing species (Cenostigma tocantinum, Senna reticulata and Dipteryx odorata) and three N-fixing species (Clitoria fairchildiana, Inga edulis and Acacia spp.). Variations in chlorophyll fluorescence under high vs. low water and nutrient conditions were studied. Multivariate analysis was performed to detect the effects of seasonality and fertilization on dark-adapted ChF two years after the experiment was established. The correlation among ChF variables and growth, photosynthesis and foliar nutrient concentrations was evaluated. Under high water- and nutrient-availability conditions, plants exhibited an enhanced performance index on absorption basis values correlated with electron transport fluxes. Under drought and nutrient-poor conditions, most species exhibit increased energy dissipation as photoprotection. High interspecific variation was found; therefore, species-specific responses should be considered in future ChF studies. Corroborating the ability to colonize high-light environments, N-fixers showed an increased performance index correlated with electron transport and Zn and N foliar concentrations. Negative correlations were found between photosynthesis and trapped fluxes. Diameter growth was positively correlated with electron transport fluxes. Given the different responses among species, ChF is an effective technique to screen for seasonality, fertilization and species effects and should be considered for use during forest restoration. Finally, the addition of fertilization treatments may facilitate tropical forest restoration due to the importance of nutrients in physiological processes. N-fixers showed high photochemical performance and tolerance to abiotic stress in degraded areas and therefore should be included to support ecosystem biomass restoration.

TI  - People plant trees for utility more often than for biodiversity or carbon
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Tree planting is both a promising and controversial solution to climate change and biodiversity loss. However, this controversy is largely theoretical because we lack detailed information of how tree planting is proceeding onthe-ground. Here, we compiled a pantropical dataset of 174 tree planting organizations to determine the type of organizations involved in tree planting, their geographic locations and tree planting approaches. We found that the number of organizations have increased by 288% in the past 30 years, especially for-profit organizations. These organizations reported planting nearly 1.4 billion trees across 74 countries since 1961. Most frequently organizations reported establishing agroforestry systems or mixed species and single species plantations or using assisted natural regeneration, suggesting that tree planting programs are designed to support local communities as well as environmental objectives. Moreover, the most frequently reported species were commercial or utilitarian, with the top five including cacao, teak, moringa, mango and coffee. Finally, despite widespread efforts to plant more trees, there was a pronounced lack of monitoring on websites and in reports; only 18% of organizations mention monitoring at all, and only 5% mention measuring survival rate of plantings. Greater transparency and greater communication are needed between planting organizations and researchers to apply the most effective ways to restore forest cover. Further, while organizations often aimed to counter environmental problems, the use of the same sets of commercially useful species to meet economic development goals across the global indicates a need for greater coordination among organizations to avoid biotic homogenization.

TI  - Contrasting patterns of local richness of seedlings, saplings, and trees may have implications for regeneration in rainforest remnants
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Remnants of lowland rain forest remain following deforestation, but the longer-term effects of fragmentation remain poorly understood, partly due to the long generation times of trees. We study rain forest trees in three size classes: seedlings (<1 cm dbh), saplings (1-5 cm dbh), and trees (>5 cm) that broadly reflect pre- and post-fragmentation communities, and we examine the impacts of fragmentation on forest regeneration in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We found that seedling richness (measured as the number of genera per plot) in fragments was about 30 percent lower than in plots in undisturbed forest, and about 20 percent lower than in an extensive tract of selectively logged forest, providing evidence of recruitment declines in fragments. Seedling richness was lowest in small, isolated, and disturbed fragments, potentially signaling an extinction debt given that these fragmentation impacts were not observed in trees. Unlike seedlings, saplings showed no declines in richness in fragments, suggesting that density dependent mortality (where rare individuals have a higher survival rate) and/or year-to-year variation in which species are recruiting could potentially compensate for the reductions in seedling richness we observed. Longer-term studies are required to determine whether sporadic or failed recruitment in small fragments will eventually translate into reduced richness of mature trees, or whether the processes that currently retain high sapling richness will continue in fragments.

TI  - Land related grievances shape tropical forest-cover in areas affected by armed-conflict
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - Armed-conflicts often occur in tropical areas considered to be of high 'conservation-value', termed as such for their biodiversity or carbon-storage functions. Despite this important overlap, few studies have assessed how forest-biomass is affected by armed-conflicts. Thus, in this paper we develop a multinomial logit model to, examine how outcomes of the interactions between carbon-storage, armed-conflict and deforestation rates are linked to social, institutional and economic factors. We use Colombia as a case study because of its protracted armed-conflict, high forest-cover, sustained deforestation rates and ongoing peace processes. Our empirical results show that the impacts of armed-conflicts on forest-cover are connected to specific socio-economical processes, such as unequal land distribution and land grabbing, which typically occurs as part of 'agricultural colonization'. Findings address a research gap by providing statistically sound evidence for associations between armed-conflicts and land-related grievances, which has rarely been demonstrated empirically. Our results also suggest that forest commons are associated with reduced armed-conflict, and simultaneously provide contributions to carbon storage and to meeting basic needs. Moreover, our forest-conflict transition models provide useful visual means to capture and relay to policymakers-the causes of forest cover-changes in a conflict-affected country. Finally, our findings imply that in dedicating their efforts to resolving land-ownership disputes, the Colombian government might uphold their international climate change commitments via reducing deforestation and hence forest based carbon emissions, while pursuing their national security objective via undermining opportunities for guerrilla groups to operate.

TI  - Measuring the causal effect of no-till system adoption on Brazilian natural areas
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB  - No-till system (NTS) is a method of soil management that involves techniques recommended to increase agricultural land productivity. Therefore, employing NTS results in changes in agricultural land use decisions and indirectly impacts the conservation of natural areas. This study aims to evaluate the causal effect between NTS adoption and land use decisions in Brazil, with particular attention to their impacts on natural areas. The discussion on the effects of NTS use over agricultural practices gains relevance in Brazil, given the country's strategic position in the global agricultural market and the need to preserve tropical natural areas to mitigate global warming and preserve local biodiversity. We conducted this assessment using the statistical approach of spatial propensity score matching, which relies on a small set of assumptions to estimate causal effects in experiments with observational data robustly. Our statistical results show that the adoption of NTS had a positive effect on the natural (0.338; p-value < 0.05) and cultivated agricultural (0.214; p-value < 0.05) areas of the treated municipalities. The evidence from this case study indicates that NTS allows for the recovery of eroded soil and expansion of cultivated lands, preserving natural areas, while corroborating Borlaug's approach and further reinforcing the use of NTS as a sustainable soil management practice.

TI  - Monitoring the rewilding of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest on tree and mammal diversity: From a biodiversity hotspot to a biodiversity hopespot
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
AB  - The implementation of rewilding initiatives is crucial for biodiversity recovery, particularly in biodiversity hotspots such as the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Long-term monitoring of rewilding initiatives is critical for assessing progress and informing management choices. This study assesses the efficiency of different reforestation practices for biodiversity recovery, including passive restoration, active reforestation with different native seedlings, and plantations of exotic species. We applied an ecosystem approach to estimate the tree and mammal diversity, collected through forest plots and camera traps. We selected differently managed areas and included the oldest forest patches as reference points for the assessment of biodiversity; a naturally disturbed montane forest in the area was included as a control category for the disturbance analysis. Moreover, we investigated the influence of ecological variables, such as biodiversity, aboveground biomass, and altitude, on rewilding processes. Our results suggest that Eucalyptus plantations, a simplified ecosystem made up of monocultures of exotic species, support lower biodiversity. On the contrary, active reforestation with different native species resulted in an ecological status comparable to naturally regrown secondary forests. We show that active reforestation can reduce the time required for rewilding. We also found a positive correlation between tree and mammal species richness. These results underscore the importance and potential of responsible restoration efforts in recovering local biodiversity, contributing to the vision of a future where the Brazilian Atlantic Forest can be acknowledged not only as a biodiversity hotspot but also as a "hopespot."

TI  - Monoculture plantations impede forest recovery: Evidence from the regeneration of lowland subtropical forest in Hong Kong
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Anthropogenic disturbance has led to widespread clearance and degradation of tropical forests, and tree planting has been promoted as an effective solution for recovery. However, trees have been overwhelmingly planted in monocultures or low-diversity mixes and this is expected to have profound, lasting impacts on forest structure, diversity, and functioning. In this study, we tested the extent to which historical vegetation transition types (VTTs) constrain forest recovery in a secondary tropical landscape in Hong Kong, South China. To do so, we overlaid vegetation types (forest, shrubland, pine plantation, grassland) identified in aerial photographs taken in 1956 and 1963 of a 20-ha plot situated in Tai Po Kau Nature Reserve, allowing us to define six historic VTTs, namely: FF (forest to forest), GP (grassland to plantation), GS (grassland to shrubland), SS (shrubland to shrubland), SF (shrubland to forest), and SP (shrubland to plantation). We compared present-day forest structure and species diversity among these VTTs, as determined from a census conducted in 2015, using incidence- and abundance-based rarefaction and extrapolation, and we assessed species' association within VTTs using a torus translation test. Our results reveal that stem density and species diversity in naturally regenerated forests were more similar to those of old-growth forest, whereas species diversity in areas occupied by pine plantations was significantly lower as compared with naturally regenerated areas. Despite 60 years of recovery, pine plantations were characterised by a significantly greater proportion of negatively associated species, and late-seral species were still predominantly confined to old-growth patches. Present-day species distribution is chiefly explained by the combined effects of topography and VTT (17.1%), with VTT alone explaining 4.4%. Our study demonstrates that VTT has a significant long-term impact on forest regeneration and community assembly and, importantly, that monocultural plantations (forest plantation) can greatly impede forest recovery. Remnant old-growth forest patches merit priority protection, and active restoration, including thinning and enhancement planting, is necessary to facilitate forest succession.

TI  - Primary productivity and resource partitioning in model tropical ecosystems
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - The diversity of plant life forms in tropical forests affords the opportunity for assembly of plant combinations, both natural and managed, that make full use of resources and sustain high productivity. The influence of combining life forms on productivity and resource use was evaluated using three fast-growing tree species (Hyeronima alchorneoides, Cedrela odorata, and Cordia alliodora); each species was grown alone and with two perennial, large-stature, self-supporting monocots (Euterpe oleracea and Heliconia imbricata).
   Aboveground net primary productivity was extremely high in all stands. The monocots did not contribute significantly to the productivity of the Hyeronima polycultures, which was 4.5-8.4 g.m(-2).d(-1) between 18 and 36 mo. In contrast, the monocots accounted for 57% of the productivity (9.7 g.m(-2).d(-1)) of Cedrela polycultures and 67% of the productivity (6.8 g.m(-2).d(-1)) of the Cordia polycultures, by age 3 yr. The leaf area and density of fine roots in the Cedrela and Cordia polycultures were also significantly increased by the presence of the monocots, reaching or surpassing the levels found in the Hyeronima stands.
   The high productivity of Hyeronima, coupled with poor growth of its interplanted monocots, indicated that Hyeronima was able to achieve nearly complete use of resources. Ecosystem productivity and resource capture were increased when the monocots were grown with the other two tree species, and this occurred because of the inability of the tree species to completely utilize available resources, which provided an opportunity for the monocots to flourish in the understory. Monocot productivity in the Cedrela stands was additive to that of the trees, indicating complementary resource use between the monocots and this tree species. In the case of Cordia, tree productivity was slowed by the monocots, but this decline was more than compensated for by the high productivity of the associated monocots.
   Whether in natural forests or human-constructed agroforestry systems, the presence of dominant species that do not fully exploit all available resources allows the coexistence of other species and creates the potential for complementary resource use. The resource use characteristics of such species should be a key consideration in forest restoration efforts and in the design of sustainable land use systems.

TI  - Southeast Asian biodiversity is a fifth lower in deforested versus intact forests
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Southeast Asia is highly biodiverse and currently experiences among the highest rates of tropical deforestation globally, but impacts on biodiversity are not well synthesized. We use Bayesian multi-level modeling to meta-analyse 831 pairwise comparisons of biodiversity in sites subject to land-use driven deforestation (for example, plantations or logged forest) versus undisturbed sites (control sites). After controlling for hierarchical dependencies, we show that biodiversity is a fifth lower in sites with these land-use driven deforestation (95% credible interval = 16%-28%, mean = 22%). This reduction was greater when forest losses were of high-intensity (34% reduction in biodiversity) compared to low-intensity (18% reduction), and effects were consistent across biogeographic regions and taxa. Oil-palm plantations led to the greatest reduction in biodiversity (39%, CI 27%-48%), and agroforests the least (24%, CI 10%-37%). We also find that biodiversity was reduced by 26% (CI 4%-42%) in secondary forest sites compared to undisturbed control sites, but biodiversity was the same in intermediate or mature-aged secondary forest compared to control sites (although species composition was potentially altered). Overall, our study provides a new line of evidence of the substantial detrimental impacts of land-use driven deforestation and particular types of land-use on the biodiversity of Southeast Asia.

TI  - Variation patterns of plant composition/diversity in Dacrydium pectinatum communities and their driving factors in a biodiversity hotspot on Hainan Island, China
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Climate changes and human-mediated modifications to ecosystems have threatened the biodiversity and habitats of various species. Dacrydium pectinatum is a constructive and endangered species in the tropical mountain forests of Hainan Island, China. In this study, we established sixty-eight 30 m x 30 m permanent plots of D. pectinatum along an environmental axis of temperature and precipitation in the west (Bawangling, 30 plots), southwest (Jianfengling, 30 plots) and east (Diaoluoshan, 8 plots) of Hainan Island. Our objectives are to explore the change mechanisms of plant composition/diversity in the D. pectinatum community at distinct environmental scales and analyze the association between environmental factors (topography, soil and stand conditions) and vegetation distribution. The results showed that the diversity of D. pectinatum communities was lower than that in tropical forests at other sites around the world and much higher than that in subtropical forests at similar latitudes. At the regional scale, plant diversity showed a pattern that decreases with increasing latitude; at the local scale, diversity decreases with increasing elevation. Eight environmental factors, namely, elevation, slope, canopy density, soil organic matter, soil pH, soil total nitrogen, soil available phosphorus and soil available potassium, showed a significant correlation to species distribution. Elevation factors were identified as the determinants of the overall diversity patterns. In conclusion, our study clarified that abiotic environmental factors strongly influence the vegetation structure and diversity pattern of the D. pectinatum communities in various environmental scales. Low temperatures, high humidity, low soil nutrients, and high stand density may be the limiting factors that cause their diversity to decline. We recommend various actions to ameliorate the impact of environmental changes on the D. pectinatum community, such as protecting existing habitats, strengthening monitoring of restrictive environmental factors, appropriate thinning of higher density stands, and conducting research on genetic diversity to improve the community survivability.

TI  - CONGO BASIN FOREST COVER CHANGE ESTIMATE FOR 1990, 2000 AND 2005 BY LANDSAT INTERPRETATION USING AN AUTOMATED OBJECT-BASED PROCESSING CHAIN
T2  - GEOBIA 2010: GEOGRAPHIC OBJECT-BASED IMAGE ANALYSIS
CP  - Conference on Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA)
AB  - Central Africa contains the second largest area of contiguous moist tropical forest of the world. In the framework of the Observatory of Forests in Central Africa (OFAC) and the Forest Resources Assessment (FRA-2010) led by Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), each country is invited to provide an estimation of forest cover change for years 1990-2000-2005 (and later 2010). In this context, developing efficient methods to detect forest changes by processing remote sensing data is more than ever a challenging need. At the moment, only satellite images can provide enough information on processes such as deforestation at the scale of Congo basin. An automatic method has been designed to map and quantify forest change in Central Africa. 1168 subsets of 20 x 20 km of 30 m resolution Landsat or Aster are required to cover the different countries. The different steps of the method are a (1) multi-date segmentation, applied on each extracts triplet (1990-2000 and 2005), (2) an unsupervised classification and an (3) automatic pre-labeling. (4) Change is detected by a statistical object-based method. (5) The involvement of national experts is an essential part of the intepretation process. The OFAC team together with Joint Research Centre (JRC-EU) and FAO invited in Kinshasa (September 2009) 13 national experts from the 6 countries of the Congo Basin to validate the land cover mapping and change maps. National experts check, and change if needed, the pre-interpretation of each sample using an object-based validation tool developed by the JRC. This unique exercise estimates not only deforestation and reforestation but also degradation and regeneration which are particularly important in Central Africa. These results are expected to contribute to the discussion on the reduction of CO2 emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (UN-REDD).

TI  - Disturbance and climate affect species richness and aboveground biomass relationship in a forest-savanna transition ecosystem
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The relationship between species richness and aboveground biomass (richness-biomass relationship) is a major facet of ecosystem functions and has stimulated debates over the past decades. However, we still lack basic knowledge on whether this relationship has consistent patterns across natural and human-impacted vegetation cover types. More importantly, the effects of disturbance and climatic conditions on species richness and aboveground biomass remain controversial. Using data from 197 0.5-ha plots established within a forest-savanna transition ecosystem, we determined three ecological vegetation covers via non-metric multidimensional scaling, obtained gridded climate data and calculated disturbance index from species succession guilds. We examined the consistency of the richness-biomass relationship across the vegetation covers using general linear models and further analysed the effects of disturbance and climatic conditions on this relationship using non-mixed and mixed linear models. We identified three vegetation cover types corresponding to Old-growth forests, Cocoa agroforests and Woodland savannas, suggesting a succession gradient from late-, mid-, and early-successions, respectively. Aboveground biomass consistently increased with species richness across the three vegetation cover types (i.e. positive relationship). Species richness interacts with climate humidity to increase aboveground biomass while interaction of species richness and disturbance rather decreases aboveground biomass consistently across the vegetation cover types. Our results provide insights into the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functions, having implications for ecosystem restoration and understanding ecological consequences of disturbance and climate change in the forest-savanna ecosystem.

TI  - Arthropod responses to the experimental isolation of Amazonian forest fragments
T2  - ZOOLOGIA
AB  - Arthropods are the most diverse and abundant group of animals found in tropical lowland forests, and in light of ongoing global change phenomena, it is essential to better understand their responses to anthropogenic disturbances. Here we present a review of arthropod responses to forest deforestation and fragmentation based on studies conducted at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP), located in central Amazonia. These studies involved a wide range of arthropod groups. All but one of the studies evaluated changes in total species number or species density in relation to fragment size, (i.e. area effects), and one-third also evaluated edge effects. Our review indicates that almost every arthropod group studied showed some kind of response to reduction in forest area, including altered abundances, species richness or composition in comparisons of different-sized fragments, fragmented and non-fragmented areas, or comparisons of forest edges and forest interiors. These responses tended to be idiosyncratic, with some groups showing predicted declines in abundance or diversity in the fragments while others show no response or even increases. However, some of the observed effects on arthropods, or on the ecological processes in which they are involved, were transient. The most likely explanation for this was the rapid development of secondary growth around fragments, which greatly increased the connectivity between fragments and the remaining forest. Although the BDFFP has provided many insights regarding the effects of forest fragmentation on arthropod assemblages, many diverse groups, such as canopy arthropods, have received scant attention. For those that have been studied, much remains to be learned regarding the long-term dynamics of these assemblages and how landscape context influences local biodiversity. The BDFFP remains an exceptional site in which to investigate how the ecological interactions in which arthropods are engaged are altered in fragmented landscapes.

TI  - Planting exceptional tropical tree species to increase long-term carbon storage in assisted secondary succession
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - With rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, strategies for greater carbon sequestration and long-term storage are urgently needed. Current reforestation schemes typically use fast-growing tree species with low wood density, limiting the amount of carbon stored. In most tropical forests, there are native species with relatively fast growth rates, high wood density and low mortality rates that also achieve large adult size-'exceptional species'.We present a simulated assessment of the carbon sequestration potential using these exceptional species in assisted secondary succession in the Neotropics.In our example, the selected exceptional species could add up to 16.2 Mg C/ha of sequestered carbon in secondary wet forests at maturity.Synthesis and applications. By increasing the representation of exceptional species in reforestation efforts, we could potentially boost long-term carbon storage in reforestation projects focussed on carbon sequestration. However, our approach is not a substitute for protecting existing old primary forests and reforested lands plus reducing deforestation and emissions.
   Con el aumento de las concentraciones atmosfericas de CO2, se necesitan urgentemente estrategias para una mayor captura y almacenamiento a largo plazo del carbono. Los esquemas de reforestacion actuales suelen utilizar especies de arboles de rapido crecimiento con baja densidad de madera, lo que limita la cantidad de carbono almacenado. En la mayoria de los bosques tropicales, hay especies nativas con tasas de crecimiento relativamente rapidas, alta densidad de madera y bajas tasas de mortalidad que tambien alcanzan un gran tamano adulto-'especies excepcionales'.Presentamos una evaluacion simulada del potencial de secuestro de carbono usando estas especies excepcionales en la sucesion secundaria asistida en el Neotropico.En nuestro ejemplo, las especies excepcionales seleccionadas podrian sumar hasta 16.2 Mg C/ha de carbono secuestrado en bosques humedos secundarios en su madurez.Sintesis y aplicaciones. Al aumentar la representacion de especies excepcionales en los esfuerzos de reforestacion, podriamos impulsar potencialmente el almacenamiento de carbono a largo plazo en proyectos de reforestacion centrados en el secuestro de carbono. Sin embargo, nuestro enfoque no reemplaza la proteccion de los bosques primarios antiguos existentes y las tierras reforestadas, ni reduce la necesidad de disminuir la deforestacion y las emisiones.

TI  - Few functionally acquisitive big-sized trees restrict but soil nutrients promote soil organic carbon storage in temperate deciduous forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) storage plays a crucial role in mitigating global climate change while maintaining forests and sustaining environmental conditions. Recent studies have shown that plant species diversity increases SOC storage in experimental grasslands and natural forests. Here, we aim to show how an integrating tree-size and trait-based ecological approach leads to mechanistic insights into SOC storage that may be overlooked in previous studies. We hypothesized that tree functional diversity effects on SOC storage would change with tree -sized-based species' functional strategies driven by soil properties in natural temperate deciduous forests. We used the forest inventory data, site-specific measured traits and soil properties from 99 temperate deciduous forest plots in northwestern Iran. We investigated the joint effects of topographic factors, soil chemical prop-erties, and the functional attributes (multi-trait functional diversity indices and community-weighted trait mean indices) of big-sized trees (BsT; individual tree diameter = 50 cm) and remaining-sized trees (RsT) on topsoil (0-30 cm) SOC storage. The multiple linear regression models showed that SOC storage increased with increasing soil available phosphorus (r = 0.36), soil exchangeable potassium (r = 0.27 to 0.31) and soil total nitrogen (r = 0.27). In contrast, SOC storage declined with increasing the community-weighted mean of specific leaf area (r =-0.38 to-0.40). The structural equation model showed that SOC storage was directly driven by the positive effect of soil nutrients (i.e. a latent variable of soil total nitrogen and available phosphorus; r = 0.42) and the negative effect of the community-weighted mean of specific leaf area (r =-0.31). The topographic factors as well as the other several functional attributes of BsT and RsT showed non-significant direct and indirect effects on SOC storage in both types of statistical modelling. Our study suggests that the mass ratio and soil fertility rather than the niche complementarity effects along with the big-sized trees effect regulates SOC storage through the acquisitive trait identity of BsT species as compared to RsT species in temperate deciduous forests. We argue that maintaining high levels of species diversity with the most efficient trait identity across tree sizes is important for biodiversity conservation and multiple forest functions such as SOC storage which should be a priority for plantation management plans or silvicultural practices in natural forests.

TI  - Plant functional traits under cattle grazing and fallow age scenarios in a tropical dry forest of Northwestern Mexico
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Evaluating plant functional traits helps to understand how plants respond to changing environmental conditions and resource availability associated with disturbance events. Livestock production is one of the primary drivers of tropical forest loss and degradation. Livestock alter environmental conditions within the forest by grazing, trampling and nutrient inputs, which in turn can influence species composition and functional traits of species. Understanding how livestock influence functional traits along a successional gradient is poorly understood. Here, we studied the effect of cattle grazing and fallow age on plant functional traits and soil nutrients in secondary and old-growth tropical dry forests. We analyzed plant functional traits of the most important species in successional and old-growth forest communities in both cattle present and cattle excluded plots. Our results showed the effects of cattle grazing and fallow age on plant functional traits, with fallow age explaining more variation than cattle grazing. In early succession, functional traits were associated with water conservation (thicker leaves, lower specific leaf area), and in later successional they were linked with sunlight conservation (larger height, higher specific leaf area). The presence of large fruits and seeds in advanced successional sites suggests high resource availability, which may help plants to successfully reproduce. Moreover, under cattle grazing some functional traits are associated with herbivory defense (high foliar dry weight and thick leaves). Even though N and C increased as succession advanced, the sites with cattle grazing had higher NH4 and NO3 concentrations as a result of fecal deposition. Plant functional traits responded to fallow age than to cattle grazing. Our study showed that cattle exclusion, as a management and biodiversity conservation strategy, contributes positively to soil nutrition. Thus, fallow age and cattle exclusion facilitate soil recovery and allows establishing species with suitable functional attributes for overcoming environmental filters in abandoned cattle fields.

TI  - Distribution of Ormosia macrocalyx in Mexico and delimitation of its occupation areas
T2  - REVISTA MEXICANA DE BIODIVERSIDAD
AB  - The geographic-ecological distribution of Ormosia macrocalyx Ducke was analyzed to delimit the occupation areas (AO) in Mexico, in order to recognize the ecological requirements of this tree species, which can contribute to the development and establishment of appropriate protection programs. All georeferenced species records were obtained from national and international herbaria as well as national forest inventories. Each record was correlated with the ecological variables from database of National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity and National Institute of Statistics and Geography and maps of the AO were drawn up. The AO were calculated and delimited by the Cartographic method by conglomerates. This species is distributed in the southern states of Mexico, occupying zones of high precipitation (>= 800 mm), at elevations lower than 1,150 m asl and mainly on Gleysol soils. It has been recorded in forest remnants in agroforestry systems and as isolated individuals. Five AO and 6 satellites were delimited, the 2 largest areas located within Tabasco and Chiapas. Due to its specialized habitat and the fragmented ecosystems in which it is found, this species can be categorized as vulnerable.

TI  - Rapid colonization of a Hawaiian restoration forest by a diverse avian community
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Deforestation of tropical forests has led to widespread loss and extirpation of forest bird species around the world, including the Hawaiian Islands which have experienced a dramatic loss of forests over the last 200-800 years. Given the important role birds play in forest ecosystem functions via seed dispersal and pollination, a bird community's response to forest restoration is an important measure of the success of such conservation actions. We evaluated the bird response to reforestation at an important bird sanctuary, Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge, Hawaii Island, using 26 years of bird count data. We show that most species from within the diverse avian community increased significantly, but species colonized the restoration forest at different rates. Distance from intact forest and time since restoration were both important predictors of colonization rate, interacting such that for most species it took more time to colonize areas farther from the intact forest. In addition, both forest cover and understory diversity helped to explain bird densities, but the effect varied among species, suggesting that different habitat requirements may help drive variation in colonization rates. This article provides the first detailed evaluation of how a diverse community of birds has responded to one of the largest, ongoing reforestation projects in Hawaii.

TI  - Diversity, Population Structure and Distribution of Trees in Tropical Dry Forests, East Godavari District, Eastern Ghats, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Tree diversity and population structure were analysed in two dry tropical forest sites of the Eastern Ghats in East Godavari District, Andhra Pradesh. One-hectare area (4 plots of 0.25ha each) was selected in each study site for quantitative tree inventory. A total of 99 species (71 in the site 1 and 77 in site II) from 31 families were recorded. Of which the adults (>= 10 cm DBH) and juvenile (>= 3-<10cm DBH) population of tree species were greater in the site 1 (45 and 49) than site 11 (34 and 35) while saplings (<3 cm DBH) contribution showed a reverse trend (55 in site I and 72 in site II). The basal area ranged 20.6-29.4 m(2)/ha. The mean stem density was 506 stems/ha. Diameter class-wise distribution showed reverse "J" shaped curve. Leguminosae was most speciose family. Maximum species showed contagious distribution pattern in all the stages except for adult and juvenile populations in the site 1 where the maximum distribution was random. Xylia xylocarpa is a single dominant species in both the study sites which indicates that these forest sites were subjected to disturbances in the past. Population structure enlightens that the sites have a good regeneration potential. The present study reveals that the tropical dry forest sites in East Godavari region restore substantial tree diversity as similar to other parts Eastern Ghats and tropics. There is a variation in species richness, abundance, basal area and distribution pattern between the sites could be attributed to differences in topographical position of sites, soil moisture, microclimate, human activities, grazing and seasonal fires.

TI  - Enhanced carbon, nitrogen and associated bacterial community compositional complexity, stability, evenness, and differences within the tree-soils of Inga punctata along an age gradient of planted trees in reforestation plots
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Aims This study was designed to determine if planting the leguminous tree Inga punctata in previously cleared former tropical premontane wet forests changed the Nitrogen (N)-fixer and Lignin Degrader community compositions resulting in increased accumulation of soil carbon (C) and N components. Methods Soils were collected near the base of old growth (> 50 years old), 4, 8 and 11-year-old I. punctata trees, and assessed for differences in various soil C and N metrics, and the mean proportion of sequences (MPS, as "relative abundance " via 16S rRNA V3, V4 sequencing), composition, stability and evenness of the N-fixer and Lignin Degrader community genera. Results The N-fixer MPS decreased, and Lignin Degraders increased, while evenness and stability of both increased in soils along the tree age gradient. The Lignin Degrader MPS were positively correlated with TN, NO3-, TOC, and Biomass C, and negatively correlated with N-fixer MPS and NH4+. The N-fixer MPS were negatively correlated with TN, NO3-, TOC, Biomass-C and Lignin Degrader MPS, and positively correlated with NH4+. Evenness, stability, and dissimilarity increased for both groups in soils along the tree age gradient. Conclusions This is the first evidence that I. punctata facilitates changes in tree-soil N-fixer and Lignin Degrader communities over time by increasing the dissimilarity, evenness and stability of both groups, and increases the accumulation of tree soil C and N. This suggests I. punctata facilitates soil recovery such that it can serve as C and N sinks and support its future use in reforestation management strategy.

TI  - Ecosystem impacts of disturbance in a dry tropical forest in southern India
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
AB  - Indian forests provide a multitude of services to vast populations. Common human activities including livestock grazing, fuelwood extraction and burning have the potential to impact forest ecosystem structure and function. The effects of these activities on vegetation, ecology and soil properties were investigated in Bandipur National Park (BNP) in southern India. Data were collected from 200 sites in four watersheds within the park. Sample sites spanned a degradation gradient measured by a field disturbance index (FDI). This paper focusses on the impacts on vegetation structure, diversity and composition, and integrates impacts on soil. Shrub and tree species were inventoried and evaluated in plots 10-m in diameter. The tree layer was dominated by Anogeissus-Emblica-Tectona species. The understory was dominated by invasives Chromolaena odorata and Lantana camara, and native gymnosporia emarginata. Vegetation plot heights, canopy cover and tree diameters were negatively correlated with field disturbance resulting in stunted forest stature in degraded sites. Vegetation composition in degraded watersheds was dominated by small woody tree species and a greater diversity of shrub species. Ordination analysis was used to integrate soil data with vegetation and disturbance, revealing that deciduous forest in the park is degrading to scrub forest along with negative impacts on soil characteristics. Consequences of services currently enjoyed by local populations are discussed. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Life after logging: post-logging recovery of a neotropical bat community
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. There is considerable debate about whether tropical forests can be managed for timber production and to conserve biodiversity. Few 'sustainable forestry' systems have been evaluated adequately in this respect. Microchiropteran bats may be model taxa for this purpose. They are an important component of mammalian diversity, play key roles in forest dynamics and are indicators of disturbance in neotropical forests.
   2. We investigated the effect of Trinidad's periodic block system (PBS) on bat species diversity and community organization. PBS is a polycyclic system of selective logging with a 30-year harvesting rotation. We captured bats in primary forest and PBS-managed forest logged 33, 31, 21, 20 and 10 years previously.
   3. Selective logging did not affect species diversity but did affect community structure. Frugivorous bats were significantly more abundant in logged forest whereas gleaning animalivores were more abundant in primary forest, suggesting that frugivores benefited and gleaning animalivores were adversely affected by logging.
   4. The bat community showed evidence of recovery. The number of years since forest disturbance was positively correlated with the abundance and number of species of gleaning animalivores and negatively correlated with the proportional abundance of the most common species. Gleaning animalivores increased in abundance with forest regeneration, whereas the community became less dominated by a single generalist frugivore.
   5. Synthesis and applications. PBS selective logging appears to be compatible with the conservation of bat diversity. This provides evidence that neotropical forests can be managed for timber production in an ecologically sustainable way and that significant biodiversity conservation efforts can occur outside national parks and nature reserves in areas set aside for sustainable development. PBS could serve as a basic blueprint for sustainable forestry in the Guianan Shield where there are forests similar in species composition to those of Trinidad. Key attributes that could be adopted by many tropical countries to manage their forests in an ecologically sustainable way are a low intensity harvest, a long rotation and multiple controls on harvesting.

TI  - Tree species diversity relative to human land uses in tropical rain forest margins in Central Sulawesi
T2  - STABILITY OF TROPICAL RAINFOREST MARGINS: LINKING ECOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONSTRAINTS OF LAND USE AND CONSERVATION
CP  - International Symposium on Stability of Tropical Rainforest Margins
AB  - The large-scale exploitation and conversion of tropical forests causes growing concern about the continued existence of the rich biodiversity of these forests. In the framework of the interdisciplinary STORMA project in Lore Lindu National Park area in Central Sulawesi, we studied tree diversity in six different land use types in the margins of submontane rain forest: undisturbed forest, forest with rattan extraction, selectively logged forest, cacao forest gardens, cacao plantations with mixed canopy of planted trees, and cacao plantations with a monospecific canopy. By analyzing such a finely subdivided use gradient it was attempted to answer the question how human usage and biodiversity conservation in the study area may be reconciled. Tree species (dbh > 10 cm) were sampled in 24 plots of 0.25 ha in all six land use types (4 replicates each). In total, 251 tree species (143 genera, 59 families) were recorded. Number of tree species per 0.25 ha was 51-63 in primary forest and gradually decreased towards the studied cacao systems. However, when native and cultivated tree species were considered separately, significant differences were detected among plantation types in terms of tree diversity. Tree endemism in forest plots totalled ca. 15% and was in good accordance with endemism in woody plants of Sulawesi. The number of endemic species was strongly reduced in cacao systems, although percentage endemism did not decline significantly in cacao forest gardens. Roughly one third of tree species in the forest plots were of economic importance as commercial timber trees; timber diversity was little affected by moderate human use of the forest but was significantly reduced in cacao forest gardens and dropped to near zero in other plantation types. The mean basal area of 57 m(2) (36-80 m(2)) per ha in natural forest was lower than the previously recorded value from the study area but is still almost double as high as the mean value typical for tropical lowland forests in Southeast Asia.
   The results of this study support the notion that tree diversity in the sub-montane forests of Central Sulawesi is unusually high and rich in large-sized timber trees, although tree size varies locally. Moderate human use of the forest ecosystems does not significantly affect tree diversity. We conclude that conservation of tropical tree diversity is compatible with human exploitation of tropical forest as long as a canopy of native trees is maintained. Future conservation policies in rain forest margin areas should therefore focus on developing measures aimed at sustainable use of the natural resources. Promotion of such activities may help to stabilize tropical rain forest margins in Central Sulawesi.

TI  - Forest fragmentation in China and its effect on biodiversity
T2  - BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
AB  - Land-use change is fragmenting natural ecosystems, with major consequences for biodiversity. This paper reviews fragmentation trends - historical and current - in China, the fourth largest country on Earth, and explores its consequences. Remote sensing makes it possible to track land-use change at a global scale and monitor fragmentation of dwindling natural landscapes. Yet few studies have linked fragmentation mapped remotely with impacts on biodiversity within human-modified landscapes. Recent reforestation programs have caused substantial increases in forest cover but have not stopped fragmentation, because the new forests are mostly monocultures that further fragment China's remnant old-growth lowland forests that harbour the highest levels of biodiversity. Fragmentation - and associated biodiversity declines - is unevenly distributed in China's forests, being most problematic where agricultural expansion is occurring in the southwest and northeast, serious in the densely populated eastern regions where urbanisation and transport infrastructure are modifying landscapes, but less of a problem in other regions. Analyses of temporal trends show that the drivers of forest fragmentation are shifting from mainly agricultural expansion to urbanisation and infrastructure development. Most of China's old-growth forests persist in small, isolated fragments from which many native species have disappeared, on land unsuitable for human utilisation. Fragmentation throughout China is likely to have major consequences on biodiversity conservation, but few studies have considered these large-scale processes at the national level. Our review fills this research gap and puts forward a systematic perspective relevant to China and beyond.

TI  - Relative fire-proneness of land cover types in the Brazilian Atlantic forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Fires are increasingly affecting tropical biomes, where landscape-fire interactions remain understudied. We investigate the fire-proneness-the likelihood of a land use or land cover (LULC) type burning more or less than expected based on availability-in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (AF). This biodiversity hotspot is increasingly affected by fires due to human activities and climate change. Using a selection ratio-based approach, we analyzed fire-LULC interactions in 40,869 fires over a 35-year period (1987-2022) across various ecoregions in the AF. Our findings revealed that secondary forests, forest areas that have regrown after major disturbances, burned 61% more than expected by chance, whereas old-growth forests, native forests that have developed over very long periods, burned 57% less than expected, highlighting a nearly inverse relationship in their fire-proneness. Interestingly, our data indicate that pastures in the AF are less prone to fire than expected, despite being considered among the land uses that burn the most in Brazil. Other LULCs showed variable fire-proneness, with some differences between ecoregions. Over time, the fire-proneness of secondary forests decreased, likely due to forest aging and changes in land management practices. We emphasize the necessity for tailored fire management strategies that address the unique vulnerabilities of secondary forests, particularly in the context of ongoing restoration efforts aimed at increasing native forests. Effective measures, including the implementation of 'firesmart management' practices and enhancing the perceived value of secondary forests among local communities, are crucial for mitigating fire risks. Integrating these strategies with incentive-based approaches can bolster fire prevention, ensuring the long-term success of restoration programs. Our study provides a framework for understanding fire-landscape dynamics in tropical forests and offers actionable insights for practitioners working to safeguard these biomes from the escalating threat of wildfires.

TI  - Genetic structure and demographic history of the endangered tree species Dysoxylum malabaricum (Meliaceae) in Western Ghats, India: implications for conservation in a biodiversity hotspot
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - The impact of fragmentation by human activities on genetic diversity of forest trees is an important concern in forest conservation, especially in tropical forests. Dysoxylum malabaricum (white cedar) is an economically important tree species, endemic to the Western Ghats, India, one of the world's eight most important biodiversity hotspots. As D.malabaricum is under pressure of disturbance and fragmentation together with overharvesting, conservation efforts are required in this species. In this study, range-wide genetic structure of twelve D.malabaricum populations was evaluated to assess the impact of human activities on genetic diversity and infer the species' evolutionary history, using both nuclear and chloroplast (cp) DNA simple sequence repeats (SSR). As genetic diversity and population structure did not differ among seedling, juvenile and adult age classes, reproductive success among the old-growth trees and long distance seed dispersal by hornbills were suggested to contribute to maintain genetic diversity. The fixation index (F-IS) was significantly correlated with latitude, with a higher level of inbreeding in the northern populations, possibly reflecting a more severe ecosystem disturbance in those populations. Both nuclear and cpSSRs revealed northern and southern genetic groups with some discordance of their distributions; however, they did not correlate with any of the two geographic gaps known as genetic barriers to animals. Approximate Bayesian computation-based inference from nuclear SSRs suggested that population divergence occurred before the last glacial maximum. Finally we discussed the implications of these results, in particular the presence of a clear pattern of historical genetic subdivision, on conservation policies.

TI  - TEK and biodiversity management in agroforestry systems of different socio-ecological contexts of the Tehuacan Valley
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
AB  - Transformation of natural ecosystems into intensive agriculture is a main factor causing biodiversity loss worldwide. Agroforestry systems (AFS) may maintain biodiversity, ecosystem benefits and human wellbeing, they have therefore high potential for concealing production and conservation. However, promotion of intensive agriculture and disparagement of TEK endanger their permanence. A high diversity of AFS still exist in the world and their potentialities vary with the socio-ecological contexts. We analysed AFS in tropical, temperate, and arid environments, of the Tehuacan Valley, Mexico, to investigate how their capacity varies to conserve biodiversity and role of TEK influencing differences in those contexts. We hypothesized that biodiversity in AFS is related to that of forests types associated and the vigour of TEK and management. We conducted studies in a matrix of environments and human cultures in the Tehuacan Valley. In addition, we reviewed, systematized and compared information from other regions of Mexico and the world with comparable socio-ecological contexts in order to explore possible general patterns. Our study found from 26 % to nearly 90 % of wild plants species richness conserved in AFS, the decreasing proportion mainly associated to pressures for intensifying agricultural production and abandoning traditional techniques. Native species richness preserved in AFS is influenced by richness existing in the associated forests, but the main driver is how people preserve benefits of components and functions of ecosystems. Elements of modern agricultural production may coexist with traditional management patterns, but imposition of modern models may break possible balances. TEK influences decisions on what and how modern techniques may be advantageous for preserving biodiversity, ecosystem integrity in AFS and people's wellbeing. TEK, agroecology and other sciences may interact for maintaining and improving traditional AFS to increase biodiversity and ecosystem integrity while improving quality of life of people managing the AFS.

TI  - Contemporary forest restoration: A review emphasizing function
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The forest restoration challenge (globally 2 billion ha) and the prospect of changing climate with increasing frequency of extreme events argues for approaching restoration from a functional and landscape perspective. Because the practice of restoration utilizes many techniques common to silviculture, no clear line separates ordinary forestry practices from restoration. The distinction may be that extra-ordinary activities are required in the face of degraded, damaged, or destroyed ecosystems. Restoration is driven by the desire to increase sustainability of ecosystems and their services and restoration is likely to have multiple goals arising from the motivations of those involved. The process of setting restoration objectives translates vague goals into feasible, measurable targets and ultimately actions on the ground. Our objective for this review is to synthesize the science underpinning contemporary approaches to forest restoration practice. We focus on methods and present them within a coherent terminology of four restoration strategies: rehabilitation, reconstruction, reclamation, and replacement. While not a consensus terminology, these terms have a logical foundation. Rehabilitation restores desired species composition, structure, or processes to a degraded ecosystem. Reconstruction restores native plant communities on land recently in other resource uses, such as agriculture. Reclamation restores severely degraded land generally devoid of vegetation, often the result of resource extraction, such as mining. Replacement of species (or their locally-adapted genotypes) with new species (or new genotypes) is a response to climate change. Restoration methods are presented as available tools; because adding vegetation is an effective restoration technique, the discussion of methods begins with a description of available plant materials. We then discuss altering composition under different initial overstory conditions, including deployment methods depending upon whether or not an overstory is present, how much of the landscape will be restored, and the complexity of the planting design. We present some major approaches for altering structure in degraded forest stands, and describe approaches for restoration of two key ecosystem processes, fire and flooding. Although we consider stand-level designs, what we describe is mostly scalable to the landscape-level. No restoration project is undertaken in a social vacuum; even stand-level restoration occurs within a system of governance that regulates relationships among key agents. Gathering information and understanding the social dimensions of a restoration project is as necessary as understanding the biophysical dimensions. Social considerations can trump biophysical factors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Designing protected area networks that translate international conservation commitments into national action
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Most countries have committed to protect 17% of their terrestrial area by 2020 through Aichi Target 11 of the Convention on Biological Diversity, with a focus on protecting areas of particular importance for biodiversity. This means national-scale spatial conservation prioritisations are needed to help meet this target and guide broader conservation and land-use policy development. However, to ensure these assessments are adopted by policy makers, they mist also consider national priorities. This situation is exemplified by Guyana, a corner of Amazonia that couples high biodiversity with low economic development. In recent years activities that threaten biodiversity conservation have increased, and consequently, protected areas are evermore critical to achieving the Aichi targets. Here we undertake a cost-effective approach to protected area planning in Guyana that accounts for in-country conditions. To do this we conducted a stakeholder-led spatial conservation prioritisation based on meeting targets for 17 vegetation types and 329 vertebrate species, while minimising opportunity costs for forestry, mining, agriculture and urbanisation. Our analysis identifies 3 million ha of priority areas for conservation, helping inform government plans to double the current protected area network from 8.5 to 17%. As part of this, we also develop a new technique to prioritise engagement with local communities whose lands are identified as important to conservation. Our study both provides a scientifically robust, politically acceptable protected area expansion strategy for Guyana, and illustrates the importance of conservation planning at the country-scale to translate international commitments into national action.

TI  - Trees outside forests as climate change mitigation champions: evaluating their carbon sequestration potential and monetary value in Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak (Haryana), India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB  - The annual average increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration is touching new heights every year. Global climate change and warming are twin outcomes of record-breaking CO2 levels. The trees outside forests (TOF) are the most promising and suitable components in the ecosystem for combating global warming via carbon (C) sequestration. Urban university campuses are the hotspot regions of TOF. We have attempted to quantify the C stock, C sequestration potential, and C credit value of dominant tree species at Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU), Rohtak. Different volumetric and biomass equations were used for biomass computation. We assessed a total of 29,442 trees (top 10) for measuring phytosociological parameters like total tree count, age, height (H), and diameter at breast height (DBH) to quantify the amount of C stored. The total C stock, C sequestration rate, and monetary value were 78.67 (Mg C ha(-1)), 19.05 (Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1)), and 23,101.59 $ year(-1), respectively. Eucalyptus globulus is the most dominant tree species on the campus and topped almost all the quantitative characteristics like total tree count (similar to 40 %), age (25 years), density (D) (55.35 trees ha(-1)), and total C stock (16.06 & PLUSMN; 9.90 Mg C ha(-1)). Tree basal area (BA), D, diversity, and H positively affected the total C stocks. When the C market becomes operational, these C credits can be traded while generating additional income for the university. The results from this study can also help calculate the total C footprint of the campus.

TI  - India's biodiversity hotspot under anthropogenic pressure: A case study of Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
AB  - This paper presents data on the impact of biotic pressure in terms of grazing by livestock and wood cutting by humans on the plant community in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve of India. Grass, and herbaceous plant biomass, number of cattle dung piles, number of woody stems available and damaged by human activities and weed biomass were assessed at different proximity along transects radiating from village-forest boundary to forest interior to measure the ecological impact of livestock grazing and fire wood collection. The grass biomass was positively correlated to overgrazing indicating the adverse effect on natural vegetation by cattle. Woodcutting was intense along the forest boundary and significantly declined as distance increased. Similarly, weed biomass and number of thorny species declined positively with proximity from village-forest boundary and the weed biomass was significantly higher in the pastoral sites compared to residential sites. The results suggest that human impact adversely affects natural vegetation and promotes weed proliferation in forest areas adjoining human settlements in the ecologically important Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. Continued anthropogenic pressure could cause reduction in fodder availability to large herbivores like elephants, which in turn leads to an increase in human-elephant conflict.

TI  - Calling for landscape-level assessments of participatory forestry?s role in improving forest biophysical conditions
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Participatory forest management (PFM) has been applied to address declining tropical forest conditions. In the literature, there is a mixed evidence on PFM's role in improving forest conditions. However, most assessments ignore a relationship between household distance from PFM forests and impacts to non-PFM forests albeit being an essential aspect. Some PFM assessments show that distance matters in determining an individual's participation But, sparsely discussing the distance in relation to forest biophysical conditions in a landscape context. Drawing on the landscape approach and insights from Miombo forests of Kilwa in southern Tanzania, we illustrate the importance of studying PFM schemes in a landscape context to illuminate the relationship between household distance from PFM forests and impacts to non-PFM forests. Our study villages have forest abundances in areas between households and PFM forests. The average distance between households and PFM forests is 7.8 km. The long distances and forest abundances produce an 'outbound effect', whereby degrading and deforesting activities shift from PFM to non-PFM forests. Our analysis calls for landscape-level assessments that include forests under different governance regimes even those in unreserved landscapes - non-PFM forests. This is important for two reasons. First, for generating locally grounded contextual insights necessary for developing understandings of global forest conservation efforts from the 'ground up'. Second, for revealing correct forest conditions in the entire landscape critical in the light of ongoing national and international interests to manage trees inside and outside designated forest reserves for both carbon sequestration and landscape restoration.

TI  - Anthropogenic activities affect forest structure and arthropod abundance in a Kenyan biodiversity hotspot
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Land-use change remains the main threat to tropical forests and their dependent fauna and flora, and degradation of existing forest remnants will further accelerate species loss. Forest degradation may result directly from human forest use or through spatial effects of land-use change. Understanding the drivers of forest degradation and its effects on biodiversity is pivotal for formulating impactful forest management and monitoring protocols, but such knowledge is lacking for many biodiversity hotspots, such as the Taita Hills in southeast Kenya. Here we first quantify effects of social factors (human activity and presence) at plot and landscape level, forest management (gazetted vs. non-gazetted) and spatial factors (fragment size and distance to forest edge) on the vegetation structure of indigenous Taita forest fragments. Next, we quantify effects of degraded vegetation structure on arthropod abundance and diversity. We show that human presence and activity at both the plot and landscape level explain variation in vegetation structure. We particularly provide evidence that despite a national ban on cutting of indigenous trees, poaching of pole-sized trees for subsistence use may be simplifying vegetation structure, with the strongest effects in edge-dominated, small forest fragments. Furthermore, we found support for a positive effect of vegetation structure on arthropod abundance, although the effect of daily maximum temperature and yearly variation was more pronounced. Maintenance of multi-layered forest vegetation in addition to reforestation maybe a key to conservation of the endangered and endemic fauna of the Taita Hills.

TI  - Biodiversity impacts of land use simplification: a case study of dung beetles in a landscape of the Brazilian Atlantic forest
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
AB  - Unplanned and invasive use of natural resources can have irreversible implications for the environment. Appropriate strategies for adequate management could have utmost importance for the conservation of biodiversity. Environments that harbor a huge structural complexity, such as agroforestry systems, even the simplest ones, may host a high species diversity and may therefore ensure the provision of important ecological services. To examine the effect of vegetation structure loss by land use simplification on biodiversity, we evaluate dung beetle (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) diversity in different land uses, considering: Brazilian Atlantic Forest, cacao-rubber agroforestry, and rubber monoculture. We found a decreasing gradient of dung beetle diversity from forest to monoculture, as cacao-rubber agroforestry maintaining an intermediate level of dung beetle diversity that is lower than that of the native forest but significantly higher than rubber monoculture. Species composition is rather similar when comparing forest and agroforestry, whereas monoculture holds a different assemblage. Although monoculture farming is still encouraged by the agribusiness market, our results support the idea that agroforestry is a reasonable option to be considered and adapted to compensate the deleterious effects of agriculture intensification on dung beetle diversity. We suggest that such land use would be the best choice to ensure dung beetle diversity maintenance in agricultural landscapes.
