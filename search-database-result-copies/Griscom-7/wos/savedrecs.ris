TI  - Sugarcane straw management for bioenergy: effects of global warming on greenhouse gas emissions and soil carbon storage
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming can intensify the soil organic matter (SOM) turnover, damaging soil health. Crop residues left on the soil are important to maintain a positive SOM budget and nutrient cycling. But, sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) straw has been removed from the field for bioenergy purposes. We hypothesize that global warming, together with straw removal, will negatively impact Brazil's ethanol carbon footprint. Thus, we conducted an experiment under controlled conditions to evaluate the impacts of warming and straw removal on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, soil carbon and nitrogen storage, and nutrient cycling. Two soils (Rhodic Acrisol and Eutric Nitisol) were tested with three rates of sugarcane straw removal (no removal (NR): equivalent to 12 Mg ha(-1); medium removal (MR): 6 Mg ha(-1); and total removal (TR): bare soil) and submitted to two temperatures (24 degrees C and 30 degrees C) and soil moistures (30% and 50%). Straw decomposition was stimulated by lower rates of straw removal, resulting in increases on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions between 5 to 14 times, and N2O between 25 and 40%. There were no significant methane (CH4) fluxes. Soil carbon and nitrogen did not change due to straw removal, yet labile carbon fractions (living and non-living) were highly impacted, causing reductions of 15 to 40% on the carbon management index (CMI). Furthermore, straw removal reduced nutrient cycling between 10 and 30%. Overall, in a scenario of warming, our findings point to an intensification of SOM dynamic, resulting in increases of 35% on the GHG emissions and a CMI reduction by 20%. In practical terms, at least 6 Mg ha(-1)of straw should be left in the field, guaranteeing raw-material for bioenergy, without causing major impacts on the GHG emission and soil attributes.

TI  - Increasing complexity of agroforestry systems benefits nutrient cycling and mineral-associated organic carbon storage, in south-eastern Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems are often promoted as solutions to address land degradation and climate change. However, agroforestry is an umbrella term for a large variety of systems and it is not clear how their degree of complexity influences their provision of soil-based ecosystem services, such as soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and nutrient cycling. Furthermore, a knowledge gap remains whether agroforestry systems perform equally well on all soil types. The objectives of this study were 1) to assess the links between agroforestry complexity, nutrient cycling and SOC fractions, and 2) to assess how soil texture influences these relationships in Brazilian agroforestry systems. We sampled 59 agroforestry plots across 30 sites in Sao Paulo state, Brazil, and 8 monocrop sites (6 pastures and 2 crop monocultures). The 38 sites represented a soil textural gradient, ranging from very sandy to very clayey (clay content range 25 - 620 g kg(-1)). An Agroforestry Complexity Index (ACI) was defined based on tree species richness, stem density and pruning management. Nutrient (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) and C contents were determined in litter and soil (0-30 cm depth) samples, and mineral-associated organic C (MAOC) and particulate organic C (POC) in soil samples were assessed as well. ACI was positively associated with C, N, P, Ca and Mg stocks in litter, and these litter nutrients were in turn positively associated with the corresponding soil nutrient stocks. Associations between soil nutrients and MAOC were stronger on sandy soils than on clayey soils, particularly for P, Ca and Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC). For POC, robust relationships with nutrients were only found on sandy soils. Structural Equation Models indicated causal relationships between agroforestry complexity, P and Ca cycling, and MAOC and POC stocks in topsoils. Our results indicate that nutrients effectively cycle from in situ mulch into plant-available soil pools and highlight the synergies between nutrient cycling and stable C stocks that can be achieved in complex agroforestry systems. These synergies seem to be particularly strong on sandy soils (<15 % clay).

TI  - Asymmetric impacts of two herbivore ecotypes on similar host plants
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Ecotypes may arise following allopatric separation from source populations. The simultaneous transfer of an exotic plant to a novel environment, along with its stenophagous herbivore, may complicate more traditional patterns of divergence from the plant and insect source populations.2. The present study evaluated herbivory effects by two Cyrtobagous salviniae ecotypes on two species of Salvinia: the larger S. molesta and the smaller S. minima. Evaluations were based on relative growth rates, biomass production, coverage, and nutrient cycling in a series of complementary and comparative laboratory and outdoor tank experiments.3. In general, the experiment results indicated that the smaller Florida ecotype of C. salviniae impacted both Salvinia species more than the larger Brazil ecotype. Herbivory, especially by the Florida ecotype, also improved water quality and accelerated nutrient cycling by increasing the rates of litterfall from the standing crops of salvinia.4. The smaller size of the Florida ecotype may be adaptive by allowing maximal exploitation of host plants via internal larval feeding, which presumably reduces predation risk while increasing damage to the plant. These findings provide support for relying on the suppressive effects of the Florida ecotype in Florida, rather than introducing the Brazil ecotype to counter new infestations of S. molesta.

TI  - Soil biotic and abiotic traits as driven factors for site quality of Araucaria angustifolia plantations
T2  - BIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of soil biotic and abiotic factors in crucial soil functions such as primary production, organic matter dynamics, nutrient cycling, and soil biota community structure in the Araucaria ecosystem remains poorly quantified. We aimed to understand how the development of organic horizons, root growth, soil chemical properties, and the entire soil biota community affected the soil quality in even aged and monospecific Araucaria angustifolia plantations. We collected soil monoliths to describe layers of organic matter and the complex soil food web into these layers. We determined soil pH, soil moisture, total nitrogen, available P, and total organic carbon into each layer (litter, F-layer, H-layer, and A horizon), the biomass of fine roots, the community structure of soil biota, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and nematodes, as well as the microbial biomass carbon. In the high-quality site, there was significantly higher organic matter formation, nutrient cycling (N and P), root growth, soil moisture, soil biota diversity, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and nematodes evaluated by the microbial biomass carbon compared to the low-quality site. High-quality sites promote the development of organic horizons, root growth on superficial layers that provide plant nutrient release, the A horizon nutrient contents, and the entire soil biota community in monospecific Araucaria angustifolia plantations located on humid subtropical Cambisols. This creates a positive plant-soil feedback that maintains soil quality and increases primary production, nutrient cycling, and habitat and food for the soil food web.

TI  - Deposition and Decomposition of Signal Grass Pasture Litter under Varying Nitrogen Fertilizer and Stocking Rates
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing pressure on land used for animal production demands more efficient production systems. Soil nutrients required for plant growth are usually the limiting factor in pasture productivity in the tropics. Thus, understanding nutrient cycling in grasslands is crucial to maintaining pasture sustainability where litter deposition and decomposition are important components of the nutrient cycle. This research evaluated the effects of stocking rate [SR; 2.0, 3.9, and 5.8 animal units (AU) ha(-1); 1 AU = 450 kg cattle live weight] and N fertilization (0, 150, and 300 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) on litter mass and chemical composition in signal grass (Brachiaria decumbens Stapf.) pastures during two grazing seasons [2009 and 2010; 1709 and 2103 kg organic matter (OM) ha(-1), respectively]. In 2009, the highest SR treatments (3.9 and 5.8 AU ha(-1)) had less litter mass accumulation (2093 and 2205 kg OM ha(-1), respectively) than the lowest SR (2750 kg OM ha(-1)). Litter deposition rate was similar among SR treatments and between years, and averaged 26 kg OM ha(-1) d(-1). Litter N concentration increased with increasing N fertilization only in the second year (8.6 vs. 11.7 g kg(-1) at 0 and 300 kg N ha(-1), respectively). Nitrogen fertilization reduced litter C/N ratio for the range of SR tested, but the reduction was more pronounced for the lowest SR (53.1 vs. 29.1 for 0 and 300 kg N ha(-1), respectively). Nitrogen fertilization mitigated the negative effect of increasing SR on litter mass deposition and chemical composition by stimulating plant regrowth.

TI  - Life Cycle Assessment of Frozen Tilapia Fillets From Indonesian Lake-Based and Pond-Based Intensive Aquaculture Systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We used life cycle assessment to evaluate a subset of the cradle-to-destination-port environmental impacts associated with the production, processing, and transportation of frozen, packaged Indonesian tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fillets to ports in Chicago and Rotterdam. Specifically, we evaluated the cumulative energy use; biotic resource use; and global warming, acidifying, and eutrophying emissions at each life cycle stage and in aggregate. We identify the importance of least environmental cost feed sourcing for reducing supply chain environmental impacts. We also highlight the need for more effective nutrient cycling in intensive aquaculture. The environmental trade-offs inherent in substituting technological inputs for ecosystem services in intensive pond-based versus lake-based production systems are discussed. We further call for more nuanced considerations of comparative environmental advantage in the production and interregional trade of food commodities than has been characteristic of historic food miles discussions. Significant opportunities exist for improving environmental performance in tilapia aquaculture. This product compares favorably, however, with several other fishery, aquaculture, and animal husbandry products, according to the suite of impact categories considered in this study.

TI  - Carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling in agroforestry systems on degraded soils of Eastern Amazon, Brazil
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation and rural poverty are widespread in the Eastern Brazilian Amazon. Slash-and-burn agriculture is the main source of livelihood in small farms but also a driver of degradation. In this context, Agroforestry Systems (AFS) are an alternative for climate change mitigation and land restoration, allying food security and ecosystem services reestablishment. We evaluated the increment of carbon stock (aboveground biomass, necromass, and soil) and standing litter nutrients in AFS and compared with natural succession. Treatments were established in 30 x 30 m plots with six repetitions (randomized block design) on a very degraded soil at UEMA School farm, in Eastern Amazon. In AFS, the 17 planted tree species of local interest (for fruit, timber, N-fixing) were associated with agricultural species and fertilized according to local standards. Carbon stock was measured in 2012 before the experiment setup (baseline) and in 2018. Aboveground carbon increment (Mg ha(-1)) was higher in AFS (26.79 +/- 23.41) than in natural succession (1.13 +/- 1.5), because of tree and shrub cover as a result of planting efforts. We found very high variability in plant development and carbon sequestration between plots. Soil organic carbon did not present increment between 2012 and 2018, and no differences between treatments were found in 2018. Species choice plays a keyhole for carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling reestablishment. Areas under natural succession presented very low resilience, evidencing the need for active restoration. Diverse agroforestry systems are an efficient strategy to restore forest cover on degraded soils of Amazon allying ecosystem services reestablishment and production.

TI  - Potential impacts of climate change on biogeochemical functioning of Cerrado ecosystems
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cerrado Domain comprises one of the most diverse savannas in the world and is undergoing a rapid loss of habitats due to changes in fire regimes and intense conversion of native areas to agriculture. We reviewed data on the biogeochemical functioning of Cerrado ecosystems and evaluated the potential impacts of regional climate changes. Variation in temperature extremes and in total amount of rainfall and altitude throughout the Cerrado determines marked differences in the composition of species. Cerrado ecosystems are controlled by interactions between water and nutrient availability. In general, nutrient cycles (N, P and base cations) are very conservative, while litter, microbial and plant biomass are important stocks. In terms of C cycling, root systems and especially the soil organic matter are the most important stocks. Typical cerrado ecosystems function as C sinks on an annual basis, although they work as source of C to the atmosphere close to the end of the dry season. Fire is an important factor altering stocks and fluxes of C and nutrients. Predicted changes in temperature, amount and distribution of precipitation vary according to Cerrado sub-regions with more marked changes in the northeastern part of the domain. Higher temperatures, decreases in rainfall with increase in length of the dry season could shift net ecosystem exchanges from C sink to source of C and might intensify burning, reducing nutrient stocks. Interactions between the heterogeneity in the composition and abundance of biological communities throughout the Cerrado Domain and current and future changes in land use make it difficult to project the impacts of future climate scenarios at different temporal and spatial scales and new modeling approaches are needed.

TI  - FOREST PATCH CONSERVATION INDICATORS
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents indicators to assess the conservation status of forest patches in fragmented landscapes. However, how can we evaluate the conservation status of forest patches in order to compare it to a hypothetical situation of well-preserved vegetation without human disturbance? It is possible to measure some ecological processes, like nutrient cycling, canopy, edaphic, topographic and hydrological parameters, as well as landscape attributes, and associate them to conservation status. When the attributes of original well-preserved forest are unknown because they are seldom found, it is possible to compare patches by assessing the variability of their attributes. To this end, parameters related to canopy, soil, topography and landscape were analyzed to establish indicators and their integrated analysis was developed to assess the conservation status of forest patches and identify possible causes of shortcomings or obstacles to reach the conservation status. The study area is located in a Semidecidual Forest region, in Brazil. The methodology was developed considering plots distributed in sites within forest patches. The results allowed the identification of patches in different conditions of conservation and provided information of the factors that contribute to this status, in order to help guide and select the most appropriate measures to mitigate degradation and identify forest conservation strategies.

TI  - Acacia mangium Willd: benefits and threats associated with its increasing use around the world
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Acacia mangium, a fast-growing tree native to parts of Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Australia, has been cultivated outside its native environment and introduced into humid tropical lowland regions of Asia, South America and Africa over the last few decades. It is a multipurpose tree used in agroforestry, forestry and for restoration of degraded lands. It is also highly invasive in many regions where it has been introduced outside its native range. This paper reviews evidence of its obvious benefits and its negative impacts on biodiversity.Methods: A literature review on Australian acacias and especially on A. mangium was undertaken to highlight both benefits and threats associated with their increasing worldwide use outside their native ranges.Results: Through N-2 fixed from the atmosphere, A. mangium improves soil fertility, especially by increasing N status and soil C accretion when introduced to N-limited areas; it thus has the potential to restore nutrient cycling in degraded systems. No studies have, however, been done to assess the effectiveness of A. mangium in restoring biodiversity of degraded lands. Most Australian acacias have traits that facilitate invasiveness, and 23 species have been recorded as invasive to date. A. mangium has been reported as invasive in Asia, Indonesia, Pacific Islands, Indian Ocean Islands, southern Africa and Brazil. Research on other invasive Australian acacias in several parts of the world has elucidated the types of impacts that are likely in different types of ecosystems and key options for mitigating impacts.Conclusions: A. mangium has the potential to restore nutrient cycling in degraded systems, but is highly invasive wherever it is planted. Many parts of the world have a large invasion debt for this species. Experience with other invasive acacias around the world suggests a suite of interventions that could be used to reduce invasions and mitigate impacts. Careful risk assessments should be undertaken prior to any new plantings of this species.

TI  - Assessing the effects of rainfall reduction on litterfall and the litter layer in phytophysiognomies of the Amazonia-Cerrado transition
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - The tropical vegetation growing in dystrophic soils is capable of recycling nutrients through litterfall and thus maintaining soil fertility. However, climate changes can alter this production and, consequently, the litter layer over the soil, affecting the carbon cycle and the integrity of the ecosystem. In this study, we investigated whether a reduction in rainfall increased the litterfall and the litter layer (stock) and, if so, whether the effects are more evident in degraded environments. We compared the litterfall and the litter layer in years with higher (1575.3 mm) and lower (1360.8 mm) rainfall rates in three environments: "cerradao" (CD; savanna woodland), typical "cerrado" (savanna-like vegetation) and successional area (SA). We recorded increasing litterfall in the SA and in the litter layer in the three environments during the year with lower rainfall rates. We also detected alterations to the seasonal variation in the litter layer and the production of reproductive parts. The reduction in rainfall increased the return of carbon to the soil, especially in open areas. Our results indicate that climatic extremes (e.g., reduced rainfall) can modify the availability of nutrients and their absorption by plants and therefore compromising important ecosystem functions, such as carbon cycle.

TI  - Combining Sample Designs to Account for the Whole Necromass Carbon Stock in Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Necromass is crucial to understanding both carbon and nutrient cycling throughout the forest. In this study, we assessed the carbon stock and spatial distribution of necromass components in an Atlantic rainforest, southern Brazil, one hotspot of biodiversity. Necromass comprised: standing dead trees and stumps (SWN), large-sized woody necromass (LWN), medium-sized woody necromass (MWN), and litter (LTR). Specific sample designs assessed each component, while the Payandeh index indicated spatial distribution. Mean wood densities of LWN ranged from 0.24 to 0.46 g.cm(-3), and mean carbon fraction ranged from 0.42 to 0.44 gC.g(-1) d.m. depending on decay class. The total necromass carbon stock was 12.83 MgC.ha(-1). SWN, LWN, MWN, and LTR carbon stores were 3.15, 4.24, 1.50, and 3.53 MgC.ha(-1), respectively. LWN and MWN showed a reverse J-curve skewed carbon stock distribution and clumped spatial pattern. LTR presented asymmetric distribution and a random spatial pattern. Coarse and heavy necromass is clumped near dead trees, while the wind scatters fine necromass throughout the forest. This study provides useful information to the understanding of the carbon cycle in Atlantic rainforests and may be helpful to improve the Brazilian Inventory of Anthropogenic Emissions and Removals of Greenhouse Gases and the Global Forest Resource Assessment.

TI  - WHY BATS MATTERS: A CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF BAT-MEDIATED ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES IN THE NEOTROPICS
T2  - European Journal of Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - New World bats play a significant role in ecosystem functioning and are imperative for maintaining environmental services. Nevertheless, human-caused environmental changes are jeopardizing bat communities, which results in the loss of functional roles provided by them. It is important, therefore, to assess ecological processes performed by bats in the Neotropics to define priorities in further research for better conservation planning. In this systematic review, I identify general trends, advances, bias, and knowledge gaps in bat-mediated ecological processes across Neotropical ecosystems. I have conducted an extensive search on Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, and Bat Eco-Interactions Database resulting in 538 references, of which 185 papers were included in the review. The papers were published in 76 peer-reviewed journals, with the highest peak between 2006-2010. From the six biomes recorded, Moist broadleaf tropical forest was the most researched, contrary to Montane biomes (>2000 m), where few studies have been conducted. Seed dispersal was the process with more studies (44%), followed by pollination (38%), nutrient cycling (10%), and arthropod suppression (8%). Seed dispersal and pollination displayed large bias on specific bat-plant systems (Artibeus-Ficus, Sturnira-Solanum, Carollia-Piper, Pachycereeae tribe-Leptonycteris) and ecoregions (Ithsmian-Atlantic moist forest, Cerrado, Tehuacan Valley matorral), thus being important to explore other bat and plant species as well as other ecosystems. Arthropod suppression and nutrient cycling were largely overlooked despite constituting essential functions in ecosystem resilience; particularly, more research is needed to know cascading effects on plant fitness in different agroforestry systems, but also is key the understanding of how bats can be pivotal mobile links in terrestrial ecosystems and cave environments. I highlight the importance to consider bats with multiple roles and functional trait-based approach to gain a comprehensive understanding of their functionality. Even though functional studies have increased in the last two decades, several aspects of bat roles are still obscured, and is necessary to keep evaluating their ecological and economic importance to provide useful information for major decision-makings in Neotropical ecosystems ' conservation. Bat extirpations are likely to affect their ecological roles, therefore, mitigating major threats of bats are urgently needed to sustain ecosystem integrity in the Neotropics.

TI  - Influence of Acacia mangium on Soil Fertility and Bacterial Community in Eucalyptus Plantations in the Congolese Coastal Plains
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Productivity and sustainability of tropical forest plantations greatly rely on regulation of ecosystem functioning and nutrient cycling, i.e., the link between plant growth, nutrient availability, and the microbial community structure. So far, these interactions have never been evaluated in the Acacia and Eucalyptus forest planted on infertile soils in the Congolese coastal plains. In the present work, the soil bacterial community has been investigated by metabarcoding of the 16S rRNA bacterial gene in different stands of monoculture and mixed-species plantation to evaluate the potential of nitrogen-fixing trees on nutrient and bacterial structure. At the phylum level, the soil bacterial community was dominated by Actinobacteria, followed by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Acidobacteria. A principal coordinate analysis revealed that bacterial communities from pure Eucalyptus, compared to those from plantations containing Acacia in pure and mixed-species stands, showed different community composition (beta-diversity). Regardless of the large variability of the studied soils, the prevalence of Firmicutes phylum, and lower bacterial richness and phylogenic diversity were reported in stands containing Acacia relative to the pure Eucalyptus. Distance-based redundancy analysis revealed a positive correlation of available phosphorus (P) and carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio with bacterial community structure. However, the Spearman correlation test revealed a broad correlation between the relative abundance of bacterial taxa and soil attributes, in particular with sulfur (S) and carbon (C), suggesting the important role of soil bacterial community in nutrient cycling in this type of forest management. Concerning mixed plantations, a shift in bacterial community structure was observed, probably linked to other changes, i.e., improvement in soil fertility (enhanced P and C dynamics in forest floor and soil, and increase in soil N status), and C sequestration in both soil and stand wood biomass with the great potential impact to mitigate climate change. Overall, our findings highlight the role of soil attributes, especially C, S, available P, and C/N ratio at a lesser extent, in driving the soil bacterial community in mixed-species plantations and its potential to improve soil fertility and to sustain Eucalyptus plantations established on the infertile and sandy soils of the Congolese coastal plains.

TI  - Litterfall Production and Decomposition in Tropical and Subtropical Mangroves: Research Trends and Interacting Effects of Biophysical, Chemical, and Anthropogenic Factors
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Review
AB  - The present systematic literature review (SLR) synthesized the literature on mangrove litterfall production and decomposition from studies published between 1985 and 2023 following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Key questions about biophysical, chemical, and anthropogenic/societal factors influencing nutrient cycling via litterfall production and decomposition in mangrove forests were addressed. The SLR included 332 peer-reviewed original and review articles from the ScienceDirect, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases. The United States of America had the highest relative count (RC, 31.32%), followed by Japan (8.79%) and Indonesia (8.24%), and the lowest RCs were found in Bangladesh, Kenya, Philippines, and Thailand. We showed the increasing trend on these topics and discussed the milestones to enhance our understanding of litterfall production and decomposition processes and inform future research endeavors in the context of climate change. A positive trajectory for understanding litterfall production and decomposition for effective decision-making and management strategies towards mangrove conservation and sustainable use is also discussed. Ten-year research prospects were also identified, including studies on impacts of pollution, habitat degradation, climate change, and other destructive human activities. The trend in studies about mangrove litterfall production and decomposition suggests the growing recognition of mangroves' ecological and societal importance. Future advancements can be made to better understand the biophysical, chemical, and anthropogenic factors influencing litterfall production and decomposition through the identified future research directions. Finally, the findings of the present review are relevant to supporting effective conservation and management strategies for mangroves in a changing climate.

TI  - Benthic macroinvertebrates and degradation of phytomass as indicators of ecosystem functions in flooded rice cropping
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the ecosystem functions of a natural wetland and of artificially flooded rice areas, managed under organic and conventional systems, by phytomass degradation and by the colonization of this material by benthic macroinvertebrates. The experiment was carried out in a natural wetland area, and in two flooded rice areas managed under organic and conventional systems. Twenty-five decomposition bags filled with 10 g of dry vegetation were installed in each site. At 14, 28, 42, 56, and 70 days after the beginning of the experiment, five bags from each site were collected. Macroinvertebrates were identified and classified by functional trophic group. The number of species of benthic macroinvertebrates increased: natural wetland > organic system > conventional system. The Chironomidae group was present in all areas, confirming its food plasticity and adaptability to different substrates and environmental stress situations. The Amphipoda group was present only in the artificially flooded rice area, and the Acari, only in the natural wetland. The diversity of species in the natural wetland area was higher than in the artificially flooded rice area. Nutrient cycling, provided by phytomass decomposition, is affected by the management system, and the delay in this process causes a reduction of the ecosystem functions in the conventional system.

TI  - Impact of the Urbanisation Process in the Availability of Ecosystem Services in a Tropical Ecotone Area
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanisation has been a main cause of land use land cover (LULC) change worldwide, often with irreparable consequences to the provision of ecosystem services. Despite an increase in quantitative assessments of ecosystem service values (ESV) related to LULC changes, data are scarce for ecotones, such as the agreste in northeast Brazil (a transitional area between the Atlantic Forest and the Caatinga biomes). The benefit transfer method was used to quantify changes in ESV between 1989, 2007 and 2014 due to urbanisation in the microwatershed Riacho das Piabas (3660ha) in the agreste of Paraiba. Remote sensing techniques and a geographic information system were used to quantify LULC changes. Loss of arboreal vegetation (covering 46% of the study area in 1989 and 5% in 2014) was the key factor driving the 73.2% decline in the total ESV (from US$ 13.7 million to US$ 3.7 million in 2017 values). LULC changes resulted in losses of 89% in the estimated value of eight ecosystem services, including climate regulation, water flow regulation, moderation of disturbance, nutrient cycling and biological control, which are critical locally when considering the regional trend towards aridification and the existing pressures on water resources. Ecosystem functions loss and climate change impacts may lead to a shift in ecotone boundaries favouring the semiarid Caatinga vegetation. These results urge the implementation of ecosystem-based spatial planning, focusing on urban green infrastructure and restoration of natural habitats and their connectivity, to prevent further ecosystem service losses. Local estimates of ESV required to inform the suggested policy actions are identified.

TI  - The impact of salinity on heavy metal accumulation in seaweed
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Review
AB  - Aquatic heavy metal pollution, driven by industrialization and climate change, threatens marine ecosystems through bioaccumulation. Climate-induced salinity fluctuations influence metal speciation and bioavailability in coastal environments. Seaweeds, crucial for nutrient cycling and economic use, exhibit species-specific metal uptake under varying salinity conditions. This study employs bibliometric analysis to examine research trends from 1995 to 2024 on the impact of salinity on metal accumulation in seaweeds. A search conducted on 8 October 2024 resulted in 242 articles, which were then filtered to 28 relevant studies for analysis. Using the Web of Science Core Collection, these articles were analyzed with VOSviewer and Bibliometrix to identify key contributors, collaborations, and research themes. Results reveal a growing academic interest since 2006, with increasing citation counts reflecting global concern over salinity and heavy metal pollution. Significant contributions from Brazil and Portugal, alongside strong European collaborations, highlight regional strengths. Five key themes emerge, encompassing seaweed physiology, biomonitoring, and phytoremediation. Findings indicate that salinity fluctuations significantly affect metal bioavailability and uptake in seaweeds, influenced by speciesspecific factors, temperature, and pH. This study highlights the need for targeted, site-specific research on diverse seaweed species to effectively manage heavy metal pollution in coastal ecosystems, particularly in light of climate change and industrial activities. Additionally, the research emphasizes the potential of seaweeds as bioindicators and bioremediators in environmental monitoring and pollution management.

TI  - Signal Grass Litter Decomposition Rate Increases with Inclusion of Calopo
T2  - CROP SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Low N availability is a major limitation in tropical and subtropical pasture systems and one of the main causes for system degradation. Including legumes in forage mixes may enhance soil-N presence and cycling, therefore mitigating the problem. To test this theory, signal grass [Brachiaria decumbens (Stapf) R. D. Webster] litter chemical composition and decomposition after inclusion of calopo (Calopogonium mucunoides Desv.) at 0, 50, or 100% of litter mass was evaluated. Litter samples were collected from both species and incubated by litter bag technique for 0, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, or 256 d in 2007 and 2008. Biomass decomposition was described by a simple exponential organic matter (OM) decay model (p < 0.0001; Y predicted [the remaining biomass at a given time of decomposition, predicted by the single exponential model] = 91.11(-0.00451t) and 94.16(-0.00217t) for year 1 and 2, respectively). Remaining biomass was lower (p < 0.05) in 2007 (28%) than 2008 (54%) following 256 d incubation at least in part because of greater lignin concentrations in 2008 litter. Pure signal grass litter C:N values were 74 to 76% greater (p < 0.05) than pure legume while the inclusion of 50% calopo reduced (p < 0.05) grass ratios by 62 to 64%. Net annual N mineralization increased (p < 0.05) from 27% without legume to 38% with legume inclusion at 50% of the grass litter, a nutrient cycling acceleration of 16% (p < 0.05). This research indicated that the inclusion of calopo will ameliorate N deficiency in soils of a signal grass pasture.

TI  - Potential of biochar to restoration of microbial biomass and enzymatic activity in a highly degraded semiarid soil
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biochar is an effective material for enhancing soil ecosystem services. However, the specific impacts of biochar on microbial indicators, particularly in degraded soils, remain poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of biochar produced from cashew residues and sewage sludge, in a highly degraded soil, on microbial indicators. We analyzed soil chemical composition and microbial biomass C and N, enzyme activity, and stoichiometry. Cashew biochar increased soil respiration, indicating a higher availability of C to microorganisms compared to sewage sludge biochar and a better adaptation of soil microbial communities to C-rich organic material obtained from a native plant. Although the biochar differentially impacted microbial biomass C, both significantly increased N in the microbial biomass. Arylsulphatase activity did not respond to biochar application, while beta-glucosidase, urease, and phosphatases showed significant changes with biochar treatments. Importantly, stoichiometry and vector analysis revealed that both types of biochar increased P limitation for soil microbes. Conversely, both biochar alleviated C and N limitations for the soil microbes. Thus, biochar applications in highly degraded soils should be supplemented with external P sources to maintain soil functions, mainly for cashew residues. Our results provide evidence that biochar can restore soil biological properties and enhance the availability of C and N to microorganisms. These findings have significant implications for restoration practices in degraded lands of semiarid regions.

TI  - Soil bacterial communities in the Brazilian Cerrado: Response to vegetation type and management
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pasture degradation in the Brazilian Cerrado, the second largest biome in South America, is a widespread problem that leads to serious environmental consequences. Thus pasture restoration is crucial, not only because of the economic importance of meat production in Brazil, but also for mitigation of soil erosion and the effects of climate change. Furthermore, ecosystem productivity depends on nutrient cycling and organic matter transformation in soils, highlighting the need to better understand the biological functioning of soil in natural and managed systems. Soil microbiota can be analyzed to monitor changes in soil functions, thereby serving as an indicator of ecological restoration. In the present study, we used a barcoded pyrosequencing approach to assess soil bacterial communities under three different conditions: a native cerrado area, an active pasture, and a degraded pasture that was planted with native tree species. In the three study areas, Acidobacteria was dominant phylum (20-38%), followed by Proteobacteria (8-13%), AD3 (4-12%), Verrucomicrobia (3-11%), and Firmicutes (3-8%). However, the results demonstrated a clear differentiation of soil microbial communities under native vegetation cover and pasture regardless of rainfall seasonality. The higher abundance of AD3 in the native cerrado area was an important variable differentiating natural and managed areas. Comparing the two pasture areas, the pasture under restoration treatment differed from the active pasture in terms of abundance of the most dominant phyla in the rainy period but not in the dry period. Proteobacteria was lower in the degraded pasture planted with native trees than in the active pasture, while the relative abundance of Acidobacteria showed the opposite trend. Changes in the abundance of main bacterial phyla even in the initial phases of the restoration process, point out for the relevance of microbiological parameters as additional indicators in the monitoring of degradation recovery.

TI  - Contrasting phenology of Eucalyptus grandis fine roots in upper and very deep soil layers in Brazil
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - While the role of deep roots in major ecosystem services has been shown for tropical forests, there have been few direct measurements of fine root dynamics at depths of more than 2 m. The factors influencing root phenology remain poorly understood, creating a gap in the knowledge required for predicting the effects of climate change. We set out to gain an insight into the fine root phenology of fast-growing trees in deep tropical soils.Fine root growth and mortality of Eucalyptus grandis trees were observed fortnightly using minirhizotrons down to a soil depth of 6 m, from 2 to 4 years after planting.In the topsoil, the highest live root length production was during the rainy summer (20 cm m(-2) d(-1)) whereas, below 2 m deep, it was at the end of the dry winter (51 cm m(-2) d(-1)). The maximum root elongation rates increased with soil depth to 3.6 cm d(-1) in the 5-6 m soil layer.Our study shows that the effect of the soil depth on the seasonal variations in fine root growth should be taken into account when modelling the carbon, water and nutrient cycles in forests growing on deep tropical soils.

TI  - Changes in soil C and N stocks and nutrient dynamics 13 years after recovery of degraded land using leguminous nitrogen-fixing trees
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In tropical forest areas with highly weathered soils, organic matter plays an important role in soil functioning and forest sustainability. When forests are clear-cut. the soil begins almost immediately to lose organic matter, triggering a series of soil degradation processes, the extent and intensity of which depends on soil management. Depending on the level of soil degradation, the rate at which the system can re-establish itself can be slow and may require the use of degraded land restoration techniques. This study aimed at evaluating the potential of pioneer leguminous nitrogen-fixing trees to recuperate degraded land. The area studied - located in the coastal town of Angra dos Reis in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - was planted with seven species of fast-growing leguminous nitrogen-fixing trees in 1991. The nutrient concentrations (Ca, Mg, P and K) and N and C stocks in the soil and litter were determined, in addition to the free- and occluded-light fractions of soil organic matter. Soil samples were also collected from two reference areas: (1) an area of undisturbed native forest; and (2) a deforested area spontaneously colonised by Guinea grass (Panicum maximum). The nutrient stocks in the litter of the restored area were similar to those found in native forest. The recuperation technique used was able to re-establish the soil C and N stocks after 13 years. C and N increased by 1.73 and 0.13 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. The free-light fraction was highest in the recuperated area and lowest in the deforested area. The occluded-light fraction of the recuperated area was higher than that of the native forest only in the 0-5 cm layer. Both the free-light and occluded fractions were higher in the native forest and recuperated areas than in the deforested area. Since the free-light and the occluded-light fractions are the result of litterfall and decomposition, these results - combined with the data of litter stocks and soil C and N stocks - indicate that the use of legume trees was efficient in re-establishing the nutrient cycling processes of the systems. These results also show that recovering degraded land with this technique is effective in sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at high rates. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Do microplastics and climate change negatively affect shredder invertebrates from an amazon stream? An ecosystem functioning perspective
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Pollution and climate change are among the main threats to the biodiversity of freshwater ecosystems in the 21st century. We experimentally tested the effects of microplastic and climate change (i.e., increase in temperature and CO2) on the survival and consumption by an Amazonian-stream shredder invertebrate. We tested three hypotheses. (1) Increased microplastic concentrations and climate change reduce shredder survival. We assumed that the combined stressors would increase toxic stress. (2) Increased concentrations of microplastics have negative effects on shredder food consumption. We assumed that blockage of the digestive tract by microplastics would lead to reduced ability to digest food. In addition, increased temperature and CO2 would lead to an in-crease in metabolic cost and reduced consumption. (3) The interaction between microplastics and climate change have greater negative effects on survival and consumption than either alone. We combined different concen-trations of microplastic and climate change scenarios to simulate in real-time increases in temperature and CO2 forecast for 2100 for Amazonia. We found that both stressors had lethal effects, increasing mortality risk, but there was no interaction effect. Shredder consumption was negatively affected only by climate change. The interaction of microplastics and climate change on shredder consumption was dose-dependent and more intense in the extreme climate scenario, leading to reduced consumption. Our results indicate that microplastic and climate change may have strong effects on the consumption and/or survival of insect shredders in Amazonian streams. In addition, microplastic and climate change effects may affect not only populations but also ecosystem functioning (e.g., nutrient cycling). Integrative approaches to better understand and mitigate the effects of both stressors are necessary because plastic pollution and climate change co-occur in environments.

TI  - Are eucalypts Brazil's friend of foe? An entomological viewpoint
T2  - Anais da Sociedade Entomologica do Brasil
M3  - Article
AB  - Vast areas of Brazil are being planted Eucalyptus in order to provide renewable sources of timber, charcoal and cellulose. Although the rapid growth and productivity of various Eucalyptus species undoubtedly relaxes the pressure on logging of native forests, there are ecological costs. Firstly, some eucalypt species are vulnerable to pest outbreaks. A large number of native Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and leaf-cutting ants (Atta spp.), some of which have become pests, have been found on eucalypts growing in Brazil. Probably, the diverse myrtaceous flora of South America supports a fauna that can adapt to the introduced Eucalyptus species. Secondly, the leaf litter produced under Eucalyptus plantations differs substantially from that of native forests both in terms of its physical structure and chemistry, posing a range of problems for the native decomposer fauna. If microarthropod diversity is reduced, nutrient cycling could be impeded under eucalypt plantations. Thirdly, native forest canopies support a massive diversity and biomass of arthropods on which many birds, reptiles and mammals depend for food. The evidence is that invertebrate biomass and diversity are greatly reduced in the canopies of exotic eucalypt plantations. This, in turn, reduces the food-base on which forest arthropods and other animals depend, and hence their conservation status. This paper reviews the evidence for adverse ecological effects in Brazilian eucalypt plantations and suggests ways in which Brazil might meet its forestry needs, while conserving forest invertebrates and the vertebrates that depend on them.

TI  - Hydraulic redistribution affects modeled carbon cycling via soil microbial activity and suppressed fire
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydraulic redistribution (HR) of water from moist to drier soils, through plant roots, occurs world-wide in seasonally dry ecosystems. Although the influence of HR on landscape hydrology and plant water use has been amply demonstrated, HR's effects on microbe-controlled processes sensitive to soil moisture, including carbon and nutrient cycling at ecosystem scales, remain difficult to observe in the field and have not been integrated into a predictive framework. We incorporated a representation of HR into the Community Land Model (CLM4.5) and found the new model improved predictions of water, energy, and system-scale carbon fluxes observed by eddy covariance at four seasonally dry yet ecologically diverse temperate and tropical AmeriFlux sites. Modeled plant productivity and microbial activities were differentially stimulated by upward HR, resulting at times in increased plant demand outstripping increased nutrient supply. Modeled plant productivity and microbial activities were diminished by downward HR. Overall, inclusion of HR tended to increase modeled annual ecosystem uptake of CO2 (or reduce annual CO2 release to the atmosphere). Moreover, engagement of CLM4.5s ground-truthed fire module indicated that though HR increased modeled fuel load at all four sites, upward HR also moistened surface soil and hydrated vegetation sufficiently to limit the modeled spread of dry season fire and concomitant very large CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Historically, fire has been a dominant ecological force in many seasonally dry ecosystems, and intensification of soil drought and altered precipitation regimes are expected for seasonally dry ecosystems in the future. HR may play an increasingly important role mitigating development of extreme soil water potential gradients and associated limitations on plant and soil microbial activities, and may inhibit the spread of fire in seasonally dry ecosystems.

TI  - Carbon and nitrogen stock in soils of subtropical urban forests: Isotopic δ<SUP>13</SUP>C and δ<SUP>15</SUP>N indicators for nature-based solutions in a megacity
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban forest soils play a pivotal role in enhancing the environmental sustainability of cities, contributing to various natural processes, including plant-microbe interactions, microbial activity, and the decomposition of organic matter. Consequently, urban forest soils emerge as effective NBS, underscoring their potential to mitigate environmental challenges and foster sustainable urban ecosystems. In these sense, this manuscript aimed at evaluating how soil attributes of the urban forests of S & atilde;o Paulo, Brazil, with different adjacent land uses, influence the capacity to store the excess of C and N from anthropogenic emissions, making this ecosystem an important reservoir of urban anthropogenic emissions. Three hundred urban forest soil samples were collected from the surface to a depth of 50 cm. All samples were analyzed for C and N content (and their stable isotopes). In addition, granulometric tests were also carried out to classify the soils. It was found that the most central forest fragment has the highest C and N contents at all analyzed depths, probably due to the association with physical aspects of soil texture. For all layers, the most central fragment soil sample, the only one with a clay soil, presented approximately twice as many elements when compared to the soil samples of the other sites. In general, C and N stocks (and their stable isotopes, delta C-13 and delta N-15, respectively) varied significantly in forests located in the center-periphery direction (%N - F = 24.58, p < 0.05; %C - F = 22.48, p < 0.05; delta N-15 - F = 4.27, p < 0.05; delta C-13 - F = 19.8, p < 0.05; C/N - F = 14.56, p < 0.05). This more central forest fragment with higher vehicle emissions showed greater potential to store these atmospheric elements and with greater neutralizing efficiency than the other forest fragments. delta C-13 and delta N-15 contents together with the C:N ratio indicated the efficiency of biogeochemical cycling, through decomposition, in different urban forest fragments. More peripheral fragments showed high efficiency in C and N cycling along the analyzed soil profiles, while in the most superficial layer, the most central fragment was highly efficient. These shed light results how integrating NbS principles into strategic urban planning and city-level climate policies can bolster the effectiveness of urban green areas. The integration not only promotes carbon sequestration and efficient nutrient cycling in the soil but also fosters sustainable practices, contributing to a more resilient urban landscape.

TI  - The breakdown of ecosystem functionality driven by deforestation in a global biodiversity hotspot
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Review
AB  - The pace of deforestation in tropical forests has achieved unprecedented rates, requiring effective and achievable conservation mitigations that are also easily understood by society and policy makers. In this context, we report the outcomes from a large-scale project located in the threatened Atlantic Forest (SISBIOTA network) to understand how deforestation affects ecological patterns and processes in human-modified landscapes. In particular, we compiled data from 28 studies that evaluated habitat quality, biodiversity maintenance or ecological processes and scrutinised their responses along the gradient of forest loss. After a decade of research effort, we provide evidence of key changes in forest quality, species diversity and ecological processes that are ultimately affecting forest functioning of the remaining patches. As deforestation progresses, we unveiled a clear retraction of local vegetation structure, in which forests become similar to secondary forests, as are characterised by retaining shorter and thinner trees, higher foliage density and increased canopy openness. Besides being hotter, patches embedded within deforested landscapes present reduced quality, evidenced by low fruit production and quality. Such changes cascade to disruptions in biodiversity maintenance and ecological processes. Specifically, forest-specialist species exhibit reduced diversity (e.g., juvenile and adult trees, birds and mammals) and for some groups, are compensated by the increase in habitat-generalist species. Furthermore, forest patches immersed in deforested landscapes experience strong alterations in nutrient cycling and carbon stocks, increase of leaf herbivory, reduction of frugivory, and finally, a simplification in bird-plant interactions. Preventing deforestation is imperative, but restoration and rewilding are also required to safeguard forest-dweller species and, consequently, enable ecological functionality.

TI  - Land-use change shifts and magnifies seasonal variations of the decomposer system in lowland tropical landscapes
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation and agricultural expansion in the tropics affect local and regional climatic conditions, leading to synergistic negative impacts on land ecosystems. Climatic changes manifest in increased inter- and intraseasonal variations and frequency of extreme climatic events (i.e., droughts and floods), which have evident consequences for aboveground biodiversity. However, until today, there have been no studies on how land use affects seasonal variations below ground in tropical ecosystems, which may be more buffered against climatic variation. Here, we analyzed seasonal variations in soil parameters, basal respiration, microbial communities, and abundances of soil invertebrates along with microclimatic conditions in rainforest and monocultures of oil palm and rubber in Sumatra, Indonesia. About 75% (20 out of 26) of the measured litter and soil, microbial, and animal parameters varied with season, with seasonal changes in 50% of the parameters depending on land use. Land use affected seasonal variations in microbial indicators associated with carbon availability and cycling rate. The magnitude of seasonal variations in microbial parameters in the soil of monocultures was almost 40% higher than in the soil of rainforest. Measured parameters were associated with short-term climatic conditions (3-day period air humidity) in plantations, but not in rainforest, confirming a reduced soil buffering ability in plantations. Overall, our findings suggest that land use temporally shifts and increases the magnitude of seasonal variations of the belowground ecosystem compartment, with microbial communities responding most strongly. The increased seasonal variations in soil biota in plantations likely translate into more pronounced fluctuations in essential ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration, and these ramifications ultimately may compromise the stability of tropical ecosystems in the long term. As the observed seasonal dynamics is likely to increase with both local and global climate change, these shifts need closer attention for the long-term sustainable management of plantation systems in the tropics.

TI  - The role of land use, management, and microbial diversity depletion on glyphosate biodegradation in tropical soils
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and management changes affect the composition and diversity of soil bacteria and fungi, which in turn may alter soil health and the provision of key ecological functions, such as pesticide degradation and soil detoxification. However, the extent to which these changes affect such services is still poorly understood in tropical agroecosystems. Our main goal was to evaluate how land-use (tilled versus no-tilled soil), soil management (N-fertilization), and microbial diversity depletion [tenfold (D1 = 10-1) and thousandfold (D3 = 10-3) dilutions] impacted soil enzyme activities (beta-glycosidase and acid phosphatase) involved in nutrient cycles and glyphosate mineralization. Soils were collected from a long-term experimental area (35 years) and compared to its native forest soil (NF). Glyphosate was selected due to its intensive use in agriculture worldwide and in the study area, as well as its recalcitrance in the environment by forming inner sphere complexes. Bacterial communities played a more important role than the fungi in glyphosate degradation. For this function, the role of microbial diversity was more critical than land use and soil management. Our study also revealed that conservation tillage systems, such as no-tillage, regardless of nitrogen fertilizer use, mitigates the negative effects of microbial diversity depletion, being more efficient and resilient regarding glyphosate degradation than conventional tillage systems. No-tilled soils also presented much higher beta-glycosidase and acid phosphatase activities as well as higher bacterial diversity indexes than those under conventional tillage. Consequently, conservation tillage is a key component for sustaining soil health and its functionality, providing critical ecosystem functions, such as soil detoxification in tropical agroecosystems.

TI  - Warming weakens facilitative interactions between decomposers and detritivores, and modifies freshwater ecosystem functioning
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Warming is among the major drivers of changes in biotic interactions and, in turn, ecosystem functioning. The decomposition process occurs in a chain of facilitative interactions between detritivores and microorganisms. It remains unclear, however, what effect warming may have on the interrelations between detritivores and microorganisms, and the consequences for the functioning of natural freshwater ecosystems. To address these gaps, we performed a field experiment using tank bromeliads and their associated aquatic fauna. We manipulated the presence of bacteria and detritivorous macroinvertebrates (control, bacteria, and bacteria+macroinvertebrates) under ambient and warming scenarios, and analyzed the effects on the microorganisms and ecosystem functioning (detritus mass loss, colored dissolved organic matter, and nitrogen flux). We applied antibiotic solution to eliminate or reduce bacteria from control bromeliads. After 60days incubation, bacterial density was higher in the presence than in the absence of macroinvertebrates. In the absence of macroinvertebrates, temperature did not influence bacterial density. However, in the presence of macroinvertebrates, bacterial density decreased by 54% with warming. The magnitude of the effects of organisms on ecosystem functioning was higher in the combined presence of bacteria and macroinvertebrates. However, warming reduced the overall positive effects of detritivores on bacterial density, which in turn, cascaded down to ecosystem functioning by decreasing decomposition and nitrogen flux. These results show the existence of facilitative mechanisms between bacteria and detritivores in the decomposition process, which might collapse due to warming. Detritivores seem to contribute to nutrient cycling as they facilitate bacterial populations, probably by increasing nutrient input (feces) in the ecosystem. However, increased temperature mitigated these beneficial effects. Our results add to a growing research body that shows that warming can affect the structure of aquatic communities, and highlight the importance of considering the interactive effects between facilitation and climatic drivers on the functioning of freshwater ecosystems.

TI  - Cover crop diversity for sustainable agriculture: Insights from the Cerrado biome
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil is one of the largest soybean producer of the world and the Cerrado biome has played a pivotal role in this expansion. Because of the economic and agronomic challenges associated with the maize production as a second summer crop in this region, cover crops are gaining popularity as a strategy to diversify the agricultural system while enhancing soil health. This study assessed the benefits of single species of cover crops and a mix of cover crop species in between harvest seasons to the soybean grain yield and nematode suppression. The study was carried out for 3 years in two locations within the Cerrado biome. We evaluated six cover crop treatments after soybean cultivation: (1) Mix of cover crops (Pennisetum glaucum, Crotalaria spectabilis and Urochloa ruziziensis), (2) P. glaucum (Pearl millet), (3) C. spectabilis, (4) U. ruziziensis (Congo grass) (5) Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu (Marandu palisadegrass) and (6) U. brizantha BRS Paiaguas (Paiaguas palisadegrass). Pennisetum glaucum and U. brizantha cv. Marandu produced highest amounts of biomass on a 3-year average. In one site, P. glaucum produced more biomass than other cover crops by 210%. Tropical grasses (U. ruziziensis, Marandu and Paiaguas), along with the cover crop mixture, exhibited intermediate biomass levels in the site with higher P. glaucum biomass production and did not differ from P. glaucum in the other site. Cover crops varied nutrient uptake depending on the species. Decomposition rates varied among cover crops as expected, with C. spectabilis decomposing rapidly and releasing substantial amounts nutrients, particularly nitrogen. In contrast, the cover crop mixture had a slower decomposition. The choice of cover crop significantly influenced soybean population and yield, with some variability across years and locations. The cover crop mixture consistently supported higher soybean populations and yields, highlighting its potential for enhancing soybean production, nutrient cycling and nematode suppression. It effectively reduced nematode abundance in soybean roots, highlighting its role in nematode management. Our findings emphasize the robustness and versatility of cover crop mixtures in mitigating weather variability across years and sites. They consistently performed well in terms of biomass production, nutrient uptake, soybean yields and nematode control. This study highlights the vital role of cover crops in the Cerrado ecosystem, enhancing soil health, crop productivity and environmental sustainability. The choice of cover crop species and mixtures offers a valuable tool for farmers seeking resilient and sustainable agricultural practices amid changing environmental conditions.

TI  - Concluding remarks: overall impacts on biodiversity and future perspectives for conservation in the Pantanal biome
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pantanal biome is characterised by seasonal flooding which determines specific ecosystem processes, with the occurrence of adapted plants and animals to the annual shrinking and expansion of habitats due to the seasonal hydrological regime. Biodiversity abundance varies during the dry and wet seasons. The Pantanal's biodiversity is a fundamental component of ecosystem services for human society, including nutrient cycling, fish production, ecotourism, carbon storage, flood control, among others, which are relevant to regional and global environmental consequences. The biome has been impacted by the conversion of natural vegetation into agricultural fields and pasture for cattle raising, with alteration and loss of natural habitats and biodiversity. Major negative impacts occur in uplands, with drastic deforestation of savanna vegetation, where main rivers feeding the Pantanal have their springs. This article discusses future needs and priorities for ecological research, in order to better understand the biome's natural system, to achieve conservation and sustainable use.

TI  - Sustainable Sugarcane Straw Special Issue: Considerations for Brazilian Bioenergy Production
T2  - BIOENERGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This issue of Bioenergy Research summarizes the results of two large-scale projects aiming to provide quantitative data to support decision-making for straw management and establish rational plans for sustainable straw removal without compromising soil health, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and sugarcane yield in Brazil. These projects cover results from multi-disciplinary research quantifying the effects of sugarcane straw harvest, transport, and conversion into biofuel, bioelectricity, or bio-renewable. Seventeen publications from a cross-institutional group addressing soil health, nutrient cycling and fertilizer management, GHG emissions, pest management, crop yield, engineering solutions, and industrial performance are included in this special issue. Overall, the main findings confirm that sustainable straw removal is feasible in Brazil, but integrated knowledge should be used to ensure that straw removal for industrial uses will not compromise soil ecosystem services and crop yields. We believe that this special issue provides an amalgamation of high-level scientific information and can be used on a strategic basis by academics, sugarcane industry, and policy makers at both state and national government levels.

TI  - Emerging Insights on Brazilian Pepper Tree (Schinus terebinthifolius) Invasion: The Potential Role of Soil Microorganisms
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Invasive plant species constitute a major ecological and economic problem worldwide, often distorting trophic levels and ecosystem balance. Numerous studies implicate factors ranging from environmental plasticity, competition for nutrient and space, and allelopathy in the success of invasive species in general. The Brazilian Pepper tree (BP) was introduced to the United States in the 1800s and has since become a category one invasive plant in Florida. It has aggressively spread to about 3000 km(2) of terrestrial surface, fueled in part by the prevalence of the hybrid genotypes and environmental perturbations. It displays some of the well-established invasive mechanisms but there is a serious dearth of knowledge on the plant microbe soil interactions and whether the rhizobiome plays any roles in the displacement of native flora and the range expansion of BR Several control measures, including chemical, mechanical, and biological antagonism have been used with limited success while restoration of natives in soils from which BP was removed has proved problematic partly due to a poorly understood phenomenon described as the "BP legacy effect." Emerging evidence suggests that allelopathy, selective recruitment of beneficial soil microbes, disruption of microbial community structure and alteration of nutrient cycling, exhibited by many other invasive plant species may also be involved in the case of BP. This brief review discusses the well-established BP invasion mechanisms and highlights the current understanding of the molecular, below-ground processes. It also points out the gaps in studies on the potential role of microbial interactions in the success of BP invasion. These hitherto poorly studied mechanisms could further explain the aggressive spread of BP and could potentially contribute significantly to effective control measures and enable appropriate strategies for restoring native plants. The review advocates for the use of cutting edge techniques in advancing the plant microbiome science. Ultimately, comparing metagenomic analyses of the rhizobiome of invasive plants grown in native and non-native soils could lead to a better understanding of the microbial determinants of biotic resistance, potentially empowering environmental managers with some predictive power of future trends of plant invasion.

TI  - Effect of Organic Farming on Soil Carbon Reserves and Quality in Citrus Groves in the Brazilian Semi-Arid Region
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Organic fertilisation of orchard soils can influence soil organic matter (SOM), nutrient cycling, greenhouse gas emissions and the overall sustainability of the farming systems. This study investigated the long-term effects of organic citrus farming on soil properties in a semi-arid region of Cear & aacute;, Brazil. Soil samples were collected from a 30-year-old organic citrus orchard and a natural vegetation site was used as a reference. Management practices at the organic orchard include annual pruning, with residues left in the inter-row area and an annual application of 20 kg of on-site produced compost per plant in the planting rows. The organic compost is composed of cattle manure, sugarcane bagasse, rock phosphate, MB-4, EM-4 and molasses. We evaluated the SOM, oxidizable fractions of organic carbon and microbial activity in the orchard rows, inter-rows and the reference site. The highest carbon stocks (64.30 Mg ha-1 +/- 5.29; 0.0-1.00 m depth) were recorded in the inter-row soils. Microbial activity, however, was greatest in the soil at the natural vegetation site (52.34 +/- 2.19 mg CO2 kg-1) compared to the row soil (29.86 +/- 2.57 mg CO2 kg-1), with the inter-row showing intermediate values (41.21 +/- 7.04 mg CO2 kg-1). Overall, the results indicate that long-term organic management enhances carbon stocks and organic matter in sandy soil, supporting its potential for climate change mitigation and sustainable agriculture in semi-arid regions.

TI  - Land Use and Seasonal Effects on the Soil Microbiome of a Brazilian Dry Forest
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Drylands occupy approximately 41% of the Earth's terrestrial surface. Climate change and land use practices are expected to affect biogeochemical cycling by the soil microbiome in these ecosystems. Understanding how soil microbial community might respond to these drivers is extremely important to mitigate the processes of land degradation and desertification. The Caatinga, an exclusively Brazilian biome composed of an extensive seasonal tropical dry forest, is exposed to variable spatiotemporal rainfall patterns as well as strong human-driven pressures. Herein, an integrated analysis of shotgun metagenomics approach coupled to meteorological data was employed to unravel the impact of seasonality and land use change on soil microbiome from preserved and agriculture-affected experimental fields in Caatinga drylands. Multivariate analysis suggested that microbial communities of preserved soils under seasonal changes were shaped primarily by water deficit, with a strong increase of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria members in the dry and rainy seasons, respectively. In contrast, nutrient availability notably played a critical role in driving the microbial community in agriculture-affected soils. The strong enrichment of bacterial genera belonging to the poorly-known phylum Acidobacteria ('Candidatus Solibacter' and 'Candidatus Koribacter') in soils from dry season affected by ferti-irrigation practices presupposes a contrasting copiotrophic lifestyle and ecological role in mitigating the impact of chemical fertilization. Functional analyses identify overrepresented genes related to osmotic stress response (synthesis of osmoprotectant compounds, accumulation of potassium ions) and preferential carbon and nitrogen utilization when comparing the microbiome of preserved soils under seasonal changes, reflecting differences in the genetic potential for nutrient cycling and C acquisition in the environment. However, the prevalence of nitrosative stress and denitrification functions in irrigation/fertilization-affected soils of the dry season clearly suggest that nutrient input and disruption of natural water regime may impact biogeochemical cycles linked to the microbial processes, with potential impacts on the ecosystem functionality. These findings help to better understand how natural seasonality and agricultural management differentially affect soil microbial ecology from dry forests, providing support for the development of more sustainable land management in dryland ecosystems.

TI  - Genome diversity of Alteromonas macleodii isolated from the Persian Gulf and the Atlantic Ocean
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Alteromonas macleodii is a heterotrophic marine bacteria abundant in the water column and associated with marine organisms. However, the genomic repertoire associated with this lifestyle is not completely understood. This study aimed to analyze the genome sequences of A. macleodii obtained from two different environmental conditions, Abrolhos Bank (AB), Brazil, and the Persian Gulf (PG), Iran, from seawater and corals. The genomes of seven Alteromonas strains from AB and three from PG were obtained using Illumina sequencing, ranging from 3 to 4.5 Mb (GC% 44.3-45). Different types and numbers of metal resistance, heat-shock, and salt resistance genes were found in the Alteromonas strains, influenced by their specific environmental conditions. Cultures of PG Alteromonas symbionts produced strong antioxidant activity under laboratory conditions, confirmed by the related gene clusters in their genomes. Additionally, higher secondary metabolites, heavy metal resistance, and chemotaxis gene clusters were found. High temperatures and salinity in the PG favor high absorption rates for heavy metals in corals. Cultivable bacteria from corals might benefit from being adapted to high temperatures, nutrients, and heavy metals. In contrast, the AB strains exhibited a different set of adaptive mechanisms, participating in nutrient cycling, including carbohydrate degradation and metabolic interactions, given the milder environmental conditions of the Atlantic Ocean. The genomic repertoire of A. macleodii strains is consistent with both a free-living and a symbiotic lifestyle, potentially contributing to the health of Abrolhos corals in different ways.

TI  - Evaluation of Vulnerability to Extreme Climatic Events in the Brazilian Amazonia: Methodological Proposal to the Rio Acre Basin
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The southern border of the Brazilian Amazon is one of the most sensitive areas to deforestation in Brazil. In addition to problems related to changes in land use, new issues are emerging, including climate change and its negative effects on the regional hydrological cycle. In recent years considerable research has been undertaken focusing on climate change and its effects on Amazon Biodiversity, carbon cycle, fire incidence and even on regional water resources, but there is very little research linking territorial planning and public policies to prospective planning scenarios and climate change and the necessary adaptation or mitigation actions to address climate vulnerability. This study examines issues pertaining to social, economic and environmental vulnerability, including new challenges posed by climate change. Examples of environmental problems related to climate dynamics of the Rio Acre Basin are floods and dry periods such as the major drought of 2005 and the 2009 flood. The use of methodology for integrated assessment of vulnerability to river basins in Amazon Region constitutes a valuable instrument for territorial planning, since it takes into account both the challenges of poverty and the environmental fragility, as well the possible aggravations of extreme climatic events in the future.

TI  - No-till cabbage production in different cover crops and phosphorus sources in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - HORTICULTURA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - No-till planting and the use of organomineral fertilizers are crop management practices that increase soil organic matter, thereby mitigating leaching and cycling a considerable amount of nutrients, with the potential to improve crop yield. This study aimed to assess the agronomic performance of cabbage grown under a no-till system, using different cover crops and phosphorus sources. A randomized block design was used, with the main plot consisting of eight split plots for different cover crop treatments: 1) Signal grass (SG); 2) Sunn hemp (SH); 3) Pearl millet (PM); 4) SG+SH; 5) SG+PM; 6) SH+PM; 7) SG+SH+PM; 8) conventional tillage (soil preparation with no cover crop), and phosphorus (P) sources in the sub-plots: mineral fertilizer (FM); 2) organomineral fertilizer (OF); 3) no P, with four repetitions. The following characteristics were assessed: cover crop fresh (FW) and dry weight (DW) (t/ha), residue decomposition and nutrient cycling; and cabbage head FW and DW (HFW and HDW) (g/plant) and yield (YLD) (t/ha). The highest FW and DW were recorded in the intercropped cover plant treatments; PM+SH and SG+SH residue exhibited the highest decomposition rate and cycling into the soil. The highest cabbage HFW and YLD occurred in the SG+SH treatment, regardless of the fertilizer used. The MF used as P source produced a greater cabbage YLD when grown PM residue. Under conventional tillage, YLD was higher when OF was used as P source.

TI  - Farmer adaptation strategies through local farming systems in Enrekang, Indonesia
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Farmers in tropical Indonesia who manage agroecological systems face multiple challenges related to food security. Despite the conditions caused by climate change, these farming households have effectively utilized agroforestry to build food security. However, prolonged dry seasons pose new constraints to their livelihood strategies. This study uses a qualitative methodology and a rural farmer livelihood framework to analyze and evaluate household livelihood strategies, attitudes, and reactions to climate change. The findings show that farmers constantly modify their management techniques using flexible and adaptive decision-making processes to cope with and minimize climate change challenges. Moreover, the role of climate variation as a significant catalyst for change in farming practices is challenging to distinguish from some of the routine problems that farmers face each year. Through knowledge accumulation and adaptive management, farmers in Enrekang utilize several livelihood adaptation strategies to reduce risks in the face of changing climate conditions. In addition, farmers utilize on-farm crops to obtain various ecosystem services that provide services such as food, nutrition, and medicine and improve ecology, nutrient cycling, and climate regulation. Further research is needed to understand how on-farm tree inclusion affects various biophysical properties and the rationale behind species selection.

TI  - Metal contamination in mangrove crab (Ucides cordatus) and human risk assessment on the Brazilian Amazon coast.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The mangrove crab, Ucides cordatus, plays a relevant role in nutrient cycling in mangroves and is a significant source of food security and income by sustaining the artisanal fishing economy in South America. However, increasing metal contamination threatens the coastal systems, mangrove crabs, and the human population depending on this resource. This study investigates the concentrations of five metals (Al, Co, Fe, Ni, Zn) in the muscle, gills, hepatopancreas, and carapace via metal transfer from the sediment to these crab tissues in "low" and "potentially impacted" areas in the states of Para and Maranhao on the Brazilian Amazon coast. Our results indicate that Fe (2403.35mgkg-1 ww) and Zn (65.94±4.48mgkg-1 ww) levels exceed the most conservative limits established for Fe (EU and FAO/WHO=45.00mgkg-1 ww) and Zn (EU and ANVISA=50.00mgkg-1 ww), particularly in the gills and hepatopancreas. Bioaccumulation of Zn was observed in all tissues, with this concentration being up to 7.76-fold higher in crab meat. Risk assessment analyses suggest that estimated daily intake values for muscle consumption alone pose no health risk. In contrast, PIS and SIS methods for consuming white and brown meat suggest potential risks. These findings reveal the urgent need for comprehensive assessments of metal contamination in different fish and shellfish species and for improved risk assessment protocols, which are crucial to supporting public health policies and mitigating the impacts of this kind of contamination in mangrove areas.

TI  - Biotechnological potential of fungi from a mangrove ecosystem: Enzymes, salt tolerance and decolorization of a real textile effluent
T2  - MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The mangrove is an ecosystem bounded by the line of the largest tide in size that occurs in climatic and subtropical regions. In this environment, microorganisms and their enzymes are involved in a series of transformations and nutrient cycling. To evaluate the biotechnological potential of fungi from a mangrove ecosystem, samples from mangrove trees were collected at the Paranagun Estuarine Complex in Brazil and 40 fungal isolates were obtained, cultivated, and screened for hydrolytic and ligninolytic enzymes production, adaptation to salinity and genetic diversity. The results showed a predominance of hydrolytic enzymes and fungal tolerance to <= 50 g L-1 sodium chloride (NaCl) concentration, a sign of adaptive halophilia. Through morphological and molecular analyses, the isolates were identified as: Trichoderma atroveride, Microsphaeropsis arundinis, Epicoccum sp., Trichoderma sp., Gliocladium sp., Geotrichum sp. and Cryphonectria sp. The ligninolytic enzymatic potential of the fungi was evaluated in liquid cultures in the presence and absence of seawater and the highest activity of laccase among isolates was observed in the presence of seawater with M. arundinis (LB07), which produced 1,037 U L-1. Enzymatic extracts of M. arundinis fixed at 100 U L-1 of laccase partially decolorized a real textile effluent in a reaction without pH adjustment and chemical mediators. Considering that mangrove fungi are still few explored, the results bring an important contribution to the knowledge about these microorganisms, as their ability to adapt to saline conditions, biodegradation of pollutants, and enzymatic potential, which make them promising candidates in biotechnological processes.

TI  - System diversification and grazing management as resilience-enhancing agricultural practices: The case of crop-livestock integration
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Managing for resilience in agriculture will be required to overcome future challenges such as growing food demand, climatic uncertainty, scarce raw materials and economic instability. Identifying resilience-enhancing practices is therefore fundamental for developing sustainable agroecosystems. We aimed to assess the resilience of two agricultural systems with different levels of diversification in southern Brazil: a specialized soybean (Glycine max) system and an integrated soybean-beef cattle system. We assessed the robustness and the adaptive capacity of these systems when facing climate hazards and price volatility. The study was based on a long-term trial that has been carried out since 2001, composed of an annual rotation of no-fill soybean production during the summer and grazing of mixed black oat (Avena strigosa) and Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflontm) pasture in the winter. Treatments consisted of four grazing intensifies in the integrated crop-livestock system (ICLS), defined by sward heights: 10, 20, 30 and 40 cm plus an ungrazed control representing the specialized cropping system (CS). The experiment was carried out using a randomized complete block design with three replicates. We analysed system results over five years using two methods: i) a downside risk analysis to estimate the expected losses of yield and gross value added; and ii) the Ecological Network Analysis, which was applied to each treatment and year, for the assessment of the resilience of nitrogen (N-R-flow) and phosphorus (P-R-flow) flows. Both methods showed that co-located crop-livestock production in an ICLS was more resilient than the specialized soybean system and had improved nutrient cycling and resource-use efficiency. The effects of grazing management on system resilience depended on the output: beef yields were more stable under lower grazing intensifies, but the risk of falling below a target economic threshold was inversely proportional to grazing intensity and null when the highest grazing intensity was adopted. The ecological network analysis did not reveal differences in resilience of nutrient flows among grazing management treatments. Our study suggests that R-flow (N or P) is a useful proxy for assessing the robustness and adaptability of agroecosystems. Our comprehensive resilience analysis of nutrient and economic flows provides evidence that system diversification through the integration of grazing animals into specialized cropping systems is a good strategy towards the sustainable intensification of agriculture. It would be relevant, however, to consider further studies comparing more complex system configurations and levels of diversification.

TI  - Artificial flooding changes soil chemistry and carbon dynamics in upland forests next to hydropower plant in Amazon basin
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Upland forest cover in the Amazon basin has been reduced by land use changes, e.g., the establishment of hydropower plants. Such plants cause permanent flooding and may produce periodic flooding in adjacent upland forests. We determined the short- and long-term effects of artificial flooding on the soil chemistry of upland forests adjacent to the Balbina Hydroelectric Reservoir, Amazonas State, Brazil. We randomized 20 sampling units in upland forests located on the banks of streams adjacent to the hydropower plant. Each sampling unit consisted of two paired forests: one artificial "flooded forest" near the stream and an unflooded "control forest." We performed soil chemical analyses to determine the pH and total organic C, N, Al3+, and nutrient levels (P, Ca, Mg, and K). In the short term, flooding caused soil acidification, C loss, and increased soil nutrient availability, but this effect did not occur in the long term. In the long term, soil acidity decreased, C loss occurred, and available N cumulatively decreased because of annual flooding after the impoundment of the reservoir. These cumulative N losses, associated with high C emissions, may alter the regional climate and contribute to global climate change.

TI  - Interactions between Vegetation, Hydrology, and Litter Inputs on Decomposition and Soil CO2 Efflux of Tropical Forests in the Brazilian Pantanal
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has the capacity to alter water availability and the litter production of tropical forests, which will alter rates of carbon (C) cycling and storage. We conducted a short-term field experiment in two hydrologically diverse forests in the Brazilian Pantanal to assess the initial response of litter decomposition and soil respiration (Rsoil) to variations in litter pool size. Total annual Rsoil and decomposition significantly declined with litter removal and increased with litter addition, but the rate of litter decomposition was highest for plots where litter was removed. Rsoil was positively related to soil organic matter content and the rate of litter decomposition, but not soil moisture or temperature, suggesting that the litter treatment effects on decomposition and Rsoil were due to changes in C availability and not litter effects on the soil environment (i.e., temperature and moisture). Rsoil was not significantly different between the forests studied here even though they had large differences in hydrology; however, litter decomposition was significantly higher in seasonally flooded forest, especially when augmented with litter. These results suggest that alterations in litter production from land use and/or climate change will alter short-term rates of decomposition and Rsoil for these and other floodplain forests of the Pantanal and Amazon Basin.

TI  - Low Impact Development practices in the context of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: A new concept, lessons learned and challenges
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The increase in urbanization and climate change brings new challenges to the cities' sustainability and resilience, mainly related to flood and drought events. Among these challenges, it can be highlighted the physical and health damage to the population, interruption of water, energy and food supply services, damage to basic infrastructure, economic losses and contamination of urban rivers. To contribute to the increase of resilience in urban centers, LID practices have been used as a new approach of mitigation and adaptation within urban drainage systems, aiming at runoff retention, peak flow attenuation, pollutant removal and ecosystem services restoration (e.g., resources recycling, carbon sequestration, thermal comfort and landscape integration). These different mitigation purposes and complementary benefits provided by LID practices can be related to the different Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) presented by the United Nations (UN), to achieve countries' systemic sustainability. The identification of local techniques that contribute to the different SDG helps to achieve their territorialization and application as public policy. Therefore, this paper presents a literature review, categorizing the studies into different generations based on their main application purpose and presents a linkage of the LID benefits to different SDG. Some challenges were identified requiring further investigation, such as the need to identify and quantify the energy demands for LID practices maintenance and their incorporation in the system final energy balance, identification of processes that contribute to carbon sequestration and emission, and risks of emerging pollutants for human health from water reuse and nutrient cycling for sustainable agriculture.

TI  - Greenhouse gas mitigation and rural electricity generation by a novel two-stroke biogas engine
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Small-scale anaerobic digestion of wet organic wastes can make positive contributions to climate mitigation, energy security and nutrient cycling in agri-food systems. However, the environmental sustainability of small-scale anaerobic digestion is undermined where lack of capacity to utilize the biogas fuel results in biomethane venting to the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. Policy support for improved manure management in Bali, Indonesia, has resulted in the installation of small (6 m(3)) anaerobic digesters across 752 Bali cattle breeding units. These 752 remote rural digesters annually vent approximately 75 482 +/- 37 741 m(3) of biomethane into the atmosphere as a waste, owing to lack of practical means to convert this potential fuel into useful energy. Meanwhile, most of these cattle farms lack access to electricity. This paper describes the performance of a novel, compact and versatile "BioMiniGen" system that provides convenient electricity generation from small-scale biogas production. This innovative system comprises: (i) a simple biogas desulfurizing system; (ii) a two-stroke, single cylinder (63 cc) air-cooled engine; (iii) an electric generator; (iv) an optional CO2 removal unit. Lifecycle assessment indicated that bioelectricity generated by the BioMiniGen would have a smaller environmental footprint than Indonesian grid electricity across 11 impact categories, including a negative global warming burden owing to avoidance of biogas venting. Trade-offs included a larger abiotic depletion burden associated with manufacture of the generators. Over a five-year lifetime, each unit, costing US$500, could generate up to 5971 kWh of electricity and mitigate up to 65.1 Mg CO2 eq., with a greenhouse gas abatement value up to US$13023. Across Bali, up to 898 +/- 449 MWh yr(-1) bioelectricity could be generated, and 1.92 +/- 0.96 Gg CO2 eq. saved. Further pilot trials are needed to ascertain realistic biogas yields from cleaned digesters managed for bioenergy generation alongside manure management. BioMiniGen technology could make an important contribution to energy security for the 1.4 billion people globally who lack access to electricity. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Eucalyptus tree influence on spatial and temporal dynamics of fine-root growth in an integrated crop-livestock-forestry system in southeastern Brazil
T2  - RHIZOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrated farming systems are promising strategies towards land-use efficiency and sustainable agriculture. The integrated crop-livestock-forestry (ICLF) system stablish complex interactions were synergies or competition depend on the arrangements throughout time and space. Fine root (<= 2 mm) growth dynamics of crops, pasture and trees remains unclear when these species are integrated. We aimed to assess root growth dynamics after Eucalyptus urograndis introduction into an integrated crop-livestock (ICL) system. Previous ICL area was used as a reference. We assessed ICLF 1.9, 4.3 and 7.5 m distances from tree rows, starting the study when trees had three years of age. Eucalyptus rows were spaced 15 m apart and integrated to annual crops and pasture. We evaluated the root growth under two different successional periods: (i) corn cultivation interspaced with palisade grass (Urochloa brizantha); and (ii) a pasture, when palisade grass was grazed. We tracked fine rootlength using the minirhizotron technique, capturing 3200 images scanning up to 70 cm soil depth. Data of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) transmission, soil bulk density, rainfall and air temperature were used as complementary information to support the discussion. Our results showed that Eucalyptus trees impaired root growth of annual crops cultivated in the interrow position, regardless of distance from the row. From 31 to 80 days after corn germination, root length production in ICLF was reduced by 120-179 cm m(-2).d(-1) along the tree interrow space. For the pasture period, total produced root length density reduced 6% at 1.9 m but increased 25% at 4.3 and 7.5 m, when compared to ICL. Shade of Eucalyptus trees at ICLF 1.9 m position, with PAR transmission mainly below 60%, sharply impaired root growth. Eucalyptus roots represented 12% from total root length produced in ICLF system, and 38% of these roots had positive ectomycorrhizal status. In conclusion, under Eucalyptus trees higher than 20 m, pasture of palisade grass is more adaptable than corn when considering the root growth dynamics of our studied ICLF arrangement. Based on our findings, corn intercropped with palisade grass should not be introduced in future management of the ICLF system, unless part of the trees is chopped to reduce light competition. However, implemented pasture of palisade grass showed belowground synergies with Eucalyptus, increasing root growth in intermediary interrow positions and emerging new fungal symbiosis, which could be playing important functions in soil, as soil carbon storage and nutrient cycling.

TI  - Ecological mechanisms and phylogeny shape invertebrate stoichiometry: A test using detritus-based communities across Central and South America
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Stoichiometric differences among organisms can affect trophic interactions and rates of nutrient cycling within ecosystems. However, we still know little about either the underlying causes of these stoichiometric differences or the consistency of these differences across large geographical extents.2. Here, we analyse elemental (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus) composition of 872 aquatic macroinvertebrates (71 species) inhabiting tank bromeliads (n=140) from five distantly located sites across Central and South America to (i) test phylogenetic, trophic and body size scaling explanations for why organisms differ in elemental composition and (ii) determine whether patterns in elemental composition are universal or context dependent.3. Taxonomy explained most variance in elemental composition, even though phylogenetic signals were weak and limited to regional spatial extents and to the family level. The highest elemental contents and lowest carbon:nutrient ratios were found in organisms at high trophic levels and with smaller body size, regardless of geographical location.4. Carnivores may have higher nutrient content and lower carbon:nutrient ratios than their prey, as organisms optimize growth by choosing the most nutrient-rich resources to consume and then preferentially retain nutrients over carbon in their bodies. Smaller organisms grow proportionally faster than large organisms and so are predicted to have higher nutrient requirements to fuel RNA and protein synthesis. Geography influenced the magnitude, more than the direction, of the ecological and/or phylogenetic effects on elemental composition.5. Overall, our results show that both ecological (i.e. trophic group) and evolutionary drivers explain among-taxa variation in the elemental content of invertebrates, whereas intraspecific variation is mainly a function of body size. Our findings also demonstrate that restricting analyses of macroinvertebrate stoichiometry solely to either the local scale or species level affects inferences of the patterns in invertebrate elemental content and their underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Conversion of tropical lowland forest reduces nutrient return through litterfall, and alters nutrient use efficiency and seasonality of net primary production
T2  - OECOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical landscapes are not only rapidly transformed by ongoing land-use change, but are additionally confronted by increasing seasonal climate variation. There is an increasing demand for studies analyzing the effects and feedbacks on ecosystem functioning of large-scale conversions of tropical natural forest into intensively managed cash crop agriculture. We analyzed the seasonality of aboveground litterfall, fine root litter production, and aboveground woody biomass production (ANPP(woody)) in natural lowland forests, rubber agroforests under natural tree cover ("jungle rubber"), rubber and oil palm monocultures along a forest-to-agriculture transformation gradient in Sumatra. We hypothesized that the temporal fluctuation of litter production increases with increasing land-use intensity, while the associated nutrient fluxes and nutrient use efficiency (NUE) decrease. Indeed, the seasonal variation of aboveground litter production and ANPP(woody) increased from the natural forest to the plantations, while aboveground litterfall generally decreased. Nutrient return through aboveground litter was mostly highest in the natural forest; however, it was significantly lower only in rubber plantations. NUE of N, P and K was lowest in the oil palm plantations, with natural forest and the rubber systems showing comparably high values. Root litter production was generally lower than leaf litter production in all systems, while the root-to-leaf ratio of litter C flux increased along the land-use intensity gradient. Our results suggest that nutrient and C cycles are more directly affected by climate seasonality in species-poor agricultural systems than in species-rich forests, and therefore might be more susceptible to inter-annual climate fluctuation and climate change.

TI  - Evaluation of the roles of metals and humic fractions in the podzolization of soils from the Amazon region using two analytical spectroscopy techniques
T2  - MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) plays an important role in environmental sustainability, since it is involved in carbon and nutrient cycling. Consequently, it is a key factor to consider in studies concerning global climate change and agronomy. Among the main components of SOM are humic substances (HS), which are divided, according to their solubility, into humic acid (HA), fulvic acid (FA), and humin (HU) fractions. Study of the chemical properties of this organic matter is important for understanding the biogeochemical processes occurring in the soil. The aim of this work was to determine the metals iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al), using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), in order to elucidate the role of organic matter in the transport of these metals in Amazonian soils. The results showed that FA was important for Al, while the HA fraction was more selective towards Fe. The translocations of these metals to deeper profiles in two different soils involved either young and less humified organic matter, or older organic matter with a low degree of humification. Therefore, these two humic fractions were involved in the process of soil podzolization, with FA having a predominant role in the transport of Al, while HA was mainly responsible for the transport of Fe.

TI  - Cultivation of pink pepper in succession to cover crops and bokashi application
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Cover crops have the potential to improve economic viability while simultaneously mitigating the environmental impacts of agriculture. Pink pepper, known for its ecoplasticity and rapid growth, can be cultivated under various management systems. This study aims to assess the influence of biostimulant application on the mass production, nutrient release, and productivity of pink pepper following cover crops, focusing on carbon sequestration, soil health, and production optimization. The experimental design employed a randomized block in a 4 x 2 x 5 factorial arrangement. Three cover crops (crotalaria, stylosanthes, and millet) were compared with a control-group (spontaneous vegetation), with or without FertBokashi (R) application. Evaluation occurred at five periods (0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 days post-cutting). Mass production and N, P, and K release were measured for over crops. Pink pepper plants were harvested at 270 days post-transplanting to assess leaf, stem, and fruit mass productivity. The residual mass of pearl millet and spontaneous vegetation showed the highest P and K levels at cutting and 180 days later, indicating significant potential for nutrient cycling by millet and certain spontaneous vegetation species. Pink pepper plants exhibited higher fresh leaf mass (386.46 g per plant) and fruit mass (80.82 g per plant) when cultivated after spontaneous vegetation and with FertBokashi (R) application. Soil application of FertBokashi (R) positively influenced pink pepper leaf and fruit production.

TI  - Impact of rainforest conversion into monoculture plantation systems on pseudoscorpion density, diversity and trophic niches
T2  - Soil Organisms
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia's biodiversity is at risk due to large forest areas being transformed into rubber and oil palm monoculture plantations. The effects of this land-use change on local fauna have been studied in a variety of organisms, including invertebrates from leaf litter and soil habitats. Litter and soil organisms arc important drivers of essential ecosystem functions, such as nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration, which are impacted heavily by monoculture plantations. Pseudoscorpions (Arachnida: Pseudoscorpiones) are predatory arthropods in such litter and soil habitats and are an ubiquitous, although typically not very abundant, component of the soil animal food web. Since virtually nothing is known on their functional role diversity in tropical soil food webs, this study aims at contributing filling this gap of knowledge. We studied the impact of the conversion of rainforest into rubber and oil palm plantations on the density and diversity of pseudoscorpions in two landscapes of Jambi province, Sumatra, Indonesia, and applied stable isotope analysis to investigate changes in their trophic niches. Among 266 sorted individuals, only one described species was recorded, while the others were sorted to a total of nine moiphospecies. Pseudoscorpions in the study region predominantly colonized mineral soil rather than the litter layer. As expected, the density declined from rainforest to rubber (-83%) and oil palm (-87%), and the number of species declined from rainforest to rubber (-37%) but in particular to oil palm (-47%). The density in riparian areas was five times lower than in non-riparian sites, however, species richness was almost the same. Further, the community composition of pseudoscorpions differed between land-use systems and landscap, no species was present across all land-use systems, and the majority of species was only present in one land-use system indicating high habitat dependence. Stable isotope analysis suggested that the pseudoscorpion community shifted from species associated with the detritus-based energy channel in rainforest to species associated with the plant-based energy channel in monoculture plantations, indicating shifts in the use of basal resources by the soil community cascading up into predators. Overall, the results indicate that tropical pseudoscorpion communities comprise high-level predators that prefere to inhabit soil rather than litter and respond sensitively to land-use change. Due to this sensitivity, pseudoscorpion abundance may serve as bioindicator for ecosystem changes in the tropics. To mitigate negative effects of changes in land use in tropical ecosystems on cryptic and unexplored soil biodiversity, reduced herbicide use resulting in increased understory vegetation and mulching practices might be adopted.

TI  - Direct and indirect effects of a pH gradient bring insights into the mechanisms driving prokaryotic community structures
T2  - MICROBIOME
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: pH is frequently reported as the main driver for prokaryotic community structure in soils. However, pH changes are also linked to "spillover effects" on other chemical parameters (e.g., availability of Al, Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu) and plant growth, but these indirect effects on the microbial communities are rarely investigated. Usually, pH also co-varies with some confounding factors, such as land use, soil management (e.g., tillage and chemical inputs), plant cover, and/or edapho-climatic conditions. So, a more comprehensive analysis of the direct and indirect effects of pH brings a better understanding of the mechanisms driving prokaryotic (archaeal and bacterial) community structures.Results: We evaluated an agricultural soil pH gradient (from 4 to 6, the typical range for tropical farms), in a liming gradient with confounding factors minimized, investigating relationships between prokaryotic communities (16S rRNA) and physical-chemical parameters (indirect effects). Correlations, hierarchical modeling of species communities (HMSC), and random forest (RF) modeling indicated that both direct and indirect effects of the pH gradient affected the prokaryotic communities. Some OTUs were more affected by the pH changes (e.g., some Actinobacteria), while others were more affected by the indirect pH effects (e.g., some Proteobacteria). HMSC detected a phylogenetic signal related to the effects. Both HMSC and RF indicated that the main indirect effect was the pH changes on the availability of some elements (e.g., Al, Fe, and Cu), and secondarily, effects on plant growth and nutrient cycling also affected the OTUs. Additionally, we found that some of the OTUs that responded to pH also correlated with CO2, CH4, and N2O greenhouse gas fluxes.Conclusions: Our results indicate that there are two distinct pH-related mechanisms driving prokaryotic community structures, the direct effect and "spillover effects" of pH (indirect effects). Moreover, the indirect effects are highly relevant for some OTUs and consequently for the community structure; therefore, it is a mechanism that should be further investigated in microbial ecology.

TI  - Greater Water Surface Variability Revealed by New Congo River Field Data: Implications for Satellite Altimetry Measurements of Large Rivers
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Large river hydrodynamics studies inform global and regional issues pertaining to biogeochemical cycling, ecology, water availability, and flood risk. Such studies rely increasingly on satellite measurements, but these are limited by resolution, coverage, and uncertainty and their inability to directly measure bathymetry or discharge. We obtain new in situ data covering 650 km of the Congo's main stem, including elusive bathymetry and discharge measurements that complement space-borne data sets. Our key findings relate to our water surface elevation measurements, which show that spatial coverage of existing satellite altimetry for deriving river water surface profiles may be adequate through the globally important Cuvette Centrale but is not at its outlet where our field data reveal significant spatial variability in water surface slope. The findings have implications for altimetry-based hydrodynamics studies of other large rivers, such as those that involve estimating discharge or modeling multichannel river hydraulics.

TI  - Nitrogen aboveground turnover and soil stocks to 8 m depth in primary and selectively logged forest in southern Amazonia
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive areas of Amazonia undergo selective logging, modifying forest structure and nutrient cycles. Anthropogenic-accelerated rates of nitrogen (N) turnover could increase N loss and affect regeneration, carbon sequestration and timber production. We quantified leaf area reduction, canopy opening and downed biomass and resultant N flux from reduced impact logging (RIL) activities. We compared canopy reduction, surface soil moisture and nitrate to 8 m depth between logged gaps and intact primary forest to determine if logging activities increase subsoil nitrate. To test long-term logging effects, we evaluated surface N stocks along a 12-year postlogging chronosequence. At the harvest rate of 2.6 trees ha-1, total N additions in logging gaps, including leaves and wood from felled crowns (24.8 kg N ha-1) and other killed trees (41.9 kg N ha-1), accounted for over 80% of the total N addition to aboveground necromass from all logging activities (81.9 kg N ha-1). Despite this N turnover by logging, belowground nitrate storage to 8 m depth did not differ between logging gaps and primary forest at the low harvest rate and disturbance intensity of this study. Soil water depletion also did not differ between gaps and primary forest over 1 year, indicating the impact on belowground inorganic N was low. Compared with primary forest, nitrate concentrations to 8 m depth in logging gaps were only significantly higher at 60-100 cm, suggesting some N redistribution beyond the bulk of the fine roots in logging gaps. Extrapolated to the Amazon Basin scale, we provide a conservative estimate that logging damage and bole export under RIL would turn over 0.14 +/- 0.07 to 0.23 +/- 0.12 Tg N yr-1 based on 1999-2002 selective logging rates. Greater damage during conventional selective logging would cause higher N turnover throughout the Amazon Basin than our results based on RIL.

TI  - BIOMASS AND NUTRIENT CYCLING BY COVER CROPS IN BRAZILIAN CERRADO IN THE STATE OF PIAUI
T2  - REVISTA CAATINGA
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on the performance of cover crops in crop systems of annual crops in the Brazilian state of Piaui contributes to increases in yield, greater efficiency of fertilizers and mitigation of environmental impacts. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of cover crops in terms of biomass production and the accumulation and release of nutrients during the crop season (November to April) in an oxisol in the Brazilian Cerrado in the state of Piaui that was submitted to different crop production systems including soybeans, maize and upland rice. The experiment was established during the 2010/11 and 2011/12 crop years in the rural area near the municipality of Bom Jesus, Piaui. The experimental design was a randomized block in a split-plot array. Different soil management systems (conventional and no-till) were evaluated in the main plots. Different crop production systems consisting of cover crops sown in the off-season (April to November), and annual crops sown during the crop season (November to April) were implemented in the subplots. The crop production systems that included Urochloa ruziziensis and Pennisetum glaucum overseeded on soybeans and Urochloa ruziziensis simultaneously intercropped with maize stood out in terms of biomass production and the accumulation and release of nutrients. Yields of maize and upland rice declined when sown under newly implemented no-till soil management.

TI  - Agricultural Impacts on Hydrobiogeochemical Cycling in the Amazon: Is There Any Solution?
T2  - WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - Expansion of agriculture in the Brazilian Amazon has been driven not just by demands from traditional, rural producers, but also large agriculture and cattle producers, both of whom have put considerable pressure on remaining forests and their watersheds. Monitoring of these watersheds has been a focus of intensive study for the past 20 years and although this work has greatly increased our understanding, considerable gaps still remain in our ability to provide adequate recommendations for land management and associated public policies. In this study we present a summary of findings from these previous results. For small properties, the use of fire to prepare land for cultivation remains controversial, while in large properties, forest conversion to pasture and/or crop production has had a meaningful and adverse effect on water quality. Riparian forest conservation can make a significant difference in reducing impacts of land-use change. Secondary vegetation can also play an important role in mitigating these impacts. New types of sustainable agricultural production systems, together with incentives such as payments for ecosystem service can also contribute. Continued monitoring of these changes, together with robust sustainable development plans, can help to preserve forest while still addressing the social and economic needs of Amazonian riverine inhabitants.

TI  - The Threat of Multi-Year Drought in Western Amazonia
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent "once-in-a-century" Amazonian droughts highlight the impacts of drought and climate change on this region's vegetation, carbon storage, water cycling, biodiversity, land use, and economy. The latest climate model simulations suggest this region will experience worsening future drought. However, the instrumental record is too short to quantify the range of background drought variability, or to evaluate extended drought risk in climate models. To overcome these limitations, we generated a new, highly resolved lake record of hydroclimatic variability within the western Amazon Basin. We find that Amazonia has regularly experienced multi-year droughts over the last millennium. Our results indicate that current climate model simulations likely underestimate the background risk of multi-year Amazonian drought. These findings illustrate that the future sustainability of the Amazonian forest and its many services may require management strategies that consider the likelihood of multi-year droughts superimposed on a continued warming trend.

TI  - The "Flexi-Chamber": A Novel Cost-Effective In Situ Respirometry Chamber for Coral Physiological Measurements
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coral reefs are threatened worldwide, with environmental stressors increasingly affecting the ability of reef-building corals to sustain growth from calcification (G), photosynthesis (P) and respiration (R). These processes support the foundation of coral reefs by directly influencing biogeochemical nutrient cycles and complex ecological interactions and therefore represent key knowledge required for effective reef management. However, metabolic rates are not trivial to quantify and typically rely on the use of cumbersome in situ respirometry chambers and/or the need to remove material and examine ex situ, thereby fundamentally limiting the scale, resolution and possibly the accuracy of the rate data. Here we describe a novel low-cost in situ respirometry bag that mitigates many constraints of traditional glass and plexi-glass incubation chambers. We subsequently demonstrate the effectiveness of our novel "Flexi-Chamber" approach via two case studies: 1) the Flexi-Chamber provides values of P, R and G for the reef-building coral Siderastrea cf. stellata collected from reefs close to Salvador, Brazil, which were statistically similar to values collected from a traditional glass respirometry vessel; and 2) wide-scale application of obtaining P, R and G rates for different species across different habitats to obtain inter- and intra-species differences. Our novel cost-effective design allows us to increase sampling scale of metabolic rate measurements in situ without the need for destructive sampling and thus significantly expands on existing research potential, not only for corals as we have demonstrated here, but also other important benthic groups.

TI  - How do replanted mangroves affect phosphorus dynamics in their soils?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Phosphorus is a limiting element for the productivity of mangroves, which in turn are important ecosystems in regulating nutrients cycle and climate change by sequestering carbon (C). Despite this, there is an intense process of degradation in these environments. In addition to providing socio-environmental services, mangrove replanting can also alter the dynamics of nutrients in soils. Therefore, this study aims to understand the changes in soil phosphorus (P) fractions after a mangrove restoration. Soil samples from an unvegetated area (NV), a mature mangrove (R) and 7 and 9 year old replanted mangroves at SE-Brazil (APA Guapi-mirim, Rio de Janeiro state) were collected and analyzed to characterize the redox conditions (Eh), pH, and iron (Fe) fractionation, Total Organic Carbon (TOC) contents and P fractionation (exchangeable P; P associated with reducible Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides; associated with Al silicates and hydroxides; associated with humic acids; associated with Ca and Mg; associated with humin). The results indicate an increase in TOC as the age of the mangrove restoration increases (from 8.6 to 17.9%). The pH values were significantly lower, reaching very acidic values, associated with an increase in Eh. Both parameters also showed strong seasonal variation, with a drop in Eh during the wet period (from 165% to -46%) and an increase in pH in the same period (from 6.0 to 6.7). Regarding P fractionation, the main P pool was organic P forms, which showed the highest concentrations in all studied sites. Unvegetated areas showed higher organic P forms (NV: 108.8 mu g g- 1) than vegetated areas (M7: 55.7 mu g g(-1), M9: 83.6 mu g g(-1), R: 87.3 mu g g(-1)). Vegetated sites also showed lower levels of the PEx, PFeMn and Papatite fractions (total forest mean: 2.4 mu g g(-1), 5.8 mu g g(-1), 3.0 mu g g(-1), respectively). Besides no clear trend on P fractionation through seasons and forest age, pseudo-total P increased following the forest recovery (e.g. M7<M9<R), showing the re-establishment of temporary nutrient retention capacity with the replanting of the mangrove. Mangroves replanting affected P dynamics, promoting an accumulation of P in soils, also indicated the reestablishment of ecosystem services, such as nutrient cycling. Seasonal variations influenced the ability of P retention and release for adjacent areas. Our findings indicate that mangrove restoration affected the key parameters (pH, Eh, TOC) which controlled soil processes (redox reactions, organic matter degradation), impacting the cycles of Fe, C, and P cycles. Therefore, crucial soil ecosystem services (e.g., nutrient regulation and C storage) were improved by replanting mangroves. However, seasonal trends on nutrient dynamics still need further studies to better un- derstand soil processes, especially in replanting environments.

TI  - Living in darkness: functional diversity of mesopelagic fishes in the western tropical Atlantic
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mesopelagic zones (200-1,000-m depth) are characterized by relatively low light levels, cold waters, and often limited oxygen, forming a stable yet challenging habitat for their inhabitants. To overcome these constraints, mesopelagic fishes have developed several adaptations that enable them to participate in crucial ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling, carbon transport, and provisioning of harvestable fish stocks. However, our understanding of the functional diversity of mesopelagic fishes remains limited, while it is of particular importance considering the increase in human threats and possible environmental changes in the deep ecosystems. In this context, functional diversity emerges as a powerful tool and can help assess community assembly rules, including species complementary and redundancy. Here, we take advantage of scientific surveys that collected 200 species taxa identified from over 7,000 specimens to determine the functional diversity of mesopelagic fish assemblages across depths and the day-night period. We created a data set of 17 qualitative functional traits related to feeding, survival, and locomotion functions. Based on this information, functional spaces and diversity indices were calculated, and functional groups were established. Furthermore, the influence on the functional diversity of environmental variables and the day-night period was assessed by generalized additive models (GAMs). The hypothesis of functional complementary was tested. Overall, mesopelagic fishes displayed a high functional diversity and could be grouped into 10 major functional groups. Moreover, 107 species exhibited a unique composition of functional trait values, revealing a vast complementarity of functions within the deep-sea ecosystem. We also showed that functional diversity in mesopelagic ecosystems is neither static nor homogeneous, exhibiting higher values in the deepest layers and varying between day and night. We finally discuss processes that may structure mesopelagic fish assemblages and the implications of our findings for the conservation mesopelagic fishes.

TI  - Seasonal Changes in Metabolic Rates of Two Tropical Lakes in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied the importance of environmental drivers for the seasonal dynamics of gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R), and net ecosystem production in surface waters of two tropical lakes in southeast Brazil (Carioca-CA; and Dom Helv,cio-DH), 2011 and 2012, using high frequency measurements of dissolved oxygen. Metabolic rates were approximately twice as high during the fully mixed winter periods, compared to the summer periods. For both lakes, GPP was approximately 30% lower during the warmer and dryer spring of 2012 compared to 2011. Seasonal changes in GPP and R were negatively correlated to water column stability (GPP r = -0.82, p < 0.001; R r = -0.80, p < 0.001). Periods with high stability coincided with warm waters which reduced mixing and internal inputs of nutrients from hypolimnetic waters. GPP was accordingly suppressed in both lakes during summer due to a combination of nutrient depletion and photo-inhibition, which was more pronounced during summer. These conditions were more prevailing during the warm and dry year of 2012, indicating ecosystem responses in carbon cycling to the ongoing regional climate changes.

TI  - Hydrological Cycles over the Congo and Upper Blue Nile Basins: Evaluation of General Circulation Model Simulations and Reanalysis Products
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The simulations and predictions of the hydrological cycle by general circulation models (GCMs) are characterized by a significant degree of uncertainty. This uncertainty is reflected in the range of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) GCM predictions of future changes in the hydrological cycle, particularly over major African basins. The confidence in GCM predictions can be increased by evaluating different GCMs, identifying those models that succeed in simulating the hydrological cycle under current climate conditions, and using them for climate change studies. Reanalyses are often used to validate GCMs, but they also suffer from an inaccurate representation of the hydrological cycle. In this study, the aim is to identify GCMs and reanalyses' products that provide a realistic representation of the hydrological cycle over the Congo and upper Blue Nile (UBN) basins. Atmospheric and soil water balance constraints are employed to evaluate the models' ability to reproduce the observed streamflow, which is the most accurate measurement of the hydrological cycle. Among the ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim), NCEP-NCAR reanalysis, and 40-yr ECWMF Re-Analysis (ERA-40), ERA-Interim shows the best performance over these basins: it balances the water budgets and accurately represents the seasonal cycle of the hydrological variables. The authors find that most GCMs used by the IPCC overestimate the hydrological cycle compared to observations. They observe some improvement in the simulated hydrological cycle with increased horizontal resolution, which suggests that some of the high-resolution GCMs are better suited for climate change studies over Africa.

TI  - Soil fungal community in eucalyptus cultivation cycles
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS AGRARIAS-AGRARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The short production cycle, high biomass production, and adaptability to various edofoclimatic conditions have led the eucalyptus to a prominent position in the world forestry sector. However, little is known about fungal community structure in these crops. This work aimed to evaluate the structure of soil fungal communities in eucalyptus forests as a function of rhizosphere effect and crop cycles of this crop. We used the independent PCR-DGGE method to evaluate the structure of the soil fungal community in Eucalyptus urograndis plantations located in the Vale do Rio Doce region, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The rhizospheric and non-rhizospheric portions of the soil were sampled in an area of recent forest establishment and in an area under multiple cycles. The principal component analysis revealed that the rhizosphere microenvironment is the dominant component in structuring the fungal communities in the areas studied, and this effect is more pronounced in the area of recent establishment of eucalyptus culture. The same pattern was found for the richness and diversity values, with the greatest differences found in the recently established area. In both studied areas the dominance of the order Agaricales prevailed, evidencing the role of the fungal community in the cycling of nutrients in the soil.

TI  - Metagenome of a Microbial Community Inhabiting a Metal-Rich Tropical Stream Sediment
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, we describe the metagenome and functional composition of a microbial community in a historically metal-contaminated tropical freshwater stream sediment. The sediment was collected from the Mina Stream located in the Iron Quadrangle (Brazil), one of the world's largest mining regions. Environmental DNA was extracted and was sequenced using SOLiD technology, and a total of 7.9 Gbp was produced. A taxonomic profile that was obtained by comparison to the Greengenes database revealed a complex microbial community with a dominance of Proteobacteria and Parvarcheota. Contigs were recruited by bacterial and archaeal genomes, especially Candidatus Nitrospira defluvii and Nitrosopumilus maritimus, and their presence implicated them in the process of N cycling in the Mina Stream sediment (MSS). Functional reconstruction revealed a large, diverse set of genes for ammonium assimilation and ammonification. These processes have been implicated in the maintenance of the N cycle and the health of the sediment. SEED subsystems functional annotation unveiled a high degree of diversity of metal resistance genes, suggesting that the prokaryotic community is adapted to metal contamination. Furthermore, a high metabolic diversity was detected in the MSS, suggesting that the historical arsenic contamination is no longer affecting the prokaryotic community. These results expand the current knowledge of the microbial taxonomic and functional composition of tropical metal-contaminated freshwater sediments.

TI  - Soil improvement and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions for integrated crop-livestock systems: Case study assessment in the Pantanal savanna highland, Brazil
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Greenhouse gas emissions and climate change has been partially attributed to agricultural expansion by deforestation, while the pressure to assure food, fiber and energy for the future generations leads to the intensification of agricultural systems. The transition to more efficient systems is actually considered an important strategy to reduce deforestation and to spare land for other uses, including the recovery of environmental services and ecohydrological processes in the drainage basin such as carbon sink and water regulation. The Brazilian Federal Program for Low Carbon Agriculture (ABC Program) intends to reduce carbon emissions by stimulating technological processes that neutralize emissions or enhance the sinking of greenhouse gases. A pilot farm has been established to assess an intensive animal-plant farming system that incorporates anaerobic digestion for biogas, power generation and organic fertilizer production. Emergy Synthesis was chosen as a methodological tool to assess and to diagnosis the farm system design. The modified emergy assessment including externalities (greenhouse gas emissions) improves the understanding of integrated crop-livestock systems efficiency in internal recycling of nutrients and power conversion. The adoption of manure treatment in intensified agricultural systems can effectively contribute to enhance environmental and economic performances. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Integrating Oceanographic Data and Benthic Community Structure Temporal Series to Assess the Dynamics of a Marginal Reef
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Reefs are the richest marine ecosystems. Their benthic communities generate structural complexity and participate in nutrient cycles, providing habitat and food for many marine species. These ecosystems have been threatened by local and global anthropogenic impacts and changes in community structure have led to loss of biodiversity, ecosystem function and services worldwide. Most studies about these structural changes have been conducted in Caribbean and Indo-Pacific coral reefs. In the Southwestern Atlantic, where reefs are naturally algae-dominated, these efforts are incipient, especially at oceanic islands where local anthropic impacts tend to be lower, and natural and climate-induced fluctuations might be easily detected. We conducted the first temporal assessment of benthic communities and the influence of oceanographic parameters between 2013 and 2019 in Fernando de Noronha (FNA), the largest Brazilian oceanic archipelago. We annually sampled benthic communities in FNA's shallow reefs (2-21 m) using photoquadrats, quantified and gathered organisms in major groups according to their functional roles. We also characterized and tested "sea surface temperature," "marine heatwaves," "diffuse attenuation coefficient," and "wave energy" influence for the same period. The most abundant groups were epilithic algal matrix (EAM; mean annual coverage: 23-60%), macroalgae (15-35%) and calcifiers (15-29%), followed by cyanobacteria (1-37%), suspension/filter-feeders (<2%), zoanthids (<1%) and other invertebrates (<0.1%). EAM was negatively correlated with "marine heatwaves" and positively correlated with "wave energy," while macroalgae and calcifiers showed opposite responses to "marine heatwaves" and "wave energy," respectively. Cyanobacteria was positively correlated with "marine heatwaves." The dominance of EAM and macroalgae was already described for reefs along the Brazilian Province and we demonstrated the persistence of this structure over the years in FNA, with the exception of 2019 when there was a substantial increase of cyanobacteria after a strong marine heatwave. Our results suggest a flickering dynamic between EAM and macroalgae, which vary according to the oceanographic conditions, reinforcing its distinct dynamics from most tropical coral reefs. However, the increase of cyanobacteria added to projections of more frequent and stronger marine heatwaves worldwide indicate possible structural changes in this community. Continued monitoring of community and oceanographic drivers is key for better understanding and predicting changes in important marginal reefs.

TI  - Fungal communities in oil contaminated mangrove sediments - Who is in the mud?
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are ecosystems located in tropical and subtropical regions of the world and are vital for coastal protection. Their unique characteristics make them hotspots for carbon cycling and biological diversity. Studies on isolated filamentous fungi and environmental and anthropogenic factors that influence sediments offer new understandings on how to preserve mangroves. Here we report on the filamentous fungi isolated from four mangroves. We correlated fungal community composition with sediment texture, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons concentration (oil pollution), pH, salinity, organic matter, total and thermotolerant coliforms (sewage pollution). In total we identified 34 genera and 97 species. The most polluted sites had highest species richness whereas the best preserved site showed the lowest species richness. Oil spill and sewage pollution were identified as the drivers of fungal community composition in the most polluted sites. We found very distinct fungal communities with no > 5 species shared between any two mangrove sites.

TI  - Climate change in Brazil: perspective on the biogeochemistry of inland waters
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although only a small amount of the Earth's water exists as continental surface water bodies, this compartment plays an important role in the biogeochemical cycles connecting the land to the atmosphere. The territory of Brazil encompasses a dense river net and enormous number of shallow lakes. Human actions have been heavily influenced by the inland waters across the country. Both biodiversity and processes in the water are strongly driven by seasonal fluvial forces and/or precipitation. These macro drivers are sensitive to climate changes. In addition to their crucial importance to humans, inland waters are extremely rich ecosystems, harboring high biodiversity, promoting landscape equilibrium (connecting ecosystems, maintaining animal and plant flows in the landscape, and transferring mass, nutrients and inocula), and controlling regional climates through hydrological-cycle feedback. In this contribution, we describe the aquatic ecological responses to climate change in a conceptual perspective, and we then analyze the possible climate-change scenarios in different regions in Brazil. We also indentify some potential biogeochemical signals in running waters, natural lakes and man-made impoundments. The possible future changes in climate and aquatic ecosystems in Brazil are highly uncertain. Inland waters are pressured by local environmental changes because of land uses, landscape fragmentation, damming and diversion of water bodies, urbanization, wastewater load, and level of pollutants can alter biogeochemical patterns in inland waters over a shorter term than can climate changes. In fact, many intense environmental changes may enhance the effects of changes in climate. Therefore, the maintenance of key elements within the landscape and avoiding extreme perturbation in the systems are urgent to maintain the sustainability of Brazilian inland waters, in order to prevent more catastrophic future events.

TI  - Soil Carbon Turnover Measurement by Physical Fractionation at a Forest-to-Pasture Chronosequence in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of conversion from forest-to-pasture upon soil carbon stocks has been intensively discussed, but few studies focus on how this land-use change affects carbon (C) distribution across soil fractions in the Amazon basin. We investigated this in the 20 cm depth along a chronosequence of sites from native forest to three successively older pastures. We performed a physicochemical fractionation of bulk soil samples to better understand the mechanisms by which soil C is stabilized and evaluate the contribution of each C fraction to total soil C. Additionally, we used a two-pool model to estimate the mean residence time (MRT) for the slow and active pool C in each fraction. Soil C increased with conversion from forest-to-pasture in the particulate organic matter (> 250 mu m), microaggregate (53-250 mu m), and d-clay (< 2 mu m) fractions. The microaggregate comprised the highest soil C content after the conversion from forest-to-pasture. The C content of the d-silt fraction decreased with time since conversion to pasture. Forest-derived C remained in all fractions with the highest concentration in the finest fractions, with the largest proportion of forest-derived soil C associated with clay minerals. Results from this work indicate that microaggregate formation is sensitive to changes in management and might serve as an indicator for management-induced soil carbon changes, and the soil C changes in the fractions are dependent on soil texture.

TI  - Carbon cycling anal sequestration opportunities in South America: the case of Brazil
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A carbon emission inventory of the Brazilian agricultural sector was used to compare greenhouse gas emissions with estimated carbon offsets promoted by two main changes in agricultural management: the replacement of conventional tillage by no-tillage and the cessation of annual burning in sugar cane production. Using the IPCC revised 1996 guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories, we estimate that 12.65 Mt C are emitted annually from agricultural land in Brazil. Ongoing conversion of conventionally tilled land to no-tillage currently accumulates 9 Mt C yr(-1). Industrial by-products like alcohol and bagasse from sugar cane processing substitute fossil fuel for transportation and power generation offsetting 10 and 8 Mt C yr(-1), respectively. An additional opportunity for 0.53 Mt C yr(-1) sequestration is presented by avoiding burning before harvesting of sugar cane. These data show that there could be almost full compensation between sources and sinks/offsets in the agricultural carbon cycle. There is a great opportunity to achieve this mitigation benefit because the adoption of new technologies is increasing rapidly.

TI  - The Western South Atlantic Ocean in a High-CO2 World: Current Measurement Capabilities and Perspectives
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An international multi-disciplinary group of 24 researchers met to discuss ocean acidification (OA) during the Brazilian OA Network/Surface Ocean-Lower Atmosphere Study (BrOA/SOLAS) Workshop. Fifteen members of the BrOA Network (www. broa. furg. br) authored this review. The group concluded that identifying and evaluating the regional effects of OA is impossible without understanding the natural variability of seawater carbonate systems in marine ecosystems through a series of long-term observations. Here, we show that the western South Atlantic Ocean (WSAO) lacks appropriate observations for determining regional OA effects, including the effects of OA on key sensitive Brazilian ecosystems in this area. The impacts of OA likely affect marine life in coastal and oceanic ecosystems, with further social and economic consequences for Brazil and neighboring countries. Thus, we present (i) the diversity of coastal and open ocean ecosystems in the WSAO and emphasize their roles in the marine carbon cycle and biodiversity and their vulnerabilities to OA effects; (ii) ongoing observational, experimental, and modeling efforts that investigate OA in the WSAO; and (iii) highlights of the knowledge gaps, infrastructure deficiencies, and OA-related issues in the WSAO. Finally, this review outlines long-term actions that should be taken to manage marine ecosystems in this vast and unexplored ocean region.

TI  - Organic carbon burial and sources in soils of coastal mudflat and mangrove ecosystems
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove organic carbon is primarily stored in soils, which contain more than two-thirds of total mangrove ecosystem carbon stocks. Despite increasing recognition of the critical role of mangrove ecosystems for climate change mitigation, there is limited understanding of soil organic carbon sequestration mechanisms in undisturbed low-latitude mangroves, specifically on organic carbon burial rates and sources. This study assessed soil organic carbon burial rates, sources and stocks across an undisturbed coastal mudflat and mangrove hydrogeomorphological catena (fringe mangrove and interior mangrove) in Bintuni Bay, West Papua Province, Indonesia. Pb-210 radionuclide sediment dating, and mixing model of natural stable isotope signatures (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and C/N ratio were used to estimate organic carbon burial rates and to quantify proportions of allochthonous (i.e., upland terrestrial forest) and autochthonous (i.e., on-site mangrove forest) organic carbon in the top 50 cm of the soil. Burial rates were in the range of 0.21-1.19 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Compared to the fringe mangroves, organic carbon burial rates in interior mangroves were almost twice as high. Primary productivity of C3 upland forest vegetation and mangroves induced soil organic carbon burial in interior mangroves and this was consistent with the formation of the largest organic carbon stocks (179 +/- 82 Mg C ha(-1)). By contrast, organic carbon stored in the fringe mangrove (68 +/- 11 Mg C ha(-1)) and mudflat (62 +/- 10 Mg C ha(-1)) soils mainly originated from upland forests (allochthonous origin). These findings clearly indicate that carbon sequestered and cycling in mangrove and terrestrial forest ecosystems are closely linked, and at least a part of carbon losses (e.g., erosion) from terrestrial forests is buried in mangrove ecosystems.

TI  - Use of the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) does not mitigate N2O emission from bovine urine patches under Oxisol in Northwest Brazil
T2  - NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Animal production systems are important sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs), especially methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). GHG emissions from urine patches have been extensively studied in temperate climates, with few studies under tropical conditions. Here we examined the driving factors of N2O and CH4 emission from urine patches in the tropics, as well as the role of the nitrification inhibitor DCD (dicyandiamide) in mitigating emissions. We hypothesized that the high temperature and periodical rainfall can increase GHG emissions from urine patches through accelerating mineralization of urine-N. We measured CH4 and N2O emissions from beef cattle urine (360 kg N ha(-1)) in Rondnia state (Brazil, tropical climate), during two different seasons (winter and summer), with and without the application of DCD (10 kg ha(-1)). No effects of DCD on cumulative N2O emissions were detected in summer, but DCD retarded the main emission peak. During winter DCD increased N2O emissions from 10.8 to 39.2 mg N-N2O m(-2) (p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.05). Emission factors averaged 0.4 % for summer and 0.1 % for winter, which is significantly lower than the IPCC default value of 1 %. The climate, associated with soil (acidic pH, WFPS and low N content) and plant properties (biological nitrification inhibition) resulted in a low emission factor. We concluded that the IPCC default emission factor for tropical systems may be reduced, and that the application of DCD is not recommended in such systems.

TI  - Droughts, Wildfires, and Forest Carbon Cycling: A Pantropical Synthesis
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCES, VOL 47
M3  - Review
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Tropical woody plants store similar to 230 petagrams of carbon (PgC) in their above-ground living biomass. This review suggests that these stocks are currently growing in primary forests at rates that have decreased in recent decades. Droughts are an important mechanism in reducing forest C uptake and stocks by decreasing photosynthesis, elevating tree mortality, increasing autotrophic respiration, and promoting wildfires. Tropical forests were a C source to the atmosphere during the 2015-2016 El Nino-related drought, with some estimates suggesting that up to 2.3 PgC were released. With continued climate change, the intensity and frequency of droughts and fires will likely increase. It is unclear at what point the impacts of severe, repeated disturbances by drought and fires could exceed tropical forests' capacity to recover. Although specific threshold conditions beyond which ecosystem properties could lead to alternative stable states are largely unknown, the growing body of scientific evidence points to such threshold conditions becoming more likely as climate and land use change across the tropics.Droughts have reduced forest carbon uptake and stocks by elevating tree mortality, increasing autotrophic respiration, and promoting wildfires.Threshold conditions beyond which tropical forests are pushed into alternative stable states are becoming more likely as effects of droughts intensify.

TI  - Ecomorphological relations of sympatric juveniles of Clupeiformes from a Brazilian sandy beach
T2  - IHERINGIA SERIE ZOOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Surf zones are important for early life stages of several fish species for presenting characteristics such as high phytoplanktonic production, diverse food availability and shelter against predators. The action of waves in this environment provides nutrient cycling and increase the turbidity making surf zones ideal nursery environments for diverse species of fish, including clupeiforms. Clupeiform species have a great ecological and economic value for being abundant fish in tropical sandy beaches surf zones with significant fisheries importance. Studies about their feeding ecology and environment use are relevant, and one of the methods improving this knowledge is the application of ecomorphological analyses, which helps understanding species ecological interactions and their adaptations. In this context, the present study aimed to identify the ecomorphological relations and infer about the feeding ecology of eight sympatric clupeiform species in a Brazilian tropical sandy beach. Ten ecomorphological variables were analyzed of individuals belonging 1829) and Opisthonema oglinum (Lesueur, 1818), whose values were employed in a principal component analysis (PCA) with the two first axis explaining 58.92% of the total variance. A high morphological overlap between the species of Engraulidae was observed with the exception of A. clupeoides, which differed from the others for presenting higher values of the compression index and caudal peduncle compression index. The Clupeidae species differed from the other families due to higher values of relative height and relative head length which also showed differences between the species themselves, having H. clupeola presented the highest values of these variables. The representative of Pristigasteridae showed an intermediate overlap between the species of the other families because of its highly compressed body but with low scores of relative height, caudal peduncle relative length and mouth aspect ratio. The morphological differentiation between the families and even between species from the same family indicates niche divergences, showing that besides their phylogenetical proximity there are differences in their ecological interactions which possibly contribute to their coexistence.

TI  - Comparing Tropical Forest Projections from Two Generations of Hadley Centre Earth System Models, HadGEM2-ES and HadCM3LC
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Future changes in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and associated influences on climate could affect the future sustainability of tropical forests. The authors report on tropical forest projections from the new Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model version 2 Earth System configuration (HadGEM2-ES) and compare them to results from the previous generation model [third climate configuration of the Met Office Unified Model in lower resolution with carbon cycle (HadCM3LC)], which had projected near-complete dieback of the Amazon rain forest for a business as usual scenario. In contrast, HadGEM2-ES projects minimal change in Amazon forest extent. The main aim of this study is a preliminary investigation of this difference between the two models. It is found that around 40% of the difference in forest dieback projections is associated with differences in the projected change in dry-season length. Differences in control climatologies of temperature and dry-season length, projected regional warming, and the forest response to climate and CO2 also all contribute to the increased survival of forest in HadGEM2-ES. However, HadGEM2-ES does not invalidate HadCM3LC: Amazon dieback remains a possible scenario of dangerous change that requires further understanding. The authors discuss the relevance to assessments of dieback risk and future work toward narrowing uncertainty about the fate of the Amazon forest.

Leaf litter decomposition was studied in experiments over five-month-periods with repetitions for the dry and wet seasons, using the nylon-mesh bag technique. The greater litter production took place during the drier period of the year, mainly  from June to October, while decomposition processes were more accentuated in the wet season: in the plateau site, one-half of the litter disappears, according to a mathematical model, in about 218 days under dry season conditions as against 32 days in the wet season. In the rainy season, weight reduction and mineral losses from decomposing leaves occurred more rapidly, owing to the intense biological activity on the material during this period. Particularly noticeable was the intense activity  of termites in organic matter breakdown and mineral removal, and the extensive root penetration in the decomposing leaves, which removed some minerals but increased the amounts of others. Leaching effects were also quite noticeable in this period. During the rainy season, in the latosol sites, termites were responsible for more than 40% of the removal of decomposing leaves. While intense biological activity appears to be the major factor responsible for weight reduction and loss of many  minerals, as well as for the accumulation of some other minerals (mainly zinc, iron and aluminum) in the decomposing material, leaching seems to be the major factor responsible for the loss of certain minerals such as potassium, boron and copper.

TI  - Aboveground Carbon Storage and Cycling of Flooded and Upland Forests of the Brazilian Pantanal
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests and savanna (cerrado) are important carbon (C) sinks; however, few data exist for seasonally flooded forests. We quantified the annual rates of aboveground net primary production (ANPP) over a five-year period for two forests, an upland mixed forest and a seasonally flooded cerrado forest, located in the northern Pantanal region of Brazil. We hypothesized that rates of ANPP would be higher for the mixed forest than the cerrado forest because seasonal flooding can limit rates of tree growth. ANPP was calculated as the sum of the annual litter production measured from litterfall traps and the stem growth increment measured from dendrometers and tree density. ANPP varied between 3.8-5.5 MgC ha(-1)y(-1)for the flooded forest and 1.6-4.6 MgC ha(-1)y(-1)for the upland forest. Litter production accounted for 57% of the ANPP, and the difference in ANPP between the upland and flooded forests was due to consistently higher litter production in the flooded forest. Annual variations in ANPP were not correlated with annual precipitation, presumably because the hydrology of these sites is driven more by the flood stage of the Cuiaba River than by local precipitation. However, consistent declines in forest floor litter mass occurred at both sites, suggesting that C storage may be responding to some unknown disturbance that occurred prior to our sampling campaign. Seasonal variation in rainfall exerted an important control on litter production dynamics, with leaf litter production increasing during the dry season and stem and reproductive litter production increasing during the wet season. While there are few studies of seasonally flooded tropical forests, our data suggest that the seasonally flooded and upland forests of the northern Pantanal can act as appreciable aboveground C sinks.

TI  - Mammals in Sao Paulo State: diversity, distribution, ecology, and conservation
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Mammals are charismatic organisms that play a fundamental role in ecological functions and ecosy stem services, such as pollination, seed dispersal, nutrient cycling, and pest control. The state of Sao Paulo represents only 3% of the Brazilian territory but holds 33% of its mammalian diversity. Most of its territory is dominated by agriculture, pastures, and urban areas which directly affect the diversity and persistence of mammals in the landscape. In addition, Sao Paulo has the largest port in Latin America and the largest offshore oil reservoir in Brazil, with a 600 km stretch of coastline with several marine mammal species. These human-made infrastructures affect the diversity, distribution, ecology, and the future of mammals in the state. Here, we answer five main questions: 1) What is the diversity of wild mammals in Sao Paulo state? 2) Where are they? 3) What is their positive and negative impact on human well-being? 4) How do mammals thrive in human-modified landscapes? 5) What is the future of mammals in the state? The state of Sao Paulo holds 255 species of native mammals, with four endemic species, two of them globally endangered. At least six species (two marsupials, Giant otter, Pampas deer, Brazilian dwarf brocket deer, and Giant armadillo) were extirpated from the state due to hunting and habitat loss. The intense human land use in the state forced many mammalian species to change their diet to cope with the intense fragmentation and agriculture. Large-scale monoculture has facilitated the invasion of exotic species such as wild boars (javali) and the European hare. Several "savanna-dwelling" species are expanding their ranges (Maned wolf, Bracket deer) over deforested areas and probably reflect changes towards a drier climate. Because the state has the largest road system, about 40,000 mammals from 33 species are killed per year in collisions causing an economic loss of 12 million dollars/year. The diversity of mammals is concentrated in the largest forest remnants of Serra do Mar and in the interior of the State, mainly in the regions of Ribeirao Preto and Jundiai. Sampling gaps are concentrated throughout the interior of the state, particularly in the northwest region. Wild mammals play a fundamental role in many ecosystem services, but they can also be a concern in bringing new emergent diseases to humans. Although the taxonomy of mammals seems to be well known, we show that new species are continuously being discovered in the state. Therefore, continuous surveys using traditional and new technologies (eDNA, iDNA, drones), long-term population monitoring, investigation of the interface of human-wildlife conflict, and understanding of the unique ecosystem role played by mammals are future avenues for promoting sustainable green landscapes allied to human well-being in the state. The planting of forest or savanna corridors, particularly along with major river systems, in the plateau, controlling illegal hunting in the coastal areas, managing fire regimes in the Cerrado, and mitigating roadkill must be prioritized to protect this outstanding mammal diversity.

TI  - The productivity, allocation and cycling of carbon in forests at the dry margin of the Amazon forest in Bolivia
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The dry transitional forests of the southern Amazonia have received little attention from a carbon cycling and ecosystem function perspective, yet they represent ecosystems that may be impacted by global climate change in the future.Aims: To compare the full carbon cycle for two 1-ha forest plots that straddle the ecotone between humid forest and dry forest in Amazonia, ca. 100 km from Santa Cruz, Bolivia.Methods: 2.5 years of measurements of the components of net primary production (NPP) and autotrophic respiration were collected.Results: Total NPP was 15.5 +/- 0.89 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) at the humid site and 11.27 +/- 0.68 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) at the dry site; a total Gross Primary Production (GPP) of 34.14 +/- 2.92 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) and 26.88 +/- 2.70 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) at the two sites. Carbon use efficiency for both sites was higher than reported for other Amazonian forests (0.45 +/- 0.05 and 0.42 +/- 0.05).Conclusions: Drier soil conditions selected for the dry deciduous tree species which had higher leaf photosynthesis and total GPP. NPP allocation patterns were similar at the two sites, suggesting that in terms of carbon allocation, the dry forests of the southern Amazonia behave as a scaled-down version of wetter humid forests.

TI  - Mitigation of yield-scaled greenhouse gas emissions in subtropical paddy rice under alternative irrigation systems
T2  - NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood irrigated rice accounts for 20 % of all agricultural methane (CH4) emissions in Southern Brazil. In this study, the potential of intermittent irrigation regimes [viz., intermittent irrigation (II), sparse intermittent irrigation (SII) and frequent intermittent irrigation (FII)] for mitigating yield-scaled CH4 and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions was evaluated in relation to continuous flood irrigation (CF) in the subtropical region of Brazil. Irrigation regimes were evaluated for two growing seasons (GS's), where II was evaluated in GS-1 and SII and FII in GS-2. In relation to CF, the intermittent irrigation reduced season CH4 emissions by 47 % in GS-1 and 85 and 71 % for SII and FII in GS-2, respectively. Although the intermittent irrigation significantly increased N2O emissions, they reduced the partial global warming potential (pGWP = CH4 x 25 + N2O x 298) by 37 % (GS-1) and 70 % (GS-2) with respect to CF. For each day without a standing water layer on the soil surface, pGWP was reduced linearly by 249 kg CO2-eq ha(-1). Considering the water regimes did not affect rice yield (mean of 11,910 kg ha(-1) for GS-1 and 10,638 kg ha(-1) for GS-2), the intermittent irrigation regimes led to significantly lower yield-scaled pGWP values (0.19-0.57 kg CO2-eq kg(-1) grain) compared to CF (0.8 kg CO2-eq kg(-1) grain on average with GS-1 and GS-2). Our results show that intermittent irrigation provides an effective strategy for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from irrigated subtropical Brazilian rice systems, without any negative impact on rice productivity.

TI  - Response of soil organic carbon to land-use change in central Brazil: a large-scale comparison of Ferralsols and Acrisols
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - The southeastern part of the Amazon region is one of the largest agricultural frontiers in the world, leading to extensive land-use change. This paper provides evidence for the impacts of land-use change on soil organic carbon (OC) stocks along a large scale for Ferralsols and Acrisols including subsoil.We took soil samples to 100 cm depth for native vegetation, pasture and crop-field along a 1000 km agricultural transect in central Brazil to determine OC stocks and, by using a stable isotope approach, losses of forest-derived OC.At the scale of individual plots, soil OC stocks indicate a highly heterogeneous response to land-use change (e.g. in Ferralsols in 0-30 cm from -45 % to +57 % Mg OC ha(-1) after conversion to pasture), but relatively minor responses when considering the complete transect (i.e. no significant OC changes for similar land-use type). Acrisols evidenced a slower decline of forest-derived OC and simultaneously a faster accumulation of pasture-derived OC than Ferralsols. Surprisingly, the impact of land-use change was more pronounced in the subsoil.Our results emphasize the role of subsoils on carbon cycling which has been previously underestimated, but may also raise doubts whether OC stocks in soil is an appropriate parameter to assess the impacts of land-use conversion on climate change.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variability of macrophyte cover and productivity in the eastern Amazon floodplain: A remote sensing approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Herbaceous aquatic macrophytes cover extensive areas on the floodplains of the Amazon basin and are an important habitat and input of organic carbon. These communities have large intra- and inter-annual variability, and characterization of this variability is necessary to quantify the role of macrophytes in the ecology and biogeochemistry of the floodplain. A novel approach for mapping the temporal evolution of aquatic vegetation in the Amazon floodplain, which could be adapted to other spatially and temporally changing environments, is presented Macrophyte cover varied seasonally and Inter-annually, ranging between 104 and 198 km(2) for the floodplain examined (total area, 984 km(2)). The observed evolution of plant distribution indicated a spatial and temporal partition of macrophyte communities into short-lived and annual groups. A simulation of macrophyte net primary production (NPP) based on the mapping results indicated that at least 3% of NPP could be attributed to the short-lived communities. The present results suggest that significant changes in the macrophyte's contribution to carbon cycling in the Amazon floodplain could occur as a result of the predicted increase in frequency of drought years for the Amazon system due to climate change.

TI  - Active methane processing microbes and the disproportionate role of NC10 phylum in methane mitigation in Amazonian floodplains
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Here we use a top-down and bottom-up approach in landscape ecology to analyze the active microbes processing methane fluxes (FCH4) in seasonally flooded-forest (FOR) and -traditional farming systems (TFS) in Amazonian floodplains flooded with black, white, and clear water. Our results revealed higher CH4 emissions from water-atmosphere interface in clear water floodplain, followed by black and white water floodplain, respectively. Active methanogenic and methanotrophic taxa were ubiquitous at 0-15 and 15-30 cm soil layer in FOR and TFS, with differences among the water types with respect to the richness, evenness and diversity of the methanogenic communities. These ecological results were not generalizable regarding to FOR and TFS sites, soil layers, and non-flooded and flooded periods. Despite the predominant oxidation of CH4 in the non-flooded period, higher richness and diversity of methanotrophs were revealed for FOR and TFS in the flooded period. In turn, the structure of the methanogenic and methanotrophic communities and their variation were influenced mainly by soil physicochemical factors, water type, soil depth and the presence of nitrifiers, as Nitrososphaera and Nitrospira. Our study reveals a signature across methanotrophic communities in soils from Amazon floodplain with different water types, with a putative disproportionate role of NC10 phylum in CH4 mitigation in natural and agricultural Amazonian floodplains. These findings open the possibilities to explore the role of NC10 phylum in the carbon cycling in Amazon.

TI  - A model analysis of N and P limitation on carbon accumulation in Amazonian secondary forest after alternate land-use abandonment
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Productivity and carbon (C) storage in many mature tropical forests are considered phosphorus (P) limited because of advanced soil weathering. However, disturbance can shift limitation away from P and toward nitrogen (N) because of disproportionately large N losses associated with its mobility relative to P in ecosystems. This shift was illustrated by model analyses in which large disturbances including timber extraction and slash-burn were simulated in a P-limited tropical forest. Re-accumulation of ecosystem C during secondary forest growth was initially N-limited, but long term limitation reverted to P. Mechanisms controlling shifts between N and P limitation included: (1) N volatility during slash combustion produced ash that increased soil solution P more than N, (2) a wide N: P ratio in residual fuel and belowground necromass relative to soil organic matter (SOM) N: P produced a simultaneous P sink and N source during decomposition, (3) a supplemental ( to aerosol deposition) external N source via biological N fixation. Redistribution of N and P from low C: nutrient SOM to high C: nutrient vegetation was the most important factor contributing to the resilience of ecosystem C accumulation during secondary growth. Resilience was diminished when multiple harvest and re-growth cycles depleted SOM. Phosphorus losses in particular resulted in long-term reductions of C storage capacity because of slow re-supply rates via deposition and the absence of other external sources. Sensitivity analyses limiting the depth of microbially active SOM in soil profiles further illustrated the importance of elements stored in SOM to ecosystem resilience, pointing to a need for better knowledge on the functioning of deeply buried SOM.

TI  - Volcanic Ash, Insecurity for the People but Securing Fertile Soil for the Future
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Volcanic eruptions affect land and humans globally. When a volcano erupts, tons of volcanic ash materials are ejected to the atmosphere and deposited on land. The hazard posed by volcanic ash is not limited to the area in proximity to the volcano, but can also affect a vast area. Ashes ejected from volcano's affect people's daily life and disrupts agricultural activities and damages crops. However, the positive outcome of this natural event is that it secures fertile soil for the future. This paper examines volcanic ash (tephra) from a soil security view-point, mainly its capability. This paper reviews the positive aspects of volcanic ash, which has a high capability to supply nutrients to plant, and can also sequester a large amount of carbon out of the atmosphere. We report some studies around the world, which evaluated soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation since volcanic eruptions. The mechanisms of SOC protection in volcanic ash soil include organo-metallic complexes, chemical protection, and physical protection. Two case studies of volcanic ash from Mt. Talang and Sinabung in Sumatra, Indonesia showed the rapid accumulation of SOC through lichens and vascular plants. Volcanic ash plays an important role in the global carbon cycle and ensures soil security in volcanic regions of the world in terms of boosting its capability. However, there is also a human dimension, which does not go well with volcanic ash. Volcanic ash can severely destroy agricultural areas and farmers' livelihoods. Connectivity and codification needs to ensure farming in the area to take into account of risk and build appropriate adaptation and resilient strategy.

TI  - Oxidative mitigation of aquatic methane emissions in large Amazonian rivers
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The flux of methane (CH4) from inland waters to the atmosphere has a profound impact on global atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) levels, and yet, strikingly little is known about the dynamics controlling sources and sinks of CH4 in the aquatic setting. Here, we examine the cycling and flux of CH4 in six large rivers in the Amazon basin, including the Amazon River. Based on stable isotopic mass balances of CH4, inputs and outputs to the water column were estimated. We determined that ecosystem methane oxidation (MOX) reduced the diffusive flux of CH4 by approximately 28-96% and varied depending on hydrologic regime and general geochemical characteristics of tributaries of the Amazon River. For example, the relative amount of MOX was maximal during high water in black and white water rivers and minimal in clear water rivers during low water. The abundance of genetic markers for methane-oxidizing bacteria (pmoA) was positively correlated with enhanced signals of oxidation, providing independent support for the detected MOX patterns. The results indicate that MOX in large Amazonian rivers can consume from 0.45 to 2.07 Tg CH4 yr(-1), representing up to 7% of the estimated global soil sink. Nevertheless, climate change and changes in hydrology, for example, due to construction of dams, can alter this balance, influencing CH4 emissions to atmosphere.

TI  - The function of the superficial root mat in the biogeochemical cycles of nutrients in Congolese Eucalyptus plantations
T2  - ANNALS OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Aims The importance of superficial root mats inside the forest floor for the nutrition of Amazonian rain forests has been extensively investigated. The present study was aimed at assessing the function of a root mat adherent to decomposing organic material observed in Eucalyptus plantations.Methods The development of the root mat was studied through micromorphological observations of thin litter sections, and the influence of soil microtopography and soil water repellency on root mat biomass was assessed in situ on an area of 5 m(2). In addition, input-output budgets of nutrients within the forest floor were established from measurements of litterfall, dissolved nutrients in gravitational solutions, and forest floor nutrient contents.Key Findings The amounts of nutrients released during litter decay in this ecosystem during the period of study were, on average, 46, 3, 4, 19 and 17 kg ha(-1) year(-1) for N, P, K, Ca and Mg, respectively. The simultaneous measurements of the chemical composition of throughfall solutions and leachates beneath the forest floor showed a very quick uptake of nutrients by the root mat during the decomposition processes. Indeed, the solutions did not become noticeably enriched in nutrients during their passage through the holorganic layer, despite large amounts of elements being released during litter decay. The root mat biomass decreased significantly during the dry season, and a preferential development in microdepressions at the soil surface was observed. A strong water repellency observed in these depressions might enhance the ability of the roots to take up water and nutrients during the dry periods.Conclusions The root mat was active throughout the year to catch the flux of nutrients from the biodegradation of the forest floor, preventing the transfer of dissolved nutrients toward deeper soil horizons. This mechanism is involved in the successful adaptation of this Eucalyptus hybrid in areas covered by 'climacic' savannas in Congo. (C) 2004 Annals of Botany Company.

T2  - PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial and early Holocene-age sediments from lakes on Mt. Kenya have documented strong responses of montane hydrology, ecosystems, and carbon cycling to past changes in temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. However, little is known about climate and ecosystem variations on Mt. Kenya during the Common Era (the past similar to 2000 years), despite mounting evidence for significant climate changes in the East African lowlands during the past millennium and recent observations of alpine glacier retreat in the East African highlands. We present a new, high-resolution record of the hydrogen and carbon isotopic composition of terrestrial plant wax compounds (delta D-wax, delta C-13(wax)) preserved in the sediments of Sacred Lake from 200C.E. to the end of the 20th century. We find that Mt. Kenya's climate was highly variable during the past 1800 years. Droughts at Sacred Lake around similar to 200C.E., 700C.E., and 1100C.E. align with similar droughts in central Kenya and Uganda/Congo, indicating that failures of both the Indian and Atlantic monsoons caused widespread drought throughout equatorial East Africa during the early Common Era. In contrast, dry and wet periods at Sacred lake during the past 500 years show meridional and zonal contrasts with other sites in East Africa, suggesting strong spatial heterogeneity, possibly due to independent waxing and waning of the Atlantic and Indian monsoons. Pronounced drying after similar to 1870C.E. suggests that the current dry phase observed at Sacred Lake may have begun prior to the 20th century, around the time when the retreat of Mt. Kenya's glaciers was first observed by European explorers. Mt. Kenya's vegetation responded strongly to these recent climate changes, highlighting the particular sensitivity of tropical montane climate and ecosystems to regional and global climate patterns, and underscoring the critical need to understand potential impacts of future climate change scenarios on this highly sensitive region.

TI  - Shifts in functional traits and interactions patterns of soil methane-cycling communities following forest-to-pasture conversion in the Amazon Basin
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation threatens the integrity of the Amazon biome and the ecosystem services it provides, including greenhouse gas mitigation. Forest-to-pasture conversion has been shown to alter the flux of methane gas (CH4) in Amazonian soils, driving a switch from acting as a sink to a source of atmospheric CH4. This study aimed to better understand this phenomenon by investigating soil microbial metagenomes, focusing on the taxonomic and functional structure of methane-cycling communities. Metagenomic data from forest and pasture soils were combined with measurements of in situ CH4 fluxes and soil edaphic factors and analysed using multivariate statistical approaches. We found a significantly higher abundance and diversity of methanogens in pasture soils. As inferred by co-occurrence networks, these microorganisms seem to be less interconnected within the soil microbiota in pasture soils. Metabolic traits were also different between land uses, with increased hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic pathways of methanogenesis in pasture soils. Land-use change also induced shifts in taxonomic and functional traits of methanotrophs, with bacteria harbouring genes encoding the soluble form of methane monooxygenase enzyme (sMMO) depleted in pasture soils. Redundancy analysis and multimodel inference revealed that the shift in methane-cycling communities was associated with high pH, organic matter, soil porosity and micronutrients in pasture soils. These results comprehensively characterize the effect of forest-to-pasture conversion on the microbial communities driving the methane-cycling microorganisms in the Amazon rainforest, which will contribute to the efforts to preserve this important biome.

TI  - Amazonia and the modern carbon cycle: lessons learned
T2  - OECOLOGIA
M3  - Review
AB  - In this paper, we review some critical issues regarding carbon cycling in Amazonia, as revealed by several studies conducted in the Large Scale Biosphere Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA). We evaluate both the contribution of this magnificent biome for the global net primary productivity/net ecosystem exchange (NPP/NEE) and the feedbacks of climate change on the dynamics of Amazonia. In order to place Amazonia in a global perspective and make the carbon flux obtained through the LBA project comparable with global carbon budgets, we extrapolated NPP/NEE values found by LBA studies to the entire area of the Brazilian Amazon covered by rainforest. The carbon emissions due to land use changes for the tropical regions of the world produced values from 0.96 to 12.4 Pg C year(-1), while atmospheric CO2 inversion models have recently indicated that tropical lands in the Americas could be exchanging a net 0.62 +/- 1.15 Pg C year(-1) with the atmosphere. The difference calculated from these two methods would imply a local sink of approximately 1.6-1.7 Pg C year(-1), or a source of 0.85 ton C ha(-1) year(-1). Using our crude extrapolation of LBA values for the Amazon forests (5 million km(2)) we estimate a range for the C flux in the region of -3.0 to 0.75 Pg C year(-1). The exercise here does not account for environmental variability across the region, but it is an important driver for present and future studies linking local process (i.e. nutrient availability, photosynthetic capacity, and so forth) to global and regional dynamic approaches.

TI  - African tropical rainforest net carbon dioxide fluxes in the twentieth century
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The African humid tropical biome constitutes the second largest rainforest region, significantly impacts global carbon cycling and climate, and has undergone major changes in functioning owing to climate and land-use change over the past century. We assess changes and trends in CO2 fluxes from 1901 to 2010 using nine land surface models forced with common driving data, and depict the inter-model variability as the uncertainty in fluxes. The biome is estimated to be a natural (no disturbance) net carbon sink (-0.02 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) or -0.04 Pg C yr(-1), p < 0.05) with increasing strength fourfold in the second half of the century. The models were in close agreement on net CO2 flux at the beginning of the century (sigma 1901 = 0.02 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)), but diverged exponentially throughout the century (sigma 2010 = 0.03 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)). The increasing uncertainty is due to differences in sensitivity to increasing atmospheric CO2, but not increasing water stress, despite a decrease in precipitation and increase in air temperature. However, the largest uncertainties were associated with the most extreme drought events of the century. These results highlight the need to constrain modelled CO2 fluxes with increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and extreme climatic events, as the uncertainties will only amplify in the next century.

TI  - Effects of Coffee arabica cultivation systems on tropical soil microbial biomass and activity in the northeast region of Brazil
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Microbial biomass (MB) is an important indicator of soil quality, being responsive to changes resulting from soil management and use. Although there are studies that evaluate changes in soil microbiological attributes in coffee growing systems, the effects of these systems on MB and its relationship with other soil attributes have rarely been investigated, especially in tropical climate conditions at altitude. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of different coffee growing systems on biomass and microbial activity and how these responses relate to other soil and litter attributes. Our study was carried out in soils under three Coffea arabica cultivation systems (CCM-monoculture, CCB-consortium with banana, AFS-agroforestry system with Grevillea robusta) and under native forest (NF). Soil samples were collected at a depth of 0-10 cm and subjected to analysis to determine the microbial biomass carbon content (MB-C) by the fumigation-extraction method, accumulated respiration through released CO2, soil organic carbon (SOC) and labile carbon by wet oxidation. There was a 45% reduction in SOC in coffee growing systems and a 75% reduction in MB-C in CCM compared to NF. The AFS is closer to native forest conditions due to its positive influence on the SOC content and the efficiency of converting this carbon into microbial carbon. The presence of the forestry component is positive and should be encouraged to mitigate the impacts of coffee growing on the soil.

TI  - Variability in mean size of phytoplankton in two floodplain lakes of different climatic regions
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton size has an important functional role in ecosystem processes, such as nutrient production and cycling. It has been suggested that warmer temperatures may favor the smaller organisms in biological communities. We evaluate the mean size of the phytoplankton organisms and apply a morphology-based functional groups (MBFG) approach. We use time series of two floodplain lakes that present mean annual temperature difference of 10A degrees C and similar hydrodynamic, area, and mean depth. We expected that a smaller mean size of MBFGs would be associated with higher temperatures. The Akaike Information Criterion was used to investigate environmental factors predicting the mean size of MBFGs within each lake. The mean size was most associated to nutrients and dissolved oxygen in the subtropical lake, and to temperature in the temperate lake. Large filaments with aerotopes and the small flagellated with siliceous exoskeletal structures showed high mean size at higher temperatures, thus contradicting temperature-size rules. Probably the high variability of mean size was provided by the high variability observed around environmental factors. Our findings reveal that other functional traits may be associated with the phytoplankters mean size, which result in adaptation to high variability of various environmental factors.

T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The impact of fire on carbon cycling in tropical forests is potentially large, but remains poorly quantified, particularly in the locality of the transition forests that mark the boundaries between humid forests and savannas.Aims: To present the first comprehensive description of the impact of repeated low intensity, understorey fire on carbon cycling in a semi-deciduous, seasonally dry tropical forest on infertile soil in south-eastern Amazonia.Methods: We compared an annually burnt forest plot with a control plot over a three-year period (2009-2011). For each plot we quantified the components of net primary productivity (NPP), autotrophic (R-a) and heterotrophic respiration (R-h), and estimated total plant carbon expenditure (PCE, the sum of NPP and R-a) and carbon-use efficiency (CUE, the quotient of NPP/PCE).Results: Total NPP and R-a were 15 and 4% lower on the burnt plot than on the control, respectively. Both plots were characterised by a slightly higher CUE of 0.36-0.39, compared to evergreen lowland Amazon forests.Conclusions: These measurements provide the first evidence of a distinctive pattern of carbon cycling within this transitional forest. Overall, regular understorey fire is shown to have little impact on ecosystem-level carbon fluxes.

TI  - Impacts of fire on sources of soil CO2 efflux in a dry Amazon rain forest
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire at the dry southern margin of the Amazon rainforest could have major consequences for regional soil carbon (C) storage and ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, but relatively little information exists about impacts of fire on soil C cycling within this sensitive ecotone. We measured CO2 effluxes from different soil components (ground surface litter, roots, mycorrhizae, soil organic matter) at a large-scale burn experiment designed to simulate a severe but realistic potential future scenario for the region (Fire plot) in Mato Grosso, Brazil, over 1year, and compared these measurements to replicated data from a nearby, unmodified Control plot. After four burns over 5 years, soil CO2 efflux (R-s) was similar to 5.5 t C ha(-1) year(-1) lower on the Fire plot compared to the Control. Most of the Fire plot R-s reduction was specifically due to lower ground surface litter and root respiration. Mycorrhizal respiration on both plots was around similar to 20% of R-s. Soil surface temperature appeared to be more important than moisture as a driver of seasonal patterns in R-s at the site. Regular fire events decreased the seasonality of R-s at the study site, due to apparent differences in environmental sensitivities among biotic and abiotic soil components. These findings may contribute toward improved predictions of the amount and temporal pattern of C emissions across the large areas of tropical forest facing increasing fire disturbances associated with climate change and human activities.

TI  - Changes in soil C and N distribution assessed by natural δ<SUP>13</SUP>C and δ<SUP>15</SUP>N abundance in a chronosequence of sugarcane crops managed with pre-harvest burning in a Cerrado area of Goias, Brazil
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Pre-harvest sugarcane straw burning affects the dynamics of soil chemistry and delta C-13 and delta N-15 abundance, but further studies are needed to understand the long-term effects of this practice on the degradation of chemical attributes of soil and sugarcane production. The present study evaluates chemical modifications of soil and natural delta C-13 and delta N-15 abundance in sugarcane crops managed with pre-harvest straw burning for I, 5,10 and 20 years. For comparison purposes, soil covered with natural Cerrado vegetation and forage grass (pasture) were also evaluated. After chemical characterization of the areas studied, according to Embrapa (1997) total organic carbon (TOC), bulk density (Bd) and natural delta N-15 and delta C-13 abundance were determined in soil samples, and carbon stocks calculated from TOC values. In general, the pasture area had the highest delta C-13 and delta N-15 content, the Cerrado vegetation area had the lowest values for these elements and sugarcane crops exhibited intermediary levels. Areas subjected to sugarcane field burning for a shorter period had the highest Ca and Mg and lowest P and K content. Sugarcane crops managed with straw burning for 1 and 5 years produced lower carbon stocks in the top soil layer (0-10 cm) than sugarcane crops with 10 and 20 years, pasture and Cerrado areas. The replacement of natural Cerrado vegetation by sugarcane crops changed delta C-13 profile, likely because sugarcane is a C-4 plant, which has a specific carbon accumulation pattern. Areas cropped with sugarcane for 1, 10 and 20 years and subjected to different types of soil use after replacement of the original Cerrado vegetation had the highest delta N-15 values, indicating accelerated mineralization of soil organic matter.

TI  - Phosphorus fractionation in a sandy soil under organic agriculture in Northeastern Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - This work aimed to evaluate the impacts of the organic fertilization and the use of green manure (GrM) on the different soil P fractions in areas under organic agriculture in the municipality of Ubajara, state of Cearg, Brazil. The work was carried out in an organically cultivated farm situated in the Ubajara municipality, state of Cearg, Brazil. Soil samples of a sandy soil were collected at the 0- to 5, 5- to 10-, 10- to 20-, 20- to 40- and 40- to 50-cm layers in areas of Caribbean cherry with (+) and without (-) previous incorporation of GrM in the rows (+GrM(r) and -GrM(r)) and between-rows (+GrM(b-row) and -GrM(b-row)). Area under natural vegetation (NV) was also sampled and considered as reference. P fractionation was performed by using a sequential extraction scheme adapted from Hedley. The cultivated systems presented higher P contents than NV, mainly in the most labile P pool (res-Pi+NaHCO3-P), indicating that organic management favoured greater P cycling of this fraction. In the cultivated areas labile P pool accounted for 20,17, 21 and 27% of sum of soil total P in the -GrM(D) -GrM(b-row) +GrM(r) and +GrM(b-row) respectively. There was an increment of 86% in the organic P pool in the organically cultivated areas in relation to the NV. The organic management promoted an increase on the available-P forms by avoiding and/or decreasing the rate of transformation of the Pi in more stable P forms, enhancing the P cycling. The use of green manure promoted increase on the most labile P pool (Resin-P + NaHCO3-P) and seems to contribute to the P incorporation into biological cycle. On the other hand, the risks of P losses in the organically managed areas should be considered and suggest a scientific remark to farmers for a better management of organic farming in sandy soils.

TI  - Nitrogen cycle and ecosystem services in the Brazilian La Plata Basin: anthropogenic influence and climate change
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing human demand for food, raw material and energy has radically modified both the landscape and biogeochemical cycles in many river basins in the world. The interference of human activities on the Biosphere is so significant that it has doubled the amount of reactive nitrogen due to industrial fertiliser production (Haber-Bosch), fossil fuel burning and land-use change over the last century. In this context, the Brazilian La Plata Basin contributes to the alteration of the nitrogen cycle in South America because of its huge agricultural and grazing area that meets the demands of its large urban centres - Sao Paulo, for instance - and also external markets abroad. In this paper, we estimate the current inputs and outputs of anthropogenic nitrogen (in kg N.km(-2).yr(-1)) in the basin. In the results, we observe that soybean plays a very important role in the Brazilian La Plata, since it contributes with an annual entrance of about 1.8 TgN due to biological nitrogen fixation. Moreover, our estimate indicates that the export of soybean products accounts for roughly 1.0 TgN which is greater than the annual nitrogen riverine exports from Brazilian Parana, Paraguay and Uruguay rivers together. Complimentarily, we built future scenarios representing changes in the nitrogen cycle profile considering two scenarios of climate change for 2070-2100 (based on IPCC's A2 and B2) that will affect land-use, nitrogen inputs, and loss of such nutrients in the basin. Finally, we discuss how both scenarios will affect human well-being since there is a connection between nitrogen cycle and ecosystem services that affect local and global populations, such as food and fibre production and climate regulation.

TI  - High Spatial Resolution Visual Band Imagery Outperforms Medium Resolution Spectral Imagery for Ecosystem Assessment in the Semi-Arid Brazilian Sertao
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Semi-arid ecosystems play a key role in global agricultural production, seasonal carbon cycle dynamics, and longer-run climate change. Because semi-arid landscapes are heterogeneous and often sparsely vegetated, repeated and large-scale ecosystem assessments of these regions have to date been impossible. Here, we assess the potential of high-spatial resolution visible band imagery for semi-arid ecosystem mapping. We use WorldView satellite imagery at 0.3-0.5 m resolution to develop a reference data set of nearly 10,000 labeled examples of three classes-trees, shrubs/grasses, and bare land-across 1000 km(2) of the semi-arid Sertao region of northeast Brazil. Using Google Earth Engine, we show that classification with low-spectral but high-spatial resolution input (WorldView) outperforms classification with the full spectral information available from Landsat 30 m resolution imagery as input. Classification with high spatial resolution input improves detection of sparse vegetation and distinction between trees and seasonal shrubs and grasses, two features which are lost at coarser spatial (but higher spectral) resolution input. Our total tree cover estimates for the study area disagree with recent estimates using other methods that may underestimate treecover because they confuse trees with seasonal vegetation (shrubs and grasses). This distinction is important for monitoring seasonal and long-run carbon cycle and ecosystem health. Our results suggest that newer remote sensing products that promise high frequency global coverage at high spatial but lower spectral resolution may offer new possibilities for direct monitoring of the world's semi-arid ecosystems, and we provide methods that could be scaled to do so.

TI  - Mapping data gaps to estimate biomass across Brazilian Amazon forests
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Tropical forests play a fundamental role in the provision of diverse ecosystem services, such as biodiversity, climate and air quality regulation, freshwater provision, carbon cycling, agricultural support and culture. To understand the role of forests in the carbon balance, aboveground biomass (AGB) estimates are needed. Given the importance of Brazilian tropical forests, there is an urgent need to improve AGB estimates to support the Brazilian commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Many AGB maps and datasets exist, varying in availability, scale and coverage. Thus, stakeholders, policy makers and scientists must decide which AGB product, dataset or combination of data to use for their particular goals. In this study, we assessed the gaps in the spatial AGB data across the Brazilian Amazon forests not only to orient the decision makers about the data that are currently available but also to provide a guide for future initiatives. Results We obtained a map of the gaps in the forest AGB spatial data for the Brazilian Amazon using statistics and differences between AGB maps and a spatial multicriteria evaluation that considered the current AGB datasets. The AGB spatial data gap map represents areas with good coverage of AGB data and, consequently, the main gaps or priority areas where further biomass assessments should focus, including the northeast of Amazon State, Amapa and northeast of Para. Additionally, by quantifying the variability in both the AGB maps and field data on multiple environmental factors, we provide valuable elements for understanding the current AGB data as a function of climate, soil, vegetation and geomorphology. Conclusions The map of AGB data gaps could become a useful tool for policy makers and different stakeholders working on National Communications, Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+), or carbon emissions modeling to prioritize places to implement further AGB assessments. Only 0.2% of the Amazon biome forest is sampled, and extensive effort is necessary to improve what we know about the tropical forest.

TI  - The impact of climate change and climate extremes on sugarcane production
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sugarcane production supports the livelihoods of millions of small-scale farmers in developing countries, and the bioenergy needs of millions of consumers. Yet, future sugarcane yields remain uncertain due to differences in climate projections, and because the sensitivity of sugarcane ecophysiology to individual climate drivers (i.e. temperature, precipitation, shortwave radiation, VPD and CO2) and their interactions is largely unresolved. Here we ask: how sensitive is sugarcane yield to future climate change, including climate extremes, and what are its key climate drivers? We combine the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere model with detailed time-series measurements from experimental plots in Guangxi, China, and Sao Paulo State, Brazil. We first calibrated and validated modelled carbon and water cycling against field flux and biometric data. Second, we simulated sugarcane growth under the historical climate (1980-2018), and six future climate projections (2015-2100). We computed the 'yield-effect' of each climate driver by generating synthetic climate forcings in which the driver time series was alternated to that of the historical median. In Guangxi, median yield and yield lows (i.e. lower decile) were relatively insensitive to forecast climate change. In Sao Paulo, median yield and yield lows decreased under all future climates projections (x over bar = -4% and -12% respectively). At Guangxi, where moisture stress was low, radiation was the principal driver of yield variability (yield-effect x over bar = -1.2%). Conversely, high moisture stress at Sao Paulo raised yield sensitivity to temperature (yield-effect x over bar = -7.9%). In contrast, a number of other modelling studies report a positive effect of increased temperatures on sugarcane yield. We ascribe the disparity between model predictions to the representation of key phenological processes, including the link between leaf ageing and thermal time, and the role of ageing in driving leaf senescence. We highlight climate sensitivity of phenological processes as a key focus for future research efforts.

TI  - Effect of interannual climate variability on carbon storage in Amazonian ecosystems
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon Basin contains almost one-half of the world's undisturbed tropical evergreen forest as well as large areas of tropical savanna(1,2). The forests account for about 10 per cent of the world's terrestrial primary productivity and for a similar fraction of the carbon stored in land ecosystems(2,3), and short-term held measurements' suggest that these ecosystems are globally important carbon sinks. But tropical land ecosystems have experienced substantial interannual climate variability owing to frequent El Nino episodes in recent decades(5). Of particular importance to climate change policy is how such climate variations, coupled with increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration, affect terrestrial carbon storage(6-8). Previous model analyses have demonstrated the importance of temperature in controlling carbon storage(9,10). Here we use a transient process-based biogeochemical model of terrestrial ecosystems(3,11) to investigate interannual variations of carbon storage in undisturbed Amazonian ecosystems in response to climate variability and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration during the period 1980 to 1994. In El Nino years, which bring hot, dry weather to much of the Amazon region, the ecosystems act as a source of carbon to the atmosphere (up to 0.2 petagrams of carbon in 1987 and 1992). In other years, these ecosystems act as a carbon sink (up to 0.7 Pg C in 1981 and 1993). These fluxes are large; they compare to a 0.3 Pg C per year source to the atmosphere associated with deforestation in the Amazon Basin in the early 1990s(12). Soil moisture, which is affected by both precipitation and temperature, and which affects both plant and soil processes, appears to be an important central on carbon storage.

TI  - Responses of aquatic macrophyte cover and productivity to flooding variability on the Amazon floodplain
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Macrophyte net primary productivity (NPP) is a significant but understudied component of the carbon budget in large Amazonian floodplains. Annual NPP is determined by the interaction between stem elongation (vertical growth) and plant cover changes (horizontal expansion), each affected differently by flood duration and amplitude. Therefore, hydrological changes as predicted for the Amazon basin could result in significant changes in annual macrophyte NPP. This study investigates the responses of macrophyte horizontal expansion and vertical growth to flooding variability, and its possible effects on the contribution of macrophytes to the carbon budget of Amazonian floodplains. Monthly macrophyte cover was estimated using satellite imagery for the 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 hydrological years, and biomass was measured in situ between 2003 and 2004. Regression models between macrophyte variables and river-stage data were used to build a semiempirical model of macrophyte NPP as a function of water level. Historical river-stage records (1970-2011) were used to simulate variations in NPP, as a function of annual flooding. Vertical growth varied by a factor of ca. 2 over the simulated years, whereas minimum and maximum annual cover varied by ca. 3.5 and 1.5, respectively. Results suggest that these processes act in opposite directions to determine macrophyte NPP, with larger sensitivity to changes in vertical growth, and thus maximum flooding levels. Years with uncommonly large flooding amplitude resulted in the highest NPP values, as both horizontal expansion and vertical growth were enhanced under these conditions. Over the simulated period, annual NPP varied by ca. 1.5 (1.06-1.63 TgCyr(-1)). A small increasing trend in flooding amplitude, and by extension NPP, was observed for the studied period. Variability in growth rates caused by local biotic and abiotic factors, and the lack of knowledge on macrophyte physiological responses to extreme hydrological conditions remain the major sources of uncertainty.

TI  - Impact of forest organic farming change on soil microbial C turnover using <SUP>13</SUP>C of phospholipid fatty acids
T2  - AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Situated in the fast-developing country of Brazil, the Atlantic rainforest Mata AtlA cent ntica faces risks generated by population growth-derived problems. Conversion of forest to agriculture has led to a mosaic landscape with fragments of secondary forest in agricultural land. This disturbance to a naturally well-adapted ecosystem prompts rapid soil degradation. Therefore, here we compared soil C incorporation into soil microorganisms and their turnover in typical land-use systems such as primary forest, secondary forest, and agricultural land at the Atlantic Plateau of So Paulo, Brazil. In C-3 and C-4 plants having different C-13/C-12 compositions, a C-3-C-4 vegetation change was induced using maize, a C-4 plant. We measured the delta C-13 composition of individual phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) because PFLA are specific of typical microbes. Results show that statistical analysis of soil PLFA allow differentiation of four microbial units: (1) Gram-positive bacteria; (2) anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria; (3) fungi, vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and Gram-positive bacteria; and (4) actinomycetes and Gram-positive bacteria. We also found that soil organic matter is cycled for longer time in primary forest ecosystems, of mean turnover time of 28 years, than in agricultural ecosystems with mean turnover time of 4 years for organic farming and 8 years for conventional farming. Calculation of maize-derived carbon of each microbial unit suggested that fungi and vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi dominate microbial activity in primary forest whereas Gram-negative bacteria are prominent in the agricultural sites. To conclude, we found that PLFA profiles are sensitive to land-use conversion, and their compound-specific stable-isotope analysis can strongly discriminate between different managements.

TI  - Modeling canopy conductance under contrasting seasonal conditions for a tropical savanna ecosystem of south central Mato Grosso, Brazil
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Temporal variations in land-atmosphere watervapor exchange are more pronounced in seasonal environments, especially grass-dominated savannas (known as campo sujo Cerrado) of the southern and eastern Amazon Basin. Recent work in campo sujo indicates that rates of canopy conductance (g(c)) were directly and indirectly affected by a variety of meteorological variables, which limited our understanding of how seasonal variation in meteorology affected rates of gc. Thus, our overall objective here is to determine how individual meteorological variables affect seasonal variations in g(c). Estimates of g(c) were derived using the inverted Penman-Monteith equation from hourly eddy-covariance measurements of evapo-transpiration made between March 2011 and December 2013. We employed the so-called Jarvis-type model to estimate g(c), which allows us to specify the functional role of each variable on g(c), to evaluate how variations in meteorology affect rates of Cerrado g(c). The model was parameterized using eddy covariance data from 2012 and tested with data collected in 2011 and 2013. Using orthogonal regression and the Willmott index of agreement, we found that the model estimates compared well to those derived from eddy covariance, especially in 2011. Sensitivity analyses revealed that g(c) was sensitive to warming and drying, particularly during the dry season when drought stress from low soil moisture availability was already limiting g(c). Warming and drying in response to climate change is expected to increase dry season duration, and dry season intensification may already be occurring in central and southern Mato Grosso. Given the high degree of surface-atmosphere coupling for this ecosystem, and the fact that g(c) is an important link between canopy-scale C and water cycling, our data suggest that dry season intensification may further limit CO2 and H2O vapor exchange during the dry season.

TI  - The impact of Indonesian peatland degradation on downstream marine ecosystems and the global carbon cycle
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatlands are among the most space-efficient stores of carbon on Earth containing approximately 89Gt C. Of this, 57Gt (65%) are stored in Indonesian peatlands. Large-scale exploitation of land, including deforestation and drainage for the establishment of oil palm plantations, is changing the carbon balance of Indonesian peatlands, turning them from a natural sink to a source via outgassing of CO2 to the atmosphere and leakage of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the coastal ocean. The impacts of this perturbation to the coastal environment and at the global scale are largely unknown. Here, we evaluate the downstream effects of released Indonesian peat carbon on coastal ecosystems and on the global carbon cycle. We use a biogeochemical box model in combination with novel and literature observations to investigate the impact of different carbon emission scenarios on the combined ocean-atmosphere system. The release of all carbon stored in the Indonesian peat pool, considered as a worst-case scenario, will increase atmospheric pCO(2) by 8ppm to 15ppm within the next 200years. The expected impact on the Java Sea ecosystems is most significant on the short term (over a few hundred years) and is characterized by an increase of 3.3% in phytoplankton, 32% in seagrass biomass, and 5% decrease in coral biomass. On the long term, however, the coastal ecosystems will recover to reach near pre-excursion conditions. Our results suggest that the ultimate fate of the peat carbon is in the deep ocean with 69% of it landing in the deep DIC pool after 1000years, but the effects on the global ocean carbonate chemistry will be marginal.

TI  - Occurrence frequencies and regional variations in Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) global active fires
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Active fires are considered to be the key contributor to, and critical consequence of, climate change. Quantifying the occurrence frequency and regional variations in global active fires is significant for assessing carbon cycling, atmospheric chemistry, and postfire ecological effects. Multiscale variations in fire occurrence frequencies have still never been fully investigated despite free access to global active fire products. We analyzed the occurrence frequencies of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) active fires at national, pan-regional (tropics and extratropics) to global scales and at hourly, monthly, and annual scales during 2012-2017. The results revealed that the accumulated occurrence frequencies of VIIRS global active fires were up to 12,193 x 10(4), yet exhibiting slight fluctuations annually and with respect to the 2014-2016 El Nino event, especially during 2015. About 35.52% of VIIRS active fires occurred from July to September, particularly in August (13.06%), and typically between 10:00 and 13:00 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT; 42.96%) and especially at 11:00 GMT (17.65%). The total counts conform to a bimodal pattern with peaks in 5 degrees-11 degrees N (18.01%) and 5 degrees-18 degrees S (32.46%), respectively, alongside a unimodal distribution in terms of longitudes between 15 degrees E and 30 degrees E (32.34%). Tropical annual average of active fire (1,496.81 x 10(4)) accounted for 75.83%. Nearly 30% were counted in Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Indonesia, and Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA). Fires typically occurred between June (or August) and October (or November) with far below-average rainfall in these countries, while those in MSEA primarily occurred between February and April during the dry season. They were primarily observed between 00:00 and 02:00 GMT, between 12:00 and 14:00 within each Zone Time. We believed that VIIRS global active fires products are useful for developing fire detection algorithms, discriminating occurrence types and ignition causes via correlation analyses with physical geographic elements, and assessment of their potential impacts.

TI  - SOIL MICROBIAL BIOMASS UNDER DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT AND TILLAGE SYSTEMS OF PERMANENT INTERCROPPED COVER SPECIES IN AN ORANGE ORCHARD
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - To mitigate soil erosion and enhance soil fertility in orange plantations, the permanent protection of the inter-rows by cover species has been suggested. The objective of this study was to evaluate alterations in the microbial biomass, due to different soil tillage systems and intercropped cover species between rows of orange trees. The soil of the experimental area previously used as pasture (Brachiaria humidicola) was an Ultisol (Typic Paleudult) originating from Caiua sandstone in the northwestern part of the State of Parana, Brazil. Two soil tillage systems were evaluated: conventional tillage (CT) in the entire area and strip tillage (ST) (strip width 2 m), in combination with different ground cover management systems. The citrus cultivar 'Pera' orange (Citrus sinensis) grafted onto 'Rangpur' lime rootstock was used. Soil samples were collected after five years of treatment from a depth of 0-15 cm, under the tree canopy and in the inter-row, in the following treatments: (1) CT and an annual cover crop with the leguminous species Calopogonium mucunoides; (2) CT and a perennial cover crop with the leguminous peanut Arachis pintoi; (3) CT and an evergreen cover crop with Bahiagrass Paspalum notatum; (4) CT and a cover crop with spontaneous Brachiaria humidicola grass vegetation; and (5) ST and maintenance of the remaining grass (pasture) of Brachiaria humidicola. Soil tillage and the different cover species influenced the microbial biomass, both under the tree canopy and in the inter-row. The cultivation of brachiaria increased C and N in the microbial biomass, while bahiagrass increased P in the microbial biomass. The soil microbial biomass was enriched in N and P by the presence of ground cover species and according to the soil P content. The grass species increased C, N and P in the soil microbial biomass from the inter-row more than leguminous species.

TI  - Impacts on soil nitrogen availability of converting managed pine plantation into switchgrass monoculture for bioenergy
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Biofuels derived from lignocellulosic materials is one of the options in addressing issues on climate change and energy independence. One of the most promising bioenergy crops is switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), particularly in North America. Future advancement in large-scale conversion of lignocellulosic feedstocks and relatively more competitive price for biomass and other economic advantages could lead to landowners opting to venture on switchgrass monoculture (SWITCH) in lieu of loblolly pine monoculture (PINE). Therefore, we investigated the conversion of previously managed loblolly pine stand into SWITCH in eastern North Carolina, USA. on soil N availability.Treatments included PINE, SWITCH , and mature loblolly pine stand (REF). Each treatment was replicated three times on 0.8 ha plots drained by open ditches dug 1.0-1.2 m deep and spaced at 100 m. Rates of net N mineralization (N-m) and nitrification (N-n) at the top 20cm were measured using sequential in-situ techniques in 2011 and 2012 (the 3rd and 4th years of establishment, respectively) along with a one-time laboratory incubation. On average. PINE, SWITCH, and REF can have field net N-m rates up to 0.40. 0.34 and 0.44 mg N . kg soil(-1) . d(-)(1). respectively, and net N-n rates up to 0.14, 0.08 and 0.10 mg N.kg soil(-1). d(-1). respectively. Annually, net N-m rates ranged from 136.98 to 167.21, 62.00 to 142.61, and 63.57 to 127.95 kg N . ha(-1), and net N-n rates were 56.31-62.98, 16.45-30.45, 31.99-32.94 kg N.ha(-1) in PINE, SWITCH, and REF, respectively. Treatment effect was not significant on field N-m rate (p = 0.091). However, SWITCH significantly reduced nitrate-N production (p < 0.01). Overall, results indicated that establishment of SWITCH on poorly drained lands previously under PINE is less likely to significantly impact total soil N availability and potentially has minimum N leaching losses since soil mineral N under this system will be dominated by ammonium-N.

TI  - Land disposal potential of tobacco processing residues
T2  - CIENCIA RURAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil is one of the leaders in the production and trading of tobacco leaves in the global market, which results in a large amount of residues that would be recycled and used as soil fertilizers in agriculture. This research aimed to study the land disposal potential and agricultural use of tobacco processing residues (TPRs), their mineralization and the nutrient supply to the plants. The study was carried out in an open area using pots with 32dm(3) of a sandy soil (Paleudult), provided with water drainage collectors and tilled with three corn plants each. Eighteen treatments were tested with mineral fertilization, poultry manure (PM), earthworm compost (EC) and increasing rates (0, 7.5, 15, 30 e 60t ha(-1)) of TPR D (dust) and TPR S (stem fibers). Treatments with TPRs (15t ha(-1)) plus mineral supplementation two by two (NP, NK and PK) were also tested, with four replications each. The experiment started in 01/15/2004 and conducted until 03/16/2004, when corn plants were harvested. The response curves showed that the residues application rates between 15 and 20t ha(-1) are most adequate for the studied soil. The results indicated that both TPRs may be important sources of biomass and potash and have potential to be recycled in the soil, supplying part of the macronutrients required for proper plant growth.

TI  - Proteomic analysis of follicular fluid from tropically-adapted goats
T2  - ANIMAL REPRODUCTION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study was conducted to characterize the major proteome of ovarian follicular fluid from locally-adapted, "Caninde" goats in the northeast of Brazil. Eight estrous cycling goats received a hormonal treatment consisting of medroxyprogesterone acetate, D-cloprostenol and FSH. Fluid was collected by laparoscopy from small (< 3 mm), medium (3-4 mm) and large (> 4 mm) follicles and then, proteins were analyzed by 2-D SDS-PAGE and tandem mass spectrometry. Thirty-six proteins were identified in the goat follicular fluid, including albumin, immunoglobulins, ceruloplasmin, complement factor B, alpha-1B-glycoprotein precursor, serotransferrin, complement C3 and serpins, among others. Albumin and immunoglobulins were the most abundant proteins. Protein concentrations were similar in the fluid from small (45.3 +/- 3.1 mg/mL), medium (44.2 +/- 3.3 mg/mL) and large follicles (45.1 +/- 2.3 mg/mL). The intensities of spots identified in 2-D gels as serotransferrin, zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein-like, complement factor B and complement protein C3 differed (P < 0.05) among follicle categories. The amount of serotransferrin was greater in the medium than small follicles (P < 0.05). Content of zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein-like, complement factor B and complement C3 was greater (P < 0.05) in the fluid of large follicles than in medium follicles. Based on gene ontology, the major molecular functions associated with goat follicular fluid proteins were binding and catalytic activity, while the main biological processes were related to regulation, cellular processing, location and the immune system. In conclusion, the major proteome of the follicular fluid from goats subjected to hormonal stimulation was elucidated in the present study. Also, molecules associated with follicle development are potential biomarkers of oocyte competence were prevalent.

TI  - Soil nitrous oxide emissions as affected by long-term tillage, cropping systems and nitrogen fertilization in Southern Brazil
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are affected by management practices, but little information is available on the interactive effects of tillage, cropping systems and N sources in tropical and subtropical soils. In an 18-yr old experiment located in a subtropical Acrisol of Southern Brazil we conducted a sequence of two trials. The 1-year trial (October 2003-2004) was set to evaluate the long-term effects of tillage [CT: conventional; and NT: no-tillage] and cropping systems [O/M: black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb.)/maize (Zea mays L.); and V/M; vetch (Vicia sativa L.)/maize] on soil N2O emissions, either in the post-management period (45 days after desiccation and knife-rolling of winter cover crops) or in the whole year. The second and short-term trial (October-November 2004) was carried out to compare the impact of N sources [urea (mineral) and legume-residue of vetch (biologically fixed), both at 180 kg N ha(-1)] on soil N2O emissions during 53 days after cover-crop management. Air sampling was carried out by static chambers and N2O analysis by gas chromatography. In the 45-day post-management period of the 1-year trial, soil N2O emissions were practically not affected by tillage systems, but increased 4 times due to vetch residues (average of 0.40 +/- 0.08 kg N ha(-1) in V/M versus 0.10 +/- 0.05 kg N ha(-1) in O/M) and related with soil contents of NO3--N, NH4+-N, and dissolved organic C (DOC). Over the whole year, soil N2O emissions under CT were similar for grass- and legume-based cropping systems and averaged 0.43 +/- 0.17 kg N ha(-1), while NT exacerbated N2O emissions in the legume-based cropping system (0.80 +/- 0.07 kg N ha(-1) in V/M versus -0.07 +/- 0.06 kg N ha(-1) in O/M). Maize yield was not affected by tillage, but increased from 2.32 Mg ha(-1) in O/M to 4.44 Mg ha(-1) in V/M. Yield-scaled N2O emissions varied from -33g N2O-N Mg-1 grain in NT O/M to 179g N2O-N Mg-1 grain in NT VIM, and were intermediate in CT soil (106 and 156 g N2O-N Mg-lgrain in V/M and O/M cropping systems, respectively). In the short-term trial, the N2O emitted in excess relative to the control treatment (O/M without N fertilizer) was at least 3 times greater with urea-N (0.44% of applied N) than with legume-residue-Nsource (0.13% of applied N). Yield-scaled N2O emission after vetch residues management (67 g N Mg-1 grain) was half of that after urea-N application (152 g N Mg-1 grain). Partially supplying the maize N requirements with winter legume cover-crops may be a feasible strategy to mitigate soil N2O emissions in the subtropical conservation agriculture.

TI  - Soil organic carbon pools controlled by climate and geochemistry in tropical volcanic regions
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the factors that control the storage of soil organic carbon (SOC) is an urgent priority for mitigating global climate problems. The objective of this study was to determine the factors controlling SOC pools with differing stabilities. Surface soil samples were collected along an elevation gradient from four volcanic regions of Tanzania (two regions) and Indonesia (two regions) under largely-undisturbed vegetation (24 sites in total). A three-pool kinetic model was fitted to accumulative CO2 release curve produced over 343-day incubation to determine the sizes of the labile and intermediate SOC pools (C-L and C-I, respectively) and their mean residence times (1/K-L and 1/K-I, respectively), where the size of the stable SOC pool (C-S) was measured as non-hydrolyzable carbon. Correlation and path analyses were performed using the results of soil fractionation and model fitting with climatic and geochemical properties.The intermediate pool comprised 50% of total SOC, was responsible for 58% of total accumulative CO2 release, and controlled total SOC stability. The content of nanocrystalline minerals (Al-o + 1/2Fe(o): 5.5-110 g kg(-1)) was strongly correlated with C-I and C-S, suggesting that organo-mineral complexes is the essential factor that controls C-I and C-S rather than soil texture or pH. Temperature (12-26 degrees C) was weakly correlated with C-I, C-S, and strongly with C-L, which was closely related to microbial biomass carbon. The low temperature at the high elevation sites retards the decomposition of the whole SOC. The significant correlations of excess precipitation with 1/K-L and 1/K-I represent the effect of moisture on the potential stabilities of the labile and intermediate SOC pools. Climatic factors primarily affect relatively labile SOC pools, whereas geochemical factors influence more stable pools and control total SOC. The findings have important implications for understanding the SOC stabilization mechanisms, which is an essential process of the carbon cycle, in tropical volcanic soils. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Sensitivity and uncertainty of modelled terrestrial net primary productivity to doubled CO2 and associated climate change for a relatively large perturbed physics ensemble
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP) is often modelled explicitly in general circulation models (GCMs) utilising process models that may include plant photosynthesis, respiration, allocation of photosynthates, phenology, mortality and competition between plant functional types. It is an important measure for understanding the role of terrestrial vegetation in the global carbon cycle, and useful for gaining insights into the large-scale, integrated effects of climate and atmospheric changes on potential plant productivity and associated impacts, i.e. food security and carbon cycle feedbacks. However, there are simplifications and uncertainties in GCM projections of future climate change, as well as further uncertainties involved in modelling the associated terrestrial vegetation responses. In particular, it is important to highlight that many GCM simulations, including the ones used in this study, do not model nutrient limitation, even though primary plant nutrients, e.g. nitrogen and phosphorus, are key limiting factors on plant productivity.Here, we examine sensitivities and uncertainties in large(global)-scale modelled NPP to climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration [CO2], utilising a relatively large perturbed physics ensemble (PPE) of simulations generated from the HadSM3 GCM under equilibrium doubling of pre-industrial atmospheric [CO2]. We also exploit the ensemble design to highlight the relative importance of two, often opposing, forcings on NPP: (i) plant physiological responses to CO2, termed 'Phys'; and (ii) plant responses to physical drivers of climate, termed 'Rad'. It is important to note that this is a sensitivity study that provides useful guidance on the relative importance of the Rad and Phys drivers and their uncertainties. The results cannot be considered quantitatively realistic, particularly because the equilibrium experimental design and lack of nutrient limitation in the model are important limitations that prevent such interpretation.We find that doubled [CO2] and associated climate changes ultimately increase potential global average NPP by 57%, from 0.293 kg cm(-2) yr(-1) (similar to 36 PgCyr(-1)) to 0.460 kg cm(-2) yr(-1) (similar to 57 PgCyr(-1)). Spatially, the largest decreases (similar to-0.45 kg cm(-2) yr(-1)) occur across the north-east of South America in association with the largest decreases in precipitation. The largest increases (up to similar to 0.75 kg cm(-2) yr(-1)) occur across tropical Africa and Indonesia, where NPP is already high, and both temperature and precipitation increase under doubled [CO2]. In most regions where NPP shows an increase the changes are significantly larger than the ensemble standard deviation, indicating that increases in global NPP under doubled [CO2] are reasonably robust. However, in some regions, particularly north-eastern South America and Central America, where NPP decreases are projected, the standard deviation across the ensemble is larger than the average NPP change, indicating that even the sign of the NPP sensitivity to doubled [CO2] and climate is uncertain. These uncertainties are shown to be highly dependent on the relative sensitivities of NPP to the Phys and Rad forcings. Crown Copyright (c) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved..

TI  - Climatic and biotic controls on annual carbon storage in Amazonian ecosystems
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1 The role of undisturbed tropical land ecosystems in the global carbon budget is not well understood. It has been suggested that interannual climate variability can affect the capacity of these ecosystems to store carbon in the short term. In this paper, we use a transient version of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) to estimate annual carbon storage in undisturbed Amazonian ecosystems during the period 1980-94, and to understand the underlying causes of the year-to-year variations in net carbon storage for this region.2 We estimate that the total carbon storage in the undisturbed ecosystems of the Amazon Basin in 1980 was 127.6 Pg C, with about 94.3 Pg C in vegetation and 33.3 Pg C in the reactive pool of soil organic carbon. About 83% of the total carbon storage occurred in tropical evergreen forests. Based on our model's results, we estimate that, over the past 15 years, the total carbon storage has increased by 3.1 Pg C (+ 2%), with a 1.9-Pg C (+2%) increase in vegetation carbon and a 1.2-Pg C (+4%) increase in reactive soil organic carbon. The modelled results indicate that the largest relative changes in net carbon storage have occurred in tropical deciduous forests, but that the largest absolute changes in net carbon storage have occurred in the moist and wet forests of the Basin.3 Our results show that the strength of interannual variations in net carbon storage of undisturbed ecosystems in the Amazon Basin varies from a carbon source of 0.2 Pg C/year to a carbon sink of 0.7 Pg C/year. Precipitation, especially the amount received during the drier months, appears to be a major controller of annual net carbon storage in the Amazon Basin. Our analysis indicates further that changes in precipitation combine with changes in temperature to affect net carbon storage through influencing soil moisture and nutrient availability.4 On average, our results suggest that the undisturbed Amazonian ecosystems accumulated 0.2 Pg C/year as a result of climate variability and increasing atmospheric CO2 over the study period. This amount is large enough to have compensated for most of the carbon losses associated with tropical deforestation in the Amazon during the same period.5 Comparisons with empirical data indicate that climate variability and CO2 fertilization explain most of the variation in net carbon storage for the undisturbed ecosystems. Our analyses suggest that assessment of the regional carbon budget in the tropics should be made over at least one cycle of El Nino-Southern Oscillation because of interannual climate variability. Our analyses also suggest that proper scaling of the site-specific and subannual measurements of carbon fluxes to produce Basin-wide flux estimates must take into account seasonal and spatial variations in net carbon storage.

TI  - INDONESIA'S TROPICAL PEATLANDS REVISITED: AREA, DEPTH, CARBON POTENTIAL, AND THEIR IMPORTANCE
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia has the largest tropical peatlands in the Asia-Pacific region and the world's second largest tropical peatlands. Growing concerns on peatland conservation and restoration emphasise the importance of these ecosystems for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Although Indonesia's peatlands are well-studied compared with other tropical countries, there are still uncertainties regarding its peat volume and carbon stock estimations, and how important it is locally and globally. To solve these uncertainties, this study estimated peat volume and carbon stock in Indonesia using the national peatlands data published by the Ministry of Agriculture, Republic of Indonesia and analysed greenhouse gas emissions among the major industrial sectors in the country and global emissions by peatland degradation. Our study posited that anthropogenic disturbance degraded Indonesian peatlands and that the country could become the largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world. Therefore, successful conservation and restoration of Indonesia's peatlands could significantly contribute to global climate change mitigation and adaptation.

TI  - Mangrove conservation for climate change mitigation in Indonesia
T2  - WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Review
AB  - In terms of climate change mitigation, mangroves serve as carbon sinks and the loss of mangrove forests can result in significant release of stored carbon. As the country in the world with the largest cover of mangrove forest, Indonesia has global significance in climate change mitigation. About 22% of mangrove forests in Indonesia are preserved in conservation areas and provide 0.82-1.09 PgC hectare(-1) of carbon storage. Greater potential for climate change mitigation can be achieved by increasing mangrove conservation areas that keep mangrove forests from their conversion to other land uses. Our finding confirms the importance of mangrove conservation in storing and sequestering carbon. Furthermore, as mangrove forests are associated with a diversity of ecosystem services with multiple beneficiaries, the carbon benefits will enhance the value of mangrove forest in terms of ecological, social, and economic benefits. However, prioritizing carbon benefits through the implementation of mangrove conservation as part of climate change mitigation may be conflicting with socioeconomic issues. Thus, legal frameworks and the participation of stakeholders, especially local communities, are needed to ensure that there is a net reduction in mangrove loss.This article is categorized under:Climate, Ecology, and Conservation > Conservation Strategies

TI  - Biogeochemical cycling in terrestrial ecosystems of the Caatinga Biome
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The biogeochemical cycles of C, N, P and water, the impacts of land use in the stocks and flows of these elements and how they can affect the structure and functioning of Caatinga were reviewed. About half of this biome is still covered by native secondary vegetation. Soils are deficient in nutrients, especially N and P. Average concentrations of total soil P and C in the top layer (0-20 cm) are 196 mg kg(-1) and 9.3 g kg(-1), corresponding to C stocks around 23 Mg ha(-1). Aboveground biomass of native vegetation varies from 30 to 50 Mg ha(-1), and average root biomass from 3 to 12 Mg ha(-1). Average annual productivities and biomass accumulation in different land use systems vary from 1 to 7 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). Biological atmospheric N-2 fixation is estimated to vary from 3 to 11 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) and 21 to 26 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) in mature and secondary Caatinga, respectively. The main processes responsible for nutrient and water losses are fire, soil erosion, runoff and harvest of crops and animal products. Projected climate changes in the future point to higher temperatures and rainfall decreases. In face of the high intrinsic variability, actions to increase sustainability should improve resilience and stability of the ecosystems. Land use systems based on perennial species, as opposed to annual species, may be more stable and resilient, thus more adequate to face future potential increases in climate variability. Long-term studies to investigate the potential of the native biodiversity or adapted exotic species to design sustainable land use systems should be encouraged.

TI  - Navigating Mangrove Protection: A Jurisdictional Approach to Climate Action in South Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - CLIMATE LAW
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems in Indonesia, essential for coastal protection and carbon sequestration, are under severe threat from deforestation. This article emphasizes their significance and their role in Indonesia's climate change mitigation strategies. Their carbon sequestration capacity is substantial, potentially preventing significant CO2 emissions. Indonesia is committed to climate change mitigation, with its Enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution focusing on the Forest and Other Land Use (Foiu) sector, where mangroves are pivotal. However, optimizing this potential and involving local communities present challenges due to weak enforcement, policy conflicts, and limited community engagement Based on a case study in South Sumatra, this study highlights the importance of involving local governments and communities in mangrove conservation efforts as a climate change mitigation measure. By applying a jurisdictional approach, especially through social -forestry schemes (e.g. Village Forests and mangrove -based ecotourism), local governments can play a crucial role in preserving mangrove ecosystems, integrating them into climate policies, and supporting community empowerment while achieving climate change mitigation goals.

TI  - Soil macro-fauna in an Acacia mangium plantation in comparison to that in a primary mixed dipterocarp forest in the lowlands of Sarawak, Malaysia
T2  - PEDOBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable ecosystem management of Acacia mangium plantation, the area of which is rapidly increasing in the tropics, especially in Indonesia and Malaysia, becomes more and more important. In this context, abundance, biomass and vertical distribution of soil macro-invertebrates were investigated in a mature plantation of A. mangium . n Sarawak, Malaysia. In the present paper, in order to reveal the changes in soil macro-fauna caused by conversion of natural forests to A. mangium plantations, the results were compared with those from a nearby primary forest. White total abundance of soil macro-invertebrates was similar, total, biomass was much Larger in the plantation than in the primary forest. The prominent factor for such a Large total biomass in the plantation was the high abundance of earthworms, followed by isopods and harvestmen with much smaller contributions. The common feature of the communities of these three taxa in the plantation was the absolute dominance by single species. The dominant earthworm species was of the endogeic type that was absent from the primary forest and thought to be introduced with A. mangium seedlings from outside. The isopod flushed in the plantation was a pill bug that occurred in the primary forest, too, and might have been pre-adapted to the vegetation change. The dominant harvestman in the plantation was of the life form different from that of the other species found, and was thought to be supported by the explosive increase in biomass of earthworm and/or pill bug. On the other hand, communities of termites, ants, fly Larvae, click beetle Larvae and other beetle Larvae were depressed by the vegetation change. Thus the major consequence of the conversion of natural forest to A. mangium plantation was simplification of community structure in many taxonomic groups. The major points of the simplification in turn were the explosive increase in biomass of the soil processing earthworm and the titter processing pill bug which may accelerate the mineralization processes. The need for a careful monitoring on sustainability of soil fertility was concluded. (C) 2004 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

CL  - Natl Inst Agro-Environm Sci, Tsukuba, JAPAN
AB  - Monthly measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes in peat soils were carried out and compared with groundwater level over a year at four sites (drained forest, upland cassava, upland and lowland paddy fields) located in Jambi province, Indonesia. Fluxes from swamp forest soils were also measured once per year as the native state of this investigated area. Land-use change from drained forest to lowland paddy field significantly decreased the CO2 (from 266 to 30 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) and N2O fluxes (from 25.4 to 3.8 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)), but increased the CH4 flux (from 0.1 to 4.2 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) in the soils. Change from drained forest to cassava field significantly increased N2O flux (from 25.4 to 62.2 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)), but had no significant influence on CO2 (from 266 to 200 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) and CH4 fluxes (from 0.1 to 0.3 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) in the soils. Averaged CO2 fluxes in the swamp forests (94 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) were estimated to be one-third of that in the drained forest. Groundwater levels of drained forest and upland crop fields had been lowered by drainage ditches while swamp forest and lowland paddy field were flooded, although groundwater levels were also affected by precipitation. Groundwater levels were negatively related to CO2 flux but positively related to CH4 flux at all investigation sites. The peak of the N2O flux was observed at -20 cm of groundwater level. Lowering the groundwater level by 10 cm from the soil surface resulted in a 50% increase in CO2 emission (from 109.1 to 162.4 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) and a 25% decrease in CH4 emission (from 0.440 to 0.325 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) in this study. These results suggest that lowering of groundwater level by the drainage ditches in the peat lands contributes to global warming and devastation of fields. Swamp forest was probably the best land-use management in peat lands to suppress the carbon loss and greenhouse gas emission. Lowland paddy field was a better agricultural system in the peat lands in terms of C sequestration and greenhouse gas emission. Carbon loss from lowland paddy field was one-eighth of that of the other upland crop systems, although the Global Warming Potential was almost the same level as that of the other upland crop systems because of CH4 emission through rice plants.

TI  - Blue carbon: A new paradigm of mangrove conservation and management in Indonesia
T2  - MARINE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia is the largest archipelagic country in the world and has vast natural resources. In the maritime sector, efforts to realize the sustainability of natural resources in coastal ecosystems have focused on mangroves and seagrass meadows, also known as blue carbon ecosystems, that have an important role in regulating the Earth's climate. The need for ecosystem-based climate change mitigation combined with economic recovery and improved environment conditions has shifted the motivation and escalated mangrove restoration efforts in Indonesia. As the richest mangrove nation with the greatest mangrove carbon stocks in the world, recently Indonesia has taken significant steps in the land use sector to reduce emissions by acknowledging the 'true' value of mangrove carbon and setting priorities for mangrove conservation and restoration within Indonesia's climate actions. This paper reviews opportunities and challenges in mainstreaming mangrove blue carbon into policy in Indonesia. We evaluate the gaps in regulations and policies and propose pathways for the national blue carbon action. As mangroves are embedded in both forestry and marine sectors and the responsibilities for management lies within several government ministries, an integrated framework is suggested to support the national blue carbon strategy. The Indonesia Blue Carbon Strategy Framework (IBCSF) encompasses three main elements that should be considered in order to address challenges and seize opportunities in blue carbon: coordination, policy and funding.

TI  - Ecotourism and mangrove conservation in Southeast Asia: Current trends and perspectives
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Mangroves in Southeast Asia provide numerous supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural services that are crucial to the environment and local livelihoods since they support biodiversity conservation and climate change resilience. However, Southeast Asia mangroves face deforestation threats from the expansion of commercial aquaculture, agriculture, and urban development, along with climate change-related natural processes. Ecotourism has gained prominence as a financial incentive tool to support mangrove conservation and restoration. Through a systematic literature review approach, we examined the relationships between ecotourism and mangrove conservation in Southeast Asia based on scientific papers published from 2010 to 2022. Most of the studies were reported in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, respectively, which were associated with the highest number of vibrant mangrove ecotourism sites and largest mangrove areas compared to the other countries of Southeast Asia. Mangrove-related ecotourism activities in the above countries mainly include boat tours, bird and wildlife watching, mangrove planting, kayaking, eating seafood, and snorkeling. The economic benefits, such as an increase in income associated with mangrove ecotourism, have stimulated infrastructural development in ecotourism destinations. Local communities benefited from increased access to social amenities such as clean water, electricity, transportation networks, schools, and health services that are intended to make destinations more attractive to tourists. Economic benefits from mangrove ecotourism motivated the implementation of several community-based mangrove conservation and restoration initiatives, which attracted international financial incentives and public-private partnerships. Since mangroves are mostly located on the land occupied by indigenous people and local communities, ensuring respect for their land rights and equity in economic benefit sharing may increase their intrinsic motivation and participation in mangrove restoration and conservation initiatives. Remote sensing tools for mangrove monitoring, evaluation, and reporting, and integrated education and awareness campaigns can ensure the long-term conservation of mangroves while sustaining ecotourism 's economic infrastructure and social amenities benefits.

TI  - New contributions to mangrove rehabilitation/restoration protocols and practices
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The conservation of extant mangroves and the restoration of the lost forests is extremely important for the Planet. However, there is a scarcity of information about several operational details and methodologies in worldwide mangrove rehabilitation/ restoration projects or attempts (RRPA), especially from a more functional approach. Methodological data from case studies can help practitioners' initiatives, projects progress, and/or management measures improvement. In this work, we make a non-systematic review of several mangrove restoration protocols, case studies, and published RRPA, addressing several important aspects raised by them and during our restoration practices in the Neotropics. We address the specificity of mangrove rehabilitation/restoration (R/R) in relation to the regional biotic/abiotic features and the use of experimental approaches, the question of key faunal groups that can be used as indicators of the functionality of restored stands, the mangrove R/R foreseeing the effects of already ongoing climate changes, and finally the challenges posed to mangrove conservation and restoration by the carbon trade and the 'economic developmentalism' framework adopted by most countries. This work also contributes to update the knowledge of some practical issues scarcely addressed by studies, aiming to improve the effectiveness of RRPA, especially when considering that mangrove restoration and climate change mitigation projects/attempts are expected to increase.

TI  - A global predictive model of carbon in mangrove soils
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are among the most threatened and rapidly vanishing natural environments worldwide. They provide a wide range of ecosystem services and have recently become known for their exceptional capacity to store carbon. Research shows that mangrove conservation may be a low-cost means of reducing CO2 emissions. Accordingly, there is growing interest in developing market mechanisms to credit mangrove conservation projects for associated CO2 emissions reductions. These efforts depend on robust and readily applicable, but currently unavailable, localized estimates of soil carbon. Here, we use over 900 soil carbon measurements, collected in 28 countries by 61 independent studies, to develop a global predictive model for mangrove soil carbon. Using climatological and locational data as predictors, we explore several predictive modeling alternatives, including machine-learning methods. With our predictive model, we construct a global dataset of estimated soil carbon concentrations and stocks on a high-resolution grid (5 arc min). We estimate that the global mangrove soil carbon stock is 5.00 +/- 0.94 Pg C (assuming a 1 meter soil depth) and find this stock is highly variable over space. The amount of carbon per hectare in the world's most carbon-rich mangroves (approximately 703 +/- 38 Mg C ha(-1)) is roughly a 2.6 +/- 0.14 times the amount of carbon per hectare in the world's most carbon-poor mangroves (approximately 272 +/- 49Mg C ha(-1)). Considerable within country variation in mangrove soil carbon also exists. In Indonesia, the country with the largest mangrove soil carbon stock, we estimate that the most carbon-rich mangroves contain 1.5 +/- 0.12 times as much carbon per hectare as the most carbon-poor mangroves. Our results can aid in evaluating benefits from mangrove conservation and designing mangrove conservation policy. Additionally, the results can be used to project changes in mangrove soil carbon stocks based on changing climatological predictors, e.g. to assess the impacts of climate change on mangrove soil carbon stocks.

TI  - Systematic Planning and Ecosystem-Based Management as Strategies to Reconcile Mangrove Conservation with Resource Use
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - About 120 million people worldwide live within 10 km of large mangrove forests, and many of them directly depend on the goods and services provided by these ecosystems. However, it remains unclear how to synchronize ecological definitions and legal conservation strategies regarding mangroves, especially in developing countries, such as Brazil. The influence of human populations' socio-economic context in mangrove conservation policies, as well associated challenges in incorporating this influence, are underestimated or, often, largely ignored. Considering the recent threats emerging from changes in legislation and the lack of spatial and social-ecological integrated data to plan mangrove conservation in Brazil, this paper aims to answer the following questions: (1) What suitable measures could managers and other decision makers adopt for efficient mangrove conservation planning?; (2) What are the site-specific, social-ecological aspects that need to be taken into account when deciding on conservation and management strategies?; and (3) How could science contribute to the development of these measures? In order to achieve an ecosystem-based management approach, mangrove ecosystems should not be divided into sub-systems, but instead treated as an integrated system. Furthermore, interconnections with other coastal ecosystems must be assessed and taken into account. This is crucial for effective systematic conservation planning. Also, most of the particular social-ecological aspects in the different types of mangrove ecosystems along the Brazilian coast, and how those differences might be considered while planning for conservation, remain poorly understood. Based on similar drivers of change, geological features, and likely impacts of climate change, a macro-unit approach is proposed to group mangrove systems along the Brazilian coast and guide national policies. This paper draws parallels with management approaches worldwide to find common points and hence lessons to be applied in other regional realms. It considers the issues of legal vulnerability and needs for social-ecological data on mangroves, contributing toward systematic conservation planning and ecosystem-based management for these ecosystems.

TI  - Tropical forest and peatland conservation in Indonesia: Challenges and directions
T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
M3  - Review
AB  - Tropical forests and peatlands provide important ecological, climate and socio-economic benefits from the local to the global scale. However, these ecosystems and their associated benefits are threatened by anthropogenic activities, including agricultural conversion, timber harvesting, peatland drainage and associated fire. Here, we identify key challenges, and provide potential solutions and future directions to meet forest and peatland conservation and restoration goals in Indonesia, with a particular focus on Kalimantan.Through a round-table, dual-language workshop discussion and literature evaluation, we recognized 59 political, economic, legal, social, logistical and research challenges, for which five key underlying factors were identified. These challenges relate to the 3Rs adopted by the Indonesian Peatland Restoration Agency (Rewetting, Revegetation and Revitalization), plus a fourth R that we suggest is essential to incorporate into (peatland) conservation planning: Reducing Fires.Our analysis suggests that (a) all challenges have potential for impact on activities under all 4Rs, and many are inter-dependent and mutually reinforcing, implying that narrowly focused solutions are likely to carry a higher risk of failure; (b) addressing challenges relating to Rewetting and Reducing Fire is critical for achieving goals in all 4Rs, as is considering the local socio-political situation and acquiring local government and community support; and (c) the suite of challenges faced, and thus conservation interventions required to address these, will be unique to each project, depending on its goals and prevailing local environmental, social and political conditions.With this in mind, we propose an eight-step adaptive management framework, which could support projects in both Indonesia and other tropical areas to identify and overcome their specific conservation and restoration challenges.

TI  - A review of the drivers of tropical peatland degradation in South-East Asia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Review
AB  - The world's largest area of tropical peatland ecosystems is found in South-East Asia. These peatlands have globally significant carbon stocks and play an important role in regional and global climate systems. Despite the valuable social and economic services and ecosystem biodiversity these tropical peatlands provide, misguided land use policies have resulted in widespread peatland degradation in the region during the past 20 years. This paper reviews the drivers of peatland degradation in South-East Asia and confirms that logging, conversion to industrial plantations, drainage, and recurrent fires are the principal direct drivers of peatland degradation in South-East Asia, and that these drivers are compounded by a complex mix of indirect socioeconomic, policy- and climate change-related factors. The review concludes by noting that in order to address the problem of peatland degradation, we first need to know more about how to design and assess "successful" peatland restoration initiatives, and what regulatory and policy interventions are likely to improve peatland conservation and restoration outcomes in the South-East Asian region.

M3  - Article
AB  - The decade 2021-2030 was defined by the UN as the decade of 'Ecosystem Restoration' and of 'Ocean Science for Sustainable Development', aiming to restore ecosystems and protect the Oceans. Among target ecosystems, mangroves are fundamental wetlands, since they support a lively, biologically dynamic frontier between land and sea, furnishing many goods and services in relation to their extension, like fisheries, timber, biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation, among others. Regarding climate change, mangrove restoration helps mitigate GHG emissions, by sequestering carbon in biomass and sediments for long periods of time and increases shore protection facing sea level rise and extreme climate events. The possibilities and conditions for mangrove restoration are many, and their rehabilitation/restoration is possible as provided by evidence form many experiments worldwide. Notwithstanding, there are still many steps in methodology and governance decisions to place mangrove restoration as a globally effective mitigation and adaptation measure to climate change.

TI  - Climate-smart peatland management and the potential for synergies between food security and climate change objectives in Indonesia
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatlands lie at a nexus of competing sustainable development demands of enhancing food security, mitigating climate change, improving resilience and supporting rural livelihoods. Meeting United Nations Sus-tainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires balancing these various demands. Progress in meeting SDGs has been slow in low to middle income countries because of difficulties in identifying and quantifying the trade offs associated with natural resource exploitation, including on extensive areas of tropical peatlands.Here, by using secondary data from the literature, Indonesian and international agencies, we examine how land-use allocation in Indonesia has developed over the last three decades by investigating trends of key food and woody crops (oil palm and rubber) and evaluate the role that peatland provinces have played in food security and climate forcing. Overall, food crop production has been marginal in peatland provinces compared to monoculture woody crops, with the latter associated with increased carbon emissions from land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) over the last thirty years. Our analysis shows that synergies between responses to looming food security and climate change crises can also promote less damaging forms of tropical peatland management. For instance, the conversion of degraded shallow peatlands to agroecological practices (e.g., paludiculture) can be promoted. However, we stress that peatland conservation and restoration must remain the top priority. Impediments due to lack of a common definition for peatland and planning/management units, the use of multiple sectoral maps by different government agencies and uncoordinated sectoral policy targets can, however, hinder the implementation of less damaging peatland management.

TI  - Identifying Mangrove Deforestation Hotspots in South Asia, Southeast Asia and Asia-Pacific
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves inhabit highly productive inter-tidal ecosystems in >120 countries in the tropics and subtropics providing critical goods and services to coastal communities and contributing to global climate change mitigation owing to substantial carbon stocks. Despite their importance, global mangrove distribution continues to decline primarily due to anthropogenic drivers which vary by region/country. South Asia, Southeast Asia and Asia-Pacific contain approximately 46% of the world's mangrove ecosystems, including the most biodiverse mangrove forests. This region also exhibits the highest global rates of mangrove loss. Remotely sensed data provides timely and accurate information on mangrove distribution and dynamics critical for targeting loss hotspots and guiding intervention. This report inventories, describes and compares all known single- and multi-date remotely sensed datasets with regional coverage and provides areal mangrove extents by country. Multi-date datasets were used to estimate dynamics and identify loss hotspots (i.e., countries that exhibit greatest proportional loss). Results indicate Myanmar is the primary mangrove loss hotspot, exhibiting 35% loss from 1975-2005 and 28% between 2000-2014. Rates of loss in Myanmar were four times the global average from 2000-2012. The Philippines is additionally identified as a loss hotspot, with secondary hotspots including Malaysia, Cambodia and Indonesia. This information helps inform and guide mangrove conservation, restoration and managed-use within the region.

TI  - Contribution of mangrove forest carbon stocks on climate change mitigation: a case study at Tuntang Estuary, Central Java
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are an important coastal ecosystem in the global cycle of carbon and climate change mitigation. Unfortunately, a significant loss of mangrove forests has significantly increased carbon emissions over recent years. This research aims to measure the carbon stocks and potential carbon storage of the Tuntang Estuary mangrove forest. Sixteen quadrant plots at six sites were used to collect data on above- and below-ground carbon (roots and sediment). Several published allometric formulas were used for estimating the above and below-ground (root) carbon, while the Walkley and Black method was used to analyze sediment organic carbon. This study showed that the potential of total carbon stocks in this mangrove forest was approximately 0.08 x 106 (+/- 0.02) Mg C or equivalent to 0.29 x 106 (+/- 0.05) Mg CO2e. The largest average percentage of carbon stocks (62%) was stored in sediment, 24.57% in mangrove tree biomass, and 13.43% in root biomass. This study discovered that coastal abrasion has a natural effect on mangrove forests and that human activities, particularly aquacultures, also contribute to the low total stock of carbon. The ecotourism site had the highest overall stock of carbon due to the extensive conservation efforts of all stakeholders, including visitors. This study highlights the crucial role of conserving mangroves as a strategy for achieving sustainable development goals, particularly in the context of climate change mitigation.

TI  - Integrated spatial cost-benefit analysis of large-scale mangrove conservation and restoration in Indonesia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Economic development in Indonesia has resulted in reduced poverty but has also been accompanied by significant pressure on natural capital, including its mangrove forests. In recognition of the role of mangroves in providing coastal protection and the delivery of other ecosystem services, the Government of Indonesia has engaged in several policy actions, among others the use of nature based solutions and has set a target to restore or enhance the protection of 600,000 ha of mangroves by 2025. The objective of the analysis presented in this paper is to inform the design and development of a national-scale mangrove conservation and restoration policy for Indonesia through a spatially explicit cost-benefit analysis. The analytical framework involves the integration of maps, data and models to estimate the costs and benefits of mangrove restoration at a high spatial resolution. On the benefit side, we make use of meta-analytic value transfer methods to value changes in fisheries, raw materials, coastal protection, carbon sequestration and avoided emissions, and mangrove tourism. On the cost side, we assess the opportunity and implementation costs using country specific data. Through a spatial overlay of cost and benefit estimates, cost-benefit indicators are calculated per district for investing in additional mangrove restoration and conservation. Using a discount rate of 5.5% and a 30-year project lifetime, the benefit-cost ratios of mangrove conservation and restoration are found to be >1 in most districts indicating positive social returns on investment. We find that mangrove conservation generally has higher benefit-cost ratios than restoration due to both the higher cost of restoration implementation and the additional time that it takes for restored mangroves to deliver ecosystem services. The spatially explicit framework to estimate district-level costs and benefits reveals tradeoffs with agriculture and aquaculture and enables the evaluation of investment scenarios and the spatial prioritisation of investments in mangrove conservation and restoration across Indonesia. Strategic allocation of conservation and restoration investments across districts can potentially significantly increase the economic viability of this nature-based solution.

TI  - The carbon stock potential of the restored mangrove ecosystem of Pasarbanggi, Rembang, Central Java
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems can absorb significant amounts of carbon and help mitigate climate change. However, their existence continues to be endangered by natural and human forces. Therefore, mangrove restoration is regarded as a crucial component of the global climate change agenda. This study aims to estimate the potential total carbon stock of restored mangrove ecosystems in Pasarbanggi, Rembang, Central Java. The above-below ground (root) carbon stock was calculated using several published allometric equations. The loss-on-ignition method analyzed leaf litter and sediment carbon stocks. This study estimates the Pasarbanggi mangrove ecosystem's total carbon stock potential at 0.02 x 106 MgC, which is equivalent to the potential CO2 emission of 0.08 x 106 MgCO2e, with up to 65% stored in sediments. This study highlights the critical role of restored mangrove ecosystems on the climate change mitigation agenda by reducing the concentration of atmospheric CO2.

TI  - Climate change commitments and agriculture sectoral strategies in Cameroon: Interplay and perspectives
T2  - COGENT ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cameroon like other developing countries is developing approaches to respond to national and global climate change adaptation and mitigation commitments. Sufficient information on the interplay between sector policies and the causes, impacts and response to climate change is relevant for developing sustainable climate change response plans. Using the agriculture sector as a case, this paper examines this interplay in the context of the humid forest zone (HFZ) of Cameroon. Drawing on secondary information from agriculture sector strategies, forest cover change, climate vulnerability and agriculture systems in the HFZ, we found that: (i) the objectives of agriculture expansion and avoided deforestation and forest degradation are at cross-roads; (ii) agriculture as a livelihood strategy is vulnerable to climate variability and change; (iii) strengthening agriculture production systems technically, materially and financially are main suggestions for climate resilient and low carbon emission agriculture practices. We highlight barriers that need to be addressed for the agriculture intensification mechanism, i.e. the agriculture research and extension services in Cameroon to respond to the needs of adaptation and carbon emission reductions from avoided deforestation. These barriers and others would be addressed if their financial, technology and capacity building needs are carefully evaluated as Cameroon mobilizes resources for the implementation of its National Determined Contributions.

TI  - Impact of climate change on flood inundation in a tropical river basin in Indonesia
T2  - PROGRESS IN EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change will have a significant impact on the water cycle and will lead to severe environmental problems and disasters in humid tropical river basins. Examples include river basins in Sumatra Island, Indonesia, where the coastal lowland areas are mostly composed of peatland that is a wetland environment initially sustained by flooding from rivers. Climate change may alter the frequency and magnitude of flood inundation in these lowland areas, disturbing the peatland environment and its carbon dynamics and damaging agricultural plantations. Consequently, projecting the extent of inundation due to future flooding events is considered important for river basin management. Using dynamically downscaled climate data obtained by the Non-Hydrostatic Regional Climate Model (NHRCM), the Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) model was applied to the Batanghari River Basin (42,960 km(2)) in Sumatra Island, Indonesia, to project the extent of flood inundation in the latter part of the twenty-first century. In order to obtain reasonable estimates of the extent of future flood inundation, this study compared two bias correction methods: a Quantile Mapping (QM) method and a combination of QM and Variance Scaling (VS) methods. The results showed that the bias correction obtained by the QM method improved the simulated flow duration curve (FDC) obtained from the RRI model, which facilitated comparison with the simulated FDC using reference rainfall data. However, the high spatial variability observed in daily and 15-day rainfall data remained as the spatial variation bias, and this could not be resolved by simple QM bias correction alone. Consequently, the simulated extreme variables, such as annual maximum flood inundation volume, were overestimated compared to the reference data. By introducing QM-VS bias correction, the cumulative density functions of annual maximum discharge and inundation volumes were improved. The findings also showed that flooding will increase in this region; for example, the flood inundation volume corresponding to a 20-year return period will increase by 3.3 times. River basin management measures, such as land use regulations for plantations and wetland conservation, should therefore consider increases in flood depth and area, the extents of which under a future climate scenario are presented in this study.

TI  - Governance reform and climate change response
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CLIMATE CHANGE (ICCC 2018)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 3rd International Conference on Climate Change (ICCC)
CL  - Solo City, INDONESIA
AB  - This paper focuses on Indonesian government-driven initiative on critical forest and degraded land rehabilitation. We employ Governance System Analysis (GSA) to diagnose various efforts that have been made by various actors in affecting and managing the rehabilitation of critical forests and degraded land. This study uses Wonosobo District as a case study because it has the largest forest coverage in Central Java Province and has a relatively high amount of land with critical condition. The application of GSA suggests improvement in terms of connectivity to reduce strong segregation between authorities managing the forest and capacity of an involved participant in strategy formulation, implementation and monitoring, and evaluation. The study finds it difficult to locate such governance reforms in the major classification of climate change strategies, either mitigation or adaptation. The reform is neither directly reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases nor is an adjustment of the system to the changing of climatic patterns. In the absence of such governance reform, however, prospect to maximize the contribution of forest environmental services to combat climate change are constrained.

TI  - Natural forest regeneration on anthropized landscapes could overcome climate change effects on the endangered maned sloth (Bradypus torquatus, Illiger 1811)
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and habitat loss have been identified as the main causes of species extinction. Forest regeneration and protected areas are essential to buffer climate change impacts and to ensure quality habitats for threatened species. We assessed the current and future environmental suitability for the maned sloth, Bradypus torquatus, under both future climate and forest restoration scenarios, using ecological niche modeling. We compared environmental suitability for two Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUnorth and ESUsouth) using two climate change scenarios for 2070, and three potential forest regeneration scenarios. Likewise, we evaluated the protection degree of the suitable areas resulting from the models, according to Brazilian law: PA-Protected Areas; PPA-Permanent Protection Areas (environmentally sensitive areas in private properties); and LR-Legal Reserves (natural vegetation areas in private properties). Finally, we calculated the deficit of PPA and LR in each ESU, considering the current forest cover. Forest regeneration might mitigate the deleterious effects of climate change by maintaining and increasing environmental suitability in future scenarios. The ESUnorth contains more suitable areas (21,570 km(2)) than the ESUsouth (12,386 km(2)), with an increase in all future scenarios (up to 45,648 km(2) of new suitable areas), while ESUsouth might have a significant decrease (up to 7,546 km(2) less). Suitable areas are mostly unprotected (ESUnorth-65.5% and ESUsouth-58.3%). Therefore, PPA and PA can maintain only a small portion of current and future suitable areas. Both ESUs present a high deficit of PPA and LR, highlighting the necessity to act in the recovery of these areas to accomplish a large-scale restoration, mitigate climate change effects, and achieve, at least, a minimum forested area to safeguard the species. Notwithstanding, a long-term conservation of B. torquatus will benefit from forest regeneration besides those minimum requirements, allied to the protection of forest areas.

TI  - Climate change and cultural resilience in late pre-Columbian Amazonia
T2  - NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term response of ancient societies to climate change has been a matter of global debate. Until recently, the lack of integrative studies using archaeological, palaeoecological and palaeoclimatological data prevented an evaluation of the relationship between climate change, distinct subsistence strategies and cultural transformations across the largest rainforest of the world, Amazonia. Here we review the most relevant cultural changes seen in the archaeological record of six different regions within Greater Amazonia during late pre-Columbian times. We compare the chronology of those cultural transitions with high-resolution regional palaeoclimate proxies, showing that, while some societies faced major reorganization during periods of climate change, others were unaffected and even flourished. We propose that societies with intensive, specialized land-use systems were vulnerable to transient climate change. In contrast, land-use systems that relied primarily on polyculture agroforestry, resulting in the formation of enriched forests and fertile Amazonian dark earth in the long term, were more resilient to climate change.

TI  - Adaptive restoration planning to enhance water security in a changing climate
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Ecosystem restoration is a global priority for recovering degraded areas and mitigating climate change. However, climate change can impact the long-term effectiveness of restoration efforts. This study evaluated the effects of climate change on restoration planning, focusing on water quality in the Doce River basin, the site of Brazil's largest environmental tragedy and the most significant mining disaster globally, with the release of approximately 50 million cubic metres of iron ore tailings into the environment. Sediment exportation was used as a criterion for assessing water quality under three climate scenarios. Restoration of riparian vegetation reduced sediment exportation by 75.29% but was insufficient to fully control erosion, particularly in the upper basin, where increased precipitation could exacerbate the problem. The findings underscore the risks of ignoring climate change in restoration planning. Adaptive strategies are essential to ensure long-term benefits and address climate challenges, fostering more resilient and sustainable ecosystems.

TI  - Managing the forest-water nexus for climate change adaptation
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change can directly affect forest hydrology by altering precipitation, evapotranspiration, and streamflow generation, or indirectly by changing disturbance regimes and forest structures at multiple scales. Climate change impacts on the forest-water nexus across biomes are pervasive characterized by a great complexity and uncertainty, significantly impeding the design of adaptive forest watershed management to mitigate climate change risks. This paper reviews our current knowledge on the interactions between climate change and the forest-water nexus at the scales of individual tree, stand, and watershed. We found that climate change dramatically altered watershed hydrology in many parts of the world, with varying hydrological responses at multiple scales of tree species, forest types, climate types, and hydrological regimes. The streamflow response was often more pronounced in snow-dominated or water-limited watersheds, especially in watersheds with increasing droughts due to climate change and intensively managed plantations of either non-native tree species (e.g., Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and Australia) or young coniferous species. Climate change impacts can be compounded or offset by forest changes (i.e., deforestation, and forestation) through forest-climate interactions and feedbacks. Forest management can mitigate or aggravate the negative hydrologic impacts of climate change. Adaptive forest management is a prerequisite for managing the forest-water nexus in the face of climate change. Various forest management strategies aiming at maintaining optimal forest structure and high species diversity are recommended to enhance forest resistance and resilience to climate change and sustain water provision services from forests and other beneficial ecosystem services while minimizing negative impacts and risks of climate change.

TI  - Restoration of coastal ecosystems as an approach to the integrated mangrove ecosystem management and mitigation and adaptation to climate changes in north coast of East Java
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is very basic and appears on earth. Climate change has become an issue that must be faced by humans today and in the future. One of the impacts of climate change can be found in coastal areas. Tsunamis and tidal floods repeatedly occur in coastal areas. One of the efforts to overcome sea level rise that causes tsunamis, erosion, and tidal flooding is mangrove forests. This study aims to determine public awareness of the occurrence of tidal flooding and tsunami and to find an easy and inexpensive way to overcome it. This research is integrated using the partial least square (PLS) approach and the coastal vulnerability index (CVI) approach to mangrove forests. The results showed that the awareness and assessment of the community to carry out mangrove forest restoration to overcome disasters caused by climate change must be managed and handled with a co-management approach..

TI  - Identifying changes in mangrove landscapes in the Philippines and Indonesia using remote sensing and community perceptions: Towards ecosystem services management
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems provide important services in mitigating global climate change while delivering various co-benefits at the local level. However, they are subjected to multiple anthropogenic and natural disturbances, leading to several investigations aimed at addressing these threats and/or restoring them. This study was conducted to develop site-specific scale land cover maps using remote sensing to monitor and quantify mangroves, alongside assessing community perceptions to identify the direct drivers of mangrove cover changes. Results showed that in Balangkayan, (Philippines), the mangrove cover increased by approximately 500 ha between 2014 and 2021, following a decline in 2013 due to Typhoon Haiyan. In Muaragembong (Indonesia), mangrove cover increased by about 176.13 ha between 2000 and 2022 after years of conversion to fish and shrimp ponds. Community perceptions in both sites revealed that natural disturbances, such as strong typhoons and coastal erosion, were the primary drivers of mangrove cover changes. The key findings of this study provide valuable insights into (1) mangrove cover changes over time, (2) proximate and underlying drivers of these changes, and (3) land use and land cover maps highlighting mangroves in less-explored sites. These local-scale observations offer global perspectives on the long-term effects of natural disasters and sustained mangrove restoration efforts on mangrove blue carbon.

T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - We assessed the influence of the intertidal and salinity gradients and mangrove forest structure on C stocks and sequestration rates in mangrove soils of an estuarine system in Todos os Santos Bay, Eastern Brazil. The accumulation rates of organic C (C-org) during the last century varied between and within estuarine zones, ranging from 65 to 1073 g C(org)m(-2)yr(-1). The mean stocks of C-org and N for the top 1 m soils were 263 +/- 14 Mg C-org ha(-1)and 11.8 +/- 0.4 Mg N ha(-1), respectively. We found a less variable distribution pattern on C-org and N stocks throughout the salinity gradient than along the intertidal gradient, being significantly higher at the fringe mangroves than at the interior forest. We estimated that Brazil, one of the major reservoirs of mangroves (similar to 10%) on the planet, has 207 +/- 34 Tg C-org in the upper meter of soils, which represents 3-8% of the C stored in mangrove soils globally. Given that Brazil is a Blue Carbon hotspot, it is emphasized the urgent need for the establishment of better mangrove conservation practices and a comprehensive evaluation of their value in climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies for reducing CO2 emissions.

TI  - Half of land use carbon emissions in Southeast Asia can be mitigated through peat swamp forest and mangrove conservation and restoration
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Southeast Asia (SEA) contributes approximately one-third of global land-use change carbon emissions, a substantial yet highly uncertain part of which is from anthropogenically-modified peat swamp forests (PSFs) and mangroves. Here, we report that between 2001-2022 land-use change impacting PSFs and mangroves in SEA generate approximately 691.8 +/- 97.2 teragrams of CO2 equivalent emissions annually (TgCO2eyr-1) or 48% of region's land-use change emissions, and carbon removal through secondary regrowth of -16.3 +/- 2.0 TgCO2eyr-1. Indonesia (73%), Malaysia (14%), Myanmar (7%), and Vietnam (2%) combined accounted for over 90% of regional emissions from these sources. Consequently, great potential exists for emissions reduction through PSFs and mangroves conservation. Moreover, restoring degraded PSFs and mangroves could provide an additional annual mitigation potential of 94.4 +/- 7.4 TgCO2eyr-1. Although peatlands and mangroves occupy only 5.4% of SEA land area, restoring and protecting these carbon-dense ecosystems can contribute substantially to climate change mitigation, while maintaining valuable ecosystem services, livelihoods and biodiversity.

TI  - Unveiling complementarities between mangrove restoration and global sustainable development goals
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia, renowned as the most mangrove-rich nation, has committed to extensive mangrove restoration policies, but the effects of these policies have yet to be systematically evaluated. Our study conducts a comprehensive network analysis to investigate the synergies between mangrove restoration policy and global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) achievements by exploring their interactions. This investigation follows the 'product space' method in economics and creates the 'Mangrove-SDG space' to assess each metric pair's co-occurrence and comparative advantages with validated stability. Our analysis unveils a tripartite structure, encompassing socio-economic and environmental clusters, each significantly contributing to global sustainability and a distinctive mangrove cluster tied to land attributes. At the Goal level, mangrove loss showcases robust synergies with SDGs 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and 13 (Climate Change), and mangrove metrics such as tropical storm frequency and mangrove change, indicating strong interdependences between mangrove forests and SDGs. The result indicates that improved performance of climate change and responsible consumption can greatly enhance mangrove forests' performance in alleviating mangrove loss and reducing tropical storms. Moreover, our analysis underscores the central roles played by 'bridge' Goals. Indicator-level space details how they warrant prioritization because of their cascade synergistic enhancements across widely interconnected indicators, triggering systematic positive improvements. Turning to Indonesia, we advocate a strategic shift from solely expanding mangrove extent to focusing on four critical policy priorities: effective nitrogen management, enhancing Ramsar site efficiency, optimizing logistic performance, and addressing urban population conditions. These priorities are pivotal to seeking complementarities between Indonesia's international sustainability commitment and fostering mangrove restoration success.

TI  - Low carbon growth in Indonesia
T2  - BULLETIN OF INDONESIAN ECONOMIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia has responded to worldwide concern about climate change by committing to significant carbon emissions reductions over the next decade. Achievement of this goal will face significant practical obstacles, and the opportunity cost of avoided deforestation is considerable. In our second Policy Dialogue, two climate change experts present contributions to the debate. This exchange could not be more timely, given Norway's recent offer of substantial development assistance to Indonesia in return for reductions in deforestation and forest degradation. In this first contribution, Adam Schwarz canvasses abatement options and outlines barriers to abatement and its measurement. These include capacity and data constraints, obstacles posed by decentralisation, and problems in identifying and measuring the costs of abatement measures. The author urges Indonesia to embrace the opportunity a lower carbon growth trajectory presents, and argues that this will require substantial additional funding, including from developed countries, and sustained leadership.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The impacts of climate change, such as increasing temperature, erratic rainfall pattern, sea level rise, etc., are being increasingly reported. These impacts are destructive for human activities and thus the development and improvement of mitigation and adaptation strategies is a priority globally. In the least developed and developing countries, adequate adaptive capacities are required so to boost the resilience of communities towards the projected climate change projected. Moreover, activities of climate change adaptation not only provide solutions and strategies to deal with climate change, but also encourage sustainable development. This comparative study evaluates projects in three countries: Mongolia, The Philippines, and Timor Leste, by mapping and contrasting the factors that contribute to adaptive capacity and support sustainable development. A heuristic matrix was used to articulate the capacities that influenced the desired outcomes of each project. Some key components of adaptive capacity were identified in each context. The interaction of those components improved the generic and specific capacity at individual and system level then ultimately improved resilience towards climate change.

TI  - Win-wins or trade-offs? Site and strategy determine carbon and local ecosystem service benefits for protection, restoration, and agroforestry
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nature-based solutions (NBS) can deliver many benefits to human wellbeing, including some crucial to climate adaptation. We quantitatively assess the global potential of NBS strategies of protection, restoration, and agroforestry by modeling global climate change mitigation and local ecosystem services (water availability, sediment retention, runoff, pollination, nitrogen retention, green water storage, and coastal protection). The strategies with the most potential to help people do not necessarily deliver the most climate change mitigation: per area of conservation action, agroforestry provides substantial benefits (>20% increase in at least one local ecosystem service) to three times more people on average than reforestation while providing less than one tenth the carbon sequestration per unit area. Each strategy delivers a different suite of ecosystem service benefits; for instance, avoided forest conversion provides a strong increase in nitrogen retention (100% increase to 72 million people if fully implemented globally) while agroforestry increases pollination services (100% increase to 3.0 billion people if fully implemented globally). One common disservice shared by all the NBS strategies modeled here is that increased woody biomass increases transpiration, reducing annual runoff and in some watersheds negatively impacting local water availability. In addition, the places with the greatest potential for climate change mitigation are not necessarily the ones with the most people. For instance, reforestation in Latin America has the greatest climate change mitigation potential, but the greatest ecosystem service benefits are in Africa. Focusing on nations with high climate mitigation potential as well as high local ecosystem service potential, such as Nigeria in the case of reforestation, India for agroforestry, and the Republic of Congo for avoided forest conversion, can help identify win-win sites for implementation. We find that concentrating implementation of these three conservation strategies in critical places, covering 5.8 million km(2), could benefit 2.0 billion people with increased local ecosystem services provision. These critical places cover only 35% of the possible area of implementation but would provide 80% of the benefits that are possible globally for the selected set of ecosystem services under the NBS scenarios examined here. We conclude that targeting these critical places for protection, restoration, and agroforestry interventions will be key to achieving adaptation and human wellbeing goals while also increasing nature-based carbon mitigation.

AB  - Economic growth has led to tremendous environmental changes including resulted pollution, overexploitation of natural resources (biodiversity), converted land/sea (reclamation) and increasing carbon emissions. How developing countries have ability to manage climate change impacts as committed in international climate agreement such as the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), UNFCCC, COP 21 and so on, is important to be analyzed. As middle income countries, most developing countries (such as Indonesia) have already dealed with other various issues - political, economic, social, etc - in which most government put their priorities and allocate most of their resources to solve those challenges. It is critical to provide policy framework on adaptation and mitigation of climate change impact to strengthen national resilience. As conceptual paper this study aims to analyse the policy governance that integrate the perspective of social and economic issues to address the impacts of climate change on particular case. By exploring global issues of multi level perspectives, this paper provides several propositions for policy makers to strengthen the key strategic policy in national and local contexts of climate change challenges.

TI  - Building Disaster Resilience in Thousand Islands (Indonesia): Unlocking Climate Adaptation Strategies to Navigate Sea Level Rise in Coastal Regions while Safeguarding Crop Productivity and Local Biodiversity
T2  - ACS ES&T WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change causes sea levels to rise, threatening the lives of people living on coastal islands. However, none has studied how communities can adapt to the changing environment and build climate resilience. To address this issue, the work unlocks adaptation strategies for climate-induced sea level rise in coastal islands. The Thousand Islands (Indonesia) was used as a case study due to their low-lying areas and reliance on agriculture. This work identifies best practices and local challenges due to climate change that could be applicable to other coastal regions. Data collection was undertaken through semistructured interviews with stakeholders. It is evident that adaptation strategies in coastal regions need to be participatory due to the importance of local knowledge and community empowerment. Community's adaptation initiatives include mangrove restoration and giant seawall construction. There was a 15% increase in species richness and a 10% increase in ecosystem resilience in areas where adaptive measures were applied. The barriers of climate adaptation cover the lack of resources and institutional constraints. It is crucial for the government to collaborate with stakeholders to implement climate adaptation strategies based on local needs. Overall, this work highlights the need for regional collaboration to tackle climate impacts on the rising sea level in coastal areas.

TI  - Modelling spatial-temporal changes in carbon sequestration by mangroves in an urban coastal landscape
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove deforestation by land use conversions is the greatest threat to the conservation of coastal ecosystems, ranking Brazil as a country with high gross annual CO2 emissions. Despite the recognized socio-ecological importance in providing essential ecosystem services (e.g., erosion prevention, protection against extreme weather events, provision of habitats for estuarine species, and blue carbon storage), mangroves have been converted from blue carbon sinks to sources. Here, we modelled and evaluated the spatial-temporal changes in blue carbon stocks and net sequestration potential in mangrove forests in Santos and Sao Vicente, Brazil, from 1988 to 2050. We used classified images obtained from MapBiomas and the InVEST Coastal Blue Carbon model, which quantifies the potential carbon sequestered in the study area based on changes in the land use and land cover over the determined study period. We found an increased trend in carbon stocks and net sequestration of mangroves in both municipalities. Over the analysis period, carbon stocks in the mangroves of the city of Santos increased 29% in total, while we found a smaller rise (14%) in Sao Vicente. We found that land use changed substantially during 1988 until 2018, with mangrove extent varying in the region from 3,375 ha in 1988 to 3,764 ha in 2018 within the entire study region. Overall, the net carbon sequestration was approximately 925,393 Mg CO(2)e and 287,130 Mg CO(2)e, in Santos and Sao Vicente, respectively, over a period from 1988 to 2050. To our knowledge, this study is the first to quantify soil carbon stock and accumulation in mangroves along an urban coastal landscape in Brazil and emphasizes the current and future role of mangroves in climate change mitigation. Our findings can support the development of public policies for mangrove conservation and restoration actions to mitigate climate impacts.

TI  - Wetland Raised-Field Agriculture and Its Contribution to Sustainability: Ethnoecology of a Present-Day African System and Questions about Pre-Columbian Systems in the American Tropics
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - One adaptation for farming wetlands is constructing raised fields (RF), i.e., elevated earth structures. Studies of RF agriculture have focused mostly on the vestiges of RF that were cultivated by pre-Columbian populations in the Americas. Ironically, whereas RF agriculture is still practiced nowadays in many parts of the world, including the Congo Basin, these actively farmed RF have received scant attention. Yet, studying how RF function today can shed new light on ongoing debates about pre-Columbian RF agriculture. Also, in a context of climate change and widespread degradation of wetlands, the study of RF agriculture can help us evaluate its potential as part of an environmentally sustainable use of wetlands. We carried out an ethnoecological study of RF agriculture combining qualitative and quantitative methods over a total of eight months' fieldwork in the Congo Basin. We found that RF show great diversity in size and shape and perform several functions. Incorporation of grasses such as green manure, allows RF to produce high yields, and RF agriculture decreases flooding risk. However, it is labor-intensive and is likely always only one component of a multi-activity subsistence system, in which fishing plays a great role, that is both resilient and sustainable.

TI  - Zonation of aquatic plant communities along a flooding gradient in subtropical wetlands
T2  - FOLIA GEOBOTANICA
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Aquatic plants play a crucial role in wetlands, and understanding distribution patterns and species composition can be valuable for several purposes. Here, we assessed aquatic plants distribution along a flooding gradient in the transition region between terrestrial and aquatic environments within a wetland complex. We investigated the presence of distinct zones in terms of species richness, composition (beta diversity) and life forms. We established transects along the shoreline and defined three zones along each transect: the occasionally flooded zone (zone 1), the water-land interface zone (zone 2), and the water body zone (zone 3). Clear zonation patterns were identified due to occurrences restricted to portions of the gradient and variations in the cover of species and life forms. The gradient displayed high beta diversity, with zones 1 and 3 differing significantly in species composition. Turnover explained the observed variation, associated with environmental filtering and interspecific interactions. There was no significant decrease in richness with increasing water depth. Amphibious plants dominated along the gradient. Our study highlights that the life forms inhabiting wetlands, particularly in the transitional aquatic-terrestrial region, represent an adaptive continuum ranging from plants that tolerate temporary submergence to those strictly limited to the aquatic environment. We propose a framework for classifying these plants. Understanding species distribution patterns is crucial for delineating wetland boundaries and gaining valuable insights into wetland conservation and restoration, particularly in light of escalating threats and the impacts of climate change.

TI  - Plantation forestry in Brazil: Projections to 2050
T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil is fortunate in having large areas of land that are not currently forested but that are suitable for silvicultural plantations. Changes in the area and regional distribution of the country's silvicultural plantations imply a wide variety of environmental and social impacts. Projections of future development of plantation silviculture are needed for analyzing these impacts, as well as to serve as a reference scenario for evaluating the potential effects of climatic change on Brazil's plantations, and for the related task of evaluating the implications of proposals to combat global warming by increasing the area of silvicultural plantations in Brazil beyond the extent to which they would otherwise expand. Such a reference scenario provides the control, or "business as usual" standard, against which one can compare the situation as affected by climatic change and/or by additional silvicultural or other activities carried out to help mitigate climatic change. Assuming constancy of climate, technology, per-capita consumption of wood products, and Brazil's share of international trade, the area of plantations in 2050 would be 3.2 times larger than the area in 1991.

TI  - Evaluating and Adapting Climate Change Impacts on Rice Production in Indonesia: A Case Study of the Keduang Subwatershed, Central Java
T2  - ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting the effect of climate change on rice yield is crucial as global food demand rapidly increases with the human population. This study combined simulated daily weather data (MarkSim) and the CERES-Rice crop model from the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) software to predict rice production for three planting seasons under four climate change scenarios (RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) for the years 2021 to 2050 in the Keduang subwatershed, Wonogiri Regency, Central Java, Indonesia. The CERES-Rice model was calibrated and validated for the local rice cultivar (Ciherang) with historical data using GenCalc software. The model evaluation indicated good performance with both calibration (coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.89, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) = 0.88) and validation (R-2 = 0.87, NSE = 0.76). Our results suggest that the predicted changing rainfall patterns, rising temperature, and intensifying solar radiation under climate change can reduce the rice yield in all three growing seasons. Under RCP 8.5, the impact on rice yield in the second dry season may decrease by up to 11.77% in the 2050s. Relevant strategies associated with policies based on the results were provided for decision makers. Furthermore, to adapt the impact of climate change on rice production, a dynamic cropping calendar, modernization of irrigation systems, and integrated plant nutrient management should be developed for farming practices based on our results in the study area. Our study is not only the first assessment of the impact of climate change on the study site but also provides solutions under projected rice shortages that threaten regional food security.

TI  - Enhancing climate change resilience of ecological restoration-A framework for action
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration is a tool for climate change mitigation and adaptation, and yet its outcomes are susceptible themselves to climate change impacts. Drawing on the literature documenting this in theory and practice, we present a comprehensive overview of climate change risks and considerations across the whole life cycle of a restoration initiative. The resulting framework identified seven areas of restoration design and implementation in which climate change is important to address: setting restoration objectives, selecting sites and managing connectivity, choosing target species and ecosystems, managing key ecosystem interactions and micro-climates, identifying and mitigating site-level climate change risks, aligning the project with long-term policies, and designing a monitoring framework that enables adaptive management. A scan of restoration projects focussing on two regions - Brazil and countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN - revealed limited inclusion of these considerations in practice, with less than 5% of the projects evidently addressing at least one of the seven areas. We discuss two projects showing good practice in climate resilient restoration: restoration of Atlantic forest in Brazil that plans for climate change in connectivity and hydrological management, species selection, and policy alignment, and crayweed underwater forest restoration in Sydney, Australia, whose careful attention to species provenance, genotype measurement and monitoring provided a "future-proofing" approach to restoration success in the long term. Building on such examples, our framework can be used as a tool to support global restoration targets and the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030 through more climate resilient restoration.

TI  - The role of peatland degradation, protection and restoration for climate change mitigation in the SSP scenarios
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH-CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands only cover a small fraction of the global land surface (similar to 3%) but store large amounts of carbon (similar to 600 GtC). Drainage of peatlands for agriculture results in the decomposition of organic matter, leading to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. As a result, degraded peatlands are currently responsible for 2%-3% of global anthropogenic emissions. Preventing further degradation of peatlands and restoration (i.e. rewetting) are therefore important for climate change mitigation. In this study, we show that land-use change in three SSP scenarios with optimistic, recent trends, and pessimistic assumptions leads to peatland degradation between 2020 and 2100 ranging from -7 to +10 Mha (-23% to +32%), and a continuation or even an increase in annual GHG emissions (-0.1 to +0.4 GtCO2-eq yr-1). In default mitigation scenarios without a specific focus on peatlands, peatland degradation is reduced due to synergies with forest protection and afforestation policies. However, this still leaves large amounts of GHG emissions from degraded peatlands unabated, causing cumulative CO2 emissions from 2020 to 2100 in an SSP2-1.5 degrees C scenario of 73 GtCO2. In a mitigation scenario with dedicated peatland restoration policy, GHG emissions from degraded peatlands can be reduced to nearly zero without major effects on projected land-use dynamics. This underlines the opportunity of peatland protection and restoration for climate change mitigation and the need to synergistically combine different land-based mitigation measures. Peatland location and extent estimates vary widely in the literature; a sensitivity analysis implementing various spatial estimates shows that especially in tropical regions degraded peatland area and peatland emissions are highly uncertain. The required protection and mitigation efforts are geographically unequally distributed, with large concentrations of peatlands in Russia, Europe, North America and Indonesia (33% of emission reductions are located in Indonesia). This indicates an important role for only a few countries that have the opportunity to protect and restore peatlands with global benefits for climate change mitigation.

TI  - Reforestation can compensate negative effects of climate change on amphibians
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate and land-use change are major drivers of biodiversity loss, but their combined effects are still unclear. Reforestation may compensate or reduce climate change impacts on species, but this hypothesis has not been tested yet. Here we quantify the additive and synergistic effects of forest change - in particular, reforestation - and climate changes on ten endemic and forest-dependent anurans of the Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot. We estimated climatic and habitat suitability for all species under historical and future (2050) conditions, using niche modeling and forest cover maps from a comprehensive land-use model. We contrasted a pessimistic landuse scenario, with little change in forest cover, with an optimistic scenario, with forest gain through restoration of "legal reserve" areas. Our models show that climate change will have species-specific effects on anurans, increasing climatic suitability for seven species, but decreasing for three. For these three species, we predict that forest gain can compensate the negative impact of climate change, increasing overall environmental suitability. These results reinforce the importance of ensuring reforestation and forest protection as a climate change adaptation strategy for biodiversity.

TI  - Perceptions of climate change and local responses on livelihoods: the case of people around the Mambioko community forest
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest provides services, directly linked to micro and macro environment, water and soil resources, plants and animals' diversity, food production and security and energy resources. This study contributes to other studies and growing literature on climate change impacts and adaptation strategies in the Congo Basin forest, particularly Cameroon's forest region. Mambioko has a four-season climate, with annual precipitation of 2000-3000 mm and temperature variations of 21.8-30.8 degrees C, most of its agriculture is rainfed. It has an evergreen or semi-deciduous rainforest corresponds to the ""humid"" and "low- and medium-altitude sub-humid" eco-floristic zones. This study is carried out to identify and assess climate change impacts on the livelihoods of forest-dependent communities in Mambioko community forest in Cameroon. Primary data were collected from 85 households; key informants, and focus group discussions and were supplemented with secondary data from a desk review of relevant literature. The study shows that climate change impacts the major livelihood activities of forest-dependent communities through prolonged drought, erratic rainfall patterns, and variability in rainfall intensity. Four of the critical activities of local communities impacted by climate change are agriculture, hunting, fishing and collecting non-timber forest products. People respond to the negative impacts by adopting simple irrigation systems, crop diversification, alternative livelihood activities, and increasing their farm sizes. This study concludes that future interventions to help forest-dependent communities cope with climate change impacts will require pursuing alternative non-climate-dependent livelihood activities, increasing access to climate information, and adopting sustainable agricultural and forest management practices.

TI  - Bioenergy-livestock integration in Brazil: Unraveling potentials for energy production and climate change mitigation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Future projections indicate an expansion for both food and energy demands, which can increase pressure on land use, while there is an urgent global need for climate change mitigation. Bioenergy is foreseen as key option to meet future energy demands and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, however its sustainability depends on locations and regional characteristics. Simultaneously, agricultural production models that co-produce food, feed, and energy offer sustainability synergies and co-benefits, but site-specific sustainability assessments of their large-scale implementation are missing. This study presents a bottom-up approach to assess spatially explicit sustainability aspects of bioenergy-livestock integrated systems (BLI) in Brazil and shed light on their contribution to future energy demands, to climate change mitigation targets, and their impacts on selected ecosystem services, including bioenergy production, climate change mitigation, reduction of food competition, biodiversity conservation, and avoided deforestation. The proposed integration considers livestock intensification and use of biofuels by-products as animal feed supplement, taking advantage of synergies between these two value chains. The expansion of the BLI system in the Center-South region of Brazil produce up to 89 billion liters of ethanol, enough to meet future domestic ethanol demands from multiple shared socioeconomic pathways and generating surpluses for export. This production takes place on 16 million hectares of pastureland within the Sugarcane Agroecological Zoning, excluding the Amazon and Pantanal biomes, and biodiversity hotspots. BLI expansion mitigate up to 250 million tonnes of CO2eq and generate 15 billion dollars of profits. The best locations to maximize the selected ecosystem services are west of Sa similar to o Paulo, east of Mato Grosso do Sul, and the south-central region of the states of Goi ' as. This study may encourage the formulation of enhanced public policies for the integration of bioenergy and livestock value chains and guide a sustainable large-scale deployment of BLI systems.

TI  - Present and future distribution of endangered and economically important Ocotea species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest: Implications for conservation and restoration
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat destruction and climate change are major threats to global biodiversity. Economically important species are even more susceptible to these drivers, as their already vulnerable populations experience additional stress. This is exemplified by species such as Ocotea catharinensis , O. odorifera , and O. porosa , which have been extensively exploited and are mainly found in the highly degraded Atlantic Forest hotspot. In this context, this study aimed to assess the effects of climate change on the distribution of these species and identify priority areas to support conservation and restoration measures. The MaxEnt algorithm was employed to estimate the current and future distribution of the three species under two time periods (2040 and 2080) and climate change scenarios (SSP 245 and SSP 585). The obtained information was then used to assess land use change within the species distribution range, focusing on suitable regions within legally protected areas and on lands that need to be restored to comply with the Brazilian forest code. The analysis revealed that habitat loss, particularly due to forest conversion for forestry use, remains a significant threat to these species. Furthermore, climate change is projected to cause reductions in suitable habitats for all species. The predicted reduction ranges from 32% to 67% for O. catharinensis , 39 -86% for O. odorifera , and 26 -69% for O. porosa , depending on the year and climate change scenario. These results indicate a potential worsening of their conservation status in the coming years. A concerning mismatch was observed between the conservation target and legally protected suitable areas in future scenarios, particularly affecting O. catharinensis and O. porosa . Additionally, a significant portion of the suitable areas falls within lands that require restoration. Our findings highlight climate change as an additional risk factor for the conservation of these already endangered species. The results provided by this study can support the development of ex situ and in situ conservation strategies aiming at safeguarding these ecologically and economically valuable species.

TI  - A global map of mangrove forest soil carbon at 30 m spatial resolution
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the growing recognition that effective action on climate change will require a combination of emissions reductions and carbon sequestration, protecting, enhancing and restoring natural carbon sinks have become political priorities. Mangrove forests are considered some of the most carbon-dense ecosystems in the world with most of the carbon stored in the soil. In order for mangrove forests to be included in climate mitigation efforts, knowledge of the spatial distribution of mangrove soil carbon stocks are critical. Current global estimates do not capture enough of the finer scale variability that would be required to inform local decisions on siting protection and restoration projects. To close this knowledge gap, we have compiled a large georeferenced database of mangrove soil carbon measurements and developed a novel machine-learning based statistical model of the distribution of carbon density using spatially comprehensive data at a 30 m resolution. This model, which included a prior estimate of soil carbon from the global SoilGrids 250 m model, was able to capture 63% of the vertical and horizontal variability in soil organic carbon density (RMSE of 10.9 kg m(-3)). Of the local variables, total suspended sediment load and Landsat imagery were the most important variable explaining soil carbon density. Projecting this model across the global mangrove forest distribution for the year 2000 yielded an estimate of 6.4 Pg C for the top meter of soil with an 86-729 Mg C ha(-1) range across all pixels. By utilizing remotely-sensed mangrove forest cover change data, loss of soil carbon due to mangrove habitat loss between 2000 and 2015 was 30-122 Tg C with >75% of this loss attributable to Indonesia, Malaysia and Myanmar. The resulting map products from this work are intended to serve nations seeking to include mangrove habitats in payment-for ecosystem services projects and in designing effective mangrove conservation strategies.

TI  - Correlation between global warming mitigation knowledge, attitudes, and community behavior in mangrove forests in Langsa City, Indonesia
T2  - CLEANER WASTE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forest destruction in Langsa City is caused by land conversion into ponds and illegal logging for charcoal production. Knowledge of global warming mitigation through mangrove conservation and rehabilitation is important for the community to have a positive and environmentally friendly attitude. The study aims to: (1) evaluate community knowledge about global warming mitigation through mangrove conservation and rehabilitation, (2) analyze the relationship between the attitudes and behavior of people living near mangrove forests, and (3) examine the relationship between knowledge, attitudes, and behavior of people living near mangrove forests. The study was conducted in Cinta Raja and Kuala Langsa Villages using a quantitative correlational design approach. The research population was the entire local community; samples were taken by purposive sampling based on data collection activities through structured interviews, observations, and documentation. The results of the study showed that the variable of community attitudes towards mangrove forests was in the good category (77 %), while mitigation knowledge (69 %) and conservative behavior (67 %) were in the moderate category. Positive attitudes were strongly correlated with conservative behavior and had a significant effect, while knowledge played a role in shaping attitudes but did not directly influence behavior. Therefore, increasing knowledge is a strategic step to strengthen mangrove conservation efforts. Contribution: Increasing knowledge of global warming mitigation can strengthen positive attitudes and encourage conservative behavior among people in mangrove forests. It is recommended to increase education, socialization, support from local organizations, and mangrove conservation and rehabilitation practices to support global warming mitigation.

TI  - Climate change mitigation potential of Atlantic Forest reforestations
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - International agendas focus on limiting unchecked climate change through extensive mitigation. Worldwide, several reforestation initiatives strive to achieve ambitious goals and promote carbon sequestration on land. The greatest potential for reforestation lies within the tropics, and the Atlantic Forest is among the protagonists. However, little is known about the potential of these reforestations to mitigate climate change. Here, we assessed the carbon sequestration potential of Atlantic Forest reforestations, both in the field and in the available scientific literature. We demonstrate that the Atlantic Forest reforestations provide valuable contributions to climate change mitigation. Even at young age, reforestations have astonishing potential, with much higher carbon sequestration rates than un-assisted natural regeneration of later successional stages. Although with lesser potential, un-assisted natural regeneration remnants can also be a valuable strategy to aid climate mitigation, especially when close to reforestations or old-growth forests. We found far greater potential of sequestration in all types of forests inside protected areas than unprotected ones, highlighting the noteworthy benefits of conservation that buffers degradation. Climate action is urgent, and the Atlantic Forest certainly is a great contributor to the achievement of such ambitious goals.

TI  - Climate change threatens native potential agroforestry plant species in Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is one of the main drivers of species extinction in the twentyfirst-century. Here, we (1) quantify potential changes in species' bioclimatic area of habitat (BAH) of 135 native potential agroforestry species from the Brazilian flora, using two different climate change scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) and dispersal scenarios, where species have no ability to disperse and reach new areas (non-dispersal) and where species can migrate within the estimated BAH (full dispersal) for 2041-2060 and 2061-2080. We then (2) assess the preliminary conservation status of each species based on IUCN criteria. Current and future potential habitats for species were predicted using MaxEnt, a machine-learning algorithm used to estimate species' probability distribution. Future climate is predicted to trigger a mean decline in BAH between 38.5-56.3% under the non-dispersal scenario and between 22.3-41.9% under the full dispersal scenario for 135 native potential agroforestry species. Additionally, we found that only 4.3% of the studied species could be threatened under the IUCN Red List criteria B1 and B2. However, when considering the predicted quantitative habitat loss due to climate change (A3c criterion) the percentages increased between 68.8-84.4% under the non-dispersal scenario and between 40.7-64.4% under the full dispersal scenario. To lessen such threats, we argue that encouraging the use of these species in rural and peri-urban agroecosystems are promising, complementary strategies for their long-term conservation.

TI  - Synergy potential between climate change mitigation and forest conservation policies in the Indonesian forest sector: implications for achieving multiple sustainable development objectives
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - There has been growing interest in achieving multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by identifying effective interactions or synergy potential among measures/policies on sustainable development. The simultaneous implementation of climate change mitigation (SDG 13) and forest protection (SDG 15) is an example of an interaction where the measures/policies that contribute to both goals can be identified and the overlaps eliminated. However, there are limited studies that quantitatively evaluate the synergy potential in the forest sector. This study is the first attempt to examine the synergy potential in the forest sector in Indonesia focusing on climate change mitigation and forest protection. We evaluated four scenarios that differentiated climate and forest policy options and assessed the effectiveness of implementing these two policies simultaneously by 2030, using a computable general equilibrium model and a land-use model. We found that the additional efforts needed for emission reduction were larger for the scenario not considering forest protection than for that considering forest protection. This caused differences in the mitigation measures introduced and the resulting land use that depended on the scenario. Consequently, mitigation costs would be reduced by implementing mitigation and forest protection policies simultaneously, suggesting that the synergy effect in the forest sector in Indonesia does exist. This also implies simultaneous contributions to SDGs 13 and 15 (Targets 13.2 and 15.2). To realize such synergies, which have not yet been considered, it is necessary for policymakers to fill the institutional gaps between the policies/strategies of mitigation and forest conservation and enforce the policies for SDGs.

T2  - CARBON MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Paulo Moutinho(dagger 1), Osvaldo Stella Martins', Mariana Christovam(1), Andre Lima(1), Daniel Nepstad(1) & Ana Carolina Crisostomo(1) Brazil has exercised a leadership in the International scene about climate change mitigation and adaptation. Internally, it has been demonstrating institutional, legal and technical capacity to monitor and reduce deforestation in the Amazon, capacities also required to the development of a national Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) system. In this article, we present the progress on the REDD+ debate under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Brazilian government trajectory towards a positive REDD+ agenda. We also discuss the relevant Brazilian legislation that can support a REDD+ regime: the National Policy for Climate Change, the Amazon state plans for deforestation reduction and the current debate and proposal of a REDD+ regime in Brazil, discussing their contexts, threats and opportunities. Funding opportunities are also discussed, with emphasis on the role of the Amazon Fund on fostering the REDD+ activities in Brazil. At the end, we propose a mechanism of REDD+ benefits sharing, based on a stock-target and flow approach.

TI  - Towards understanding climate change impacts: monitoring the vegetation dynamics of terrestrial national parks in Indonesia
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring vegetation dynamics in terrestrial national parks (TNPs) is crucial for ensuring sustainable environmental management and mitigating the potential negative impacts of short- and long-term disturbances understanding the effect of climate change within natural and protected areas. This study aims to monitor the vegetation dynamics of TNPs in Indonesia by first categorizing them into the regions of Sumatra, Jawa, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Eastern Indonesia and then applying ready-to-use MODIS EVI time-series imageries (MOD13Q1) taken from 2000 to 2022 on the GEE cloud-computing platform. Specifically, this research investigates the greening and browning fraction trends using Sen's slope, considers seasonality by analyzing the maximum and minimum EVI values, and assesses anomalous years by comparing the annual time series and long-term median EVI value. The findings reveal significantly increasing greening trends in most TNPs, except Danau Sentarum, from 2000 to 2022. The seasonality analysis shows that most TNPs exhibit peak and trough greenness at the end of the rainy and dry seasons, respectively, as the vegetation response to precipitation increases and decreases. Anomalies in seasonality that is affected by climate change was detected in all of the regions. To increase TNPs resilience, suggested measures include active reforestation and implementation of Assisted Natural Regeneration, strengthen the enforcement of fundamental managerial task, and forest fire management.

TI  - Strengthening Infrastructure Resilience for Climate Change Mitigation: Case Studies from the Southeast Asia Region with a Focus on Wastewater Treatment Plants in Addressing Flooding Challenges
T2  - ACS ES&T WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - Climate change poses challenges to infrastructure resilience in Southeast Asia's flood-prone regions. This study identifies and evaluates strategies for enhancing infrastructure resilience through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia. Using a mixed-method approach, we analyzed the case studies and conducted quantitative assessments of flood mitigation efforts. Data were collected (2021-2024) through site visits, interviews with key stakeholders, and analysis of historical flood and infrastructure performance data. Data analysis involved statistical methods for assessing their effectiveness and comparative analyses across them. Singapore reduced flood-prone areas by 30% using integrated WWTP technologies with drainage systems, while Malaysia developed resilient infrastructure networks with WWTPs designed to withstand extreme weather, preventing 85% of contamination cases. Thailand combined green and blue infrastructure with WWTPs, decreasing flood vulnerability by 25%. Indonesia invested in decentralized WWTPs in urban areas, increasing infrastructure resilience by 40%. Nature-based solutions, such as ecological restoration, reduce flooding impacts by 20%. The implications for policymakers and practitioners include the need to integrate advanced technologies and nature-based solutions to bolster infrastructure resilience and mitigate flooding risks. This study offers insights into developing effective climate change adaptation strategies in flood-vulnerable regions, emphasizing the critical role of WWTPs in enhancing infrastructure resilience.

TI  - Climate change mitigation actions in Brazil
T2  - CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents and discusses the main findings of a study focusing on climate change mitigation actions (MAs) in Brazil. Brazilian government presented to the 15th Conference of the Parties of the Climate Change Convention held in Copenhagen in 2009 (UNFCCC COP15) voluntary mitigation goals: a reduction in between 36.1 and 38.9% of the country's green house gases (GHG) emissions projected to 2020. If Brazil meets its voluntary goals, its GHG emissions in 2020 will be 6-10% lower than in 2005. The main research question addressed in this study is what conditions should Brazil meet to achieve its pledge? It discusses how MAs are approached, conceptualized and planned in Brazil. It describes how the country identifies MAs and the contextual framework used to define them. It also maps the initiatives underway in the country, and analyses the issues faced for its successful implementation, as well as for future approaches. The main conclusion is that Brazil seems to be in a good position to meet its voluntary mitigation goals up to 2020, as avoiding deforestation will take up the bulk of the emission reduction. After 2020, Brazil will face a new challenge: combine economic development with low GHG energy-related emissions.

TI  - Domestic and international forest regime nexus in Cameroon: An assessment of the effectiveness of REDD plus policy design strategy in the context of the climate change regime
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The major goals of forest governance arrangements are sustainable forest management (SFM), poverty alleviation, and enhancement of forest biodiversity. However, in recent years, climate change mitigation, through reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD +(1)) has emerged as one of the most important aspects of forest governance arrangements. This is due to the fact that REDD + has the potential to provide a framework for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation while addressing rural poverty and conserving forest biodiversity at the same time. In other words, the REDO + scheme provides co-benefits beyond its main goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, REDD + is seen by many forest governance experts as a scheme that has the potential to slow down deforestation in a country like Cameroon, which arguably, has the highest rate of deforestation in the Congo Basin. However, this will depend on the effectiveness of Cameroon's REDD + policy strategy, its efficiency in meeting its objectives at the lowest cost, and its ability to equitably distribute costs and benefits associated with the scheme. This paper assesses the effectiveness of REDD + policy design in Cameroon within the context of the climate change regime. The paper employs the policy design approach to analyze four components of Cameroon's REDD+ policy design framework governance and institutional arrangement; emissions baseline; leakage and scale; and technical issues. An economic-based assessment of the forest transition curve and the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) reveals limitations that could render the REDO + scheme cost ineffective for Cameroon. The paper suggests that Cameroon would have to focus on strengthening its existing governance structures and nurturing its forest related international agreements, if it is to design a REDD + policy strategy that is consistent with the "nested" climate change regime approach.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Fire dynamics in the Amazon, while not fully understood, are central to designing fire management strategies and providing a baseline for projecting the effects of climate change. Aims. The study investigates the recent fire probabilities in the northeastern Amazon and project future 'fire niches' under global warming scenarios, allowing the evaluation of drivers and areas of greatest susceptibility. Methods. Using the maximum entropy method, we combined a complex set of predictors with fire occurrences detected during 2000-2020. We estimated changes in fire patterns in the near (2020-2040) and distant (2080-2100) future, under two contrasting scenarios of shared socioeconomic pathways. Key results. Based on current conditions, the spatial fire pattern is affected by farming activities and fire is more common in savannas than in forests. Over long time scales, changes toward a warmer and drier climate, independent of land cover change, are expected to create conditions more conducive to burning. Conclusion and implications. Our study helps in understanding the multiple ecological and human interactions that result in different fire regimes in the Amazon. Future efforts can improve outcomes through more complex models that couple predictions of land use and land cover changes, shifts in vegetation resulting from climate change and fires, and fuel dynamics.

TI  - Exploring actor-network and space-time production for social-ecological resilience: case study on mangrove conservation in the North Coast of Java, Indonesia
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explored actor-networks and space-time production that affected the complexity of the social-ecological resilience of coastal communities through mangrove conservation efforts using a combination of the Actor-Network Theory (ANT) and Production of Space Theory perspectives. The case study area in Jenu coastal focused on Jenu Village because of the existence of Mangrove Center Tuban (MCT) conservation area. The study applied the regressive-progressive method qualitatively through descriptive, analytic-regressive, and historical-genetic stages. Data collected technique involved observation, semi-structured and in-depth interviews, and documentation, which were subsequently analyzed using Milles and Hubberman's interactive model analysis technique. Based on the analysis results, the adaptive cycle phases of social-ecological resilience of the community in the Jenu coastal area at a range of 1958-2020 began from the creative destruction phase and ended with the conservation phase (but none repeated phases had shown). Additionally, the phases were influenced by the agency of human actors (including the founder and managers of MCT, Jenu coastal communities, Tuban District government, etc.) and non-human actors (including coastal erosion, mangroves, trucukisasi system, sea fir, etc.). Those whole actors formed the network at each translation moment in determining the process of space transformation through space-time production, resulting in three different spatial production modes (exploitative, conservation, and economic). Theoretically, each phase of the adaptive cycle, actor-network translation moment, and spatial production mode could be interrelated as an interdisciplinary perspective to explore the process of social-ecological resilience of coastal communities when facing natural hazards.

TI  - Monitoring and estimating tropical forest carbon stocks: making REDD a reality
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation in developing countries is of central importance in efforts to combat climate change. Key scientific challenges must be addressed to prevent any policy roadblocks. Foremost among the challenges is quantifying nations' carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, which requires information on forest clearing and carbon storage. Here we review a range of methods available to estimate national-level forest carbon stocks in developing countries. While there are no practical methods to directly measure all forest carbon stocks across a country, both ground-based and remote-sensing measurements of forest attributes can be converted into estimates of national carbon stocks using allometric relationships. Here we synthesize, map and update prominent forest biomass carbon databases to create the first complete set of national-level forest carbon stock estimates. These forest carbon estimates expand on the default values recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guidelines and provide a range of globally consistent estimates.

TI  - Trends and Patterns of Daily Maximum, Minimum and Mean Temperature in Brazil from 2000 to 2020
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - According to data obtained from meteorological towers, Brazil has significantly increased temperature in the past 20 years, particularly in the North and Midwest regions. Vapor pressure deficit and evapotranspiration were also analyzed, showing an increase across the entire country, confirming that the air is becoming drier. This warming trend is part of the global climate change phenomenon caused by the rise of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, fires, poor soil management practices, deforestation, and logging. The increase in temperature and dryness has profoundly impacted Brazil's climate and ecosystems, leading to intensified extreme weather events and changes in the distribution of both animal and plant species. This study highlights the importance of utilizing meteorological tower data to monitor and understand the effects of climate change in Brazil. It emphasizes the need for immediate action to address its causes and mitigate its negative impacts.

TI  - Peatland restoration as an affordable nature-based climate solution with fire reduction and conservation co-benefits in Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem restoration is increasingly employed as a nature-based solution to a range of crises. Decisions over restoration must balance limited resources, land constraints, and competing demands. Peatlands in Southeast Asia have been heavily impacted by agricultural expansion over the past three decades, with Indonesia now accounting for a substantial proportion of degraded tropical peatlands globally. Using spatial linear programming, we focus on prioritizing peatland restoration sites in Indonesia for fire risk reduction, climate change mitigation, species conservation, and cost-effectiveness. The study finds that restoring peatlands at 1 km(2) planning units can generate multiple co-benefits such as reduced fire risks by 6%-37%, attenuated extinction risks of peatland specialist bird species and mitigated climate change potential of 0.002-0.36 Pg CO(2)e yr(-1). These benefits were reduced but still of comparable magnitude when larger areas of planning (defined by village and catchment boundaries) were used. The results, although indicative, support tropical peatland restoration as a cost-efficient strategy for mitigating climate change, reducing fire, conserving biodiversity, and supporting sustainable development that can be offset by carbon prices of USD 2-37/Mg CO(2)e.

TI  - Climate change negative effects on the Neotropical fishery resources may be exacerbated by hydroelectric dams
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is now recognized as a reality and along with human pressures such as river fragmentation by dams, amplifies the threats to freshwater ecosystems and their biodiversity. In the Brazilian portion of the Upper Paraguay River Basin (UPRB) that encompasses the Pantanal, one of the largest tropical wetlands in the world, in addition to the high biodiversity found there, fisheries are an important ecosystem service mostly supported by migratory fishes. We estimated the current range of migratory fish of commercial interest, also assessing the climate change effects predicted on the distribution patterns. Then, we assessed the effects of future climate on fish richness, and combining species ranges with routes blocked by artificial darns investigated possible impacts on fishery and food security in the UPRB. Climate change will induce range contraction between 47% and 100% for the species analyzed, and only four migratory fish may have suitable habitat until the end-of-century. The local richness will reduce about 85% in the basin. River fragmentation by dams acting together with climate change will prevent upstream shifts for most fish species. About 4% of present range and up to 45% of future range of migratory fish should be blocked by darns in UPRB. Consequently, this will also negatively affect fishery yield and food security in the future.

TI  - Does conservation agriculture deliver climate change mitigation through soil carbon sequestration in tropical agro-ecosystems?
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation agriculture (CA), comprising minimum soil disturbance, retention of crop residues and crop diversification, is widely promoted for reducing soil degradation and improving agricultural sustainability. It is also claimed to mitigate climate change through soil carbon sequestration: we conducted a meta-analysis of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock changes under CA practices in two tropical regions, the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), to quantify this. In IGP annual increases in SOC stock compared to conventional practice were between 0.16 and 0.49 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). In SSA increases were between 0.28 and 0.96 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), but with much greater variation and a significant number of cases with no measurable increase. Most reported SOC stock increases under CA are overestimates because of errors introduced by inappropriate soil sampling methodology. SOC increases require careful interpretation to assess whether or not they represent genuine climate change mitigation as opposed to redistribution of organic C within the landscape or soil profile. In smallholder farming in tropical regions social and economic barriers can greatly limit adoption of CA, further decreasing realistic mitigation potential. Comparison with the decreases in greenhouse gas emissions possible through improved management of nitrogen (N) fertilizer in regions such as IGP where N use is already high, suggests that this is a more effective and sustainable means of mitigating climate change. However the mitigation potential, and other benefits, from crop diversification are frequently overlooked when considering CA and warrant greater attention. Increases in SOC concentration (as opposed to stock) in near-surface soil from CA cause improvements in soil physical conditions; these are expected to contribute to increased sustainability and climate change adaptation, though not necessarily leading to consistently increased crop yields. CA should be promoted on the basis of these factors and any climate change mitigation regarded as an additional benefit, not a major policy driver for its adoption. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rules governing the REDD (Reductions of Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) scheme have yet to be established. Different national interests compete within the debate oil baselines in order to maximize expected gains. The scheme Could have a deleterious impact on the carbon market through massive hot air creation (fake emission reductions), and ultimately oil the Current international climate change regime derived from the cap-and-trade architecture adopted by the Kyoto Protocol. The political economy of avoided deforestation is frequently overlooked as is the issue of additionality, although both of them are more critical with deforestation at national level than they Could be with project-based CDM. An alternative REDD architecture which relies on I special fund would not only allow protection of the 0 carbon market against massive flooding by non additional credits, but could also help finance potentially efficient policies and measures. Sustaining long-term adequate funding is still an issue to be addressed on a multilateral basis.

TI  - Detecting and interpreting secondary forest on an old Amazonian frontier
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land uses that replace tropical forests are important determinants of terrestrial carbon storage and biodiversity. This includes secondary forest growth after deforestation, which has been integrated into the REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) concept as a means to enhance current forest carbon stocks. Incorporating secondary forest into climate change mitigation efforts requires both accurate measurements and a means to target interventions to achieve additionality. We demonstrate how remote sensing and household survey data can be combined to meet these requirements in 'old frontiers' of the Brazilian Amazon and introduce the idea that annual land-cover transitions - measured at the pixel level and over time - can serve as leading indicators of secondary forest regrowth. The patterns we observe are consistent with the suggested tension between equity and additionality in REDD+: the poorest households on the poorest quality lots already allow forest regeneration. Policy interventions to encourage regeneration are likely to have the greatest additional impact on higher quality lots owned by better capitalized households.

TI  - Forest regeneration may reduce the negative impacts of climate change on the biodiversity of a tropical hotspot
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Evaluate how large-scale forest regeneration based on a low-cost restoration method may mitigate the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation associated to future climate changes on the distribution of birds and arboreal mammals in a tropical biodiversity hotspot; find areas with different current and future potential species richness and assess how passive restoration can reduce the risk of species extinction. Location Brazilian Atlantic Forest (BAF). Methods We built a forest regeneration scenario via a model of seed dispersal based on the potential movement of frugivorous fauna and projected the potential distribution of 356 bird species and 21 arboreal mammals based on Species Distribution Models (SDM) which employed 79,462 occurrence records and four algorithms for different climate and landscape scenarios. SDM were based on climate and landscape predictors separately and the results were combined into maps of species richness. Finally, we assessed the species' risk of extinction based on the species-area relationship. Results Without considering the effects of climate change, the potential distribution area for each species increases on average by 72.5% (SD = 8%) in the scenario of potential regeneration. Climate change decreases the area of potential occurrence of 252 species, which may suffer a mean reduction of 74.4% (SD = 9.3%) in their current potential distribution areas. BAF regions with the largest amounts of forest had the greatest potential richness of species. In future climate scenario, 3.4% of species may become extinct, but we show that large-scale regeneration may prevent these extinctions. Main conclusions Despite the possible negative impacts of climate change on the distribution of 67% of the studied species, which would increase the risk of species extinction, our analysis indicated that promoting large-scale BAF restoration based on natural regeneration may prevent biodiversity loss.

TI  - An AHP Assessment Of Barriers in Adopting Sustainable Forest Management Practices in The Context Of Carbon Emission Reductions in Cameroon
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - As the role of forests in climate change mitigation is explicitly recognized in the Paris Agreement, the need to enhance the adoption of Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) practices is crucial. Therefore, this paper aims at identifying and evaluating barriers in adopting SFM practices in the context of forest carbon emission reductions. A total of 15 barriers in adopting SFM practices are listed through literature and expert inputs. Using Cameroon as a case study, the listed barriers are then evaluated by experts to determine their relative importance using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. According to our findings, the 'Regulatory and Legislative frameworks' barrier category was attributed to the highest importance among other categories, in adopting SFM practices in the forestry sector. 'Inadequate political will and incentive to enforce regulations' appears to be the major obstacle in adopting SFM practices in Cameroon. As carbon emission reduction initiatives are being developed, there is need to move from broad to concrete suggestions that will overcome these barriers. However, proper diagnosis is necessary in order to target barriers with the right incentives and enabling conditions that will support carbon programs and projects to deliver effective emission reductions.

TI  - DYNAMIC PROJECTION OF CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS ON ABOVEGROUND CARBON STORAGE OF TROPICAL TREES IN WEST PAPUA, INDONESIA
T2  - INDONESIAN JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Through photosynthetic activities, tropical forest ecosystems capture and store the most significant carbon emissions in the form of biomass compared with other types of vegetation, and thus play a highly crucial part in dealing with climate change. However, such important role of tropical forest is very fragile from extreme changes in temperature and precipitation, because carbon storage in forest landscape is strongly related to those climate variables. This paper examines the impacts of future climate disturbances on aboveground carbon storage of three tropical tree species, namely Myristica sp., Palaquium sp., and Syzygium sp. through "what if" scenarios evaluation using Structural Thinking and Experimental Learning Laboratory with Animation (STELLA). Results highlighted that when the dynamic simulation was running with five IPCC's climate change scenarios (Constant year 2000 concentrations, B1, A1T, A2, and A1F1) for 200 years simulation period, then moderate climate change scenarios occured, such as B1 and A1T, would have already caused significant statistical deviation to all of those tree species. At the worst level of A1F1, the 4 degrees C temperature was coupled with 20% reduction in precipitation. Palaquium sp. showed the highest reduction of aboveground carbon storage with about 17.216% below its normal value. This finding implies the negative climate feedbacks should be considered seriously to ensure the accuracy of long term forest carbon accounting under future climate uncertainty.

TI  - Governance issues related to the management and conservation of mangrove ecosystems to support climate change mitigation actions in Indonesia
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems in Indonesia show great promise in contributing to climate change mitigation, but they continue to experience significant degradation primarily because of aquaculture conversion. This work analyzes the mangrove governance in Indonesia and how it fits the country's high emission reduction. The study is mainly based on the analysis of existing regulations, interviews with relevant stakeholders, focus group discussions, and series of executive lectures from high-level government officials. Results indicate overlapping authority claims by government institutions stemming from the absence of strong regulations specifically dedicated to mangrove management and conservation. Different government institutions have varied philosophical conceptions and development priorities for sustainably managing and conserving mangroves. This study identifies specific operational regulations that potentially undermine synergies across institutions for mangrove ecosystems. The conflicting regulations relate to coastal reclamation activities, management of mangroves in non-forest zones, and expansion of commercial aquaculture. In addition, several emerging policies, which are anticipated to further encourage ecosystem degradation, are discussed. This work then provides recommendations that can be adopted to foster an improved management and conservation of mangrove ecosystems, with the far-reaching aim to support the country's goals to reduce its carbon emissions. These recommendations include improved orchestrations of policy priorities of different institutions, including the active participation of local communities in the protection and conservation of mangroves.

TI  - The role of natural regeneration to ecosystem services provision and habitat availability: a case study in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural regeneration provides multiple benefits to nature and human societies, and can play a major role in global and national restoration targets. However, these benefits are context specific and impacted by both biophysical and socioeconomic heterogeneity across landscapes. Here, we investigate the benefits of natural regeneration for climate change mitigation, sediment retention and biodiversity conservation in a spatially explicit way at very high resolution for a region within the global biodiversity hotspot of the Atlantic Forest. We classified current land-use cover in the region and simulated a natural regeneration scenario in abandoned pasturelands, areas where potential conflicts with agricultural production would be minimized and where some early stage regeneration is already occurring. We then modeled changes in biophysical functions for climate change mitigation and sediment retention, and performed an economic valuation of both ecosystem services. We also modeled how land-use changes affect habitat availability for species. We found that natural regeneration can provide significant ecological and social benefits. Economic values of climate change mitigation and sediment retention alone could completely compensate for the opportunity costs of agricultural production over 20 yr. Habitat availability is improved for three species with different dispersal abilities, although by different magnitudes. Improving the understanding of how costs and benefits of natural regeneration are distributed can be useful to design incentive structures that bring farmers' decision making more in line with societal benefits. This alignment is crucial for natural regeneration to fulfill its potential as a large-scale solution for pressing local and global environmental challenges.

TI  - Agrosilvopastoral system as a potential model for increasing soil carbon stocks: a century model approach
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Agrosilvopastoral systems have been used as sustainable production models that can promote soil organic carbon (SOC) storage. However, there are no simulation studies with the Century model to estimate the SOC accumulation capacity in the long term, analyzing the effects of management and climate change in integrated crop livestock-forest (ICLF) systems. This study aimed to simulate soil C dynamics in two chronosequences of land-use composed of native vegetation (NV), degraded pasture (DPA) and ICLF system in the Cerrado of Minas Gerais, in addition to designing future scenarios to verify the potential of SOC accumulation through climate change. The results showed that the Century model reliably simulated the SOC stocks in the two chronosequences evaluated. The model predicted an increase in SOC stocks at two sites by converting the DPA system (46.04 and 42.38 Mg ha-1) into ICLF systems (54.94 and 51.71 Mg ha-1). The Century also predicted that a 20 mm decrease in rainfall and a 2 & DEG;C increase in temperature in the tropical regions studied could reduce the SOC stocks more expressively in degraded pastures, while agroforestry systems could show a smaller reduction in SOC stocks. In addition, the results showed that replacing degraded pastures into agrosilvopastoral systems, especially in clayey soils, contributes to increasing SOC stocks. Thus, agroforestry systems are potentially viable to maintain the sustainability of agriculture in the face of climate change.

TI  - Climate change on Eucalyptus plantations and adaptive measures for sustainable forestry development across Brazil
T2  - INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The main challenges facing the Eucalyptus plantation industry are employing sustainable projects in suitable areas, and using safer forestry strategies, given climate variability and climate change. Brazil is the world's largest Eucalyptus producer, and more areas have been allocated for Eucalyptus plantations, even in areas that are considered persistent climate change hotspots. Researchers can combine adequate agroclimatic zoning methods with Earth System Model (ESMs) outputs to analyze changes to climate variables, to map suitable areas, and to outline adaptive measures for Eucalyptus plantations. Despite these facts, studies on the Eucalyptus species are still scarce. This study analyzed the impacts of climate change to suitable areas for planting Eucalyptus in Brazil, using proper Agroclimatic Zoning (AZ) method, and outlining effective adaptive measures for sustainable Eucalyptus cultivation under future climate scenarios. Daily precipitation, air temperature (mean and maximum), and global solar radiation data were used from a set of simulations and projections of nine ESMs, from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), in two Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5). The AZ method was simulated for the current climate (1980-2005), and projected for the near (2021-2050), and far future (2071-2100) climates, in two RCPs. Given intense and persistent changes to precipitation, air temperature, evapotranspiration, and water deficits, i.e., prolonged and continued changes to climate variables resulting from climate change, Eucalyptus plantations will be restricted and economically unfeasible for industrial purposes for about 15 % (RCP 4.5), to 47 % (RCP 8.5), of Brazil in the far future, covering a large part of the North, the north of the Center-West, and the northwestern part of the Northeast, including the new Brazilian agroforestry frontier (MATOPIBA). Only similar to 12 % of Brazil, encompassing small areas of the South, the South-Southeast, and a small portion in the Northwest region of the North, will be suitable for Eucalyptus plantations, since these regions are less vulnerable to climate change. As for the rest of Brazil (between similar to 42 % and similar to 80 %), regular suitability is projected, and the future of Eucalyptus plantations in these places will depend on adopting 'effective adaptive measures' and making 'safe silvicultural decisions' in order to deal with projected temperature increases and water deficits, including genotypes selection, improvements in hybridization techniques or breeding programs, planting in wider spacings (or lower stockings), and thinning and pruning at shorter intervals.

TI  - Are Tree Seed Systems for Forest Landscape Restoration Fit for Purpose? An Analysis of Four Asian Countries
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - High-quality, suitably adapted tree seed at volume is a key component for the implementation and long-term success of forest landscape restoration (FLR). We analysed the tree seed systems in four Asian countries-the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and India-which have committed to restore in total over 47.5 million hectares of degraded lands by 2030. We assessed the national seed systems using an established indicator framework, literature review and expert surveys and interviews. Additionally, we surveyed 61 FLR practitioners about their challenges in acquiring seed to understand how the strengths and weaknesses identified at the national level were reflected in FLR projects on the ground. Identified key constraints common to the studied countries are (i) a mismatch between the growing demand for priority native species and the limited seed supply in terms of quantity and quality, (ii) lack of effective quality control for seed of native species and (iii) lack of information about the effects of climate change on native species to guide species selection and seed sourcing and to improve the resilience of restored ecosystems. We discuss options to strengthen seed systems for native tree species both in terms of quality and volume to enable them to effectively respond to the national FLR commitments and make recommendations on promising technical solutions.

TI  - Ecosystem-Based Agriculture Combining Production and Conservation-A Viable Way to Feed the World in the Long Term?
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzed examples of sustainable ecosystem-based agriculture where management methods supported livelihoods of smallholders while at the same time local ecosystem services were enhanced in Ethiopia, Brazil, and the Philippines. Participation by farmers and collective actions were found to be a crucial driving force, as local specific knowledge and "learning by doing" were main components of the development. Social cohesion, particularly through associations and cooperatives, and improved marketing opportunities were also important drivers. Furthermore, recognition by authorities at all levels was perceived as crucial. Effects of climate change, insecure property rights, and political instability were potential threats. The possibilities of such systems to be scaled up beyond self-sufficiency raised further questions.

TI  - The effectiveness of acoustic indices for forest monitoring in Atlantic rainforest fragments
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest monitoring is essential to maintain the integrity of protected areas, which has become a more pressing issue due to anthropogenic pressures and global climate change. Birds are widely used for this purpose, and as bird diversity is correlated with acoustic indices, it has been suggested that sounds can be used as an ecological indicator of ecosystem complexity and environmental changes. However, previous studies yield controversial results. Thus, we evaluated the effectiveness of six acoustic indices compared with the results obtained from a traditional point-counts survey for forest monitoring in an Atlantic rainforest fragment in Southern Bahia, Brazil. We also determined differences between acoustic indices calculated in the presence and absence of the researcher in the field to quantify the bias caused by human presence during data collection. There was a moderate correlation between the number of bird species just with the acoustic evenness index, from the six acoustic indices evaluated. We also determined that the presence of the researcher in the field at the point-count survey caused bias in acoustic indices. Therefore, more research must be done with autonomous recording units and the acoustic indices before they can be widely adopted for monitoring purposes in complex and diverse habitats such as the Atlantic tropical rainforest.

TI  - Mainstreaming Smart Agroforestry for Social Forestry Implementation to Support Sustainable Development Goals in Indonesia: A Review
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - The increasing need for forest resources and cultivated land requires a solution in forest management to realize sustainable land use. Smart agroforestry (SAF) is a set of agriculture and silviculture knowledge and practices that is aimed at not only increasing profits and resilience for farmers but also improving environmental parameters, including climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity enhancement, and soil and water conservation, while assuring sustainable landscape management. SAF, a solution for land management systems to reduce the rate of deforestation, is a smart effort to overcome the food crisis and mitigate climate change that is prospectively applied mainly in the social forestry area. Optimized forest land utilization could be achieved by implementing SAF and applying silvicultural and crop cultivation techniques to optimize productivity and meet sustainability and adaptability goals. This paper reviews the existing conditions, opportunities, and challenges in the mainstreaming of SAF in social forestry implementation to support the Sustainable Development Goals in Indonesia. Mainstreaming SAF should include policy innovation and regulation implementation, the use of appropriate technology, and compromises or trade-offs among benefits, risks, and resources. SAF is a strategy to revive the rural economy and community prosperity through the optimal use of local resources as well as a form of smart landscape and land-use management that has significant roles in soil and water conservation, bioenergy, climate change responses, and enhanced biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Jakabaring and its surrounding which is part of Palembang are also experienced a high level exposure to hazard of inundation, where the area is heavily affected by tides which are mostly swamps, consisting of reclamation and protection swamps that are vulnerable to the effects of climate change. This study aims to determine the level of risk due to inundation hazards that occur in current conditions and projected conditions through risk assessment with spatial approaches and adaptation strategies needed, The vulnerability parameters that used are exposure (topography, land use, infrastructure), adaptation capacity (drainage), sensitivity (population density, education level, age, gender and poverty). In the baseline condition, Jakabaring and its surrounding areas is on moderate level of risk. Meanwhile in the projection condition (2030), Jakabaring and its surrounding areas is on high level of risk. The adaptation strategies due to climate change impact that can be carried out are river normalization, drainage normalization, infiltration measure, pumping, green open space, canalization, bio-pore, water retention ponds, multiplying gardens in residential area, roads enhancement, pavement enhancement, polders along rivers, and supervision of swamp regulations.

TI  - Cabruca agroforestry systems reduce vulnerability of cacao plantations to climate change in southern Bahia
T2  - AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In southern Bahia, Brazil's traditional cacao region, cacao is mostly grown under the shade of thinned Atlantic Forest (known as cabruca). These agroforestry systems are gradually being replaced by unshaded cacao monocultures that might be more vulnerable to changes in climate; however, the impacts of climate change have not been evaluated yet. We assessed the impact of climate change on the climatic suitability of cacao plantations in southern Bahia and evaluated to what extent the cabrucas reduce the vulnerability of cacao as compared to unshaded plantations. We measured the maximum temperature in a gradient of canopy cover during the warmest month of the year and projected ecological niche models (MaxEnt) on climate projections for 2050 simulating the microclimate of three production systems: cabrucas, intermediate shading, and unshaded plantations. We found that canopy cover drastically reduces daily maximum temperature, so that understory temperature in cabrucas can be up to 6.0 degrees C lower than in unshaded plantations. We show for the first time that all projected environmental changes negatively affect cacao in southern Bahia, diminishing its climatic suitability and reducing overall suitable areas across the region. More importantly, this study is the first one to show that cabrucas can reduce the negative impacts of climate change for cacao, especially where temperature extremes approach or exceed crop tolerance limits. We conclude that maximizing short-term profits by implementing unshaded monocultures will likely lead to production losses in the long term. Cabrucas have a central role in reducing the vulnerability of cacao to climate change and since these traditional agroforestry systems cannot be quickly restored, their conservation should be an important goal of agricultural policies in the region.

TI  - The Scope for Reducing Emissions from Forestry and Agriculture in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing emissions from agriculture, forestry, and other land uses is considered an essential ingredient of an effective strategy to mitigate global warming. Required changes in land use and forestry, however, often imply foregoing returns from locally more attractive resource use strategies. We assess and compare the prospects of mitigating climate change through emission reductions from forestry and agriculture in the Brazilian Amazon. We use official statistics, literature, and case study material from both old and new colonization frontiers to identify the scope for emission reductions, in terms of potential additionality, opportunity costs, technological complexity, transaction costs, and risks of economic and environmental spillover effects. Our findings point to a comparative advantage in the Brazilian Amazon of forest conservation-based over land-use modifying mitigation options, especially in terms of higher potential additionality in emission reductions. Low-cost mitigation options do exist also in use-modifying agriculture and forestry, but tend to be technologically complex thus requiring more costly intervention schemes. Our review points to a series of regional development deficits that may come to hamper attempts to tap into the large-scale climate change mitigation potential often associated with the Amazon. Low-hanging fruits for mitigation do exist, but must be carefully identified based on the performance indicators we discuss.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 2nd International Conference on Environment and Forest Conservation (ICEFC)
CL  - Mindanao State Univ, Bogor, INDONESIA
AB  - Indonesia is one of the biggest contributors to greenhouse emission globally. The trigger of such contributions can be traced to Land Use, Land Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF). The problem of deforestation is complex, involving social, economic and political sectors. On the other hand, a holistic approach has not been widely discussed and implemented. This paper attempts to review and aims at providing potential answer on how to manage the forest and its relations with people in order to combat forest destruction caused by people. We believed that managing such relationship is the key to maintain the sustainability of the forest while keeping its roles and sustainability. Literature review was employed to develop a problem framework, and to develop alternatives in bridging the relationships between forest and local community. Collecting relevant literatures using keywords such as "forest and climate change mitigation", "agroforestry and climate change", "ecotourism and climate change", and "agroforestry and ecotourism", 96 articles were found. Further, through matching the content and the research goals of the articles, 13 articles were selected for further content analysis. We proposed agro-ecotourism as the alternative answer that can be pursued to balance the relationship between forest and people, especially in putting forest as an important partner rather than an exploitable asset. Hence, agro-ecotourism may help to increase the awareness among local community on the critical roles of the forest in the long term to fight against climate changes.

AB  - Once abundant in the Americas, the southern green stink bug Nezara viridula (L.) has gradually declined in numbers. Until the 1990s, it was considered the main pest of major crops such as soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merrill, particularly in southern Brazil and southern USA, as well as Argentina, Uruguay, and other countries. In the past 15+ years, a dramatic population decrease was observed to the point of now being considered a secondary pest in these referred countries. In this article, we list and discuss possible reasons which explain the decline in N. viridula population in the Americas. These factors include the following: (1) the steady increase of herbicides used in no-tillage/multiple cropping systems affecting potential hosts such as weeds in crop fields and nearby natural vegetation; (2) the change in cultivation systems, mostly in the Neotropics, favoring other species more adapted to exploit crops in modern day agriculture; (3) competition among several species of stink bugs that colonize major crops; (4) the growing impact of several species of egg parasitoids, some of them laboratory reared and released in crop fields, and other natural enemies (parasitoids and predators); and (5) the impact of global climate change affecting its distribution and biology.

TI  - Climate change-induced peatland drying in Southeast Asia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - When organic peat soils are sufficiently dry, they become flammable. In Southeast Asian peatlands, widespread deforestation and associated drainage create dry conditions that, when coupled with El Nino-driven drought, result in catastrophic fire events that release large amounts of carbon and deadly smoke to the atmosphere. While the effects of anthropogenic degradation on peat moisture and fire risk have been extensively demonstrated, climate change impacts to peat flammability are poorly understood. These impacts are likely to be mediated primarily through changes in soil moisture. Here, we used neural networks (trained on data from the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive satellite) to model soil moisture as a function of climate, degradation, and location. The neural networks were forced with regional climate model projections for 1985-2005 and 2040-2060 climate under RCP8.5 forcing to predict changes in soil moisture. We find that reduced precipitation and increased evaporative demand will lead to median soil moisture decreases about half as strong as those observed during recent El Nino droughts in 2015 and 2019. Based on previous studies, such reductions may be expected to accelerate peat carbon emissions. Our results also suggest that soil moisture in degraded areas with less tree cover may be more sensitive to climate change than in other land use types, motivating urgent peatland restoration. Climate change may play an important role in future soil moisture regimes and by extension, future peat fire in Southeast Asian peatlands.

TI  - Assessing the potential risks of climate change on the natural capital of six countries resulting from global warming of 1.5 to 4 °C above pre-industrial levels
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the results from a new framework providing an assessment of how climate change risks to natural capital accrue with warming of 1.5-4 degrees C in six countries (China, Brazil, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, and India). Unlike typical biodiversity and climate change studies, this assessment also considers landcover and population changes across a range of 17 ecosystem services. The potential impacts of climate change (alone) on natural capital at 1.5 degrees C is greatest in Brazil and least in Ghana. However, when population and landcover change are included, areas projected to be at high natural capital risk begin to accrue by 1.5 degrees C in all countries. By 2 degrees C, Ethiopia and Ghana show increasing areas at high risk, even though they are at low risk owing to climate alone. Thus, current impacts to biodiversity and ecosystem services and changes in potential demand coupled with warming exceed changes projected by climate alone. However, this also indicates that there is adaptation potential, especially with warming of < 2 degrees C, to reduce risk through restoring habitat. At lower levels of warming, targeted restoration of marginal agricultural habitats would increase the bank of natural capital for use by people and provide support for remaining agricultural lands. By 3 degrees C, the adaptation potential from restoration is substantially less: < 1% in Brazil, India and Egypt; 7-8% in China and Ethiopia; but still 26% in Ghana. This indicates that restoration as an adaptation option for biodiversity, and thus, natural capital, rapidly decreases with increasing temperatures. By 2100, factoring in population change (SSP2), current ecological footprint, and current landcover, even with only 1.5 degrees C warming, large parts of Brazil, eastern China, most of Egypt, much of Ethiopia, southwestern Ghana (except for protected areas), and most of India are at high to extreme natural capital risk with an adaptation deficit potentially equating to a soft adaptation limit.

TI  - Responding to climate change and the global land crisis: REDD+, market transformation and low-emissions rural development
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Climate change and rapidly escalating global demand for food, fuel, fibre and feed present seemingly contradictory challenges to humanity. Can greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from land-use, more than one-fourth of the global total, decline as growth in land-based production accelerates? This review examines the status of two major international initiatives that are designed to address different aspects of this challenge. REDD+ is an emerging policy framework for providing incentives to tropical nations and states that reduce their GHG emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Market transformation, best represented by agricultural commodity roundtables, seeks to exclude unsustainable farmers from commodity markets through international social and environmental standards for farmers and processors. These global initiatives could potentially become synergistically integrated through (i) a shared approach for measuring and favouring high environmental and social performance of land use across entire jurisdictions and (ii) stronger links with the domestic policies, finance and laws in the jurisdictions where agricultural expansion is moving into forests. To achieve scale, the principles of REDD+ and sustainable farming systems must be embedded in domestic low-emission rural development models capable of garnering support across multiple constituencies. We illustrate this potential with the case of Mato Grosso State in the Brazilian Amazon.

TI  - Forest fire action on vegetation from the perspective of trend analysis in future climate change scenarios for a Brazilian savanna region
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cerrado region has adapted to fires because of its climate and vegetation conditions, but with increasing frequency, regional fires will begin to degrade the biome. Therefore, research is necessary to determine whether the occurrence of fires is beneficial or degrading to the environment, and if the fire origin is natural or anthropic. The objective of this study was to evaluate the vulnerability of vegetation to different scenarios of future climate change. The study area was the Ecological Station of Urucui-Una, located in the south of Piaui. The methodology consisted in identifying burnt areas in terms of their recurrence; evaluating the correlation between burnt areas and precipitation and temperature; analyzing burnt areas and the Mann Kendall trend for vegetation for the period 2001 to 2018. Based on the current vegetation conditions, the vegetation and land use were estimated for the year 2100 through the Markov chain and the vulnerable areas were estimated observing different scenarios of climate change of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Fase 6 (CMIP6). The results indicated that fires with frequencies above 5 in the interval of 18 years have a negative Pearson correlation and the Mann-Kendall analysis, which implies a state of vegetation degradation. Regarding the future climate scenarios, savanna sites with temperatures above 38 degrees C, a vegetation index below 0.4, and monthly precipitation less than 90 mm were those with the highest level of vulnerability. Vulnerability mapping can help to improve public policies for fire management for the sustainable development of this region.

TI  - Beyond opportunity costs: who bears the implementation costs of reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation?
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) in developing countries is based on the premise that conserving tropical forests is a cost-effective way to reduce carbon emissions and therefore can be fully funded by international actors with obligations or interests in reducing emissions. However, concerns have repeatedly been raised about whether stakeholders in REDD+ host countries will actually end up bearing the costs of REDD+. Most prior analyses of the costs of REDD+ have focused on the opportunity costs of foregone alternative uses of forest land. We draw on a pan-tropical study of 22 subnational REDD+ initiatives in five countries to explore patterns in implementation costs, including which types of organizations are involved and which are sharing the costs of implementing REDD+. We find that many organizations involved in the implementation of REDD+, particularly at the subnational level and in the public sector, are bearing implementation costs not covered by the budgets of the REDD+ initiatives. To sustain this level of cost-sharing, REDD+ must be designed to deliver local as well as global forest benefits.

TI  - Current knowledge on the Cuvette Centrale peatland complex and future research directions
T2  - BOIS ET FORETS DES TROPIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cuvette Centrale is the largest tropical peatland complex in the world, covering approximately 145,000 km(2) across the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo. It stores ca. 30.6 Pg C, the equivalent of three years of global carbon dioxide emissions and is now the first trans-national Ramsar site. Despite its size and importance as a global carbon store, relatively little is known about key aspects of its ecology and history, including its formation, the scale of greenhouse gas flows, its biodiversity and its history of human activity. Here, we synthesise available knowledge on the Cuvette Centrale, identifying key areas for further research. Finally, we review the potential of mathematical models to assess future trajectories for the peatlands in terms of the potential impacts of resource extraction or climate change.

T2  - NEW FRONTIERS IN NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT IN AFRICA
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The Congo forest is not only an important biodiversity hotspot, providing direct ecosystem goods and services for the livelihood of more than 50 million people, it is also of global importance holding almost 10% of the world's forest-based carbon thus acting as the planet's second lung after the Amazon and providing a carbon-sink potential to mitigate global warming. This potential strategically positions the countries in the region in the climate change negotiations aimed to enhance forests' capacity for sequestering carbon. These countries in turn rely heavily on forest ecosystem goods and services to catalyse economic development. The dilemma for policy is to manage the trade-off between exploitation and conservation of forests under new initiatives such as the REDD+ (reduce emissions from deforestation, forest degradation and foster conservation). Given also that countries within the basin stand to benefit from the emerging global carbon market, if correct measures are taken in managing existing natural resources, and being active participants in the international climate change negotiations, natural resource managers and forest policy makers would have to take measures to promote the sequestration of carbon in forest biomass while accounting for forest exploitation. Based on this premise, this paper reviews the interplay of global warming and carbon sequestration potential in the Congo Basin forest and provides illumination for new policy directions to enhance the capacity for adaptation and mitigation.

AB  - Deforestation and degraded forest land will continue to affect climate patterns in various places and trigger an increase in the frequency and intensity of weather events and extreme climate. The impacts felt by the community are quite a lot both in the social, economic, infrastructure, fishery, agriculture, health, tourism sectors, even in the areas of defence and security. Various anticipatory steps need to do by raising awareness of the community and relevant stakeholders to this issue of climate change. One of the actions of climate change adaptation in the capacity building is to encourage the emergence of national and local policies that address the concerns and readiness mitigation to cope with the impacts of climate change on various fronts, particularly in agriculture and food security. This study aims to encourage the preparation of the policy masterplan of agroforestry development as an effort to mitigate climate change in Madiun, East Java, Indonesia. With a Diagnostic and Design approach (D&D), a policy recommendation for agroforestry development in the medium and long-term developed. The result of a D&D approach by the available resource potential, the agroforestry model that is feasible to be developed is agro-silviculture and agro-silvopastoral.

TI  - Adaptation and resilience of agricultural systems to local climate change and extreme events: an integrative review
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA TROPICAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Losses in agricultural production, mainly caused by extreme temperature, rainfall and drought, have demanded the adaptation of the Brazilian agriculture to the ongoing climate change. This study aimed to evaluate, through an integrative review, the effects of agricultural practices established by two Brazilian public policies (ABC Plan and Planaveg) on the resilience and adaptation of the country's agricultural systems, considering the effects on local climate and extreme events. All the Embrapa library collections were used as main sources, and the Google Scholar was used as a secondary source. The search included publications from 1998 to April 2022 and resulted in 334 data, extracted from 51 references, covering at least one factor and one practice. The review showed that the proposed practices may contribute to the resilience and adaptation of the Brazilian agricultural and forestry sectors to climate change in the main production regions. Studies have indicated that the incorporation of the arboreal component into production systems may provide an environment more resilient to droughts, increased air humidity, reduced temperature impact and reduced fire risks, among other benefits. The adoption of the ABC Plan and Planaveg practices by the agricultural sector is an option feasible, strategic and well-aligned with a low-carbon economy, while it increases the resilience to present and future climate change impacts.

TI  - Titled Amazon Indigenous Communities Cut Forest Carbon Emissions
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Indigenous communities (ICs) have emerged as important players in global efforts to reduce forest carbon emissions, in part because they are viewed as conscientious stewards of the forest lands to which they have legal title. Yet ICs tend to be located in remote areas where deforestation would be limited regardless of who manages them. Therefore, to determine whether IC management actually cuts forest carbon emissions, it is important to control for such confounding factors. To that end, we use propensity score matching and regression to analyze the effects on 2001-2013 deforestation and forest carbon emissions of IC management in the Amazon regions of Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador and Colombia. We find that IC management reduces both deforestation and forest carbon emissions in Bolivia, Brazil and Colombia. We are not able to discern a statistically significant effect in Ecuador. These findings suggest that IC management can, in fact, help combat climate change.

To understand the long-term impact of climate change on forest production, we investigated how fluctuations in forest productivity and land availability would impact the expansion of Brazil's pulp and paper industry. We used a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Model to evaluate the financial returns, costs, and potential mill locations under multiple climates and land market scenarios. The study area was the state of Mato Grosso do Sul in Brazil, which is among the world's most attractive natural resources investments in pulp and paper. Our results showed that the region needs to expand its plantation forest area by at least 586,166 ha from the current land base of 912,371 ha in the upcoming decades to supply enough pulpwood for incoming mills and offset potential productivity losses driven by climate change. Pulpwood production cost is expected to increase by 0.61 % annually (or 16.4 % in the next 25 years). These results highlight the risks associated with losses in the productivity of plantation forests due to the changes in climate and land use. We assessed the importance of land use change rate in the market development. If it remains unchanged, the industry's success could be restrained, reducing positive externalities in the region. Furthermore, the model we proposed here can be extended to other industrial problems (e.g., wood pellet mills and biochar collection points) and assess different climate scenarios (e.g., climate shocks like droughts or wildfires).

TI  - Ecological restoration as a strategy for mitigating and adapting to climate change: lessons and challenges from Brazil
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is a global phenomenon that affects biophysical systems and human well-being. The Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change entered into force in 2016 with the objective of strengthening the global response to climate change by keeping global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees C. The agreement requires all Parties to submit their "nationally determined contributions" (NDCs) and to strengthen these efforts in the years ahead. Reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation is an important strategy for mitigating climate change, particularly in developing countries with large forests. Extensive tropical forest loss and degradation have increased awareness at the international level of the need to undertake large-scale ecological restoration, highlighting the need to identify cases in which restoration strategies can contribute to mitigation and adaptation. Here we consider Brazil as a case study to evaluate the benefits and challenges of implementing large-scale restoration programs in developing countries. The Brazilian NDC included the target of restoring and reforesting 12 million hectares of forests for multiple uses by 2030. Restoration of native vegetation is one of the foundations of sustainable rural development in Brazil and should consider multiple purposes, from biodiversity and ecosystem services conservation to social and economic development. However, ecological restoration still presents substantial challenges for tropical and mega-diverse countries, including the need to develop plans that are technically and financially feasible, as well as public policies and monitoring instruments that can assess effectiveness. The planning, execution, and monitoring of restoration efforts strongly depend on the context and the diagnosis of the area with respect to reference ecosystems (e.g., forests, savannas, grasslands, wetlands). In addition, poor integration of climate change policies at the national and subnational levels and with other sectorial policies constrains the large-scale implementation of restoration programs. The case of Brazil shows that slowing deforestation is possible; however, this analysis highlights the need for increased national commitment and international support for actions that require large-scale transformations of the forest sector regarding ecosystem restoration efforts. Scaling up the ambitions and actions of the Paris Agreement implies the need for a global framework that recognizes landscape restoration as a cost-effective nature-based solution and that supports countries in addressing their remaining needs, challenges, and barriers.

TI  - Oil palm plantation systems are at a crossroads☆
T2  - OCL-OILSEEDS AND FATS CROPS AND LIPIDS
M3  - Review
AB  - The future of most tropical sectors is clouded by growing constraints linked to, among many other parameters, climate change, price volatility and labour scarcity. Perpetuating agricultural systems inherited from the colonial era (a time of abundant arable land, protected markets, and cheap and disciplined labour) will not be enough to prepare these sectors in facing immediate crucial challenges unless substantial structural transformations are made.Implementing a successful agroecological transition in a 70-billion USD sector, covering 25 million ha worldwide, calls for drastic changes in mind-sets and practices. The key issue is no longer simply to increase productivity, but to foster innovations designed to support endangered tropical biodiversity, while providing a decent living for shrinking agricultural communities in the Global South.Agroforestry practices have a role to play in providing substantial climate change mitigation with an impact comparable to other climate-focused solutions, such as reforestation. The expected contribution of oil palm-based agroforestry relies on agro-environmental services, as basic agricultural functions such as soil preservation, pollination, or pest control can be ensured by living organisms inside and around the plantation. Diversified systems are able to achieve both economic and environmental gains, as they use land more efficiently than monocultures. Building on regenerative agriculture, new plantation designs are emerging and deserve to be thoroughly assessed to establish evidence-based advocacy for change.

TI  - Species richness accelerates marine ecosystem restoration in the Coral Triangle
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem restoration aims to restore biodiversity and valuable functions that have been degraded or lost. The Coral Triangle is a hotspot for marine biodiversity held in its coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and mangrove forests, all of which are in global decline. These coastal ecosystems support valuable fisheries and endangered species, protect shorelines, and are significant carbon stores, functions that have been degraded by coastal development, destructive fishing practices, and climate change. Ecosystem restoration is required to mitigate these damages and losses, but its practice is in its infancy in the region. Here we demonstrate that species diversity can set the trajectory of restoration. In a seagrass restoration experiment in the heart of the Coral Triangle (Sulawesi, Indonesia), plant survival and coverage increased with the number of species transplanted. Our results highlight the positive role biodiversity can play in ecosystem restoration and call for revision of the common restoration practice of establishing a single target species, particularly in regions having high biodiversity. Coastal ecosystems affect human well-being in many important ways, and restoration will become ever more important as conservation efforts cannot keep up with their loss.

TI  - Mangrove Recovery in Semiarid Coast Shows Increase of Ecological Processes from Biotic and Abiotic Drivers in Response to Hydrological Restoration
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The installation of shrimp and salt ponds has contributed to the devastation of several mangroves worldwide. In semiarid regions, where few mangroves are able to cope with the harsh environment, these forests are more vulnerable to human impacts. In Brazil, several aquaculture and salt ponds have been established over mangroves and salt flats ('apicuns') i.e. sandier natural areas contiguous to mangroves. These areas, often hypersaline, can be colonized by mangroves if tidal coverage increases, and should, therefore, be protected to ensure mangrove conservation against predicted sea level rise. To restore a mangrove stand in an abandoned saltworks (former 'apicum' area) in northeast Brazil, hydrological restoration measures were applied, which involved digging channels to restore estuarine water flux to planted and water-borne propagules. In two years, mangroves developed rapidly in the intervention area, after decades of slow monospecific Avicennia germinans recovery. Survival of planted Rhizophora mangle propagules was high, and naturally established Avicennia germinans and Laguncularia racemosa reached far higher densities and heights in channels with respect to the condition before channeling. These results provide valuated insight into mangrove expansion over salt flats by increasing tidal coverage from ongoing rising sea levels. Associated with ecological changes after mangrove rehabilitation and driven by the return of plant and faunal key groups, ecological interactions like facilitation, herbivory and bioturbation increased in the restored area. Our results shed light on the processes related to forest recovery of degraded littoral areas, and contribute to improving the restoration and management of mangrove forests in semiarid coasts.

TI  - A hybrid optimization-agent-based model of REDD plus payments to households on an old deforestation frontier in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - REDD+ was initially conceived of as a multi-level carbon-based payment for environmental services (PES). It is still often assumed to be a cost-effective climate change mitigation strategy, but this assumption is mostly based on theoretical studies and static opportunity cost calculations. We used spatial and socioeconomic datasets from an Amazonian deforestation frontier in Brazil to construct a simulation model of REDD + payments to households that can be used to assess REDD + interventions. Our SimREDD + model consists of dynamic optimization and land-use/cover change allocation sub-models built into an agent-based model platform. The model assumes that households maximize profit under perfect market conditions and calculates the optimal household land-use/cover configuration at equilibrium under a given REDD + PES scenario. These scenarios include PES based on (1) forest area and (2) carbon stocks. Insights gained from simulations under different conditions can assist in the design of more effective, efficient, and equitable REDD + programs. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Climate risks to Brazilian coffee production
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil is the world's leading coffee exporter, contributing billions of dollars to the global food economy. Yet, a majority of Brazilian coffee farms are operated by 'smallholders', producers with relatively small properties and primarily reliant on family labor. While previous work indicates that climate change will decrease the area suitable for coffee production in Brazil, no study has assessed the impacts of climate change on coffee yields or the relative exposure and vulnerability of coffee producing regions to changes in climate hazards (climate-associated losses in yield). To address these knowledge gaps, we assess the sensitivity of coffee yields to temperature and precipitation variation from 1974 to 2017 to map coffee climate hazards. Next, we identify which coffee producing regions in Brazil have the highest exposure to climate hazards due to high dependence of coffee production as a proportion of agricultural area. Finally, we generate a Vulnerability Index to identify which regions are theoretically least able to adapt to climate hazards. Our study finds that since 1974, temperatures in Brazilian coffee growing municipalities have been increasing by similar to 0.25 degrees C per decade and annual precipitation has been decreasing during the blooming and ripening periods. This historical climate change has already resulted in reductions in coffee yield by more than 20% in the Southeast of Brazil. Minas Gerais, the largest coffee producing state in Brazil, has among the highest climate hazard and overall climate risk, exacerbated by ongoing coffee expansion. Additionally, many municipalities with the lowest adaptive capacity, including the country's mountainous regions, also have high climate exposure and hazards. Negative climate hazard and exposure impacts for coffee producing regions could be potentially offset by targeting climate adaptation support to these high-risk regions, including research, extension, and credit subsidies for improved coffee varieties, irrigation, and agroforestry and diversifying agricultural production.

TI  - Climate change and Pentaclethra macrophylla Benth: Forecasting alterations in native distributional range across West and Central Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE AND BIODIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The tree species known as the African oil bean ( Pentaclethra macrophylla Benth) retains numerous applications. For rural residents, almost all of its traded elements represent a significant source of income. Numerous terrestrial habitats have reportedly experienced negative biological, temporal, and spatial effects concerning climate change lately. Understanding the out-turn of changing climate towards the geographic distribution of species could help predict their growth or decline and, if necessary, provide appropriate conservation measures. We examined whether climate change will affect the geographical distribution of this species throughout its native distributional area across West and Central Africa in light of the strong interest that this species holds for rural African residents. Under AfriClim RCP 8.5 scenario 2070 conditions, the inquiry was carried out by applying the MaxEnt model. According to the MaxEnt results, climate change shall hold a major footprint toward species' native spread. About 5% (5889 km2) of the nations across West and Central Africa are predicted to have stable species populations. These are mostly the regions located along the southern coasts of Guinea Bissau, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria, Cameroon, and Gabon. The model threshold indicated a huge 95.29% (119135.9 km2) reduction in the species' appropriate habitat. The southern coasts of Senegal, Ghana, Togo, and the Benin Republic, along with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, are predicted to be unsuitable, as are the topmost northern portions associated with the Sahel regions of West and Central African countries. Additionally, it is expected that the entire Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and south-eastern Angola will no longer be appropriate for the species. It is necessary to build up the preservation of the species by raising and establishing it in the anticipated suitable areas/agroforestry plan to ensure its sustainable usage and practicable conservation.

TI  - The ongoing cut-down of the Amazon rainforest threatens the climate and requires global tree planting projects: A short review
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The Amazon rainforest has sustained human existence for more than 10,000 years. Part of this has been the way that the forest controls regional climate including precipitation important for the ecosystem as well as agro-forestry and farming. In addition, the Amazon also affects the global weather systems, so cutting down the rainforest significantly increases the effects of climate change, threatening the world's biodiversity and causing local desertification and soil erosion. The current fire activities and deforestation in the Amazon rainforest therefore have consequences for global sustainability. In the light of this, the current decisions made in Brazil regarding an increase in Amazon deforestation require policy changes if the global ecosystems and biodiversity are not to be set to collapse. There is only one way to move forward and that is to increase efforts in sustainable development of the region including limitation in deforestation and to continuously measure and monitor the development. The G7 countries have offered Brazil financial support for at least 20 million euros for fighting the forest fires but the president denies receiving such financial support and says that it is more relevant to raise new forests in Europe. In fact, this is exactly what is happening in Denmark and China in order to reduce climate change. Such activities should be global and include South America, Europe, Africa and Asia where deforestation is important issue. Forest restoration reduces climate change, desertification, and preserves both the regional tropical and global environment if the wood is not burned at a later stage but instead used in e.g. roads as filling material. Changes are therefore needed through improved international understanding and agreements to better avoid the global climate changes, from cutting down the precious rainforest before it is too late as rainforest cannot be re-planted.

TI  - Livestock intensification as a climate policy: Lessons from the Brazilian case
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil is trying to identify ways to ally economic growth with climate change mitigation. Productivity gains in livestock have been pointed out as a promising alternative to achieve that goal. Thus, this paper analyses the economic impacts of a policy of productivity gains in the Brazilian livestock. Besides, we evaluate if the policy may conciliate agricultural growth and deforestation control, bearing in mind the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from land -use changes. The analysis was carried out through a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, tailored to represent land -use changes, GHG emissions and removals. Besides, it made progress modeling the heterogeneity of climate, soils, and emissions in inter -regional models with many regions. The results show that productivity gains can effectively "save" land and thus avoid deforestation, especially in the Amazon and Cerrado (savannah) biomes. The policy also may boost the economic growth, spreading it to other regions of Brazil, like Centre -West and North, and increasing income and consumption in those places. However, as a climate policy, focused on the reduction of GHG emissions, the results may be counterproductive. The net amount issued may increase, as a result of the positive stimulus of the policy on the economy, and GHG emissions are directly related to the economic growth. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Extinction threat to neglected Plinia edulis exacerbated by climate change, yet likely mitigated by conservation through sustainable use
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forecasting the impacts of climate change on species distribution has several implications for conservation. Plinia edulis is a rare and threatened tree species from Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest. In this study, we assessed the impact of global climate change on the distribution of P. edulis. Additionally, we evaluated the efficacy of the Brazilian protected network to conserve this species. Ecological niche models were built using the maximum entropy method based on occurrence records and environmental predictors. Models predicted a reduction of climatically suitable areas for P. edulis in all evaluated scenarios in the coming years. Furthermore, we observed that Brazilian protected areas (PAs) are ineffective to conserve this species. Given the fact that P. edulis is a promising tree species rarely found within Brazilian PAs and threatened by global climate change, we strongly recommend the cultivation of this multipurpose species in agroforestry systems, landscaping and homegardens in order to promote its conservation through sustainable use.

TI  - Global carbon dioxide removal rates from forest landscape restoration activities
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Forest landscape restoration (FLR) has been adopted by governments and practitioners across the globe to mitigate and adapt to climate change and restore ecological functions across degraded landscapes. However, the extent to which these activities capture CO2 with associated climate mitigation impacts are poorly known, especially in geographies where data on biomass growth of restored forests are limited or do not exist. To fill this gap, we developed biomass accumulation rates for a set of FLR activities (natural regeneration, planted forests and woodlots, agroforestry, and mangrove restoration) across the globe and global CO2 removal rates with corresponding confidence intervals, grouped by FLR activity and region/climate.Results: Planted forests and woodlots were found to have the highest CO2 removal rates, ranging from 4.5 to 40.7 t CO2 h(-1) year(-1) during the first 20 years of growth. Mangrove tree restoration was the second most efficient FLR at removing CO2, with growth rates up to 23.1 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) the first 20 years post restoration. Natural regeneration removal rates were 9.1-18.8 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) during the first 20 years of forest regeneration, followed by agroforestry, the FLR category with the lowest and regionally broad removal rates (10.8-15.6 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1)). Biomass growth data was most abundant and widely distributed across the world for planted forests and natural regeneration, representing 45% and 32% of all the data points assessed, respectively. Agroforestry studies, were only found in Africa, Asia, and the Latin America and Caribbean regions.Conclusion: This study represents the most comprehensive review of published literature on tree growth and CO2 removals to date, which we operationalized by constructing removal rates for specific FLR activities across the globe. These rates can easily be applied by practitioners and decision-makers seeking to better understand the positive climate mitigation impacts of existing or planned FLR actions, or by countries making restoration pledges under the Bonn Challenge Commitments or fulfil ling Nationally Determined Contributions to the UNFCCC, thereby helping boost FLR efforts world-wide.

TI  - Silvopastoral system with Eucalyptus as a strategy for mitigating the effects of climate change on Brazilian pasturelands
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of Eucalyptus trees in a silvopastoral system on the microclimate and the capacity of that to mitigate the effects of climate change on pasturelands. This study included an open pasture of Plata palisadegrass and an adjacent pasture that contained both palisadegrass and Eastto-West rows of Eucalyptus trees, with 15 m between rows, 2 m between trees within rows. The micrometeorological measurements were collected at several distances from the tree rows and in the open pasture. The silvopastoral system was associated with greater between-row shading when solar declination was high and greater near-tree shading when solar declination was around -22 degrees. Both soil heat flux and temperature were influenced by solar radiation, wind speed, and the ability of tree canopies to reduce radiation losses. Wind speed was consistently lower in the silvopastoral system, owing to the windbreak effect of the Eucalyptus trees. The present study demonstrated that silvopastoral systems can be used to attenuate the effects of climate change, as trees can protect pastureland from intense solar radiation and wind, thereby reducing evapotranspiration and, consequently, improving soil water availability for the understory crop.

TI  - Ancient origin of a rainforest in Gabon as revealed by carbon isotope data of vegetation and soil
T2  - HOLOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Holocene climate change caused disturbances of the Central African rainforest belt, with decrease in forest area during drier conditions followed by expansion during wetter periods. Today, human impact is a driver for forest degradation in the Congo Basin. For assessing the quality and quantity of forest degradation, information on biodiversity and carbon stocks from reference ecosystems is needed which (1) were not affected by Holocene climate change and (2) lack direct human impacts like logging or shifting cultivation. The Birougou Mountains in Gabon, which were devoid of direct human impact over the last centuries, may resemble such a reference ecosystem. This paper tests the hypothesis that the Birougou Mountains served as refugium for rainforest vegetation during periods of Holocene climate change. For 34 forest plots within the Birougou Mountains and 27 savannah plots within an adjacent forest savannah mosaic, we present stable carbon isotope data from current vegetation cover, organic inputs to soil organic carbon (SOC), bulk SOC and the humic acid fraction of SOC. Additionally, we estimated the mean age of the SOC humic acid fraction by C-14 dating. The data indicated a continuous forest cover in the Birougou Mountains since - at least - the Holocene climate optimum, but a change from forest to savannah vegetation in the forest savannah mosaic. Results confirm the forest of the Birougou Mountains as a refugium of rainforest vegetation and suitable reference for the natural potential regarding biodiversity and ecosystem carbon stocks.

TI  - Prospects for Governance and Climate Change Resilience in Peatland Management in Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Southeast Asia has the most significant tropical peat/peat carbon storage area in the world, with Indonesia being the primary location for much of it. Anthropogenic changes to peatlands have resulted in a threat to these endangered ecosystems; policies that have favored industrial and elite interests above those of local communities have resulted in severe consequences for the environment and public health, not only in Indonesia and its region, but for the world community in terms of contributions to climate change. Decentralization has been seen as a means of sharing authority and accountability with lower government levels and providing additional opportunities for shared governance. Still, there is reason to question the means of these approaches and the results of such efforts. The research question is: What can be learned about the administration's role in leading stakeholder involvement from the case of Indonesian peatland management? The authors utilize outcome additionality as a framework connected to the resilience of peatlands.

TI  - New records and modelling the impacts of climate change on the black-tailed marmosets
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change represents an unprecedented threat to global biodiversity and, for many species, gaps in our knowledge of their biology remain acute. Gaps in baseline knowledge, such as confirmed identifications (Linnean shortfalls) and adequate collections (Wallacean shortfalls), need to be minimized with new studies, since this is often critical for effective conservation. Despite the increase in scientific research on primates in the southwest of the Brazilian Amazon, little is known about the species Mico nigriceps (Ferrari & Lopes, 1992) Primates, Platirryni. In the current study, we sought to reduce the extent of the Wallacean shortfall for M. nigriceps, understand whether climate change represents a threat to the distribution of the species, and identify priority areas for its conservation. Accordingly, we provide 121 new records in 14 locations, obtained directly from the field, and five from the literature. Using this, we carried out ecological niche modeling, to better understand how environmental suitability might limit the area occupied by the species. We then projected a distribution for 2070 with the SSP2-4.5 (more optimistic) and SSP5-8.5 (more pessimistic) scenarios. Our data confirmed the geographic distribution of the species as being restricted to headwaters of the Ji-Parana/Machado river, but with a 400 km extension to the south. Under the modeled climate change scenarios, the area suitable for the species declines by 21% under the most optimistic, and by 27% in the pessimistic, scenario across the projected 50-year period. Although we have expanded the area of known occurrence for this species, we point out that climate change threatens the stability of this newly-discovered population strongly, and that this danger is intensified by deforestation, fire and hunting. We recommend that further studies be carried out to confirm the presence of the species in adjacent areas, those indicated by generated models as being potential environmentally suitable. In addition, we recommend intensifying forest restoration in currently pastured areas, and protection of the areas forming the current and future habitat of this species through such measures as protected area creation.

TI  - How Far Can Nature-Based Solutions Increase Water Supply Resilience to Climate Change in One of the Most Important Brazilian Watersheds?
T2  - EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Water resources are paramount for the maintenance of the Earth's system equilibrium; however, they face various threats and need increased conservation and better management. To restore water resources, nature-based solutions can be applied. Nevertheless, it is unclear which solution promotes greater water supply resilience: restoring riparian vegetation, improving management practices in key areas for water recharge, or both? In addition, how significant are these results in the face of climate change effects? To answer this, we used the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model to simulate and compare four different land use scenarios under three climate conditions (i.e., observed climate and two of the IPCC's future climate projections). Focusing on key areas contributed more to increasing water supply resilience than forest restoration. Applying both solutions, however, yielded the greatest increases in resilience and groundwater recharge and the greatest decreases in surface runoff and sediment loads. None of the solutions caused a significant difference in streamflow and water yield. Furthermore, according to both of the IPCC climate projections evaluated, by the end of this century, the average annual streamflow will be lower than the historical mean for the region. Climate adaptation strategies alone will be insufficient to ensure future water access, highlighting the need for implementing drastic mitigation actions.

TI  - Agroforestry contributions to smallholder farmer food security in Indonesia
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Review
AB  - Agroforestry has potential for strengthening the climate change resilience of smallholder farmers in Southeast Asia. In Indonesia, the food security challenges faced by smallholders will likely worsen due to climate change impacts. Agroforestry provides and option for strengthening climate change resilience, while contributing to food access, income, health, and environmental stability. To evaluate the evidence for such benefits, this systematic review identifies 22 peer-reviewed articles published between 2000 and 2019 which assess agroforestry's contributions to food security in Indonesia, mostly in Java or Sumatra. Analysis of the studies indicate that traditional and commercial agroforestry contribute to food security in diverse ways: for example, traditional homegardens offer 20% more dietary diversity than commercial counterparts, while commercial homegardens may contribute up to five times more income. Agri-silviculture contributions fall along a timber versus non-timber forest product continuum that displays a similar tradeoff between diversity and income. Those systems with a commercial focus may receive 54% of their income from a single commodity crop such as coffee, while traditional systems allow greater access to plants with medicinal benefits. Nearly all agroforestry systems offered indirect benefits for food security, such as allowing more off-farm work than traditional agriculture and contributing to environmental stability: users of agroforestry were found by one study to collect 83% less fuelwood from natural forests. One study highlighted that agroforestry options have up to 98% greater net present value (for periods over 30 years) compared to slash and burn style agriculture. However, very few studies of Indonesian agroforestry focused explicitly on financial analysis and food security, indicating the need for further research. Given the similar situations faced by many Southeast Asia countries, our findings contribute to emerging trends throughout the region regarding the relationship between agroforestry and food security.

TI  - Habitat suitability for primate conservation in north-east Brazil
T2  - ORYX
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil has a high diversity of primates, but increasing anthropogenic pressures and climate change could influence forest cover in the country and cause future changes in the distribution of primate populations. Here we aim to assess the long-term suitability of habitats for the conservation of three threatened Brazilian primates (Alouatta belzebul, Sapajus flavius and Sapajus libidinosus) through (1) estimating their current and future distributions using species distribution models, (2) evaluating how much of the areas projected to be suitable is represented within protected areas and priority areas for biodiversity conservation, and (3) assessing the extent of remaining forest cover in areas predicted to be suitable for these species. We found that 88% of the suitable areas are outside protected areas and only 24% are located in areas with forest cover. Although not within protected areas, 27% of the climatically suitable areas are considered priority areas for conservation. Future projections, considering a severe climate change scenario, indicate that A. belzebul, S. flavius and S. libidinosus may lose up to 94, 98 and 54% of their suitable range, respectively. The establishment of primate populations and their long-term survival in these areas are at risk. Mitigation actions such as the implementation of new protected areas, forest restoration and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions will be essential for the conservation of Brazilian primates.

TI  - Expanding forest carbon sinks to mitigate climate change in Africa
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests significantly contribute to climate change mitigation by acting as carbon sinks, sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide, and keeping it in soil and biomass. Covering 22 % of its land, African forests offer numerous benefits to millions of people. Nevertheless, they face threats from human activities like deforestation and degradation. A holistic approach encompassing social, economic, and environmental factors is necessary to sustain forests as carbon sinks for maximum carbon sequestration potential. This study used carbon dioxide emissions, forest loss and gain, and land use change to investigate the level of carbon dioxide emissions and their relationship to forest loss and climate change in Africa from 1992 to 2020. Using ArcGIS, land use change was reclassified, InVEST model calculated carbon storage and sequestration, and annual changes in forest cover were assessed using the K and S indices. In the last two decades, 77.36 % of African countries had greater forest losses than gains, leading to 32 x 10(3) kha net loss, resulting in 15.73 Pg C of carbon dioxide emissions. Annual forest loss rate is 1.6 x 10(3) kha, equivalent to 0.786 Pg C, and that of carbon storage and sequestration decreased to -0.69 and -1.37, respectively. Results indicate that deforestation, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, significantly contributes to carbon emissions, and persistent tropical deforestation will affect future greenhouse gas concentrations. This research provides a detailed spatiotemporal analysis, highlighting areas experiencing severe forest cover change and carbon loss, underscoring the importance of forest conservation in mitigating climate change, and promoting effective land management policies.

TI  - Assessing the importance-performance analysis of adaptive capacity programs for sustainable mangrove conservation in the Taman Nasional Bali Barat conservation area
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves, which are vital for maintaining the stability of coastal ecosystems, are facing increasing threats from global changes. This highlights the urgent need for effective adaptive capacity programs. This study focuses on the evaluation of such programs within Taman Nasional Bali Barat, Indonesia, specifically looking at their effectiveness in promoting sustainable mangrove conservation. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the community's involvement and perspectives, a survey was conducted, including a wide range of local stakeholders, not just those already involved in conservation efforts. The findings revealed that programs that prioritize flexibility, learning, and agency are crucial, but are currently underperforming. Interestingly, there was a significant variation in the willingness to participate among different groups. Fishermen and students displayed negative tendencies, while limited interest communities (a population segment historically less engaged in conservation), those with previous experiences with conservation programs, those seeking advice on marine activities, and those influenced by policies showed positive and significant responses. For example, tourist operators also exhibited a significantly positive engagement. Based on the analysis, this study provides targeted policy recommendations to enhance stakeholder engagement, improve program flexibility, and emphasize educational efforts. These recommendations aim to strengthen the adaptive capacity for sustainable mangrove management in the face of ongoing global changes.

TI  - Greenhouse gas emissions and reduction strategies for the world's largest greenhouse gas emitters
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of climate change, it is crucial to examine the contributions of leading countries in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This research provides an overview of global GHG emissions from 1970 to 2022 for the world's most polluting countries: the United States, China, India, Russia, Brazil, Indonesia, Japan, Iran, Mexico, and Saudi Arabia. These countries collectively account for approximately 64% of GHG emissions. The aim is to understand the impact of various economic sectors, such as industry, energy, agriculture, and transportation, on overall emissions. The analysis highlights the disparity in per capita emissions, with smaller but major oil-producing countries in the Persian Gulf, such as Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, exhibiting high per capita emission levels, while more populated countries like the United States and South Korea show lower per capita values but significant total emission volumes. The study suggests that transitioning to renewable energy, improving energy efficiency in industry, promoting sustainable agriculture, reforestation, and electrifying transportation are key methods to achieve United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDG). Recommendations include encouraging technological innovations, implementing stringent government regulations and standards, and garnering active support for GHG reduction programs from governments, financial institutions, and the business community. The urgency is emphasized for global efforts to combat climate change for ensuring a sustainable future.

TI  - Can forests buffer negative impacts of land-use and climate changes on water ecosystem services? The case of a Brazilian megalopolis
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - While the role of land-use conversion on water quality is reasonably understood, its role on water quantity is controversial. Climate change is also expected to impact water availability. Here we explore the interplay of hydrology, land-use change and climate change in one of the most populous urban areas in the world. We examined the potential of forests to buffer the negative impacts of land-use and climate changes on water-related ecosystem services in Tiete Basin, Brazil, which supplies water to the Sao Paulo megalopolis. We modelled six hydrological parameters using the WaterWorld Policy Support System, simulating the current baseline and six future scenarios (with different land-use and climate changes). Our results corroborate the general trend that increased forest cover improves water quality. Our modelling also predicts that increased forest cover increases water quantity in the southern part of the basin. The effects of climate change are observed mainly in urban areas, with a reduction in water quality. Because urban areas are not eligible for reforestation, they cannot benefit from its buffering effect on climate change. The increase in water availability is the greatest benefit of reforestation as a strategy to improve water-related ecosystem services in the region. Reforestation, however, will not suffice to restore all hydrological parameters in the basin, and additional sustainable agricultural practices are needed to mitigate impacts on water quality.

TI  - Integrating the resilience concept into ecosystem restoration
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoring resilient ecosystems is critical to preparing for the uncertain effects of climatic change on ecosystem functioning and socially relevant services. The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration attempts to inspire the global ecological restoration movement, reverse degradation, and mitigate climate change impacts. We present ways in which resilience might be further integrated into the science of restoration ecology and the practice of ecological restoration to address the uncertainty associated with the current impacts of adverse climatic change. We describe how incorporating meaningful community engagement, expanding monitoring indicators, and upscaling across spatial-temporal scales will improve the current state of ecosystem restoration. We present case studies of restoration approaches across Southeast Asia that utilize approaches that confer resilience (resistance, recovery, reorganization) in their restoration projects and their broader social-ecological systems. The panarchy framework encapsulates the importance of strengthening relationships between all stakeholders and restoration projects to build resilience across larger spatial-temporal scales.

TI  - Climate change mitigation on tropical peatlands: A triple burden for smallholder farmers in Indonesia
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The agricultural use and conversion of tropical peatlands is considered a major source of land-based greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, the protection and restoration of tropical peatlands has recently turned into an important strategy to mitigate global climate change. Little research exists that has investigated the impacts and dynamics that such climate mitigation efforts evoke in local communities living in and around peatlands. We present in-sights on this from Sumatra, Indonesia and use a climate justice lens to evaluate local outcomes. We show how an increasingly transnational network of state and non-state actors has become involved in developing new laws, policy programs and land-use agreements on Sumatra's coastal peatlands, aiming at supposedly win-win low-carbon development pathways. We argue that such efforts are open to much of the same criticism that has been raised regarding previous policies and projects aimed at reducing GHGE from deforestation and forest degradation. These projects disregard local perspectives on development, fail to deliver the promised benefits and, through a reconfiguration of local land-use rights, reduce the capabilities of smallholder farmers to benefit from their land. In sum, our analysis suggests that recent policies and projects aimed at mitigating GHGE from tropical peatlands contribute to a redistribution of the global climate mitigation burden onto smallholder farmers in Indonesia. This occurs through their threefold assignment to protect forests, prevent fires and help restore degraded peatlands.

TI  - Investigating biodiversity trends in different mitigation scenarios with a national integrated assessment model
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The inclusion of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in climate mitigation pathways is critical and can be reached by assessing their consequences through the deployment of appropriate indicators to that end. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are important tools for understanding possible impacts caused by adopting new policies. We investigate terrestrial biodiversity trends (life on land: SDG 15) for three different climate mitigation scenarios for Brazil: (1) A scenario compatible with a world that maintains its current policies with current deforestation rates in the Amazon and the Cerrado biomes; (2) A scenario in which Brazil fulfils its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC); and (3) A scenario compatible with a world that limits warming to 1.5 & DEG;C. We use the Brazilian Land-Use and Energy System model (BLUES), a national IAM, to show the implications of the transitions involved in the above-mentioned scenarios for the country up to 2050. We conduct a post-processing analysis using consolidated biodiversity indicators to emphasize how different IAM greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mitigation solutions present distinct positive and negative potential impacts on biodiversity in Brazil. However, our analysis does not consider the impacts associated with climate change, but only the risks imposed by mitigation policies. Our results indicate that biodiversity loss decreases in the scenarios from (1) to (3), implying that stronger climate change mitigation actions could result in smaller biodiversity losses. We conclude that Brazil has the opportunity to align its biodiversity and climate goals through nature-based solutions (NBS), such as forest conservation, restoration, pasture recovery, and the use of crop-pasture and agroforestry systems.

TI  - Human dimensions of climate change: the vulnerability of small farmers in the Amazon
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper argues for a twofold perspective on human adaptation to climate change in the Amazon. First, we need to understand the processes that mediate perceptions of environmental change and the behavioural responses at the levels of the individual and the local population. Second, we should take into account the process of production and dissemination of global and national climate information and models to regional and local populations, especially small farmers. We discuss the sociocultural and environmental diversity of small farmers in the Amazon and their susceptibility to climate change associated with drought, flooding and accidental fire. Using survey, ethnographic and archival data from study areas in the state of Para, we discuss farmers' sources of knowledge and long-term memory of climatic events, drought and accidental fire; their sources of climate information; their responses to drought and fire events and the impact of changing rainfall patterns on land use. We highlight the challenges of adaptation to climate change created by the influence of migration and family turnover on collective action and memory, the mismatch of scales used to monitor and disseminate climate data and the lack of extension services to translate large-scale forecasts to local needs. We found that for most farmers, memories of extended drought tend to decrease significantly after 3 years. Over 50% of the farmers interviewed in 2002 did not remember as significant the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) drought of 1997/1998. This helps explain why approximately 40% of the farmers have not changed their land-use behaviours in the face of the strongest ENSO event of the twentieth century.

TI  - Balancing carrots and sticks in REDD plus : implications for social safeguards
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing carbon emissions through avoided deforestation and forest degradation and enhancement of carbon stocks (REDD+) is key to mitigating global climate change. The aim of REDD+ social safeguards is to ensure that REDD+ does not harm, and actually benefits, local people. To be eligible for results-based compensation through REDD+, countries should develop nationallevel safeguard information systems to monitor and report on the impacts of REDD+. Although safeguards represent a key step for promoting social responsibility in REDD+, they are challenging to operationalize and monitor. We analyzed the impacts of different types of REDD+ interventions (incentives vs. disincentives) on key safeguard-relevant indicators, i.e., tenure security, participation, and subjective well-being, as well as on reported forest clearing. We used household-level data collected in Brazil, Peru, Cameroon, Tanzania, Indonesia, and Vietnam from approximately 4000 households in 130 villages at two points in time (2010-2012 and 2013-2014). Our findings highlight a decrease in perceived tenure security and overall perceived well-being over time for households exposed to disincentives alone, with the addition of incentives helping to alleviate negative effects on well-being. In Brazil, although disincentives were associated with reduced reported forest clearing by smallholders, they were the intervention that most negatively affected perceived well-being, highlighting a clear trade-off between carbon and noncarbon benefits. Globally, although households exposed to REDD+ interventions were generally aware of local REDD+ initiatives, meaningful participation in initiative design and implementation lagged behind. Our analysis contributes to a relatively small literature that seeks to operationalize REDD+ social safeguards empirically and to evaluate the impacts of REDD+ interventions on local people and forests.

TI  - Are national commitments to reducing emissions from forests effective? Lessons from Indonesia
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - For Indonesia to achieve its greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments, it will have to reduce emissions from deforestation, forest degradation and peatland degradation. The National Action Plan for Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reductions was Indonesia's first comprehensive plan. It reflected Indonesia's emission reduction commitments to 2020, and the first phase ran from 2010 to 2014. This research evaluates its design and implementation. It assesses seven out of thirteen actions that were implemented to reduce emissions from forestry and peatland degradation. It is shown that only two actions had a direct, evidence-based link to emission sources. Three actions had some evidence of a link, albeit dependent on many factors. For the remaining two actions, focused on emissions from agriculture in peatland, there was no information to demonstrate clear and targeted implementation of the actions. The analysis also shows that the indicators listed in the National Action Plan were insufficient to demonstrate meaningful reductions of emissions. Part of the explanation for the problematic design of the actions is that many of them were pre-existing policies, aimed at achieving a variety of different objectives that were just rebadged as climate change actions.

TI  - Integrating climate change into agroforestry conservation: A case study on native plant species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Designing multispecies systems with suitable climatic affinity and identifying species' vulnerability under human-driven climate change are current challenges to achieve successful adaptation of natural systems. To address this problem, we need to (1) identify groups of species with climatic similarity under climate scenarios and (2) identify areas with high conservation value under predicted climate change.2. To recognize species with similar climatic niche requirements that can be grouped for mixed cropping in Brazil, we employed ecological niche models (ENMs) and Spearman's. for overlap. We also used prioritization algorithms to map areas of high conservation value using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP3-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) to assess mid-term (2041-2060) and long-term (2061-2080) climate change impacts.3. We identified 15 species groups with finer climatic affinities at different times depicted on hierarchical clustering dendrograms, which can be combined into agroecological agroforestry systems. Furthermore, we highlight the climatically suitable areas for these groups of species, thus providing an outlook of where different species will need to be planted over time to be conserved. In addition, we observed that climate change is predicted to modify the spatial association of these groups under different future climate scenarios, causing a mean negative change in species climatic similarity of 9.5% to 13.7% under SSP2-4.5 scenario and 9.5% to 10.5% under SSP5-8.5, for 2041-2060 and 2061-2080, respectively.4. Synthesis and applications. Our findings provide a framework for agroforestry conservation. The groups of species with finer climatic affinities identified and the climatically suitable areas can be combined into agroecological productive systems, and provide an outlook of where different species may be planted over time. In addition, the conservation priority zones displaying high climate stability for each species individually and all at once can be incorporated into Brazil's conservation plans by policymakers to prioritize specific sites. Lastly, we urge policymakers, conservation organizations and donors to promote interventions involving farmers and local communities, since the species' evaluated have proven to maintain landscapes with productive forest fragments and can be conserved in different Brazilian ecosystems.

TI  - Climate Change Effect on Water Use Efficiency under Selected Soil and Water Conservation Practices in the Ruzizi Catchment, Eastern D.R. Congo
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Concerns have been raised on the effectiveness and sustainability of Soil and Water Conservation (SWC) practices as adaptation options to climate change and high intra- and inter-annual rainfall variabilities in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This study was conducted in the Ruzizi Plain, a dryland area, to assess the performance of maize (Zea mays L.) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) and two SWC practices (tied ridges and conventional tillage). The AgMIP's Regional Integrated Assessment (RIA) approach was used to simulate Water Use Efficiency (WUE) under the Cropping System Model-Crop Environment Resource Synthesis (CSM-CERES-Maize) of the Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer (DSSAT). The model was calibrated using experimental data from nine cropping seasons (2011-2018) and 100 farms. The model sensitivity was assessed as a function of temperature, water, and SWC practices for the same environments. Initial conditions of crop management practices were used as input data for CSM-CERES-Maize. Current climate data were extracted from AgMERRA datasets corrected with local data for the period of 1980 to 2021. Future climate projections (2022-2099) were obtained after down-scaling the data from the 29 General Circulation Models (GCMS) of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) and subsetted to five GCMs based on climate regimes. GCMS results were a strong indicator that climate change in this DRC dryland will result in an increase in average annual temperatures for both RCP 4.5 and 8.5, with the highest increase (3.05 degrees C) under hot/dry conditions for RCP8.5 and the lowest (1.04 degrees C) under cool/dry conditions for RCP 4.5. All the models selected for five climate regimes for 2022-2099 showed no change in the rainfall trends for RCP 4.5 (p > 0.05). The models projected yield declines of 5-25%, with less yield losses under tied ridges as an adaptation practice. The use of efficient SWC practices could therefore be a promising strategy in reducing potential losses from climate change in drylands of eastern DRC.

AB  - Droughts have increased in frequency, duration, and severity across most of the tropics but their effect on forest communities remain not fully understood. Here we assessed the effects of a severe El Nino-induced drought event on dominant and low abundance understory plant species and the consequent impacts on ecosystem functions in the South American Atlantic Forest. We established 20 permanent plots with contrasting vegetation structure and topography. In each plot, we measured the stem diameter at breast height (DBH) of every understory woody plant (i.e. 1 to 10 cm stem diameter) before and after a severe 4-year drought event to calculate relative growth and mortality rates after drought. Litter biomass, litter nutrient content and soil nutrients, as well as tree canopy cover, were also quantified. High stem density reduced survival to drought for both dominant and low abundance understory woody species. The growth rate of dominant and low abundance species was lower on steeper slopes during the drought. Dominant species were the main contributor of litter biomass production whereas low abundance species were important drivers of litter quality. Overall, our findings suggest that habitats with low tree density and larger trees on flat areas, such as in valleys, can act as refuges for understory plant species during drought periods. These habitats are resource-rich, providing nutrients and water during unfavorable drought periods and might improve forest resilience to climate change in the long term. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Soil Organic Matter, Mitigation of and Adaptation to Climate Change in Cocoa-Based Agroforestry Systems
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Belowground roles of agroforestry in climate change mitigation (C storage) and adaptation (reduced vulnerability to drought) are less obvious than easy-to-measure aspects aboveground. Documentation on these roles is lacking. We quantified the organic C concentration (C-org) and soil physical properties in a mountainous landscape in Sulawesi (Indonesia) for five land cover types: secondary forest (SF), multistrata cocoa-based agroforestry (CAF) aged 4-5 years (CAF4), 10-12 years (CAF10), 17-34 years (CAF17), and multistrata (mixed fruit and timber) agroforest (MAF45) aged 45-68 years. With four replicate plots per cover type, we measured five pools of C-stock according to IPCC guidelines, soil bulk density (BD), macro porosity (MP), hydraulic conductivity (K-s), and available water capacity of the soil (AWC). The highest C-stock, in SF, was around 320 Mg ha(-1), the lowest, 74 Mg ha(-1), was in CAF4, with the older agroforestry systems being intermediate with 120 to 150 Mg ha(-1). Soil compaction after forest conversion led to increased BD and reduced MP, K-s, and AWC. Older agroforestry partly recovered buffering: AWC per m of rooted soil profile increased by 5.7 mm per unit (g kg(-1)) increase of C-org. The restored AWC can support about a week's worth of evapotranspiration without rain, assisting in climate change adaptation.

TI  - Shifts in plant functional groups along an aridity gradient in a tropical dry forest
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Increasing aridity associated with climate change may lead to the crossing of critical ecosystem thresholds in drylands, compromising ecosystem services for millions of people. In this context, finding tools to detect at early stages the effects of increasing aridity on ecosystems is extremely urgent to avoid irreversible damage. Here, we assess shifts in plant community functional structure along a spatial aridity gradient in tropical dryland (Brazilian Caatinga), to select the most appropriate plant functional groups as ecological indicators likely useful to predict temporal ecosystem trajectories in response to aridity. We identified seven plant functional groups based on 13 functional traits associated with plant establishment, defense, regeneration, and dispersal, whose relative abundances changed, linearly and non -linearly, with increasing aridity, showing either increasing or decreasing trends. Of particular importance is the increase in abundance of plants with high chemical defense and Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) photosynthetic pathway, with increasing aridity. We propose the use of these functional groups as early warning indicators to detect aridity impacts on these dryland ecosystems and shifts in ecosystem functioning. This information can also be used in the elaboration of mitigation and ecological restoration measures to prevent and revert current and future climate change impacts on tropical dry forests.

TI  - Potential aboveground biomass increase in Brazilian Atlantic Forest fragments with climate change
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fragmented tropical forest landscapes preserve much of the remaining biodiversity and carbon stocks. Climate change is expected to intensify droughts and increase fire hazard and fire intensities, thereby causing habitat deterioration, and losses of biodiversity and carbon stock losses. Understanding the trajectories that these landscapes may follow under increased climate pressure is imperative for establishing strategies for conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Here, we used a quantitative predictive modelling approach to project the spatial distribution of the aboveground biomass density (AGB) by the end of the 21st century across the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (AF) domain. To develop the models, we used the maximum entropy method with projected climate data to 2100, based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 from the fifth Assessment Report. Our AGB models had a satisfactory performance (area under the curve > 0.75 and p value < .05). The models projected a significant increase of 8.5% in the total carbon stock. Overall, the projections indicated that 76.9% of the AF domain would have suitable climatic conditions for increasing biomass by 2100 considering the RCP 4.5 scenario, in the absence of deforestation. Of the existing forest fragments, 34.7% are projected to increase their AGB, while 2.6% are projected to have their AGB reduced by 2100. The regions likely to lose most AGB-up to 40% compared to the baseline-are found between latitudes 13 & DEG; and 20 & DEG; south. Overall, although climate change effects on AGB vary latitudinally for the 2071-2100 period under the RCP 4.5 scenario, our model indicates that AGB stocks can potentially increase across a large fraction of the AF. The patterns found here are recommended to be taken into consideration during the planning of restoration efforts, as part of climate change mitigation strategies in the AF and elsewhere in Brazil.

TI  - Prioritize grassland restoration to bend the curve of biodiversity loss
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In times of unprecedented climate change, ecological restoration efforts have a strong focus on forests for the purpose of carbon sequestration. Grasslands, in contrast, remain relatively neglected in global restoration policies. Concurrently, we are in the midst of a biodiversity crisis-it is estimated that 1 million species are globally threatened with extinction. Here, we present analyses from central Europe and southern Brazil that show that the majority of our endangered plant species are in fact found in open ecosystems. Using Germany as an example, we show that we could reduce plant extinction risk by up to 82% if we restore open, grassy ecosystems. This also holds true for southern Brazil, where grassland species constitute the single largest share of endangered species, but where grassy ecosystems continue to be systematically neglected by restoration policies. We further expand on our biodiversity argument to include the role that grassland restoration can play in mitigating climate change. We posit that ramping up grassland restoration efforts may not only be our best bet to bend the curve of biodiversity loss, but it will also make a critical contribution to the resilience of ecosystems in the dynamic decades to come. It is time for grassland restoration to receive higher priority in global restoration efforts and policy.

TI  - Costs of Lost opportunities: Applying Non-Market Valuation Techniques to Potential REDD plus Participants in Cameroon
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) has been systematically advanced within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). However, implementing REDD+ in a populated landscape requires information on local costs and acceptability of changed practices. To supply such information, many studies have adopted approaches that explore the opportunity cost of maintaining land as forest rather than converting it to agricultural uses. These approaches typically assume that the costs to the smallholder are borne exclusively through the loss or gain of the production values associated with specific categories of land use. However, evaluating the value of land to smallholders in incomplete and messy institutional and economic contexts entails other considerations, such as varying portfolios of land holdings, tenure arrangements, restricted access to capital, and unreliable food markets. We suggest that contingent valuation (CV) methods may provide a more complete reflection of the viability of REDD+ in multiple-use landscapes than do opportunity cost approaches. The CV approach eliminates the need to assume a homogenous smallholder, and instead assumes heterogeneity around social, economic and institutional contexts. We apply this approach in a southern rural Cameroonian context, through the lens of a hypothetical REDD+ contract. Our findings suggest local costs of REDD+ contracts to be higher and much more variable than opportunity cost estimates.

AB  - Banda Aceh (BA) is the capital of Aceh Province, Indonesia. It was the most affected areas by the 2004 tsunami. Before the natural catastrophe, most of the BA mangroves disturbed by human activities and remaining mangroves were fragmented and had a low density of trees. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to calculate the impact of the tsunami on mangrove and subsequently to evaluate the mangrove recovery based on spatial and temporal analysis and ground truthing method within the period 11 years in intertidal areas of BA. Three regions of BA coastal areas were selected, namely Kuala Cangkoy, Gampong Jawa and Lambada coasts. Before the tsunami, the mangrove forests in BA were only 13.6% of BA coastlands and fragmented. Approximately 48.9% of the mangroves have destroyed due to the tsunami. The BA mangroves at 5 and 11 years after tsunami were 66.5% and 81.3% relative to the data before tsunami, respectively. It means that the BA is very vulnerable due to the future tsunami occur. Therefore, the mangrove restoration in BA needs to be improved and maintain based on green belt concept for coastal protection as well as productivity of estuarine ecosystem.

TI  - New insights into trends of rainfall extremes in the Amazon basin through trend-empirical orthogonal function (1981-2021)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies related to monitoring changes in frequency, intensity and duration of precipitation extremes are key to creating efficient climate change measures and forest conservation policies. This study describes new insights into rainfall precipitation extremes over the Amazon basin (AB) during the last four decades (1981-2021) from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPSv2). Here we analysed the trends of daily extreme precipitation indices proposed by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) at the seasonal scale, using the trend-empirical orthogonal function (TEOF). Our results indicate that the frequency of precipitation extremes increased over Peruvian Amazonia and northeastern Brazilian Amazonia, and reduced in the centre of AB, mainly during the first seasons of the year: December-January-February (DJF) and March-April-May (MAM). The cooling trend over the eastern and central tropical Pacific and the warming trend over the tropical and western subtropical Pacific could associate with the increase in frequency of precipitation extremes in DJF. Furthermore, during June-July-August (JJA) and September-October-November (SON), rainfall intensity indices showed a decrease in Colombia and the Bolivian Amazon; in contrast, northern and southern Peru delivered an increased pattern. The trend pattern in the JJA and SON seasons could be associated with a warming trend over most of the North Atlantic and a cooling in the 40 degrees-60 degrees S band. Our results demonstrate that the precipitation extremes over the AB have spatially varying trends. These heterogeneous trends over the space might be take into account for robust adaptation policies over the countries that are parts of the AB, such as Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Per & uacute;, Surinam and Venezuela.The trend-empirical orthogonal function (TEOF) approach allowed us to identify the spatiotemporal patterns of trends in extreme rainfall intensity and frequency indices over the Amazon basin and their differential relationship with trends in large-scale climate variability phenomena. image

TI  - Assessing mangrove restoration practices using species-interaction networks
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are uniquely important ecosystems, for preserving biodiversity, sustaining livelihoods, and mitigating against climate change. However, they are degraded globally and are therefore a priority for ecosystem restoration. To date, the assessment of mangrove restoration outcomes is generally poor, and the limited studies that do exist are focused largely on forest area. Thus, more holistic ways of assessing the outcomes of mangrove restoration projects on biodiversity and associated ecological processes are urgently needed. Ecological networks are a useful tool for simultaneously examining both. Here, we assessed the utility of using species-interaction networks for evaluating mangrove restoration outcomes for the first time. We compared the structure and complexity of mangrove ecological networks in replicated "monoculture reforestation," "mixed species regeneration" and "reference forest" plots in two study areas in Sulawesi, Indonesia, an estuarine, and a coastal fringe mangrove system. We also combined and evaluated sampling methods, utilizing traditional plant-animal sampling while also integrating video recording data in a novel way. We found significant differences in the structure and complexity of mangrove networks between restored and natural plots, with contrasting effects between the two sites. Our results show differences in the complex ways in which taxa interact in mangrove restoration projects, which would be overlooked if common biodiversity metrics, such as species richness, were used alone, with consequences for the restoration of ecosystem functioning. We also highlight the utility of video recording data collection for constructing species-interaction networks, overcoming the detrimental impacts of observer presence for some key species.

TI  - Modeling Environmental Vulnerability for 2050 Considering Different Scenarios in the Doce River Basin, Brazil
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding climate change and land use impacts is crucial for mitigating environmental degradation. This study assesses the environmental vulnerability of the Doce River Basin for 2050, considering future climate change and land use and land cover (LULC) scenarios. Factors including slope, elevation, relief dissection, precipitation, temperature, pedology, geology, urban distance, road distance, and LULC were evaluated using multicriteria analysis. Regional climate models Eta-HadGEM2-ES and Eta-MIROC5 under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios were employed. The Land Change Modeler tool simulated 2050 LULC changes and hypothetical reforestation of legal reserve (RL) areas. Combining two climate and two LULC scenarios resulted in four future vulnerability scenarios. Projections indicate an over 300 mm reduction in average annual precipitation and an up to 2 degrees C temperature increase from 2020 to 2050. Scenario 4 (RCP 8.5 and LULC for 2050 with reforested RLs) showed the greatest basin area in the lowest vulnerability classes, while scenario 3 (RCP 4.5 and LULC for 2050) exhibited more high-vulnerability areas. Despite the projected relative improvement in environmental vulnerability by 2050 due to reduced rainfall, the complexity of associated relationships must be considered. These results contribute to mitigating environmental damage and adapting to future climatic conditions in the Doce River Basin.

TI  - Coral reef restoration in Indonesia: lessons learnt from the world's largest coral restoration nation
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Indonesia is the global coral reef restoration leader by number of projects, yet these remain diverse and disparate. This study reviews the status of Indonesian coral reef restoration within a framework of international common best practice (CBP) that incorporates internationally-recognised Standards for Ecological Restoration (SER). This framework is used to formulate recommendations for a formal network of reef restoration practitioners with the purview to develop and implement a national restoration roadmap. Forty-five projects were surveyed to determine how projects have been planned and implemented. This was compared with recommendations from CBP. There is particular scope to increase quantitative data collection, reinforce community involvement, improve ecological data collection, and standardise monitoring protocols. While 84% of projects reported quantifiable goals, 64% did not quantify goals during planning and 61% did not incorporate climate-smart design features. Quantitative reef monitoring surveys were absent in 22% of projects. The majority of projects did not quantify important ecological metrics like coral community composition/diversity (96%), coral health/bleaching (89%), benthic community (62%), and coral survival (62%). Indonesia has the capacity, regulations, and networks to position itself as a reef restoration driver in the Coral Triangle region; this will require increased coordination, alignment, and quantification of restoration. A structured, collaborative, and iterative national network of various stakeholders would facilitate the development of a national restoration roadmap based on adaptive management strategies. This would aid in standardising project planning, monitoring, and reporting. Efforts should include an increased focus on climate change adaptation goals.

TI  - Modeling Aboveground Biomass in Tropical Forests Using Multi-Frequency SAR Data-A Comparison of Methods
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of climate change mitigation mechanisms for avoiding deforestation, i.e., reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), comprehensive forest monitoring, especially in tropical regions, is of high relevance. A precise determination of forest carbon stocks or above-ground biomass (AGB) for large areas is of special importance.This study analyzes and compares three different methods for retrieving AGB in Indonesia's peat swamp forests from multi-frequency SAR backscatter data. Field inventory AGB data were related to LiDAR measurements allowing plentiful accurate AGB estimations. These estimatedAGB data provided a powerful basis for SAR based AGB model calibration and validation. Multivariate linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) were examined for their performance to retrieve AGB on the basis of multi-temporal TerraSAR-X and ALOS PALSAR imagery.The MLR model resulted in lower coefficients of determination and higher error measures than the other two approaches and showed significant overestimations in the high biomass range. The SVR modeled AGB was more accurate than ANN modeled AGB in terms of independent validation, but showed less variation in the spatial distribution of AGB and saturated at approximately 260 t/ha. The ANN model showed a superior performance for modeling AGB up to 650 t/ha without a saturation in the lower biomass ranges.For the needs of REDD+, it is very important to know the possibilities, constraints and uncertainties of AGB retrieval based on satellite imagery.

TI  - Slowing Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon: Avoiding Legal Deforestation by Compensating Farmers and Ranchers
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon Forest is an unquestionable cradle of planetary biological diversity and plays a fundamental role in regional and global climate change regulation. Annual deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon have gone up since 2012, presenting a grim scenario for 2021. The majority of this deforestation is illegal, but a significant proportion, 11.3 million hectares of forest in privately owned land, can be legally deforested and impact local climate, compromising Brazil's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the Paris Agreement. Thus, a fundamental question remains: how can we avoid potentially legal deforestation? Farmers and ranchers who have the right to deforest have long demanded financial incentives to keep their forests standing, but few (if any) mechanisms exist to achieve it. We developed a compensation mechanism called CONSERV, hypothesizing that legal deforestation can be avoided through targeted compensation. CONSERV can potentially contribute to climate change mitigation and foster business models geared towards conservation and increased agricultural productivity when implemented at scale. We present CONSERV's concept and potential to become an operational mechanism for Payment for Ecosystem Services/REDD + in line with Brazil's Native Vegetation Protection Law and NDC commitment. Furthermore, we introduce some ideas on how CONSERV ensures permanence and minimizes leakage while gaining scale. To successfully maintain climatic stability and ecosystems, we need to reduce deforestation, both illegal and legal. CONSERV can help us solve the latter.

TI  - Climate-Smart Conservation Agriculture, Farm Values and Tenure Security: Implications for Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation in the Congo Basin
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Research Aims: Agriculture through deforestation is an important threat to biodiversity conservation in the Congo Basin's tropical forest. The policy challenge is not only to promote adaptation to perceived climate change but also to promote forest conservation. The aim of this study is to provide empirical evidence on the impact of farm-level investments in climate-smart agricultural practices related to conservation agriculture in some Congo Basin countries. The hypothesis is that property rights to land and trees play a fundamental role in governing the patterns of investment, forestland management for conservation, as well as in the profitability of agriculture. Methods: A Simulated Maximum Likelihood Estimation using a Mixed Logit model is used to test farmers' choice of agricultural system and a farmland value model for each agricultural system which includes determinants of tenure or property rights, climate, soils, and socioeconomic variables such as education and gender. The data was collected from more than 600 farms covering 12 regions and 45 divisions in 3 countries, Cameroon, the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Results: Farmers choose one of three agricultural systems to maximize farm profit mindful of the current tenure regime and environmental conditions. Conservation agriculture techniques within climate-smart practices show benefits for smallholder farmers through improvements in soil health, soil moisture retention and enhanced crop yields. The rights to access, withdraw, manage, as well as exclude others from land and trees affect both the farmers' choice of system and the profit earned from the chosen system. Conclusion: Farm-level investments improve farm incomes and enhance conservation effort for farmers perceiving climate change. Implications for Conservation: Climate change adaptation through planting of trees improves soil stability, restores ecosystems and creates a safe haven for biodiversity. Secure land tenure promotes better forestland management and reduces land degradation in vulnerable communities.

TI  - Recruitment and mortality of Rhizophora mangle L. seedlings in the Tropical Southwestern Atlantic mangrove.
T2  - Brazilian journal of biology = Revista brasleira de biologia
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Studies in the long-term recruitment and mortality of mangrove seedlings can help to understand mangrove demography and its relationship with climatic variables, environmental restoration and advances in the ecology of this ecosystem. A seven-year population dynamics study of seedling recruitment and mortality in cohorts of Rhizophora mangle L. was carried out to identify expansion processes and patterns of survival in the understory of mangrove forests on the Atlantic coast of Brazil. The present study aimed to evaluate the relationship between recruitment and mortality R. mangle seedlings at the population level, salinity, and climatic variables (precipitation, temperature and humidity). On an annual scale, seedling recruitment was positively correlated with mean temperature. Seedling density was negatively correlated with the number of recruits and positively with the number of deaths. The number of recruits was associated with dead seedlings, temperature and precipitation considering a population scale, without grouping the data. The seedling density in the stands increased with the number of dead seedlings. Our findings described the relationship between climate variability (durability and magnitude of the dry/rainy season) and the long-term population dynamics of R. mangle seedlings in a poorly studied region and from what moment, on a monthly and annual time scale, did this relationship become significant and changes occur. The findings of this study provide information on the population dynamics of the species that will help in understanding mangrove demography. These results have important implications for projections about the recruitment and survival of the species thinking about to long-term climate change that will modify current weather patterns and mangrove conservation efforts.

TI  - REDD plus in Indonesia: An assessment of the international environmental program
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This paper provides a comprehensive review of the literature and assesses the progress on the effects of Indonesia's REDD+ program. Due to the significance of Indonesia in terms of global rainforests and the comprehensive implementation practice of REDD+ programs since 2009, focusing on the case study of Indonesia enables interesting insights regarding the challenges and opportunities of REDD+. Indonesia faced challenges during the project's implementation, but there were also reductions. This success is attributed to the set program design of REDD+. In this paper, we show that without international development cooperation in the field of climate change mitigation, the countries in the Global South lack locally driven forest conservation or restoration incentives. These incentives emanate exogenously from international development cooperation programs in the field of climate change mitigation. The review of the program also shows that despite the rigorous institutional design of REDD+ in Indonesia, not all the stakeholders could benefit from the program appropriately. Because of the de facto weakness of the smallholder farmers, indigenous population groups, and other vulnerable categories in the political process of Indonesia, these groups' interests have not come fully to their own in Indonesia. Hence, we conclude that international programs that target environmental protection, while addressing inferior institutional quality, bad governance and operate through more accountable NGOs than government agencies would perform better in terms of global environmental targets and the sustainability of local livelihoods.

TI  - Old-growth forest loss and secondary forest recovery across Amazonian countries
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - There is growing recognition of the potential of large-scale forest restoration in the Amazon as a 'nature-based solution' to climate change. However, our knowledge of forest loss and recovery beyond Brazil is limited, and carbon emissions and accumulation have not been estimated for the whole biome. Combining a 33 year land cover dataset with estimates of above-ground biomass and carbon sequestration rates, we evaluate forest loss and recovery across nine Amazonian countries and at a local scale. We also estimate the role of secondary forests in offsetting old-growth deforestation emissions and explore the temporal trends in forest loss and recovery. We find secondary forests across the biome to have offset just 9.7% of carbon emissions from old-growth deforestation, despite occupying 28.8% of deforested land. However, these numbers varied between countries ranging from 9.0% in Brazil to 23.8% in Guyana for carbon offsetting, and 24.8% in Brazil to 56.9% in Ecuador for forest area recovery. We reveal a strong, negative spatial relationship between old-growth forest loss and recovery by secondary forests, showing that regions with the greatest potential for large-scale restoration are also those that currently have the lowest recovery (e.g. Brazil dominates deforestation and emissions but has the lowest recovery). In addition, a temporal analysis of the regions that were >80% deforested in 1997 shows a continued decline in overall forest cover. Our findings identify three important challenges: (a) incentivising large-scale restoration in highly deforested regions, (b) protecting secondary forests without disadvantaging landowners who depend on farm-fallow systems, and (c) preventing further deforestation. Combatting all these successfully is essential to ensuring that the Amazon biome achieves its potential in mitigating anthropogenic climate change.

TI  - Invasive alien acacias rapidly stock carbon, but threaten biodiversity recovery in young second-growth forests
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the UN-Decade of Ecosystem Restoration and Bonn Challenge, second-growth forest is promoted as a global solution to climate change, degradation and associated losses of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Second growth is often invaded by alien tree species and understanding how this impacts carbon stock and biodiversity recovery is key for restoration planning. We assessed carbon stock and tree diversity recovery in second growth invaded by two Acacia species and non-invaded second growth, with associated edge effects, in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Carbon stock recovery in non-invaded forests was threefold lower than in invaded forests. Increasingly isolated, fragmented and deforested areas had low carbon stocks when non-invaded, whereas the opposite was true when invaded. Non-invaded forests recovered threefold to sixfold higher taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity than invaded forest. Higher species turnover and lower nestedness in non-invaded than invaded forests underpinned higher abundance of threatened and endemic species in non-invaded forest. Non-invaded forests presented positive relationships between carbon and biodiversity, whereas in the invaded forests we did not detect any relationship, indicating that more carbon does not equal more biodiversity in landscapes with high vulnerability to invasive acacias. To deliver on combined climate change and biodiversity goals, restoration planning and management must consider biological invasion risk.This article is part of the theme issue 'Understanding forest landscape restoration: reinforcing scientific foundations for the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration'.

TI  - Assessment of Gayo agroforestry coffee characteristics and carbon stock potential in Mumuger social forestry area, Central Aceh Regency
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coffee agroforestry has become a nature-based solution for controlling climate change impacts while, providing access to sustainable forest utilization for rural farmers, especially for the governance of social forestry policies in Indonesia. Ecosystem services established in coffee agroforestry provide high-carbon stocks that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. Statistical and spatial information on carbon stocks in coffee agroforestry in the Sumatran tropical forest region, especially above ground carbon (AGC), is still very limited. Therefore, this study aims to assess the available carbon stocks in Gayo coffee agroforestry in Mumuger Social Forestry Area, Central Aceh Regency, with the help of combining multi-source data (Landsat-Sentinel-NICFI imagery) and involving machine learning algorithms in estimation modelling. The agroforestry carbon stock distributed in the study area has 72.31 +/- 48.46 Mg C ha-1, which is dominated by the Leucaena-coffee agroforestry combination. There are 13 species at the overstory level that contribute carbon stock values up to 198 Mg C ha-1. Based on modelling tests of carbon stock estimation using 37 predictors, the two best machinelearning algorithms were RF and SVM, with R2 reaching 0.83 and 0.85. Carbon stock quantification information and remote sensing machine learning approaches play a strategic role in studying the impacts of agroforestry systems and as a policy evaluation in social forestry governance that can contribute to climate change mitigation.

TI  - Coffee crops adaptation to climate change in agroforestry systems with rubber trees in southern Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Adaptation to climate change is a strategy for crops to cope with the scenario of rising temperatures worldwide. In the case of Coffea arabica L., the use of agroforestry systems (AFS) with woody species is a promising practice to reduce excessive heat during the day. This study aimed to 1) evaluate air temperature changes that occur in an AFS of coffee and double alleys of rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis Mud. Arg.) and 2) carry out an analysis of future warming scenarios by comparing the cultivation of Arabic coffee in full sun and in an AFS of double alleys of rubber trees. The microclimatic variables were measured between two rows of coffee trees at 1.0 m of height from June 2016 to June 2018. The results indicate that the AFS with double alleys of rubber trees spaced 16 m apart had an average temperature reduction from 1.4 to 2.5 degrees C from 10h00 to 16h00. The study also simulated temperature increases of 1.7, 2.6, 3.1, and 4.8 degrees C from 2018 to 2099, according to scenarios predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the impact in coffee production in Parana State, Brazil. Using the climatic generator PGECLIMA_R, simulations suggest a progressive reduction of traditional areas suitable for open-grown coffee in the state. Production conditions can be maintained through the AFS, since the systems attenuate mean temperatures by 1-2 degrees C. We conclude that the AFS of coffee and rubber trees contribute to coffee crop adaptations to a future warmer environment.

TI  - Carbon budget alteration due to landcover-landuse change in wetlands: the case of afforestation in the Lower Delta of the Parana River marshes (Argentina)
T2  - WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to analyse the effects on carbon budget caused by the replacement of freshwater marshes by salicaceae plantations at ecosystem and regional scales, in the Lower Delta of the Parana River in Argentina. Biomass and net aboveground primary productivity were estimated for one of the main species planted in the delta, Salix babylonica var. sacramenta, and for the dominant species of the marshes that are most widespread in the study area, Scirpus giganteus and Schoenoplectus californicus. Soil organic carbon was also estimated. Afforestation and marshes were mapped based on the digital classification of Landsat imagery. Aboveground biomass stored by afforestation is higher than by marshes (113.4 Mg/ha vs. around 10 Mg/ha). Nevertheless, soil organic matter accumulation is 10-fold higher in the marshes. A huge amount of carbon is released into the atmosphere when marshes are converted to forest due to change from a wetland to a terrestrial condition.

TI  - Influence of carbon mapping and land change modelling on the prediction of carbon emissions from deforestation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The implementation of an international programme for reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) can help to mitigate climate change and bring numerous benefits to environmental conservation. Information on land change modelling and carbon mapping can contribute to quantify future carbon emissions from deforestation. However limitations in data availability and technical capabilities may constitute an obstacle for countries interested in participating in the REDD programme. This paper evaluates the influence of quantity and allocation of mapped carbon stocks and expected deforestation on the prediction of carbon emissions from deforestation. The paper introduces the conceptual space where quantity and allocation are involved in predicting carbon emissions, and then uses the concepts to predict carbon emissions in the Brazilian Amazon, using previously published information about carbon mapping and deforestation modelling. Results showed that variation in quantity of carbon among carbon maps was the most influential component of uncertainty, followed by quantity of predicted deforestation. Spatial allocation of carbon within carbon maps was less influential than quantity of carbon in the maps. For most of the carbon maps, spatial allocation of deforestation had a minor but variable effect on the prediction of carbon emissions relative to the other components. The influence of spatial carbon allocation reaches its maximum when 50% of the initial forest area is deforested. The method can be applied to other case studies to evaluate the interacting effects of quantity and allocation of carbon with future deforestation on the prediction of carbon emissions from deforestation.

TI  - The implementation costs of forest conservation policies in Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forest conservation is considered a low-cost option for climate change mitigation. But mitigation cost assessments have featured opportunity costs, neglecting policy implementation costs. Here we use official data to identify the Brazilian federal government's operational and institutional budgets related to forest conservation policies implemented from 2000 to 2014. We distinguish the allocated and executed budgets of these policies, and provide scenario-based estimates of their cost-effectiveness. On average, Brazil spent US$ 1 billion/year on forest conservation policies at the federal level. Brazil's substantial reduction in annual forest loss after 2004 was accompanied by a higher operational budget execution of disincentive-based policy instruments, and an absolute increase in both allocated and executed institutional budgets. The post-2004 successful mitigation effort represented additional implementation costs to the Brazilian federal government of US$ 308-923/ha of avoided deforestation, or US$ 0.87-2.60/tCO(2) of avoided emissions. Factoring in also approximate municipal and state expenditures, these costs increase to US$ 385-1153/ha or US$ 1.09-3.25/tCO(2). We conclude that implementations costs are non-trivial in size, including compared to estimates of land users' opportunity costs. This has important implications for REDD-I-policy design, in the sense that implementation costs need to be adequately considered. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Current state of knowledge regarding South America wetlands and their future under global climate change
T2  - AQUATIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The exact size of the wetland area of South America is not known but may comprise as much as 20% of the sub-continent, with river floodplains and intermittent interfluvial wetlands as the most prominent types. A few wetland areas have been well studied, whereas little is known about others, including some that are very large. Despite the fact that most South American countries have signed the Ramsar convention, efforts to elaborate basic data have been insufficient, thereby hindering the formulation of a wetland-friendly policy allowing the sustainable management of these areas. Until now, the low population density in many wetland areas has provided a high level of protection; however, the pressure on wetland integrity is increasing, mainly as a result of land reclamation for agriculture and animal ranching, infrastructure building, pollution, mining activities, and the construction of hydroelectric power plants. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has predicted increasing temperatures, accelerated melting of the glaciers in Patagonia and the Andes, a rise in sea level of 20-60 cm, and an increase in extreme multiannual and short-term climate events (El Nio and La Nia, heavy rains and droughts, heat waves). Precipitation may decrease slightly near the Caribbean coast as well as over large parts of Brazil, Chile, and Patagonia, but increase in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, around the equator, and in southeastern South America. Of even greater impact may be a change in rainfall distribution, with precipitation increasing during the rainy season and decreasing during the dry season. There is no doubt that the predicted changes in global climate will strongly affect South American wetlands, mainly those with a low hydrologic buffer capacity. However, for the coming decades, wetland destruction by wetland-unfriendly development planning will by far outweigh the negative impacts of global climate change. South American governments must bear in mind that there are many benefits that wetlands bring about for the landscape and biodiversity as well as for humans. While water availability will be the key problem for the continent's cities and agroindustries, intact wetlands can play a major role in storing water, buffering river and stream discharges, and recharging subterranean aquifers.

TI  - Congo Basin peatlands: threats and conservation priorities
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent publication of the first spatially explicit map of peatlands in the Cuvette Centrale, central Congo Basin, reveals it to be the most extensive tropical peatland complex, at ca. 145,500km(2). With an estimated 30.6Pg of carbon stored in these peatlands, there are now questions about whether these carbon stocks are under threat and, if so, what can be done to protect them. Here, we analyse the potential threats to Congo Basin peat carbon stocks and identify knowledge gaps in relation to these threats, and to how the peatland systems might respond. Climate change emerges as a particularly pressing concern, given its potential to destabilise carbon stocks across the whole area. Socio-economic developments are increasing across central Africa and, whilst much of the peatland area is protected on paper by some form of conservation designation, the potential exists for hydrocarbon exploration, logging, plantations and other forms of disturbance to significantly damage the peatland ecosystems. The low level of human intervention at present suggests that the opportunity still exists to protect the peatlands in a largely intact state, possibly drawing on climate change mitigation funding, which can be used not only to protect the peat carbon pool but also to improve the livelihoods of people living in and around these peatlands.

TI  - Marine Heatwaves, Sewage and Eutrophication Combine to Trigger Deoxygenation and Biodiversity Loss: A SW Atlantic Case Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are a major concern worldwide due to their increasing impacts in recent years, and these extreme events may trigger deoxygenation of coastal waters affected by sewage and eutrophication. Here we investigate the combined effects of MHWs and nutrient enrichment on the water quality and biodiversity of the Bay of Santa Catarina Island (Brazil). We used historical (1994-2020) sea surface temperature data from satellites and in situ physical, chemical and biological parameters to assess temporal trends. Oxygen levels have been decreasing whilst phosphorus levels have been increasing in the bay. During the austral summer of 2020 a regional sea surface heatwave was detected by satellite, lasting for 9 days and coinciding with our research cruise. During this period, seawater temperatures reached 29.8 degrees C and anoxia was detected for the first time in the bay. A decrease in macrobenthic and phytoplankton community richness correlated with decreases in oxygen both through time and towards more urbanized areas. Overall, poor wastewater treatment is a key stressor that combined with MHWs to degrade coastal waters. Mitigation strategies are needed to minimize the impact of MHWs, including improved sewage treatment, restoration and conservation of wetlands and the use of nature-based technologies to promote coastal ecosystem recovery.

TI  - A scoping review of the health co-benefits of climate mitigation strategies in South America
T2  - LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-AMERICAS
M3  - Review
AB  - The accelerated production of greenhouse gases (GHG) due to human activity has led to unprecedented global warming, making climate mitigation strategies crucial for minimizing its impacts. South America, a region highly vulnerable to climate change, stands to benefit from implementing such strategies to reduce future risks and generate health co-benefits. This scoping review, aimed to assess the existing evidence on the health benefits of climate mitigation strategies in South American countries. PubMed, Web of Science, and LILACS databases were searched until June 15, 2023. Nine studies published between 2001 and 2021 were analyzed, focusing on Brazil, Chile, and Bolivia. All the studies identified in this review used scenario modeling. They evaluated various GHG emission mitigation strategies, including land management, reducing livestock production, biofuel production, increased active transportation, renewable energy, and waste reduction. Only one study looked at GHG capture and sequestration through afforestation. Given the limited information available, there is a pressing need for more research on the region's potential health, environmental, and economic co-benefits. This review serves as a starting point and suggests that climate mitigation can offer a range of positive co-benefits, such as improved air quality and increased resilience to climate impacts, thereby advancing public health initiatives.

TI  - Climate change-induced shifts in the ecological niches of Parkia biglobosa (Jacq.) and Vitellaria paradoxa CF Gaertn, two species of agroforestry parks in Benin, West Africa
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the effects of climate change on species distribution patterns is fundamental to biogeography and evolutionary ecology, especiallyfor socio-economically important agroforestry species such as Parkia biglobosa R. Br. ex Benth and Vitellaria paradoxa CF Gaertn. However, gaps remain regarding the evolution of ecological niches of these widespread species. This study examines the effects of climate change on P. biglobosa and V. paradoxa, two key species of agroforestry parklands in Benin. By integrating intraspecific variation into niche modeling, three homogeneous subgroups (North, Center, and South) were identified and analyzed under current and future climate conditions. Maximum Entropy Modeling (MaxEnt), was used, chosen for its predictive power and flexibility in correcting for data bias. Climate projections were based on common socio-economic scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5), representing a moderate mitigation scenario and a high emissions scenario, respectively. The results showed significant climate change effects across subgroups for both species, mediated by temperature and humidity. Under the SSP2-4.5 scenario, the northern subgroup of P. biglobosa exhibited habitat shifts towards the central and southern subgroup regions, while the central and southern subgroups showed predictive habitat loss. For V. paradoxa, this scenario predicted significant habitat loss for the northern and central subgroups, while the southern subgroup demonstrated habitat expansion along altitudinal gradients. The more severe SSP-5-8.5 scenario predicted extensive habitat loss for both species. The Sudano-Guinean and Guineo-Congo zones remain climatically suitable for both species under future projections. The most pronounced interspecific niche overlap occurred between the northern and southern subgroups, indicating considerable ecological similarity. These results highlight the need for climate-adaptive management strategies in agroforestry systems with particular emphasis on subgroups facing imminent habitat loss. Future research directions should explore adaptive management approaches while maintaining essential ecosystem services and supporting local livelihoods.

TI  - Can Agroforestry Contribute to Food and Livelihood Security for Indonesia's Smallholders in the Climate Change Era?
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - In Indonesia, smallholders have historically practiced agroforestry, which warrants examination in terms of food and livelihood security within sustainable community forest frameworks. Based on a literature review, we analyzed these two forms of security related to smallholder agroforestry practices. Findings indicate diverse agroforestry systems, with 88% focusing on non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and 12% on timber. While 42% prioritize direct food supply, 58% emphasize income generation through product sales. However, agroforestry that does not produce food for direct consumption by smallholders generates revenue for purchasing food necessities. Agroforestry supports both food needs (46-61%) and income (51-54%) for smallholders, surpassing traditional agriculture (13%). Semi-commercial agroforestry (57%) is a predominant livelihood prospect. The remaining 27% are purely subsistence, and 15% are purely commercial. However, the commercialization of agroforestry that focuses only on high-value commodities results in a negative impact on biodiversity. There is a concomitant decrease in environmental services for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Biodiversity remains crucial for climate resilience, health care, and food security in rural communities. Semi-commercial agroforestry is a midpoint for achieving multifunctional agriculture (biodiversity, soil and water conservation, food security, and income) in the climate change era. The research directly related to food security and ecosystem services quantification remains limited, necessitating further investigation. Policy support and incentives are essential for smallholders practicing complex agroforestry for climate adaptation and mitigation.

TI  - Measuring and explaining the willingness to pay for forest conservation: evidence from a survey experiment in Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent research suggests that there is substantial public support (including willingness to pay) for forest conservation. Based on a nationwide survey experiment in Brazil (N = 2500) the largest and richest of the world's tropical developing countries, we shed new light on this issue. To what extent does the public in fact support forest conservation and what factors are influencing support levels? Unlike previous studies, our results show that the willingness to pay for tropical forest conservation in Brazil is rather low. Moreover, framing forest conservation in terms of biodiversity protection, which tends to create more local benefits, does not induce more support than framing conservation in terms of mitigating global climate change. The results also show that low levels of trust in public institutions have a strong negative impact on the public's willingness to pay for forest conservation, individually and/or via government spending. What could other (richer) countries do, in this context, to encourage forest conservation in Brazil and other tropical developing countries? One key issue is whether prospects of foreign funding for forest conservation are likely to crowd out or, conversely, enhance the motivation for domestic level conservation efforts. We find that prospects of foreign funding have no significant effect on willingness to pay for forest conservation. These findings have at least three policy implications, namely, that the Brazilian public's willingness to pay for forest conservation is very limited, that large-scale international funding is probably needed, and that such funding is unlikely to encourage more domestic effort, but is also unlikely to crowd out domestic efforts. Restoring public trust in the Brazilian government is key to increasing public support for forest conservation in Brazil.

TI  - Mangrove vulnerability and blue carbon storage in the Coral Triangle Areas, Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves play a vital role in the environment and contribute signific aptly to the well-being of coastal communities by providing goods and services. Unfortunately, the degradation and deforestation of mangroves has frequently occurred. Therefore, it is important to understand the vulnerability of mangroves and its impact on blue carbon storage for effective mangrove management and coastal planning. This study aims to assess the vulnerability of mangroves and its effect on blue carbon storage in the coral triangle region of Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. The vulnerability assessment included factors such as exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Blue carbon storage was evaluated based on carbon stock in sediment, biomass, and total carbon stock in mangrove ecosystems in both protected and unprotected areas. The mangrove ecosystem in the protected area of Rawa Aopa Watumohai National (RAWN) Park showed lower vulnerability due to lower exposure, lower sensitivity, and higher adaptive capacity. On the other hand, mangrove ecosystems in unprotected areas such as Tinanggea (TNG), Kendari Bay (KDI), and Staring Bay (STR) exhibited moderate to high vulnerability due to higher exposure, sensitivity, and lower adaptive capacity. Mangroves in RAWN Park, which were less vulnerable, had higher blue carbon storage in sediment (381.64 tons C/ha), biomass (312.65 tons C/ha), and the entire ecosystem (706.76 tons C/ha). These values were significantly higher (p<0.05) compared to those in TNG (306.66 tons, 144.15 tons, and 448.37 tons C/ha, respectively), KDI (262.08 tons, 227.73 tons, and 470.76 tons C/ha, respectively), and STR (169.44 tons, 66.66 tons, and 253.27 tons C/ha, respectively). The high vulnerability of mangrove ecosystems resulted in reduced carbon storage in the coastal regions of Southeast Sulawesi. Therefore, efforts such as rehabilitation and restoration, legislation, and conservation should be prioritized to enhance blue carbon storage, and other ecosystem services provided by mangroves in the coral triangle region of Southeast Sulawesi.

M3  - Article
AB  - In recent months, strong global growth, rebounding commodity prices, and relatively accommodative financial conditions have benefited the Indonesian economy. The first quarter of 2017 in Indonesia saw resilient GDP growth, moderate inflation, stable exchange rates, an increase in the growth of non-oil exports, and an investment upgrade from ratings agency Standard & Poor's. Investment growth, however, did not pick up enough to drive overall growth to a higher rate. The poor quality of banking-sector assets and the gaps in tax revenuedespite the fulfilment of the government's tax-amnesty programare two of the most immediate economic concerns. President Joko Widodo (Jokowi), who is well into the second half of his term, is under pressure to deliver on his development platform, which includes making progress in sustainable development and climate change mitigation. The effective management of forests is key to this platform. There has been longstanding tension over Indonesia's forests between the protection of environmental values, including carbon storage, and the production of valuable commodities, including timber, palm oil, and pulpwood, which generate revenue and employment. We survey recent developments in four storylines related to forestry and climate change: first, Indonesia's commitment to reducing emissions to 29%-41% below projected business-as-usual levels by 2030, as well as the international climate agreements and finance that can help achieve this commitment; second, land-use rights and regulations, including a moratorium on clearing, draining, or setting fires on peatland; third, measures to prevent catastrophic forest fires like those during the 2015 El Nino, including the establishment of the Peatland Restoration Agency; and, fourth, the actions of non-state actors, especially large agribusinesses, in managing forests and peatland. We conclude by discussing differences in the approaches of Jokowi's administration and those of former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's administration and by questioning whether Indonesia's budgeted resources, actions, and results to date are commensurate with its climate commitments.

TI  - Analysis of CH4 and N2O Fluxes in the Dry Season: Influence of Soils and Vegetation Types in the Pantanal
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines CH4 and N2O fluxes during the dry season in two distinct areas of the Pantanal: Barranco Alto Farm (BAF), dominated by grasslands, and Passo da Lontra (PL), a forested region. As climate change increases the occurrence of droughts, understanding greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in tropical wetlands during dry periods is crucial. Using static chambers, CH4 and N2O emissions were measured from soils and tree stems in both regions, with additional measurements from grass in BAF. Contrary to expectations, PL-characterized by clayey soils-had sandy mud samples that retained less water, promoting oxic conditions and methane uptake, making it a CH4 sink. Meanwhile, BAF's sandy, well-drained soils exhibited minimal CH4 fluxes, with negligible methane uptake or emissions. N2O fluxes were generally higher in BAF, particularly from tree stems, indicating significant interactions between soil type, moisture, and vegetation. These findings highlight the pivotal roles of soil texture and aeration in GHG emissions, suggesting that well-drained, sandy soils in tropical wetlands may not always enhance methane oxidation. This underscores the importance of continuous GHG monitoring in the Pantanal to refine climate change mitigation strategies.

TI  - How Will Deforestation and Vegetation Degradation Affect Global Fire Activity?
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, many parts of fire emissions are driven by deforestation. However, few studies have attempted to evaluate deforestation and vegetation degradation fires (DDF) and predict how they will change in the future. In this study, we expanded a fire model used in the Community Land Model to reflect the diverse causes of DDF. This enabled us to differentiate DDFs by cause (climate change, wood harvesting, and cropland, pastureland, and urban land-use changes) and seasonality. We then predicted the state of fire regimes in the 2050s and 2090s under RCP 2.6 and RCP 6.0 scenarios. Our results indicate that the area affected by global total fires will decrease from the current 452 to 211-378 Mha yr(-1) in the 2090s under RCP 6.0 and to 184-333 Mha yr(-1) under RCP 2.6, mainly due to socioeconomic factors such as population and economic growth. We also predict that DDF will decrease from the current 73 million hectares per year (Mha yr(-1)) to 54-66 Mha yr(-1) in the 2090s under RCP 6.0 and 46-55 Mha yr(-1) under RCP 2.6. The main contributor to these decreases in DDF burned area was climate change, especially the increasing of precipitation. The impact of future land use change on future DDF was similar or slightly lower than present-day. South America, Indonesia, and Australia were identified as high-risk regions for future DDF, mainly due to the expansion of wood harvest and pastureland. Appropriate land and fire management policies will be needed to reduce future fire damage in these areas.

T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how tropical forests respond to abiotic environmental changes is critical for preserving biodiversity, mitigating climate change, and maintaining ecosystem services in the coming century. To evaluate the relative roles of the abiotic environment and human disturbance on Central African tree community composition, we employ tree inventory data, remotely sensed climatic data, and soil nutrient data collected from 30 1-ha plots distributed across a large-scale observational experiment in forests that had been differently impacted by logging and hunting in northern Republic of Congo. We show that the composition of Afrotropical plant communities at this scale responds to human disturbance more than to climate, with particular sensitivities to hunting and distance to the nearest village (a proxy for other human activities, including tree-cutting and gathering). These findings contrast neotropical predictions, highlighting the unique ecological, evolutionary, and anthropogenic history of Afrotropical forests.Posterior parameter estimates for the effect of environmental covariates on species counts and species correlation in their responses to environmental predictors show clustering into two general groups that represent a disturbance-tolerant pioneer community and disturbance-intolerant species.image

TI  - Trends and knowledge gaps on ecological restoration research in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the current global environmental crisis, restoring degraded ecosystems stands out among the nature-based solutions to mitigate climate change, reestablish ecosystem services, and maintain biodiversity and human well-being. The high biodiversity of the Atlantic Forest (AF) and its severe degradation turned it into a "restoration hotspot." We performed a bibliometric analysis of the research on restoration of the Brazilian AF to identify thematic trends, potential gaps, as well as networks and benefits of collaboration. We also explored the spatial distribution of degradation, restoration science, and practice within the AF. We analyzed 932 articles on the issue from the Web of Science platform (1990-2020). Publications abruptly increased in the last 15 years, first by Brazilian groups and later in collaboration with foreign groups. International collaboration increased the probability of highly cited articles. Topics addressed have changed greatly in their relative position over time, likely due to scientific advances refuting theories or invalidating failed techniques. Natural regeneration was the main trending topic, while forest succession was the main emerging topic, and ecosystem services appeared as a trending topic. Research and restoration initiatives were both unevenly distributed throughout the AF region, with the southeastern region of Brazil standing out (60% of publications). The percentage of the original AF undergoing restoration is very low in all regions, regardless of scientific publications or AF extent remaining. The knowledge gaps pointed-climate change and functional traits-should drive priorities for research funding, aiming to provide robust evidence to support decision-making processes as well as restoration practices.

TI  - Climate change is expected to restructure forest frugivorous bird communities in a biodiversity hot-point within the Atlantic Forest
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Changes in climatic conditions are predicted to impact species distribution and hence alter their diversity patterns. Modifications in the composition of biological communities are expected as a result of the loss and replacement of species due to global warming. Forest frugivorous birds already suffer from habitat loss and may disappear locally due to suitable area contraction or range shifts to novel areas, disrupting seed dispersal and consequently the functioning of natural ecosystems. Here, we investigate the impacts of different climate scenarios on alpha and beta diversities of forest frugivorous birds. Location Central Corridor of the Atlantic Forest (CCAF), Brazil. Methods We used ecological niche models to project species distribution of 68 frugivorous birds for the baseline and future (2050 and 2070) scenarios. We generated binary maps of suitable areas for each species by climate scenario to calculate alpha and beta diversities. Results Most forest frugivorous birds were projected to lose suitable area, as a consequence of climate change, reducing alpha diversity in future scenarios and increasing temporal beta diversity, which is dominated by the nestedness component. In addition, species richness decreased from the east to the west portion of the CCAF, while differentiation of bird communities increased in the same direction, a pattern consistent across all climate scenarios evaluated. Main conclusions Climate change may exert drastic alterations in the composition of frugivorous bird communities in the CCAF. As forest frugivorous birds are critical to seed dispersal of forest plant species, impoverishment of their communities can drastically affect forest regeneration, diversity, and structure in the decades to come. Therefore, a better comprehension of spatio-temporal changes in diversity patterns of frugivorous birds can help us to avoid the disruption of seed dispersal and its consequences, such as cascading effects that will trigger biodiversity loss in the CCAF.

TI  - Secondary forests offset less than 10% of deforestation-mediated carbon emissions in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary forests are increasing in the Brazilian Amazon and have been cited as an important mechanism for reducing net carbon emissions. However, our understanding of the contribution of secondary forests to the Amazonian carbon balance is incomplete, and it is unclear to what extent emissions from old-growth deforestation have been offset by secondary forest growth. Using MapBiomas 3.1 and recently refined IPCC carbon sequestration estimates, we mapped the age and extent of secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon and estimated their role in offsetting old-growth deforestation emissions since 1985. We also assessed whether secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon are growing in conditions favourable for carbon accumulation in relation to a suite of climatic, landscape and local factors. In 2017, the 129,361 km(2)of secondary forest in the Brazilian Amazon stored 0.33 +/- 0.05 billion Mg of above-ground carbon but had offset just 9.37% of old-growth emissions since 1985. However, we find that the majority of Brazilian secondary forests are situated in contexts that are less favourable for carbon accumulation than the biome average. Our results demonstrate that old-growth forest loss remains the most important factor determining the carbon balance in the Brazilian Amazon. Understanding the implications of these findings will be essential for improving estimates of secondary forest carbon sequestration potential. More accurate quantification of secondary forest carbon stocks will support the production of appropriate management proposals that can efficiently harness the potential of secondary forests as a low-cost, nature-based tool for mitigating climate change.

TI  - Quantifying the fluxes of carbon loss from an undrained tropical peatland ecosystem in Indonesia
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation of undrained tropical peatland ecosystems is critical for climate change mitigation as they store a tremendous amount of soil carbon that is preserved under anoxic water-logged conditions. Unfortunately, there are too few measurements of carbon fluxes from these ecosystems to estimate the climate change mitigation potential from such conservation efforts. Here, we measured carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes as well as fluvial organic carbon export over the peat swamp forest within an undrained tropical peatland landscape in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Our measurements throughout one year (Oct 2022-Sep 2023) showed that despite its water-logged condition, peat and water overlying the swamp forest on average emits 11.02 +/- 0.49 MgCO2 ha-1 yr-1 of CO2 and 0.58 +/- 0.04 MgCO2e ha-1 yr-1 of CH4. Further, the fluvial organic carbon export contributes to additional carbon loss of 1.68 +/- 0.06 MgCO2e ha-1 yr-1. Our results help improve the accuracy of carbon accounting from undrained tropical peatlands, where we estimated a total carbon loss of 13.28 +/- 0.50 MgCO2e ha-1 yr-1. Nevertheless, the total carbon loss reported from our sites is about half than what is reported from the drained peatland landscapes in the region and resulted in a larger onsite carbon sink potential estimate compared to other undrained peat swamp forests. Together, these findings indicate that conserving the remaining undrained peatland ecosystems in Indonesia from drainage and degradation is a promising natural climate solution strategy that avoids significant carbon emissions.

TI  - MICROCLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT OF Coffea canephora INTERCROPPED WITH Carica papaya: MEASURES TO MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE
T2  - BIOSCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Intercropped systems with Conilon coffee might provide a better environment for coffee production. The aim of this study was to assess the microclimate and development of Conilon coffee intercropped with papaya trees. Papaya was planted with spacing of 3.20 x 2.40 m. The coffee trees were planted after eight months, with spacing of 3.20 x 1.60 m, in-between papaya trees (in the same row). The measurements were taken 0, 40 and 80 cm away from the coffee plants, both in the north and south direction. Concomitantly, an adjoining full sunlight coffee system (not intercropped) was also assessed. The measurements included atmospheric parameters (temperature, irradiance, and relative humidity) and vegetative parameters for the coffee plants (leaf area, relative chlorophyll index, length of plagiotropic branches, length of orthotopic branches and number of nodes) in three periods of the year. The intercropped system of Conilon coffee and papaya trees led to a decrease in both irradiance and temperature, and higher means of relative humidity during daytime in all the periods assessed, which contributes to a better environment for coffee cultivation. The shadow provided by papaya trees in the coffee plants contributed to a higher leaf area but did not affect neither the growth of both plagiotropic and orthotopic branches, nor the number of nodes and the etiolation. The intercropped system of Conilon coffee and papaya trees may be potentially used as a farming system to mitigate climate change.

TI  - Climate Change Sensitivity of Multi-Species Afforestation in Semi-Arid Benin
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The early growth stage is critical in the response of trees to climate change and variability. It is not clear, however, what climate metrics are best to define the early-growth sensitivity in assessing adaptation strategies of young forests to climate change. Using a combination of field experiments and modelling, we assessed the climate sensitivity of two promising afforestation species, Jatropha curcas L. and Moringa oleifera Lam., by analyzing their predicted climate-growth relationships in the initial two years after planting on degraded cropland in the semi-arid zone of Benin. The process-based WaNuLCAS model (version 4.3, World Agroforestry Centre, Bogor, Indonesia) was used to simulate aboveground biomass growth for each year in the climate record (1981-2016), either as the first or as the second year of tree growth. Linear mixed models related the annual biomass growth to climate indicators, and climate sensitivity indices quantified climate-growth relationships. In the first year, the length of dry spells had the strongest effect on tree growth. In the following year, the annual water deficit and length of dry season became the strongest predictors. Simulated rooting depths greater than those observed in the experiments enhanced biomass growth under extreme dry conditions and reduced sapling sensitivity to drought. Projected increases in aridity implied significant growth reduction, but a multi-species approach to afforestation using species that are able to develop deep-penetrating roots should increase the resilience of young forests to climate change. The results illustrate that process-based modelling, combined with field experiments, can be effective in assessing the climate-growth relationships of tree species.

TI  - A Holistic Approach to the Selection of Soybean (Glycine max) Cultivars for Shade Environments Based on Morphological, Yield and Genetic Traits
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The reduction of photosynthetically active radiation impacts the growth and productivity of soybean in agroforestry and intercropping systems. Thus, this report explored the responses of 16 soybean cultivars submitted to shade levels in field conditions. Multi-faceted and relative importance analyses revealed that the steam diameter and plant height are fundamental morphological markers for selecting shade-resilient cultivars, both were high and positively correlated to yield components. Moreover, the responses to shade varied among soybean cultivars, with certain genotypes demonstrating distinct tolerance levels, which allowed also the estimative of genetic variance that revealed strong participation of genetic components in responses to shade. Multivariate and clustering analysis using steam diameter and plant height in combination with two yield components resulted in the identification of four soybean cultivars more tolerant to shade environments and two sensible. Therefore, this report provides insights into soybean cultivation under varying light conditions, provides a robust foundation for the integration of morphological and yield markers in breeding programmes focused on shade tolerance and guides future endeavours in crop improvement for optimal and sustainable yield and resilience in the climate change context.

TI  - Assessing carbon sequestration in a high-diversity restoration plantation in the Atlantic Forest of southwestern Brazil
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration spotlights the urgent need for global efforts to restore ecosystems and mitigate climate change. In the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, restoration plantations often lack diversity, prompting inquiries into the optimal species count for maximal ecosystem productivity and services. This study aimed to assess aboveground carbon storage in a high-diversity restoration, comparing carbon stocks across 70 native tree species. We examined differences in carbon storage among species groups, employed regression models to project carbon accumulation over time, and identified top-performing species for carbon-focused projects in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Our high-diversity plantation, comprising 70 species, stored 46.04 MgC ha-1 at 8.5 years. The simulation revealed that planting only the most effective species could more than double carbon storage to 114.82 MgC ha-1 at the same age. Notably, filling group species consistently stored more carbon than diversity group species across all ages. We pinpointed seven top-performing filling group species: Guazuma ulmifolia, Croton urucurana, Mimosa scabrella, Trema micrantha, Solanum mauritianum, Croton floribundus, and Piptadenia gonoacantha and six from the diversity group: Inga vera, Zanthoxylum rhoifolium, Peltophorum dubium, Ceiba speciosa, Albizia polycephala, and Ficus enormis, for their superior carbon storage. Prioritizing these species can heighten carbon sequestration rates and effectively address the ongoing climate crisis. An approach combining selected filling and diversity group species emerges as the optimal strategy to achieve short- and long-term goals. Further research on species interactions and carbon stocks in scenarios with fewer planted species is imperative.

TI  - Implementing Brazil's Forest Code: a vital contribution to securing forests and conserving biodiversity
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Meeting Brazil's ambitious national commitments on both climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation depends on securing its reserves of forest carbon and biodiversity. Brazil's 'Forest Code' is a key tool to reconcile environmental preservation and agricultural production; it limits deforestation and requires forest restoration in illegally deforested areas. However, not all provisions of the law's 2012 revision have yet been implemented and some are facing new challenges. Using modelled land use change projections for the whole of the country, we show that full implementation and enforcement of the law has the potential to contribute to conserving biodiversity. Biodiversity outcomes will be especially positive if (i) deforested areas are restored in ways that support recolonization by native species and (ii) additional measures are implemented to protect native vegetation in areas like Caatinga dry forests and Cerrado savannas, which may experience added pressure displaced from other regions by Forest Code implementation.

TI  - Ecological restoration and protection of remnants are key to the survival of the critically endangered Araucaria tree under climate change
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Araucaria angustifolia - 'araucaria'- is a critically endangered conifer tree of great ecological, economic, and cultural importance occurring in subtropical forests and grasslands in southern Brazil. Using ecological niche modeling we estimated its distribution in the present and future scenarios (2050), assessed sources of uncertainties, evaluated the effectiveness of protected areas, and indicated suitable sites for restoration efforts to maintain viable populations. For this, we generated and compared 11,484 models with different combinations of variables and parameters. The final model included variables related to climate, soil, and topography. The potential distribution of araucaria was estimated to be 489.8 x 10 3km2, with a predicted reduction in 2050 from 45% to 56% (SSP245 and SSP585, respectively). The reduction within remaining habitats is estimated to range from 32% to 44%. Combined, current habitat availability and climate change accounted for a reduction from 70% to 75% of the potential distribution. Only 5% of the current potential distribution is within protected areas, which may be reduced to 1%. In addition, 40% of suitable sites in remaining habitats are not protected, which may reduce to 24-28% in 2050. Restoration efforts may contribute to an increase of 42-45% of the remaining population. We show that estimates of araucaria distribution in the future are variable and dependent on climate projections and scenarios, however, the potential distribution in natural grasslands may remain stable. Coordinated actions involving the protection and restoration of habitats associated with population growth are urgent to improve the persistence of araucaria in the future.

TI  - Sao Paulo drought: trends in streamflow and their relationship to climate and human-induced change in Cantareira watershed, Southeast Brazil
T2  - HYDROLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2013-2015 drought in the Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo exposed the lack of resilience of the regional water supply system, highly dependent on the Cantareira reservoirs. In this paper, inflows to each of the four main Cantareira reservoirs are tested for systematic change. Persistent trends in streamflow, rainfall, temperature and evapotranspiration are first evaluated. Streamflow was also tested for step change. Double-mass curves were employed to assess modification in the precipitation-runoff relationship. Subsequently, we used the climate elasticity method and the ABCD model to quantify the relative contribution of climate and human activities into the detected trends. Only Cachoeira and Atibainha sub-basins showed a significant downward trend in streamflow. The results for step change were also significant, and the year of occurrence coincided with breakpoints in precipitation-runoff relationship. For both Cachoeira and Atibainha, human activities had a more significant impact on streamflow reduction than climate variability. Land use and cover maps suggest that the reduction of pasture/abandoned land parallel to an increase in reforestation/silviculture is behind streamflow reduction. The results highlight the importance of coordinating land-use patterns and water management, as an important contributor beyond any considerations of a changing climate. Implications for better managing regional water resources are discussed.

TI  - Managing fires in a changing world: Fuel and weather determine fire behavior and safety in the neotropical savannas
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is an important ecological disturbance, but anthropogenic wildfires increasingly threaten native ecosystems and human lives. In fire-prone ecosystems, zero-fire policies have been replaced by active fire management to reduce the risk of wildfires and improve ecological outcomes. The environmental drivers of fire behavior are widely known, but climate change and deforestation are changing their roles, making fires less predictable. Thus, reassessing the main determinants of fire behavior is preeminent to allow for safe and adaptive uses of fire in protected areas (PA). We did this research in collaboration with PA managers during the initial implementation of a pilot Integrated Fire Management (IFM) program in the Brazilian savanna. The program mainly aimed to prevent large wildfires in the late-dry season and included prescribed burns during the rainy, early- and mid-dry seasons to create vegetation patch mosaics with different fire histories. We assessed fire behavior and its environmental drivers during prescribed fires in the mid-dry season (MF) and experimental late-dry season fires (LF) (emulating wildfires). We applied Linear Models to test for differences in fire intensity, heat released, combustion factor and flame height between fire seasons and to check the influence of meteorological and fuel conditions in these parameters. LF had a significantly higher fire intensity (3508 vs. 895 kW m-1), heat released (5537 vs. 3329 kW m-2), combustion factor (90 vs. 51%) and flame height (2.5 vs. 1.9 m) than MF. Relative humidity, air temperature, wind speed and fuel load were the best predictors of fire behavior, corroborating previous research. Air temperature and relative humidity pushed the seasonal differences in fire behavior while wind speed and fuel load showed similar effects across seasons. Our results emphasize the importance of considering primarily environmental variables during fire management planning, especially in the current climate changing world where extreme events and seasonal weather fluctuations are constantly defying our knowledge about fire behavior.

TI  - Getting forest science to policy discourse: a theory-based outcome assessment of a global research programme
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an assessment of the outcomes of research carried out under the Sustainable Wetlands Adaptation and Mitigation Programme (SWAMP). SWAMP aimed to inform national and international climate policy and practice by developing tools and methods to quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, carbon stocks and flux in tropical wetlands due to land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). This assessment modelled SWAMP's intended outcomes as a theory of change (ToC) and used qualitative methods to test the ToC and to evaluate whether and how the outcomes were achieved. It found that SWAMP research has helped raise academic and policy interest in wetlands. mangroves and peat forests as carbon reservoirs, and that SWAMP's recommendations informed policy discourse and supported the development of technical guidance and strategies of sustainable wetland management. However, the research had a weak effect on international and Indonesian climate change policies compared to other factors. The Paris Agreement and Indonesia's nationally determined contribution (NDC) do not include the quantification of carbon stocks from mangroves, which are not all located in the forest areas. Knowledge translation was achieved through a variety of mechanisms. with direct engagement identified as particularly important. The outcome evaluation approach proved useful as a way of conceptualising and organising the analysis of research impact on development outcomes.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 3rd International Conference on Climate Change (ICCC)

AB  - Climate change has an adverse effect on dryland by decreasing soil organic matter content and hence improving soil fertility through innovative research is urgent. The research aims to investigate the optimum doses of organic fertilizer composted with liquid biofilm biofertilizer to increase soil nutrients availability and on dryland Lithosols. The experiment was conducted on Lithosols at Geneng Duwur village, Sragen, Central Java, Indonesia, with the elevation 112 m above sea level. The experimental was arranged in the randomized complete block design with a single factor, namely doses of organic fertilizer which was composted by liquid biofilm biofertilizer (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 tons ha-1) with three replications. Each treatment occupied a 2 x 3 m2size plot, then each plot was prepared with holes to plant spinach with plants spacing of 15 cm x 20 cm. Three seeds of spinach were planted at each hole, and they were harvested at the maximum vegetative stage. The observed variables including plants parameters (plant height, stove fresh and dry weight) and soil parameters (organic matter content, pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), total nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P) and exchangeable potassium (K)). Data were analyzed using the F test at a=0.05 and followed by Duncan's multiple range test (DMRT). The results showed the application of organic fertilizer composted with liquid biofilm biofertilizer on dryland of Lithosols increased soil nutrients availability (total-N, available-P, exchangeable-K and soil organic matter) and spinach yields. Composting organic fertilizers with biofilm biofertilizer can support integrated farming systems because it provides microbes as the main agents in biogeochemistry reaction process in soil.

TI  - Current and future threats for ecological quality management of South American freshwater ecosystems
T2  - INLAND WATERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global change drivers including eutrophication, hydrological disturbance, climate change, chemical pollution, overexploitation, invasive species, and land-use change are affecting the function and structure of freshwater ecosystems. South American freshwater ecosystems are especially threatened by the combination of rising human pressures on natural resources (i.e., water use, intensive agriculture, mining, deforestation, and afforestation) and the lack of adequate legislation and economic resources for environmental protection and restoration. We assess the state of freshwater ecosystems in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Uruguay, and Venezuela, focusing on broad categories of human-induced threats grouped into 5 categories: climate change, watershed stressors, hydrological alteration, channel modification, and biological stressors. For most countries, the most severe threats are related to land uses such as mining, agriculture, and urban expansion. Other threats relate to the abstraction or wasteful use of water and the intense regulation of flows, including the effects of large hydraulic infrastructure. There is also an increasing need to empower public organisations that focus on environmental protection, to update or develop an adequate regulatory and legal framework, to provide adequate funding for the implementation of environmental legislation, and not least to implement ecological rehabilitation. Implementation of these steps would reduce the threats to South American aquatic ecosystems and allow progress toward the sustainable development of this region in future decades.

AB  - Impact of flooding on tropical forest ecosystems and their management is a little-studied area that is expected to become increasingly important under projected climate change. A demonstration of this was provided by the record-breaking 2014 flood of the Madeira River in Brazil. We assessed factors affecting survival of Brazilnut trees (Bertholletia excelsa H.B.K.) under root asphyxia caused by flooding in the Lago do Capana Grande Extractive Reserve in Manicore municipality (county), Amazonas state, Brazil. Mortality was surveyed in three Brazilnut groves (castanhais) in 680 individual Brazilnut trees of which 357 had been exposed to flooding and 200 had been flooded for at least 83 days, which was the threshold for mortality effects. Trees were georeferenced and measured for DBH and the height above the ground of the flood-water mark. This information, together with topography from satellite data and water levels from hydrographic gauges, allowed calculation of the time each tree was flooded. None of the 323 unflooded trees died. The analysis indicates a relationship between mortality and duration of root asphyxia, killing 17% of the individuals exposed to flooding and 35% of the individuals that were flooded for periods greater than 109 days. Nevertheless, survival exceeded 50% for all flooding durations. The data suggest that larger trees have a greater probability of mortality for any given period of asphyxia. Expected increases in extreme flood events threaten a sustainable forest management system based on harvest of non-timber products.

TI  - Climate change, vector-borne diseases and working population
T2  - ANNALI DELL ISTITUTO SUPERIORE DI SANITA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. Risks associated with climate change are increasing worldwide and the global effects include altered weather and precipitation patterns, rising temperatures and others; human health can be affected directly and indirectly. This paper is an overview of literature regarding climate changes, their interaction with vector-borne diseases and impact on working population.Materials and methods. Articles regarding climate changes as drivers of vector-borne diseases and evidences of occupational cases have been picked up by public databank. Technical documents were also included in the study.Results. Evidences regarding the impact of climate changes on vector-borne diseases in Europe, provided by the analysis of the literature, are presented.Discussion. Climate-sensitive vector-borne diseases are likely to be emerging due to climate modifications, with impacts on public and occupational health. However, other environmental and anthropogenic drivers such as increasing travelling and trade, deforestation and reforestation, altered land use and urbanization can influence their spread. Further studies are necessary to better understand the phenomenon and implementation of adaptation strategies to protect human health should be accelerated and strengthened.

TI  - Indonesia's globally significant seagrass meadows are under widespread threat
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia's marine ecosystems form a fundamental part of the world's natural heritage, representing a global maxima of marine biodiversity and supporting the world's second largest production of seafood. Seagrasses are a key part of that support. In the absence of empirical data we present evidence from expert opinions as to the state of Indonesia's seagrass ecosystems, their support for ecosystem services, with a focus on fisheries, and the damaging activities that threaten their existence. We further draw on expert opinion to elicit potential solutions to prevent further loss. Seagrasses and the ecosystemservices they support across the Indonesian archipelago are in a critical state of decline. Declining seagrass health is the result of shifting environmental conditions due largely to coastal development, land reclamation, and deforestation, as well as seaweed farming, overfishing and garbage dumping. In particular, we also describe the declining state of the fisheries resources that seagrass meadows support. The perilous state of Indonesia's seagrasses will compromise their resilience to climate change and result in a loss of their high ecosystem service value. Community supported management initiatives provide one mechanism for seagrass protection. Exemplars highlight the need for increased local level autonomy for the management of marine resources, opening up opportunities for incentive type conservation schemes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Agroforestry systems recover tree carbon stock faster than natural succession in Eastern Amazon, Brazil
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential of agroforestry systems (AFS) for atmospheric carbon sequestration in degraded tropical lands is of key interest for climate change and rural development policies. This study evaluated aboveground and soil (0-20 cm) carbon stocks of AFS, secondary forests (SF), conserved and logged mature forests, on 88 sites in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. Tree carbon stock was higher in young (< 10 years) and advanced (> 30 years) AFS (10.2 +/- 2.0 and 47.2 +/- 8.1 Mg ha(-1), respectively) when compared to the same age SF (5.8 +/- 2.5 and 26.5 +/- 19.5 Mg ha(-1)). However, aboveground and total carbon stocks were statistically similar within the same age categories of AFS and SF, because shrub pool were higher in SF. Conserved mature forests had the highest carbon stocks (190.2 +/- 11.0 Mg ha(-1)), and carbon stocks in logged mature forests (119.4 +/- 5.1 Mg ha(-1)) were similar to the advanced stages of AFS (108.6 +/- 7.5 Mg ha(-1)). Litter and soil organic carbon (SOC) did not differ significantly between land-use systems nor along succession. At 30 years, aboveground carbon recovery was 46% (+/- 16) in AFS and 35% (+/- 21) in SF. Vegetation structural diversity (measured by DBH and height variation) was a good predictor of aboveground carbon stocks. Our results show the potential of AFS for carbon recovery, especially in the tree pool at late stages of development. Structurally more complex AFS provide an alternative to recover degraded lands and to develop synergies between climate change mitigation, adaptation, and goods production in Amazon.

TI  - Implications of climate change on water quality and sanitation in climate hotspot locations: a case study in Indonesia
T2  - WATER SUPPLY
M3  - Review
AB  - Southeast Asia is vulnerable to climate change with over half of its population already being impacted by drought, flooding, rise in sea levels recently. This work reviews the current water resource challenges in Indonesia, prone to the rising impacts of climate change. A baseline assessment of Indonesia's water and drinking water resources related to its original sources is presented. In response to a growing concern over chronic challenges that undermine water supply nationwide, this study analyses drinking water safety supervision. To accomplish this, a literature survey (100 studies published during the 2000-2023 period) was performed to identify regional groundwater resources sustainability and water security issues. Among the main findings of this study, only 10% of rainfall infiltrates to the groundwater, while 70% of its rivers are heavily polluted by domestic waste. During the study period, water availability decreased to 1,200 m(3)/year in 2020, with only 35% of the resources being economically feasible for reuse. The water supply deficit in Indonesia was estimated to be 5.5 hm(3)/year with roughly 67% of the population's water demand satisfied in 2021. Although this deficit might be fulfilled with private vendors, water supply/demand forecasts in 2030 suggest that the gap could not be closed by increasing water supply.HIGHLIGHTS center dot About 70% of rivers in Indonesia were heavily polluted by domestic waste.center dot Water availability decreased to 1,200 m(3)/year in 2020.center dot Only 35% of the water is economically feasible to be reused.center dot Only 67% of the water demand was supplied in 2021.center dot Only 10% of rainfall infiltrates the underlying groundwater.

TI  - Modeling the Impacts of Soil Management on Avoided Deforestation and REDD plus Payments in the Brazilian Amazon: A Systems Approach
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - An Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) was employed to develop a Narrative Policy Framework (NPF) and a quantitative model to investigate the changes in land use within the Brazilian Amazon. The process began by creating a theoretical NPF using a 'systems thinking' approach. Subsequently, a 'system dynamic model' was built based on an extensive review of the literature and on multiple quantitative datasets to simulate the impacts of the NPF, specifically focusing on the conversion of forests into open land for ranching and the implementation of soil management practices as a macro-level policy aimed at preserving soil quality and ranching yields. Various fallow scenarios were tested to simulate their effects on deforestation patterns. The results indicate that implementing fallow practices as a policy measure could reduce deforestation rates while simultaneously ensuring sustainable long-term agricultural productivity, thus diminishing the necessity to clear new forest land. Moreover, when combined with payments for avoided deforestation, such as REDD+ carbon offsets, the opportunity costs associated with ranching land can be utilized to compensate for the loss of gross income resulting from the policy. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the significance of different model variables, revealing that lower cattle prices require resources for REDD+ payments, and vice-versa. The findings indicate that, at the macro level, payments between USD 2.5 and USD 5.0 per MgC ha(-1) have the potential to compensate the foregone cattle production from not converting forest into ranching land. This study demonstrates that employing an IAM with a systems approach facilitates the participation of various stakeholders, including farmers and landowners, in policy discussions. It also enables the establishment of effective land use and management policies that mitigate deforestation and soil degradation, making it a robust initiative to address environmental, climate change, and economic sustainability issues.

TI  - Metrics of water security, adaptive capacity, and agroforestry in Indonesia
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mixed agroforestry systems offer opportunities to simultaneously meet the water, food, energy and income needs of densely populated rural and peri-urban areas in Indonesia. Water flows out of upland areas provide multiple ecosystem services to downstream areas that can be part of performance-based rewards, payments or co-investment in environmental stewardship. Metrics for measuring performance and negotiating accountability need to cover river (blue), soil + vegetation (green), recycled (gray) and atmospheric (rainbow) water in relation to specific stages in the water cycle and associated services. A typology of services and prototype payment mechanisms were derived from action research in Indonesia and elsewhere in Asia by the Rewarding Upland Poor for Environmental Services (RUPES) project. The ecological metrics of landscape performance can be combined with measures of human capacity to assess and support the resilience of social-ecological systems under climate change.

TI  - Indonesia's land reform: Implications for local livelihoods and climate change
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main components of Indonesia's Just Economy policy is extensive and rapid land reform, which targets about 12% of the country's land area for redistribution to farmers and communities by 2019. Much of the reform is occurring on forest land. At the same time, the country has pledged a significant reduction of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, two thirds of which is to be achieved from forests. Hence agrarian reform potentially conflicts with emission reduction commitments. This research analyses how the redistribution of forests, with emphasis on the social forestry program, might affect people's livelihoods and Indonesia's capacity to deliver on its climate change commitments. With reference to Central Kalimantan province, we find that the land reform policy has increased the area distributed to local people through the streamlining of processes. However, ambitious targets and hurried distribution of land have posed significant challenges for processes and implementation. They result in partial understanding of the schemes, rights and responsibilities, inappropriate site allocation and types of forestland being distributed, and inadequate consideration for community capacity and local governance. Importantly, the resources allocated to grant these rights have not been accompanied by equal attention to foster subsequent actual land-based livelihood activities and forest protection. Hence the reform's potential to improve local livelihoods and contribute to climate change mitigation in Central Kalimantan is unlikely to be fully realized in the near future. We suggest that careful consideration be given to the processes of distribution, the type of forests being assigned, attention and support to foster implementation, and monitoring and enforcement of regulations.

TI  - Debating the success of carbon-offsetting projects at sports mega-events. A case from the 2014 FIFA World Cup
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are seen as climate mitigation mechanisms by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. In addition, their importance in the sustainable development paradigm has been confirmed through their inclusion in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs are designed to provide a global orientation toward inclusive and sustainable development, yet their implementation presents new challenges for forestry practitioners. This paper uses an ethnographic case study to examine a forestry-based carbon-offsetting project in Mato Grosso, Brazil, and uses several SDGs to analyze the level of project success. The project was created to offset the emissions from the construction of the new football stadium built for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Mato Grosso and, therefore, attracted international attention. The project provides analytical points for a discussion on how forestry-based carbon offsetting fits within the wider discussion on sustainable development and how the success of project outcomes can be influenced in several key areas.

TI  - Greenhouse gas balance due to the conversion of sugarcane areas from burned to green harvest, considering other conservationist management practices
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a growing need for all productive sectors to develop greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation techniques to reduce the enhanced greenhouse effect. However, the challenge to the agricultural sector is reducing net emissions while increasing production to meet growing demands for food, fiber, and biofuel. This study focuses on the changes in the GHG balance when sugarcane areas are converted from burned harvest (BH) to green harvest (GH, mechanized harvest), including the changes caused by the adoption of conservationist practices such as reduced tillage and a 4-month crop rotation with Crotalaria juncea L. during sugarcane replanting. Based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2006) methodologies, the annual emission balance includes both agricultural and mobile sources of GHG, according to the mean annual consumption of supplies per hectare. The potential soil carbon accumulation was also considered in the GH plot. The total amounts of GHG were 2651.9 and 2316.4 kg CO2eq ha-1 yr-1 for BH and GH, respectively. Factoring in a mean annual soil carbon accumulation rate of 888.1 kg CO2 ha-1 yr-1 due to the input from long-term crop residues associated with the conversion from BH to GH, the emission balance in GH decreased to 1428.3 kg CO2eq ha-1 yr-1. A second decrease occurs when a reduced tillage strategy is adopted instead of conventional tillage during the replanting season in the GH plot, which helps reduce the total emission balance to 1180.3 kg CO2eq ha-1 yr-1. Moreover, the conversion of sugarcane from BH to GH, with the adoption of a crop rotation with Crotalaria juncea L. as well as reduced tillage during sugarcane replanting, would result in a smaller GHG balance of 1064.6 kg CO2eq ha-1 yr-1, providing an effect strategy for GHG mitigation while still providing cleaner sugar and ethanol production in southern Brazil.

TI  - The role of women in early REDD plus implementation: lessons for future engagement
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Researchers and practitioners have amply discussed the potential of REDD+ to help or harm forest-based communities, but less attention has been paid to its gender dimensions. Safeguard policies are aimed at ensuring that REDD+ does not harm women, but interventions that do not seek to address imbalances at the outset may be doomed to perpetuate them. Based on research by the Center for International Forestry Research in 77 villages in 20 REDD+ sites across six countries, this article finds that women - even where they use forests as much or more - have been less involved in REDD+ initiative design decisions and processes than men, a situation with potentially significant implications for implementation and future outcomes. This article uses the research findings to argue that "participation", while a central demand of indigenous and other local communities more generally, is only a partial solution to addressing women's strategic needs in ways that could strengthen their position in REDD+. Rather, gender-responsive analyses are needed to understand real and perceived gender differences and anticipate risks.

TI  - Protecting an artificial savanna as a nature-based solution to restore carbon and biodiversity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A large share of the global forest restoration potential is situated in artificial 'unstable' mesic African savannas, which could be restored to higher carbon and biodiversity states if protected from human-induced burning. However, uncertainty on recovery rates in protected unstable savannas impedes science-informed forest restoration initiatives. Here, we quantify the forest restoration success of anthropogenic fire exclusion within an 88-ha mesic artificial savanna patch in the Kongo Central province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). We found that aboveground carbon recovery after 17 years was on average 11.40 +/- 0.85 Mg C ha-1. Using a statistical model, we found that aboveground carbon stocks take 112 +/- 3 years to recover to 90% of aboveground carbon stocks in old-growth forests. Assuming that this recovery trajectory would be representative for all unstable savannas, we estimate that they could have a total carbon uptake potential of 12.13 +/- 2.25 Gt C by 2100 across DR Congo, Congo and Angola. Species richness recovered to 33.17% after 17 years, and we predicted a 90% recovery at 54 +/- 2 years. In contrast, we predicted that species composition would recover to 90% of old-growth forest composition only after 124 +/- 3 years. We conclude that the relatively simple and cost-efficient measure of fire exclusion in artificial savannas is an effective nature-based solution to climate change and biodiversity loss. However, more long-term and in situ monitoring efforts are needed to quantify variation in long-term carbon and diversity recovery pathways. Particular uncertainties are spatial variability in socio-economics and growing conditions as well as the effects of projected climate change.Fire exclusion in an artificial savanna in the DR Congo resulted in rapid aboveground carbon recovery, at 11.40 +/- 0.85 Mg C ha-1 after 17 years and reaching 90% of aboveground carbon stocks in old-growth forests after 112 +/- 3 years. Species richness is predicted to recover even faster, reaching 90% of old-growth values after 54 +/- 2 years. We conclude that the relatively simple and cost-efficient measure of fire exclusion in artificial savannas is an effective nature-based solution to climate change and biodiversity loss, but more long-term monitoring efforts are needed to quantify variation in recovery pathways.image

TI  - Soil Organic Matter Responses to Mangrove Restoration: A Replanting Experience in Northeast Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are among the most relevant ecosystems in providing ecosystem services because of their capacity to act as sinks for atmospheric carbon. Thus, restoring mangroves is a strategic pathway for mitigating global climate change. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the organic matter dynamics in mangrove soils during restoration processes. Four mangrove soils under different developmental stages along the northeastern Brazilian coast were studied, including a degraded mangrove (DM); recovering mangroves after 3 years (3Y) and 7 years (7Y) of planting; and a mature mangrove (MM). The soil total organic carbon (C-T) and soil carbon stocks (SCSs) were determined for each area. Additionally, a demineralization procedure was conducted to assess the most complex humidified and recalcitrant fractions of soil organic matter and the fraction participating in organomineral interactions. The particle size distribution was also analyzed. Our results revealed significant differences in the SCS and C-T values between the DM, 3Y and 7Y, and the MM, for which there was a tendency to increase in carbon content with increasing vegetative development. However, based on the metrics used to evaluate organic matter interactions with inorganic fractions, such as low rates of carbon enrichment, C recovery, and low C content after hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment being similar for the DM and the 3Y and 7Y-this indicated that high carbon losses were coinciding with mineral dissolution. These results indicate that the organic carbon dynamics in degraded and newly planted sites depend more on organomineral interactions, both to maintain their previous SCS and increase it, than mature mangroves. Conversely, the MM appeared to have most of the soil organic carbon, as the stabilized organic matter had a complex structure with a high molecular weight and contributed less in the organomineral interactions to the SCS. These results demonstrate the role of initial mangrove vegetation development in trapping fine mineral particles and favoring organomineral interactions. These findings will help elucidate organic accumulation in different replanted mangrove restoration scenarios.

TI  - Mangroves, fauna compositions and carbon sequestration after ten years restoration on Flores Island, Indonesia
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia has extensively reforested mangroves to stabilize coastal ecosystems and mitigate climate change. Reforestation's long-term effects on recovering mangroves are not extensively established because most projects are only observed for two years. It raises the question of whether mangrove replanting aids biodiversity conservation and ecological recovery. This study will characterize Flores Island mangrove ecosystems after ten years of regeneration. The ecological survey took place at Bangkoor, Kolisia, and Talibura reforestation areas. Floristic composition, wildlife diversity, carbon sequestration, and energy storage were measured at each location. Field observations revealed 10 mangrove species and 11 species, which is varying by site. Flora diversity was highest in Kolisia and fauna diversity was highest in Talibura. Talibura and Kolisia have similar vegetation and wildlife than Bangkoor. Restored mangrove stands sequestered 28.69 - 70.02 Mg CO2 ha- 1 and stored 30.54 x 104 - 54.07 x 104 MJ ha- 1 of energy. Rhizophora apiculata (47.37 +/- 5.68 kg CO2) had the most carbon sequestration, while Bruguiera gymnorhiza (645.22 +/- 21.65 MJ) had the highest energy storage. Reforestation-induced mangrove ecosystems have biodiversity, carbon storage, and energy stock features.

AB  - Mangroves have an important role to the conservation of the ecosystem continues to experience damage due to land conversion activities. But on the other hand there are still people who attempted to preserve and maintain the mangroves in their area. This research aims to describe the efforts of the communities by using the cultural capital concept that they have. The method used is a case study, in which data collection was conducted through in-depth interviews and participant observation. The data were analysed using the theory of cultural capital. The results showed that people were able to adapt and modify the environment as a form of cultural capital possessed. The communities applying traditional ecological knowledge and establish institutions so that mangrove conservation is maintained. The government may accommodate the cultural capital in development policy and coastal areas conservation. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Bibliometric Analysis on Wildfires and Protected Areas
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire are increasingly frequent events on a planet undergoing climate change. With more favourable climate conditions for their occurrence, like prolonged periods of drought, the frequency and intensity of these catastrophes continue to increase. Protected areas are important territories for conserving ecosystems and biodiversity around the world and serve as a key management tool in national environmental policies. Many studies have been developed around the world to assess the conditions, frequency, and intensity of fires, and, on the other hand, protected areas are intensively studied to understand whether conservation actions are effective in keeping the ecosystem balanced. However, there are few studies that contemplate these two themes together. Consequently, this study offers a bibliometric analysis of the wildfires and its occurrence in protected areas, aiming to understand the spatial and temporal relation between them, characteristics of the research studies, and trending issues to be worked on. We used the Bibliometrix package in R language, which provides the option of different methods for analysing bibliometric data to understand the temporal evolution of the published documents about wildfires and protected areas. In total, 1116 publications were analysed, ranging from 1970 to 2022. The findings show that the terms "fires" (185 occurrences), "fire" (117), "wildfire" (101), and "forest fire" (92) are more frequently used and associated with studies on topics including biodiversity (304), conservation (221), environmental protection (188), deforestation (148), ecosystems (138), forestry (133), and climate change (126) as well as protected areas (399). The highest growth of research has been registered since 2002. The majority of the publications were published by authors from universities in the USA (77), South Africa (72), the United Kingdom (22), and Brazil (19). The USA leads all other countries with 7 of the top 10 international collaborations, followed by Brazil, Australia, and South Africa. However, only the United Kingdom continues to maintain an increased number of external (inter-country) collaborations, whereas the other nine continue to maintain an increased number of internal (intra-country). Considering the top 10 authors in terms of production, only 1 was active from 1999 to 2019, and the other 9 only have been active since 2009. The topics that stand out were subjected to a coupling analysis, which revealed that environmental protection is a motor theme, endangered species, Australia, and savannah are niche themes, and protected area, biodiversity, and fire management are basic themes.

TI  - Contrasting approaches for estimating soil carbon changes in Amazon and Cerrado biomes
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado are among the principal agricultural frontiers of the world, and have attracted global attention because of their potential to be a source or sink of atmospheric CO2. However, accurately quantifying alterations in soil organic carbon (SOC) due to land-use changes remains to be a major challenge. Using a meta-analysis, our objective was to evaluate tillage effects on SOC stocks in Brazil's Amazon and Cerrado biomes. Two approaches: (1) the classical SOC annual change rate which provides only an arithmetic average of SOC changes, and (2) the rate of annual change adjusted from management factors derived according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) SOC methodology, which allows a temporal dataset adjustment, were used. Regardless of approach, conservation technologies such as no-tillage (NT) and integrated crop-livestock (ICL) systems were identified as viable options for SOC sequestration, increasing it between 9 and 16%. One exception was adoption of NT in the Amazon forest, where SOC decreased by 9% over 20 years. Comparing results of the two approaches showed substantial differences between them. For conversions from NT to ICL or from native vegetation to full tillage (FT), the IPCC-based approach produced SOC stock estimates that were 65 and 47% lower, respectively, than with the classical approach. The IPCC approach also identified modeling covariate effects and was influenced less by outliers, thus reducing the risk of under or overestimating soil management effects on SOC.

TI  - Cattle, Clean Water, and Climate Change: Policy Choices for the Brazilian Agricultural Frontier
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Amazonian agricultural frontier, pasture for cattle ranching is an important and potentially hazardous form of land use because of sediment erosion as pastures degrade. This relationship between ranching, sediment load, and water quality is likely to further exacerbate environmental impacts, particularly in the context of climate change. We examine the role that river basin councils (RBCs) - a water governance option of Brazil's 1997 National Water Act - might play in managing this nonpoint-source pollution in the Amazonian state of Rondonia. We implement a simple coupled rancher-water system model to compare two potential governance options: a bulk water cleanup charge (BWC) implemented by RBCs and a land-use fine (LUF) for failing to maintain riparian buffers. We find no significant advantage of BWC over LUF in reducing sediment loading while keeping ranching profitable, under a changing climate. We also fail to find in Rondonia the important stake in water issues that has driven water reform elsewhere in Brazil. Moreover, the comparative success of reforestation programs suggests these programs may, in fact have the potential to manage nonpoint-source agricultural pollution in the region.

TI  - Global Tree Cover and Biomass Carbon on Agricultural Land: The contribution of agroforestry to global and national carbon budgets
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems and tree cover on agricultural land make an important contribution to climate change mitigation, but are not systematically accounted for in either global carbon budgets or national carbon accounting. This paper assesses the role of trees on agricultural land and their significance for carbon sequestration at a global level, along with recent change trends. Remote sensing data show that in 2010, 43% of all agricultural land globally had at least 10% tree cover and that this has increased by 2% over the previous ten years. Combining geographically and bioclimatically stratified Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 1 default estimates of carbon storage with this tree cover analysis, we estimated 45.3 PgC on agricultural land globally, with trees contributing >75%. Between 2000 and 2010 tree cover increased by 3.7%, resulting in an increase of >2 PgC (or 4.6%) of biomass carbon. On average, globally, biomass carbon increased from 20.4 to 21.4 tC ha(-1). Regional and country-level variation in stocks and trends were mapped and tabulated globally, and for all countries. Brazil, Indonesia, China and India had the largest increases in biomass carbon stored on agricultural land, while Argentina, Myanmar, and Sierra Leone had the largest decreases.

TI  - Growth and drought resilience of four native tree species suitable for reforestation of Brazil's Atlantic Forest
T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation of tropical forests has been a critical issue affecting climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation. Reforestation strives to remedy this situation, yet it is futile as long as deforestation of primary forests continues. Since deforestation is partly motivated by the demand for valuable tropical wood, reforestation should focus not only on planting native tree species, but specifically on a high diversity of native tree species with high-quality wood. However, the eco-physiological information required for growing such species is limited, and their resilience to drought events is unknown.Here, we focused on four native tropical wood tree species identified as suitable for Brazil's Atlantic Forest reforestation. Growth, carbon assimilation, water-use and xylem hydraulics were studied in seedlings of the two legume species Dalbergia nigra and Plathymenia foliolosa and the two non-legume species Cariniana legalis and Zeyheria tuberculosa. Seedlings were monitored weekly for 9 consecutive weeks, three to five weeks of which under induced drought. Growth and carbon assimilation were 25-65 per cent higher in the legume vs. non-legume species. In turn, non-legume species mostly avoided the drought by stomatal closure, producing a 50 per cent higher water-use efficiency (WUE) compared with the legume species. The average water potential at 50 per cent stomatal conductivity (?(gs50)) for legume species was -2.6 MPa, whereas for non-legume species it was -0.85 MPa. Still, each species showed a unique set of responses, indicating different growth strategies under mesic and xeric conditions. Our results indicate a divergence among legume and non-legume species, driven by a trade-off between plant productivity (carbon assimilation and growth) and plant safety (stomatal regulation and WUE). All in all, the four species of juvenile potted plants demonstrated a high capacity for recovery from drought, which supports their potential role in future reforestation under climate change.

TI  - Complex, diverse and changing agribusiness and livelihood systems in the Amazon
T2  - ACTA AMAZONICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Finding pathways to more sustainable agriculture and resource use remains the most pressing challenge for Amazonian countries. Characterizing recent changes in the structure and types of agrarian production systems, this review identifies responses to deal with the challenges and opportunities to promote more sustainable production and extraction economies in the Amazon. While regional agriculture and resource economies rest on a rich diversity of producers, knowledge, and production systems, the expansion of agribusiness enterprises has come to dominate the distribution of subsidies, institutional support, and logistical infrastructure. These trends are associated with forest loss and degradation, pollution of waterways, pressures on and/or displacement of indigenous and rural communities, and increased greenhouse gas emissions, all of which undermine ecosystem services. We analyzed the diverse and complex impacts of socio-economic and hydro-climatic changes on livelihoods, environments and biodiversity in Amazonian countries, with a more in-depth focus on changes in key agrarian production systems in the Brazilian Amazon using agrarian census data from 1995, 2006, and 2017. The quantitative analysis is complemented by a qualitative and empirically grounded discussion that provides insights into the changes and impacts of different activities, how they are interlinked, and how they differ across Amazonian countries. Finally, we provide recommendations towards promoting adaptive, profitable, and more sustainable smallholder production and management systems that reduce deforestation and support local communities and economies in the context of increasing urbanization and climate change.

TI  - Using spectral analysis of Landsat-5 TM images to map coastal wetlands in the Amazon River mouth, Brazil
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical coastal wetlands form complex and dynamic ecosystems based on a mixture of vegetation, soil, and water components. Optical remotely sensed data have often been used to characterize and monitor these ecosystems, which are among the environments most threatened by climate change and anthropogenic activity worldwide. The present study sought to evaluate the spectral response of Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images for the interpretation of different wetlands and associated environments at the mouth of the Amazon River, including mangroves, saltmarshes, beaches, and dunes, as well as secondary vegetation, water with different levels of sediment suspension, and human occupation. A Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classifier was applied to the analysis of Landsat-5 TMsatellite imagery to evaluate the potential for the mapping of these coastal wetland land cover classes. The characterization and comparison of the different spectral classes were obtained through the collection of at least 20 polygonal samples (5 x 5 pixels) for each class, with a total of 4,544 points. Spectral separability indices for each pair of classes were based on an Analysis of Variance, with Tukey post-test. The results indicated that most land cover classes could be separated spectrally with Landsat-5 TM. The overall accuracy and Kappa indices for the results of the classification were 86.1 and 0.84 %, respectively. The results of this spectral analysis demonstrated the potential of the SAM classifier for the classification of the different tropical wetlands in a typical Amazon coastal setting from optical remotely sensed data.

TI  - Agroforestry systems can mitigate the impacts of climate change on coffee production: A spatially explicit assessment in Brazil
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change may impose severe challenges to farmers to maintain agricultural production levels in the future. In this study we analysed the effect of projected changes in climate on the area suitable for coffee production in 2050, and the potential of agroforestry systems to mitigate these effects in a major coffee production region in southeast Brazil. We conducted a spatially explicit analysis with the bioclimatic model MaxEnt to explore the area that is suitable for coffee production in 2050 when coffee is grown in unshaded plantations and in agroforestry systems. The projected climate in 2050 was assessed using 19 global circulation models, and we accounted for the altered microclimate in agroforestry systems by adjusting the maximum and minimum air temperature. The climate models indicated that the annual mean air temperature is expected to increase 1.7 degrees C +/- 0.3 in the study region, which will lead to almost 60 % reduction in the area suitable for coffee production in unshaded plantations by 2050. However, the adoption of agroforestry systems with 50 % shade cover can reduce the mean temperatures and maintain 75 % of the area suitable for coffee production in 2050, especially between 600 and 800 m altitude. Our study indicates that major shifts in areas suitable for coffee production may take place within three decades, potentially leading to land conflicts for coffee production and nature conservation. Incentives that contribute to the development of coffee agroforestry systems at appropriate locations may be essential to safeguard coffee production in the southeast of Brazil.

TI  - The Use of Integrated Crop-Livestock Systems as a Strategy to Improve Soil Organic Matter in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to analyze the carbon (C) stock and stabilization of soil organic matter in particulate- and mineral-associated fractions across different land use systems after 32 years of experimentation in the Brazilian Cerrado. The experiment was established in 1991 and was performed in Planaltina-DF. The treatments evaluated included continuous pasture with monoculture grasses; integrated crop-livestock systems under no tillage; continuous cropping under no tillage; minimum tillage; and the preservation of the native Cerrado biome in its original condition. Soil sampling was performed to a depth of 30 cm. Carbon and nitrogen (N) stocks were quantified for the years 2001, 2009, 2013, and 2023, with soil organic matter fractionation performed on samples from 2023. Land use change resulted in significant losses of soil C and N in areas managed with conventional soil preparation practices. Systems that promote plant diversity, such as integrated crop-livestock systems, enhanced soil C and N stocks (72.8 and 5.5 Mg ha-1, respectively) and increased both particulate organic matter and mineral-associated fractions, most of which were in more stabilized forms. Integrated crop-livestock systems are management practices that offer an effective alternative to present methods in terms of combating climate change and supporting ecosystem sustainability.

TI  - Nitrogen fluxes from irrigated common-bean as affected by mulching and mineral fertilization
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to measure the fluxes of N2O-N and NH3-N throughout the growing season of irrigated common-bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), as affected by mulching and mineral fertilization. Fluxes of N2O-N and NH3-N were evaluated in areas with or without Congo signal grass mulching (Urochloa ruziziensis) or mineral fertilization. Fluxes of N were also measured in a native Cerrado area, which served as reference. Total N2O-N and NH3-N emissions were positively related to the increasing concentrations of moisture, ammonium, and nitrate in the crop system, within 0.5 m soil depth. Carbon content in the substrate and microbial biomass within 0.1 m soil depth were favoured by Congo signal grass and related to higher emissions of N2O-N, regardless of N fertilization. Emission factors (N losses from the applied mineral nitrogen) for N2O-N (0.01-0.02%) and NH3-N (0.3-0.6%) were lower than the default value recognized by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Mulch of Congo signal grass benefits N2O-N emission regardless of N fertilization.

TI  - Climate Smart Agriculture Implementation on Coffee Smallholders in Indonesia and Strategy to Accelerate
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable coffee production is significantly threatened by climate change. While implementing CSA practices offers numerous benefits, adoption rates remain low. Coffee plantations are dominated by smallholders and located in rural areas, making them more complex and requiring a comprehensive analysis and intervention. This study used an exploratory approach to assess farmers' preferences for CSA practices, identify barriers to implement, and design a support system model. The investigation focused on Arabica and Robusta farmers, with case studies from two Indonesian production centres. Preferences assessment used conjoint analysis, barriers evaluation used Mann-Whitney analysis, model development used synthetic approaches, and priority analysis used the Analytical Hierarchy Process. The study revealed that diversification is more desirable than cultivation, soil management, and water management. Arabica farmers preferred intercropping with annual crops, whereas Robusta farmers preferred perennials crops. Robusta farmers assessed that agricultural inputs, such as labor, capital, climatic data, and farm equipment and machinery, existed as barriers. However, these represent a lesser issue for Arabica farmers. We proposed agricultural innovation support system, consisting of innovation support facilities and services, as a comprehensive support system model to accelerate CSA implementation. Further analysis showed that the priority strategy for Arabica farmers is support services that focus on network development, while for Robusta farmers is support facilities that focus on climate information system development.

TI  - Community Managed Protected Areas Conserve Aboveground Carbon Stocks: Implications for REDD
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected Areas (PAs) represent a broad spectrum of outcomes and governance systems. Among PAs, Community Managed PAs have emerged from communities that are not exclusively indigenous and have developed social organizations to acquire land rights, participate in forest governance, and in some cases, engage in REDD+. However, regardless of the scale or counterfactual, there is no clear consensus about Community Managed PAs' effectiveness in forest conservation and climate change mitigation. Furthermore, previous studies have been devoted to estimating PAs' effects on deforestation before REDD+ projects began to operate. Based on Community Concessions in Peten (Guatemala) and Extractive Reserves in Acre (Brazil), we analyzed Community Managed PAs' temporal and spatial effects on carbon stocks and avoided emissions relative to unprotected lands, other Sustainable Use PAs (IUCN V-VI), and Strict PAs (I-IV). We used carbon density maps, matching methods, geographic discontinuity designs, and sensitivity analysis between 2003 and 2015. After controlling for the influence of market access and agriculture suitability, our analysis shows that Community Managed PAs were more effective than Other Lands (i.e., unprotected) and Sustainable Use PAs, and at least as effective as Strict PAs, in preserving carbon stocks and avoiding emissions. For instance, relative to Other Lands between 2011 and 2015, Community Managed PAs resulted in net avoided emissions of 4.6 tCO2-eq/ha in Peten (Guatemala) and 2.15 tCO2-eq/ha in Acre (Brazil). While these net avoided emissions were lower than in previous years, they seem to be driven by a reduction in carbon emissions outside Community Managed PAs. Spatially, the boundaries of Community Managed PAs varied across jurisdictions. For example, the boundaries of Acre's Community Managed PAs' have become less effective in avoiding emissions, which translates into reduced effects on conserving carbon stocks. Our results highlight the need to assess temporal effects to exhibit jurisdiction-wide land-use dynamics and spatial effects to identify local land-use pressures emerging inside or around the boundaries of PAs. Our analysis also shows that decentralized governance in Community Managed PAs may contribute to climate change mitigation through REDD+ and forest conservation targets.

TI  - Preliminary estimation of above-ground carbon storage in cocoa agroforests of Bengamisa-Yangambi forest landscape (Democratic Republic of Congo)
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the perspective of using cocoa as a response to climate change, a preliminary carbon stock assessment was conducted in cocoa agroforests of the Bengamisa-Yangambi forest landscape in the north-east of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Data were collected in 25 plots of 2500 m(2) each, spread over 16 villages. Above-ground carbon stock assessment on cocoa trees and their associated plants revealed that cocoa agroforests store on average 44.48 Mg ha(-1) of above-ground carbon of which, cocoa-associated plants represent 83.68%. The diversity (species richness) of cocoa associated plants determine the level of above-ground carbon stored in cocoa agroforests. Trees less than 50 cm in diameter stored a larger amount of above-ground carbon. Cocoa agroforests with associated plants dominated by forest species (Model F) store 1.76 and 1.72 times more carbon, respectively, than those where associated plants are dominated by oil palm (Model P) and a mixture of plant types (forest species mixed with oil palm plants, or Model FP). Associated plants inside cocoa agroforests also play additional roles to support livelihoods such as health care, household consumption and timber. Therefore, beyond carbon storage, cocoa agroforest is an important reservoir of some local species and thus useful for biodiversity conservation and local livelihoods. As cocoa agroforests in DRC are recognized as one of the main responses to climate change, this study constitutes an early contribution to the process of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD +) in forest landscapes in this country of the Congo Basin.

TI  - The effectiveness of global protected areas for climate change mitigation
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests play a critical role in stabilizing Earth's climate. Establishing protected areas (PAs) represents one approach to forest conservation, but PAs were rarely created to mitigate climate change. The global impact of PAs on the carbon cycle has not previously been quantified due to a lack of accurate global-scale carbon stock maps. Here we used similar to 412 million lidar samples from NASA's GEDI mission to estimate a total PA aboveground carbon (C) stock of 61.43 Gt (+/- 0.31), 26% of all mapped terrestrial woody C. Of this total, 9.65 + /- 0.88 Gt of additional carbon was attributed to PA status. These higher C stocks are primarily from avoided emissions from deforestation and degradation in PAs compared to unprotected forests. This total is roughly equivalent to one year of annual global fossil fuel emissions. These results underscore the importance of conservation of high biomass forests for avoiding carbon emissions and preserving future sequestration.

TI  - Litterfall and Associated Macrozoobenthic of Restored Mangrove Forests in Abandoned Aquaculture Ponds
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove restoration projects are now widely established, aiming to regain the carbon benefit of the mangrove ecosystem that is essential for climate change mitigation. This study aimed to investigate mangrove litter as the source of carbon in restored mangrove forests in Perancak Estuary, Bali, Indonesia, which previously experienced substantial mangrove loss due to shrimp aquaculture development. We assessed the production and decomposition of mangrove litter and associated macrozoobenthic biodiversity in restored forests with plantation age >= 14 years and intact mangrove forests as the reference. The monthly production of three groups of mangrove litter (leaf, reproductive, and wood) was assessed over 12 months. A leaf litter decomposition experiment was performed to inspect the interspecific and disturbance history variation in organic matter formation among four major mangrove species: Rhizophora apiculata, Bruguiera gymnorhiza, Avicennia marina, and Sonneratia alba. Our results showed that annual litterfall production from restored and intact mangroves in Perancak Estuary were 13.96 and 10.18 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), which is equivalent to approximately 6282 and 4581 kg C ha(-1) year(-1) of annual litterfall carbon sink, respectively. Although restored mangroves had significantly higher plant litterfall production than intact mangroves, no significant difference was detected in leaf litter decomposition and macrozoobenthic biodiversity between these forest types.

TI  - Trade-offs in linking adaptation and mitigation in the forests of the Congo Basin
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent discussions on forests and climate change have highlighted the potential for conservation of tropical forests to contribute synergistically to both mitigation (reducing emissions of greenhouse gases) and adaptation ( increasing capacity to cope with changing climate conditions). Key mechanisms through which adaptive advantages might be gained include the potential for forest resources to support livelihoods in the context of climatic strains on agriculture and the protection that intact forest ecosystems might provide against landslides, flash floods and other hazards related to extreme weather. This paper presents findings from field research with forest communities in three areas of the Congo Basin in Central Africa, in which the adaptive role and potential of forests in these respects is critically analysed. The investigation was carried out through a combination of structured and semi-structured qualitative techniques within six villages in Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and Rwanda. The findings of the research highlight the need to understand both the limits of synergy, and the constraints and trade-offs for rural livelihoods that may be associated with a forest conservation agenda driven by the additional impetus of carbon sequestration. The search for synergy may be conceptually laudable, but if forest management actions do not take account of on-the-ground contexts of constraints and social trade-offs then the result of those actions risks undermining wider livelihood resilience.

TI  - Impacts of REDD plus payments on a coupled human-natural system in Amazonia
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - We used a hybrid optimization-agent-based model to simulate REDD + (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation in combination with conservation, sustainable forest management, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) payment scenarios to farm households in the old deforestation frontier of Rondonia, Brazil. Payments varied from $5 to $30 per ton of net CO2 either not emitted or removed from the atmosphere relative to a baseline scenario. The impacts of REDD+ were assessed as changes in land use/cover, net CO2 emissions, program costs, community welfare, and agricultural production. Our results suggest that interventions aimed at zero gross deforestation would require unrealistically large annual disbursements. In contrast, zero net carbon emissions can be achieved at approximately two-thirds the cost with reduced impacts on food production. Overall, simulated payments increased inequality among households, which conflicts with desired REDD + outcomes. Results suggest that REDD + might be more successful solely as a climate change mitigation mechanism as opposed to a complex multi-objective development program.

TI  - Amazon deforestation in Brazil: effects, drivers and challenges
T2  - CARBON MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Jean Pierre Ometto(dagger 1), Ana Paula Dutra Aguiar(1) & Luiz Antonio Martinelli(2) The concept of global ecosystem services has become a powerful paradigm for understanding the link between ecosystem processes and related human activities, which is expressed by the economic and ecological quantification of the services in regards to sustainable development. The role of tropical forests in the global climate system and the uncertainty of the exact magnitude of this complex interaction has become a major concern to the scientific community. In this paper we review and synthesize the global effects of Amazon deforestation in Brazil, as well as drivers and challenges related to this process. To this end, we provide data on carbon emissions from combined annual maps of clear cutting of primary forests and spatial information on biomass distribution for different vegetation types and secondary vegetation growth, as well as the temporal dynamic related to the deforestation process and its interregional heterogeneity, the social and institutional drivers. In 2009, during the Conference of Parties, of the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (Copenhagen, Denmark), Brazil announced a voluntary commitment to reduce the national GHG emissions by 2020 and, to this end, such commitment requires reducing Amazon rainforest deforestation by 80% over a decade. To achieve this target, a set of consolidated remote sensing techniques have served to monitor and calculate the extent of deforestation, which became indispensable auditing tools for conservation, forest restoration and implementing climate change mitigation schemes.

TI  - Assessing Sumatran Peat Vulnerability to Fire under Various Condition of ENSO Phases Using Machine Learning Approaches
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, catastrophic wildfire episodes within the Sumatran peatland have contributed to a large amount of greenhouse gas emissions. The El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) modulates the occurrence of fires in Indonesia through prolonged hydrological drought. Thus, assessing peatland vulnerability to fires and understanding the underlying drivers are essential to developing adaptation and mitigation strategies for peatland. Here, we quantify the vulnerability of Sumatran peat to fires under various ENSO conditions (i.e., El-Nino, La-Nina, and Normal phases) using correlative modelling approaches. This study used climatic (i.e., annual precipitation, SPI, and KBDI), biophysical (i.e., below-ground biomass, elevation, slope, and NBR), and proxies to anthropogenic disturbance variables (i.e., access to road, access to forests, access to cities, human modification, and human population) to assess fire vulnerability within Sumatran peatlands. We created an ensemble model based on various machine learning approaches (i.e., random forest, support vector machine, maximum entropy, and boosted regression tree). We found that the ensemble model performed better compared to a single algorithm for depicting fire vulnerability within Sumatran peatlands. The NBR highly contributed to the vulnerability of peatland to fire in Sumatra in all ENSO phases, followed by the anthropogenic variables. We found that the high to very-high peat vulnerability to fire increases during El-Nino conditions with variations in its spatial patterns occurring under different ENSO phases. This study provides spatially explicit information to support the management of peat fires, which will be particularly useful for identifying peatland restoration priorities based on peatland vulnerability to fire maps. Our findings highlight Riau's peatland as being the area most prone to fires area on Sumatra Island. Therefore, the groundwater level within this area should be intensively monitored to prevent peatland fires. In addition, conserving intact forests within peatland through the moratorium strategy and restoring the degraded peatland ecosystem through canal blocking is also crucial to coping with global climate change.

TI  - Collaborative Watershed Modeling as Stakeholder Engagement Tool for Science-Based Water Policy Assessment in Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study describes a collaborative modeling process deployed at the Cantareira Water Supply System (CWSS) in Sao Paulo City Metropolitan Area, Brazil. The CWSS faces challenges for meeting the increasing water demand, while land-use and climate change and their combined effect on its water cycle and balance have created a complex water resources management problem. Through a stakeholder engagement process-involving scientists and policymakers, the water utility company, and state administration-environmental simulation models were developed to elicit and represent multiple environmental, economic, and policy perspectives, developing a mutual language to communicate and establish common goals of water resources management. Study outputs include estimation of biophysical and economic benefits associated with prioritized native vegetation restoration activities in the source watersheds. These outputs are deployed in support of landscape planning and the decision process integrating multiple stakeholder perspectives in Sao Paulo state administration, the water utility company, and municipalities.

TI  - The oldest extant tropical peatland in the world: a major carbon reservoir for at least 47 000 years
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatlands in Southeast Asia cover similar to 25 million hectares and exert a strong influence on the global carbon cycle. Recent widespread peatland subsidence and carbon dioxide emissions in response to human activity and climate change have been well documented, but peatland genesis remains poorly understood. Unlike coastal peatlands that established following sea-level stabilization during the mid-Holocene, inland peatlands of Borneo are little studied and have no apparent environmental constraint on their formation. Here, we report radiocarbon dates from the Upper Kapuas Basin which show inland peat formation since at least 47.8 thousand calibrated radiocarbon years before present, ka. We provide a synthesis of new and existing peat basal dates across Borneo, which shows a hiatus in peat genesis during a cool and dry period from 30 to 20 ka. Despite likely peat degradation during that period, the Upper Kapuas is still exceptionally deep, reaching a maximum depth (determined from coring) of 18 m. Our best estimate of mean peat depth over 3833 km(2) of the Upper Kapuas is 5.16 +/- 2.66 m, corresponding to a carbon density of 2790 +/- 1440 Mg C ha(-1). This is one of the most carbon-dense ecosystems in the world. It withstood the glacial-interglacial climate transition and remains mostly intact, but is increasingly threatened by land-use change.

TI  - Forest Dynamics and Agroforestry History since AD 200 in the Highland of Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding past forest dynamics and human influence is essential for future forest management and ecosystem conservation. This study aims to provide insights into the forest dynamics and agroforestry history in the highlands of Sumatra for the last 1800 years. We carried out palaeoecological multi-proxy analyses of pollen, spores, non-pollen palynomorphs, macro-charcoal, and X-ray fluorescence on a limnic sediment core taken from Danau Kecil in the submontane area of Kerinci Seblat National Park in Sumatra, Indonesia. Our results provide an 1800-year record of forest dynamics under climate change and human influence including the transition from forest opening to shifting cultivation and eventually permanent agroforestry. Indicators for forest openings and secondary forest formation have been present since the beginning of records (AD 200). This is followed by the possible initiation of sugar palm (Arenga) cultivation (AD 400). Since AD 500, potential agroforestry and forest gardening practices have promoted major timber trees such as Lithocarpus/Castanopsis, Bischofia, and Dipterocarpaceae combined with sugar palm (Arenga). Permanent agroforestry systems were possibly established since AD 1760, evinced by an increase in commodity trees such as Dipterocarpaceae for resin production. With the Dutch invasion ca. AD 1900, agroforestry intensified and expanded to the Kerinci Valley. This was followed by land use intensification and potential rice cultivation around Danau Kecil since the 1940s. This study provides the first details on past forest dynamics around Danau Kecil since AD 200, showing among others how appropriate forest management and a closed canopy could reduce fire vulnerability in submontane rainforest.

TI  - Can cheniers protect mangroves along eroding coastlines?-The effect of contrasting foreshore types on mangrove stability
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are increasingly valued as wave-attenuating buffers in coastal flood defence strategies. How-ever, as mangroves are vulnerable to wave-induced erosion, this raises the question, how can the stability of these protective mangrove forests be promoted? To address this question, we investigate how mangrove dy-namics in a microtidal system can be related to different types of foreshores. We used remote sensing to investigate mangrove fringe stability over multiple years in relation to intertidal mudflat width (i.e., emerged at low tide) and the presence stability of cheniers, which are sand bodies on top of muddy foreshores that are characteristic for eroding coastlines. In addition, we investigated local and short-term foreshore effects by measuring wave propagation across two cross-shore transects, one with a mudflat and chenier and one with a deeper tidal flat foreshore. The satellite images (Sentinel-2) revealed that mangrove dynamics over multiple years and seasons were related to chenier presence and stability. Without a chenier, a mudflat width of 110 m (95%CI: 76-183 m) was required to make mangrove expansion more likely than mangrove retreat. When a stable chenier was present offshore for two years or more, a mudflat width of only 16 m (95%CI: 0-43 m) was enough to flip chances in favor of mangrove expansion. However, mangrove expansion remained heavily influenced by seasonal changes, and was highly event driven, succeeding only once in several years. Finally, although mudflat width was a direct driver of mangrove expansion, and could be targeted as such in coastal management, our field measurements demonstrated that cheniers also have an indirect effect on mangrove expansion. These sand banks significantly reduce wave height offshore, thereby likely creating favorable conditions for mudflat accretion landward, and thus mangrove habitat expansion. This makes stabilization -and possibly also the temporary creation -of cheniers an interesting target for mangrove conservation and restoration.

TI  - Wildlife conservation and reduced emissions from deforestation in a case study of Nantu Wildlife Reserve, Sulawesi: 2. An institutional framework for REDD implementation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change threatens ecosystems and human society, with tropical deforestation contributing a fifth of anthropogenic carbon emissions. The proposed REDD mechanism will provide compensation for tropical forest nations to reduce deforestation, and potentially also co-benefits for rural communities and biodiversity. The success of REDD implementation will be partially determined by domestic institutional conditions. These have not yet been well articulated, so we develop a systematic approach to assessing institutional capability for REDD implementation at both the local and national levels, based upon the definition of REDD as a payment for ecosystem services (PES). We demonstrate the utility of this framework using the case study of Indonesia and a protected area within it (Nantu). We find that many of the institutional requirements for REDD cannot currently be met on the national level. Yet at the local level, the existence of an ongoing conservation project has strengthened the institutional framework within which REDD could operate, leading to a more positive outlook. We suggest that our analytical framework could be helpful in highlighting the institutional issues that could impede the implementation of REDD across scales and thus be a useful tool in improving the viability of this crucial strategy.

TI  - Tropical wetlands for climate change research, water quality management and conservation education on a university campus in Costa Rica
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - EARTH University is a small agronomic university with a theme of sustainability in eastern Costa Rica. Several natural and constructed wetlands on its campus are used for research, water quality improvement, and higher education. It has become an important location for research and teaching on humid tropical wetland ecology and management. A 112-ha flow-through Raphia taedigera (Arecaceae) forested wetland is being used for climate change research, focusing on carbon sequestration and methane generation. Methane emissions are measured seasonally and are comparable to rates in tropical wetlands published elsewhere. Carbon sequestration by the wetland appears to be substantially higher than similar flow-through temperate zone wetlands. Treatment wetlands are used on campus to improve water quality of effluents from an animal farm, a dairy plant, a landfill, and a banana paper plant. Water quality was substantially improved in all of these wetlands except the landfill leachate wetland. All of these campus wetlands have been integrated into the four-year education program of EARTH University and 22 undergraduate projects have been completed on wetlands over the past 14 years.

TI  - Reduction of mangrove carbon stock ecosystems due to illegal logging using a combination of unmanned aerial vehicle imagery and field surveys
T2  - GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Mangrove habitats play a vital role in the global carbon cycle, decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the effects of climate change. Satellite images and aerial photography have been widely utilized to map the dynamics of mangrove ecosystems. These photos were used as inputs for international policy agreements, including Indonesia, in defining regulations about carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere caused by deforestation and land use changes. This study aimed to map forest to identify deforested areas and assess the effect of illegal logging on mangrove forest carbon stocks in Lubuk Kertang Village, North Sumtera, Indonesia using unmanned aerial vehicle imagery and field. METHODS: Photometric data analysis was obtained from high-resolution satellite imagery using a da-Jiang innovations Phantom 4 Professional at 150 meters' altitude. Careful deployment of flight paths to obtain high accuracy in optimal image capture overlapped with 90 percent was conducted from August 5 to 8, 2023. Satellite imagery was captured in some areas considered important, such as rehabilitated mangrove forests and oil palm plantations. Both research sites produced orthophotos and digital surface models, and the integration of unmanned aerial vehicle with the photometry approach led to the development of the structure from motion method of data processing. FINDINGS: This study compared carbon stores in the mangrove forest of Lubuk Kertang Village in 2022 with carbon stock in 2023 or after the recurrence of illegal logging using an unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetric field survey. The distribution of aboveground biomass in the mangrove covers an area of 253.4 hectares with total carbon in 2022 of 15.819 megagrams per hectare. Meanwhile, in 2023, the aboveground biomass was 70.94 megagrams per hectare with total carbon of 8.927 megagrams per hectare. This study shows that the mangrove forest in Lubuk Kertang Village has lost around 56 percent from the previous year. CONCLUSION: Illegal logging poses a significant threat to carbon sequestration/stock lost. This phenomenon highlights the need for improved monitoring and conservation strategies. The combination of remote sensing techniques and field surveys offers a powerful tool for blue carbon inventories, mangrove conservation planning, and monitoring climate, community, and biodiversity projects in coastal ecosystems.

TI  - A reality check on the landscape approach to REDD plus : Lessons from Latin America
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing and institutionalizing cross-sectoral approaches to sustainable land use remains a crucial, yet politically contested, objective in global sustainability governance. There is a widely acknowledged need for more integrated approaches to sustainable land use that reconcile multiple landscape functions, sectors and stakeholders. However, this faces a number of challenges in practice, including the lack of policy coherence and institutional conflicts across agricultural and forest sectors. In this context, the global climate change mitigation mechanism of "reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation" (REDD+) has been flagged as a unique opportunity to stimulate the development and institutionalization of more integrated, "landscape" approaches to sustainable land use. In this article, we provide a reality check for the prospects of REDD+ to deliver on this promise, through analyzing three pioneer cases of REDD+ development and implementation in Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico. We analyze how REDD+ has operated in each of these three contexts, based on field work, key-informant interviews, and analysis of primary and secondary documents. Our findings suggest that REDD+ has stimulated development of "niche" sustainable land-use investments in each case, which aim to integrate forest conservation and agricultural development goals, but has done so while competing with business as-usual incentives. We conclude that national and international political commitment to more integrated and sustainable land-use approaches is a precondition for, rather than a result of, transformative REDD+ interventions.

TI  - Adaptation to climate change in Indonesia - livelihood strategies of rural households in the face of ENSO related droughts
T2  - TROPICAL RAINFORESTS AND AGROFORESTS UNDER GLOBAL CHANGE: ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC VALUATIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Climate change poses a major threat to the livelihoods of many people, especially those dependent on agriculture. Adaptation to climate change is a necessity to reduce social vulnerability. The adoption of agricultural innovations presents a suitable strategy to reduce negative impacts of increased inter-annual variability in rainfall and temperature. Focussing on the dominant agroforestry system cacao in the Indonesian province of Central Sulawesi, we investigate the adaptation strategies of agricultural smallholders to El Nico-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) related droughts. We apply a triangulation of Rapid Rural Appraisal Methods (RRA), semi-structured in-depth interviews and participatory observations. In addition, results from an intensive cacao-study (n=144) on yields, plot history, structure and location are used.The analysis shows that all interviewed households have been affected by extreme climatic effects such as ENSO related droughts which lead to a decline in agricultural outputs. Our study identifies various types of adaptation strategies on the micro level. Most common strategies are reactive or ex-post adaptations which support the household in coping with the effects of droughts. Further, the study assesses anticipatory adaptation strategies which, if precisely implemented, alter the household's exposure to future droughts, increase the resilience to cope with changes and reduce the degree of sensitivity of affected households. On the basis of these results we examine why different household types do not implement certain strategies, which could enhance their social resilience. In this context we reveal that the adoption of anticipatory adaptation strategies is strongly influenced by social and human capital. The knowledge transfer - which promotes adaptation - is mainly taking place along ethnic lines and local institutions. For the successful adoption of innovations to cope with ENSO related droughts in the study area, membership in certain ethnic groups, local institutions and networks is of utmost importance.

TI  - Fires in the Amazon Region: Quick Policy Review
T2  - DEVELOPMENT POLICY REVIEW
M3  - Review
AB  - Motivation: The combination of institutional weaknesses, climate change, and overexploitation is increasingly recognized as endangering the Amazon forest. These three factors made 2020 the worst year for forest fires recorded in the previous 60 years. We analyse environmental policies across the nine countries of the Amazon Basin to develop national and regional forest programmes to tackle this scenario.Purpose: The study synthesizes and compares key environmental legislation concerning protected natural areas (PNAs) and fire management in the nine countries of the Amazon Basin. To this end, the research question asks what directions can be drawn from a visualization and compilation of national regulations for future policy research and practice.Methods and approach: We undertake a critical literature review of PNAs and fire-management policies across the nine countries of the Amazon Basin and their further alignment using analyses of previous policy reviews on forest codes and land distribution.Findings: The article shows the heterogeneity of national fire-use and fire-management policies among the nine countries of the Amazon Basin. In addition, it suggests that top-down policies and regulations are likely to be characterized by misunderstandings (either direct or indirect) of local practice, rationale, and capacity; and, in some cases, risk criminalizing local and indigenous daily subsistence.Policy implications: The study indicates the need for more in-depth research and policy on participatory governance platforms for the use and management of fire, rather than fire-suppression and fire-risk adaptation strategies. There are some positive, albeit often isolated, cases, to which scholars, policy-makers, and environmental practitioners should pay more attention.

TI  - Survival and carbon stock of forest species in mixed plantation at 8 years of age
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest plantations that aim to neutralize carbon contribute to climate change mitigation by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and fixing it in its biomass. Climate change mitigation via forest restoration is still a practice that needs scientific advances. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate the survival and carbon stock of forest species in carbon offset plantation at eight years. The planting took place in December 2010 to neutralize greenhouse gas emissions related to an event at the Federal University of Vicosa in Vicosa-MG. Two hundred and eleven planted seedlings of sixteen Atlantic Forest species had their survival and carbon stock assessed at eight years, aiming to understand the species' carbon removal. The inventory was carried out annually from 2011 (12 months of age) to 2018 (96 months). Diameter at ground height (DAS in mm) and total height (H in m) data were collected. Survival at the end of the eighth year was 52.30% (180 individuals). The evaluated species, Albizia niopoides, Stryphnodendron polyphyllum, Senna multijuga and Enterolobium contortisiliquum did not show mortality rates. Stryphnodendron polyphyllum, Anadenanthera colubrina, Ateleia glazioveana and Citharexylum myrianthum stood out as species with the highest carbon stock at 8 years of age. The pioneer species obtained the highest carbon stock and survival, while the species with the lowest stock were the non -pioneer species. Thus, species that have the greatest carbon stock and potential for the implementation of restoration and carbon neutralization projects are S. multijuga, S. polyphyllum, A. glazioveana e A. colubrina, due to the high survival and carbon storage of these species.

TI  - Forest Conservation Through Markets? A Discourse Network Analysis of the Debate on Funding Mechanisms for REDD plus in Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNICATION-A JOURNAL OF NATURE AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most contentious issues surrounding the forest conservation program REDD+ is the question whether it should be funded via international carbon markets. The controversy between market supporters and opponents has been especially marked in the public debate in Brazil, one of the main potential beneficiaries of REDD+ payments. In a remarkable shift of policy, the Brazilian Federal Government gave up its long-standing opposition to market-based funding in the run-up to the COP15, following several years of competition between two main discourse coalitions and their preferred story lines. These were analyzed here with discourse network analytical techniques. Brazil's policy change may in part be explained by the failure of market opponents to employ positive arguments about alternative funding mechanisms, such as a public fund model; and by the increasing discursive dominance of a third emerging discourse coalition, which adopted major arguments of both sides in the debate. The research presented here thus provides more general insights on the dynamics of public debates, discourse coalitions, and the impacts of discursive strategies on policy-making, as well as on the value of discourse network analysis as a research method.

TI  - Trends in Agroforestry Research from 1993 to 2022: A Topic Model Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and HJ-Biplot
T2  - MATHEMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There is an immense debate about the factors that could limit the adoption of agroforestry systems. However, one of the most important is the generation of scientific information that supports the viability and benefits of the proposed techniques. Statistical analysis: This work used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modeling method to identify and interpret scientific information on topics in relation to existing categories in a set of documents. It also used the HJ-Biplot method to determine the relationship between the analyzed topics, taking into consideration the years under study. Results: A review of the literature was conducted in this study and a total of 9794 abstracts of scientific articles published between 1993 and 2022 were obtained. The United States, India, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and Germany were the five countries that published the largest number of studies about agroforestry, particularly soil organic carbon, which was the most studied case. The five more frequently studied topics were: soil organic carbon, adoption of agroforestry practices, biodiversity, climatic change global policies, and carbon and climatic change. Conclusion: the LDA and HJ-Biplot statistical methods are useful tools for determining topicality in text analysis in agroforestry and related topics.

TI  - Climate change mitigation strategies in agriculture and land use in Indonesia
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - We quantitatively evaluated mitigation potentials of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and land use sectors in Indonesia. We also determined for the land use sector 1) how much time is needed to plan the mitigation strategy, and 2) how much time is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures? We used a bottom-up type model on emission mitigation named Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use Bottom-up model (AFOLU-B model) to consider a characteristics time sequence of actions, effects and costs of mitigation countermeasures. To input to the model, we developed future scenarios on human activities in these sectors based on data from Indonesian government. We found that i) evaluation on effects and costs of mitigation measures from a long-term viewpoint and their continuing implementation are required to increase future mitigation potentials under a limited budget. ii) a long-term reduction target will also play an important role for cost-effective countermeasure selection. iii) reforestation of slow glowing species and enhanced natural regeneration will cause great increase in mitigation potential in the country.

TI  - Land use change (LUC) analysis and life cycle assessment (LCA) of Brazilian soybean biodiesel
T2  - CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative to tackle global warming, especially for reducing greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions when replacing fossil fuels. However, it can compete for land with food production. Brazil is a global player on soybeans farming and most of the biodiesel produced in the country comes from it. This work proposes a new approach to evaluate its impact, associating land use change (LUC) analysis with life cycle assessment (LCA) in a representative Brazilian soybeans farming zone. LUC assessment used Landsat satellite imagery analysis from the years 1993 and 2013, and intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) guidelines to estimate GHG emissions. LCA was based on field data collection processed with SimaPro(A (R)). Results show that the increment on annual GHG emissions per hectare, derived from the apportioning total emissions for the period studied, was 50.16 kg CO2 eq ha(-1) y(-1). From this increment, 97.1 % come from LUC, being the largest share from converting pastures to soybeans farming (81.2 % of the total emissions). However, in the area, a large share of converted pastures are degraded, acting as source of emissions, not as sink as considered by IPCC. At the same time, practices like no-tillage make soybeans a carbon sink. Therefore, results could change if alternative approaches were to be adopted, being a challenge for future work. Therefore, when considering biodiesel from soybeans, a close regard to local land use dynamics is essential to evaluate impacts. Besides, promoting more efficient use of land already cleared with the goal to avoid deforestation can turn biodiesel into a sustainable renewable energy source.

TI  - Soil Organic Matter Responses to Anthropogenic Forest Disturbance and Land Use Change in the Eastern Brazilian Amazon
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic forest disturbance and land use change (LUC) in the Amazon region is the main source of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere in Brazil, due to the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) emitted from vegetation clearance. Land use conversion associated with management practices plays a key role in the distribution and origin of C in different soil organic matter (SOM) fractions. Here, we show how changing land use systems have influenced soil C and N stocks, SOM physical fractions, and the origin of SOM in the Santarem region of the eastern Brazilian Amazon. Soil C and N stocks were calculated for the surface layer of 0-30 cm. Anthropogenic disturbances to the standing forest, such as selective logging and wildfires, led to significant declines in soil C and N stocks. However, in the long-term, the conversion of the Amazon forest to pasture did not have a noticeable effect on soil C and N stocks, presumably because of additional inputs from pasture grasses. However, the conversion to cropland did lead to reductions in soil C and N content. According to the physical fractionation of SOM, LUC altered SOM quality, but silt and clay remained the combined fraction that contributed the most to soil C storage. Our results emphasize the importance of implementing more sustainable forest management systems, whilst also calling further attention to the need for fire monitoring systems, helping to ensure the resilience of C and N stocks and sequestration in forest soils; thereby contributing towards urgently needed ongoing efforts to mitigate climate change.

TI  - Optimizing the spatial distribution of Southeast Asia mangrove restoration based on zonation, species and carbon projection schemes
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves contain large amounts of carbon that can reduce the effects of global climate change, which is termed as blue carbon and noted as an important ecosystem service. However, mangrove ecosystems have experienced a huge decline due to human activities and any rehabilitation and restoration efforts should be undertaken with careful planning to optimise their ecosystem service provision and to improve the success of these programs. The main objective of this study was to model a scenario specific to Southeast Asian mangrove distribution based on zonation, species, and coastal morphology, as well as the estimation of future aboveground biomass carbon content resulting from multiple scenarios of successful mangrove growth. This study provides the first assessment of the differences in the distribution of carbon content in a range of native mangrove species, as well as the relationship between the number of propagules, carbon content, mangrove species, and the percentage of living mangroves. The potential location for mangrove planting was dominated by zone 4 inundated by spring high tides, with a suitable area of 4,081,325 ha the next largest area was zone 2, inundated by medium high tides, with a potential area of 2,080,475 ha, followed by zone 3, inundated by normal high tides, with an area of 1,685,800 ha. This study is expected to serve as a reference for mangrove ecosystem conservation and optimisation of carbon storage, especially in Southeast Asia.

TI  - Formal designation of Brazilian indigenous lands linked to small but consistent reductions in deforestation
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Indigenous territories in Brazil have existed since the pre-European discovery of the continent. Yet, many of them remain without formal recognition by the state. While numerous studies discuss the social implications of indigenous land (IL) designation, limited empirical evidence exists regarding its role in forest conservation. To address this gap, the present study employs a quasi-experimental design and causal-inference methods to estimate the effects of formal IL designation on deforestation across Brazil and its biomes, from 1986 to 2021. Estimates indicate an average impact of -0.05% on deforestation due to the formal designation of ILs nationwide, with variations ranging from -0.21% to 0.04% across different evaluation periods and biomes. Notably, designated ILs in the Cerrado biome had the highest avoided deforestation impacts (-0.12%, on average). No evidence of deforestation leakage was observed. The findings from this study suggest that while the promotion of formal IL designation can lead to consistent reductions in deforestation, the magnitude of its effect is relatively small to be promoted on the sole basis of an effective strategy to mitigate tropical deforestation and climate change. Nevertheless, the potential positive socioeconomic impacts of formal IL designation on indigenous peoples cannot be undermined.

TI  - Cleaner fruit production with green manure: The case of Brazilian melons
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Cleaner fruit production has become important for producers worldwide because consumers and retail companies increasingly base their purchase decisions on environmental criteria. Green manure is a soil management practice that promotes soil nutrient enrichment and may improve crop yield. Nonetheless, the environmental impacts and economic analysis of combined green manure and tropical fruit production have not been performed. This work assesses the environmental impacts and profits resulting from the Brazilian melon, commercialized in Brazil. Melon production is analyzed under two cultivation systems: i) the conventional form practiced by farmers located in the Sao Francisco Valley region, Brazil, and ii) the conservationist system, based on a green manure experiment carried out in this same region. This study applies life cycle assessment to evaluate the environmental impacts of both systems, considering farm inputs production and transportation (energy power, fertilizers, pesticides, plastic, paper, and fuel) as well as melon production and transportation to the main national distribution market in Sao Paulo. The impact categories evaluated are climate change, soil acidification, freshwater and marine eutrophication, water depletion, human toxicity (cancer and non-cancer), and ecotoxicity. Scenario analysis is applied to assess impacts under different designed conditions for transportation, packing, and nitrogen fertilization. The profit analysis is performed by reducing the total production costs (inputs and services) from the revenue obtained from selling melons. Results indicate that the conservationist system causes lower impacts and lead to higher profit than the conventional system, for all assessed categories. The scenario analysis confirms that impacts can be further reduced in all categories when alternative melon transportation and fertilization practices are adopted. This work demonstrates that the environmental performance of Brazilian melon production can be improved with the addition of green manure and alternative transportation practices.

TI  - Protective shade, tree diversity and soil properties in coffee agroforestry systems in the Atlantic Rainforest biome
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable production and biodiversity conservation can be mutually supportive in providing multiple ecosystem services to farmers and society. This study aimed to determine the contribution of agroforestry systems, as tested by family farmers in the Brazilian Rainforest region since 1993, to tree biodiversity and evaluated farmers' criteria for tree species selection. In addition, long-term effects on microclimatic temperature conditions for coffee production and chemical and biological soil characteristics at the field scale were compared to full-sun coffee systems. A floristic inventory of 8 agroforests and 4 reference forest sites identified 231 tree species in total. Seventy-eight percent of the tree species found in agroforests were native. The variation in species composition among agroforests contributed to a greater gamma-diversity than a-diversity. Monthly average maximum temperatures were approximately 6 C higher in full-sun coffee than in agroforests and forests. Total soil organic C,N mineralization and soil microbial activity were higher in forests than in coffee systems, whereas the chemical and biological soil quality in agroforests did not differ significantly from full-sun coffee after 13 years. Given its contribution to the conservation of biodiversity and its capacity to adapt coffee production to future climate change, coffee agroforestry offers a promising strategy for the area.

TI  - Understanding Eco-DRR as a sustainability indicator for mangrove conservation in urbanized area of North Jakarta, Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Eco-DRR is a holistic, ecosystem-based approach that utilizes ecosystems to sustainably mitigate the effects of natural disasters. This study analyses the Eco-DRR praxis at mangrove ecosystems at North Jakarta. The research employs semi-structured in-depth interviews with informants to reveal the mangrove management in the urbanized area of North Jakarta. The data collected are verified through triangulation of data sources. The sustainability of mangrove is assessed using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) Rapfish Analysis. Additionally, comparative analysis is conducted by contrasting the two revealing findings of mangrove sustainability in protected and unprotected areas. The findings reveal that protected mangrove areas exhibit higher sustainability compared to unprotected ones distinguished by its Eco-DRR praxis. This research suggests that Eco-DRR praxis such as mangrove conservation, effectively minimize tidal flood risk, generate ecosystem services, and perform as an indicator to sustain the environment. The government policies govern the management of protected areas, emphasizing their role in providing ecosystem services and mitigating tidal floods. In contrast, unprotected areas face challenges due to less effective management, leading to suboptimal ecosystem services and reduced disaster risk reduction capacity. The key takeaway is the significance of community-based organizations, in enhancing and sustaining mangrove ecosystems, with strong participation and involvement among various stakeholders, ensures the services of mangrove ecosystems in both protected and unprotected areas, contributing to Eco-DRR and long-term environmental resilience. The praxis of Eco-DRR in the North Jakarta, Indonesia is geographically contextualized, where local praxis, policy reform, and knowledge basis in essential to support its sustainability.

TI  - Who owns the Brazilian carbon?
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil is one of the major contributors to land-use change emissions, mostly driven by agricultural expansion for food, feed, and bioenergy feedstock. Policies to avoid deforestation related to private commitments, economic incentives, and other support schemes are expected to improve the effectiveness of current command and control mechanisms increasingly. However, until recently, land tenure was unknown for much of the Brazilian territory, which has undermined the governance of native vegetation and challenged support and incentive mechanisms for avoiding deforestation. We assess the total extent of public governance mechanisms protecting aboveground carbon (AGC) stocks. We constructed a land tenure dataset for the entire nation and modeled the effects and uncertainties of major land-use acts on protecting AGC stocks. Roughly 70% of the AGC stock in Brazil is estimated to be under legal protection, and an additional 20% is expected to be protected after areas in the Amazon with currently undesignated land undergo a tenure regularization. About 30% of the AGC stock is on private land, of which roughly two-thirds are protected. The Cerrado, Amazon, and Caatinga biomes hold about 40%, 30%, and 20% of the unprotected AGC, respectively. Effective conservation of protected and unprotected carbon will depend on successful implementation of the Forest Act, and regularization of land tenure in the Amazon. Policy development that prioritizes unprotected AGC stocks is warranted to promote conservation of native vegetation beyond the legal requirements. However, different biomes and land tenure structures may require different policy settings considering local and regional specifics. Finally, the fate of current AGC stocks relies upon effective implementation of command and control mechanisms, considering that unprotected AGC in native vegetation on private land only accounts for 6.5% of the total AGC stock.

TI  - Carbon Stock and CO2 Fluxes in Various Land Covers in Karang Gading and Langkat Timur Laut Wildlife Reserve, North Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests play an important role in coastal areas from an ecological perspective, being able to store large amounts of carbon through sequestration and inhibiting climate change processes by absorbing CO2 in the atmosphere. In recent years, there have been changes in the land cover of converted and degraded mangrove forests which have resulted in the release of carbon and an imbalance in soil structure, which in turn cause a flux of CO2 into the atmosphere. This research was conducted at the Karang Gading and Langkat Timur Laut Wildlife Reserve (KGLTLWR) in North Sumatra, Indonesia. The study focused on six different land covers, namely natural forests, restoration, mixed agriculture, paddy fields, oil palm plantation, and ponds. This study aimed to measure the total carbon stock of mangrove forests that have been converted to other land covers and estimate the level of CO2 flux in the area. A total of three transects and six plots for each land cover were used in this study; for tree biomass, a non-destructive method was used by recording every DBH > 5 cm, and for soil carbon, drilling was carried out, which was divided into five depths in each plot. CO2 flux was measured using an Eosense Eosgp CO2 sensor with the static closed chamber method. The highest carbon stock was found at 308.09 Mg ha(-1) in natural forest, while the lowest 3.22 Mg ha(-1) was found in mixed agriculture. The highest soil carbon was found at 423.59 MgC ha(-1) in natural forest, while the lowest 50.44 MgC ha(-1) was found in mixed agriculture dry land. The highest average CO2 flux value of 1362.24 mgCO(2) m(2) h(-1) was found in mangrove restoration and the lowest in ponds was 123.03 mgCO(2) m(2) h(-1). Overall, the research results inform how much carbon stock is lost when converted to other land covers so that it can be used as a reference for policy makers to provide future management of mangrove forests and develop mitigation measurements to reduce carbon emissions.

TI  - Challenges and Threats Facing Gorilla beringei graueri in Kahuzi-Biega National Park and Conservation Strategies
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Gorillas play important roles in the sustainability of biodiversity and in the cultures of Indigenous communities, offering unique biological behaviors and contributing to forest regeneration. Grauer's gorilla (Gorilla beringei graueri) is one of the flagship species of biodiversity in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In this study, we carried out a systematic review to assess the challenges and threats facing Gorilla beringei graueri, as well as conservation strategies. We used search engines such as Google Scholar, Web of Science, Baidu, and China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI) to screen for literature published in the period between 2000 and 2025. We found that the existence of Grauer's gorilla is under constant threat from an increasing demand for precious minerals, the establishment of mining sites in the forests, and the establishment of new road networks in the gorillas' range, as well as from poaching, deforestation, and climate change. These pressures have exacerbated the decline of the Grauer's gorilla population, necessitating attention from both the DRC and the global community to safeguard this endangered species. Several strategies for the conservation of Grauer's gorilla are already underway in the Kahuzi-Biega National Park; these aim to reduce or contain the threats and challenges facing Grauer's gorilla. This comprehensive review serves as a recommendation to Indigenous communities, local people, government agencies, conservation NGOs, and the public, encouraging them to understand the consequences of the decline in the Grauer's gorilla population and to advocate for urgent and effective conservation strategies.

TI  - Climate-smart agriculture and soil C sequestration in Brazilian Cerrado: a systematic review
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Review
AB  - Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices, mainly no-tillage (NT), cover cropping (CC), soil fertilization with organic amendments (OA), and crop-livestock (CL) and crop-livestock-forestry (CLF) systems, has been widely adopted in areas from Brazilian Cerrado. The CSA may partly offset former soil C losses and contribute to climate change mitigation. However, contradictory findings brought uncertainties about the effect of CSA on soil C. Here, by a systematic review of 87 papers and using 621 data pairs, we provided a pervasive biome-scale analysis of soil C stock changes associated with the adoption of CSA across Brazilian Cerrado. All CSA practices evaluated showed average positive rates of C stock change, indicating a general tendency of soil C accretion after its adoption. In areas under NT, CC and CLF, greater rates were estimated for the deeper soil profile evaluated (0.00-1.00 m) (1.24 +/- 0.85, 0.54 +/- 0.54 and 1.00 +/- 1.47 Mg ha-1 yr-1, respectively), while OA and CL showed more soil C accretion when the assessment was limited down to 0.10 m depth (0.82 +/- 0.60 and 0.59 +/- 0.66 Mg ha-1 yr-1, respectively). Unfortunately, the lack of basic information precluded any attempt to statically compare our estimations. In this sense, we must be cautious in stating that soil C sequestration occurs at those rates after the adoption of CSA practices. Despite these limitations, the results clearly show that the diversification and intensification of agricultural areas in the Cerrado by the adoption of CSA is a promising pathway to increase soil C stocks, and consequently, contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Finally, our findings emphasize the importance of efforts that stimulate farmers to adopt these practices on large scale, such as Brazil's Low-Carbon Agriculture Plan, besides providing sound empirical evidence about the role of soil C sequestration in Brazil achieving its Nationally Determined Contributions commitments.

TI  - Losses and gains of soil organic carbon in grasslands in the Brazilian semi-arid region
T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies show that soil organic carbon (SOC) decreases between 3 % and 9 % in degraded grasslands in tropical regions, mainly due to the absence of techniques to enhance carbon contribution to soils. This study assessed SOC stock change factors for grassland management, specific to the semi-arid region of Brazil. These factors may contribute to a better understanding of SOC dynamics and could be used to improve inventories on GHG emissions. In addition, they could be used for updating default factors used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This study considers both soil sampling and a literature review, and comprises 27 paired comparisons, where the dataset was analyzed using a mixed linear model. For the grassland in the Brazilian semi-arid region, the SOC stock is reduced by between 12 % and 27 % due to inadequate management, overgrazing, and edaphoclimatic conditions of the Brazilian semiarid. However, this depends on aspects, such as land use and soil layer, which represents substantially more severe losses than in other regions of the country. We also found that losses occur during the first five years after conversion of native vegetation. The results also indicated a trend for SOC stocks to recover over time, reaching 4 % after 30 years of use as grassland, probably related to the long period without soil tillage and the role of gramineas root system.

TI  - Clear consensus among international public for government action at COP26: patriotic and public health frames produce marginal gains in support
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - This work surveys over 14,000 respondents in seven countries to assess support for government action to protect the environment, and for different policies at the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow. Baseline results reveal overwhelming support for action. At least nine out of ten respondents in six countries, and 79% in the USA, agree that all governments should do more. In each country, at least 50% of respondents express support for four policies: protecting wildlife; planting trees; spending more on clean technologies; and reducing the production of greenhouse gases over thirty years. A survey-experiment tests whether support changes when respondents are exposed to short texts framed in different ways. On average, exposure to a patriotism or public health text significantly raises support for action, albeit by only 1.6 and 1.3 percentage points respectively. On policies, exposure to either a public health text or a text based on current UN messaging increases support for tree planting by 2.3 and 2.9 percentage points respectively. These results suggest that international public opinion is overwhelmingly in favour of government action at COP26. They highlight policies that are likely to attract majority support, and suggest that message-framing can have a very small impact.

TI  - Disturbance and climate affect species richness and aboveground biomass relationship in a forest-savanna transition ecosystem
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between species richness and aboveground biomass (richness-biomass relationship) is a major facet of ecosystem functions and has stimulated debates over the past decades. However, we still lack basic knowledge on whether this relationship has consistent patterns across natural and human-impacted vegetation cover types. More importantly, the effects of disturbance and climatic conditions on species richness and aboveground biomass remain controversial. Using data from 197 0.5-ha plots established within a forest-savanna transition ecosystem, we determined three ecological vegetation covers via non-metric multidimensional scaling, obtained gridded climate data and calculated disturbance index from species succession guilds. We examined the consistency of the richness-biomass relationship across the vegetation covers using general linear models and further analysed the effects of disturbance and climatic conditions on this relationship using non-mixed and mixed linear models. We identified three vegetation cover types corresponding to Old-growth forests, Cocoa agroforests and Woodland savannas, suggesting a succession gradient from late-, mid-, and early-successions, respectively. Aboveground biomass consistently increased with species richness across the three vegetation cover types (i.e. positive relationship). Species richness interacts with climate humidity to increase aboveground biomass while interaction of species richness and disturbance rather decreases aboveground biomass consistently across the vegetation cover types. Our results provide insights into the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functions, having implications for ecosystem restoration and understanding ecological consequences of disturbance and climate change in the forest-savanna ecosystem.

TI  - Identifying relevant international forest regimes for South Korea based on their issues
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - South Korea has focused on bilateral agreements to supply timber since the 1990s which requires cooperation with forest-related international organisations. This study analysed the relationship between South Korean and international forest regimes by identifying the issues these regimes face and analysing South Korea's contribution to these regimes. The study used data from an in-depth content analysis of key policy documents between South Korea and each of the regimes. The results confirm six forest-related international issues: Sustainable Forest Management, Sustainable Development Goals, forest land degradation and desertification, climate change, illegal logging, forest biodiversity, and species conservation. South Korea contributed to these regimes through cooperative initiatives and projects. This contribution, furthermore, directs other countries' participation to confront the issues. Most of the international forest-related issues in South Korea are derived from external elements such as international agreements or governances. South Korea also uses international regimes to encourage national goals.

TI  - Patterns of infringement, risk, and impact driven by coal mining permits in Indonesia
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal mining is known for its contributions to climate change, but its impacts on the environment and human lives near mine sites are less widely recognised. This study integrates remote sensing, GIS, stakeholder interviews and extensive review of provincial data and documents to identify patterns of infringement, risk and impact driven by coal mining expansion across East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Specifically, we map and analyse patterns of mining concessions, land clearing, water cover, human settlement, and safety risks, and link them with mining governance and regulatory infractions related to coal mining permits. We show that excessive, improper permit granting and insufficient monitoring and oversight have led to deforestation, widespread overlaps of concessions with settlements, extensive boundary and regulatory violations, lacking reclamation, and numerous deaths. As the world's largest thermal coal exporter, Indonesia's elevated coal infringements, risks, and impacts translate to supply chain, sustainability, and human rights concerns for global coal markets.

TI  - Nature-based solutions are critical for putting Brazil on track towards net-zero emissions by 2050
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of the world's nations (around 130) have committed to reaching net-zero carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, yet robust policies rarely underpin these ambitions. To investigate whether existing and expected national policies will allow Brazil to meet its net-zero GHG emissions pledge by 2050, we applied a detailed regional integrated assessment modelling approach. This included quantifying the role of nature-based solutions, such as the protection and restoration of ecosystems, and engineered solutions, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. Our results highlight ecosystem protection as the most critical cost-effective climate mitigation measure for Brazil, whereas relying heavily on costly and not-mature-yet engineered solutions will jeopardise Brazil's chances of achieving its net-zero pledge by mid-century. We show that the full implementation of Brazil's Forest Code (FC), a key policy for emission reduction in Brazil, would be enough for the country to achieve its short-term climate targets up to 2030. However, it would reduce the gap to net-zero GHG emissions by 38% by 2050. The FC, combined with zero legal deforestation and additional large-scale ecosystem restoration, would reduce this gap by 62% by mid-century, keeping Brazil on a clear path towards net-zero GHG emissions by around 2040. While some level of deployment of negative emissions technologies will be needed for Brazil to achieve and sustain its net-zero pledge, we show that the more mitigation measures from the land-use sector, the less costly engineered solutions from the energy sector will be required. Our analysis underlines the urgent need for Brazil to go beyond existing policies to help fight climate emergency, to align its short- and long-term climate targets, and to build climate resilience while curbing biodiversity loss.

TI  - Uncertainty in establishing forest reference levels and predicting future forest-based carbon stocks for REDD
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest reference levels (FRLs) provide a benchmark for assessing reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), and they are central to demonstrate additionality of REDD+. Attaining realistic FRLs, however, is challenging, especially in complex mosaic landscapes. We established FRLs in northern Laos for different reference periods and tested them against actual carbon stock changes. Annual time series of Landsat satellite images were used to capture the subtle changes in carbon stocks in complex landscapes characterized by shifting cultivation. We found that FRLs differ considerably depending on the reference period chosen. Abrupt land-use changes occurred when hybrid maize replaced traditional shifting cultivation and forests, and this invalidated carbon stock trends that would have been predicted had the FRL been projected into the future. We conclude that demonstrating additionality of REDD+ in fast developing areas is difficult and that payment systems rewarding potential emission reductions against hypothetical extrapolation of FRLs are unlikely to be a cost-effective strategy.

TI  - Integrated assessment of carbon dioxide removal portfolios: land, energy, and economic trade-offs for climate policy
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is crucial to achieve the Paris Agreement's 1.5 degrees C-2 degrees C goals. However, climate mitigation scenarios have primarily focused on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation/reforestation, and recently direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS). This narrow focus exposes future climate change mitigation strategies to technological, institutional, and ecological pressures by overlooking the variety of existing CDR options, each with distinct characteristics-including, but not limited to, mitigation potential, cost, co-benefits, and adverse side-effects. This study expands the scope by evaluating CDR portfolios, consisting of any single CDR approach-BECCS, afforestation/reforestation, DACCS, biochar, and enhanced weathering-or a combination of them. We analyse the value of deploying these CDR portfolios to meet 1.5 degrees C goals, as well as their global and regional implications for land, energy, and policy costs. We find that diversifying CDR approaches is the most cost-effective net-zero strategy. Without the overreliance on any single approach, land and energy impacts are reduced and redistributed. A diversified CDR portfolio thus exhibits lower negative side-effects, but still poses challenges related to environmental impacts, logistics or accountability. We also investigate a CDR portfolio designed to support more scalable and sustainable climate mitigation strategies, and identify trade-offs between reduced economic benefits and lower environmental impacts. Rather than a one-size-fits-all scaling down, the CDR portfolio undergoes strategic realignment, with regional customization based on techno-economic factors and bio-geophysical characteristics. Moreover, we highlight the importance of nature-based removals, especially in Brazil, Latin America, and Africa, where potentials for avoided deforestation are the greatest, emphasizing their substantial benefits, not only for carbon sequestration, but also for preserving planetary well-being and human health. Finally, this study reveals that incentivizing timely and large-scale CDR deployment by policy and financial incentives could reduce the risk of deterring climate change mitigation, notably by minimizing carbon prices.

TI  - A country scale analysis revealed effective forest policy affecting forest cover changes in Cambodia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Considerable proportions of the remaining global forest areas are currently harboured in tropical countries. Reducing deforestation in this region is important to help mitigate climate change. Effective forest conservation approach is needed to reduce deforestation and degradation in these countries. Here, we investigated the forest conservation effect of community forests and protected areas using country scale data in Cambodia. In addition to these two forest conservation approaches, we also evaluated the effectiveness of protected forests, which are similar to protected areas but managed by different authorities. We compared deforestation between 2006 and 2016 in areas under the three forest conservation approaches and a non-conserved area by applying the inverse probability of treatment weighting with the propensity score minimizing confounding effects. The results showed that community forest, protected areas, and protected forest significantly decreased deforestation compared with non-conserved forests. Out of the three forest conservation approaches, protected forest was the most effective and community forest was the least effective. We conclude that all of the policies we evaluated are effective for forest conservation but the effectiveness varies depending on the approach. Our findings also suggest that the authority managing the given approach plays an important part in its effectiveness.

TI  - Carbon stock dynamics of forest to oil palm plantation conversion for ecosystem rehabilitation planning
T2  - GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Efforts to enhance carbon stocks and boost carbon absorption potential are essential for climate change mitigation. Peatland ecosystems, known for their high organic content, are particularly vulnerable to environmental management. The study aimed to examine the alterations in land use and land cover that occurred between 1998 and 2022, spanning a 24-year duration. Additionally, it sought to assess the associated variations in carbon stocks within the designated Kepau Jaya specific purpose forest area. The area under investigation encompasses a peatland ecosystem that has experienced substantial changes in land cover and land use. This study investigated the fluctuations in carbon stock caused by these alterations and provides valuable perspectives on the potential of agroforestry systems to promote a wider range of land uses. Additionally, it highlights their role in ecosystem restoration initiatives and the better management of forest peatland regions. METHODS: A spatial analysis was conducted on Landsat 5 and 8 satellite images by using shapefile data stored within the Google Earth Engine platform. Data analysis was carried out using Classification and Regression Tree, a decision tree algorithm used in machine learning for guided classification. Furthermore, purposive sampling was utilized to gather socioeconomic data, followed by the implementation of a benefit-cost analysis. FINDINGS: The results revealed significant changes in the land cover within the Kepau Jaya specific purpose forest area over a 24-year period, with forested areas and open areas decreasing by 23.15 hectares per year and 16.94 hectares per year respectively, and oil palm plantation areas expanding by 40.10 hectares per year. From 1998 to 2022, there has been a consistent annual decline in carbon stocks, resulting in a reduction of 1,933.11 tons of carbon per year. The changes in land use and cover are closely linked to this decline. In an effort to increase plant species diversity in the area and support the gradual transition away from monoculture, a participatory agroforestry scheme was implemented by intercropping Coffea liberica and Shorea balangeran between oil palm rows in a 2-hectare oil palm plantation block within the agroforestry demonstration plot. According to measurements taken at breast height, the aboveground biomass of these species was measured, leading to projected estimates of carbon stocks in Kepau Jaya specific purpose forest area reaching 19,455 tonnes of carbon by the year 2030, with Coffea liberica contributing 4,148 tonnes carbon and Shorea balangeran contributing 15,307 tonnes carbon. CONCLUSION: The study area experienced a substantial reduction in forest cover, whereas the extent of oil palm areas expanded significantly. The findings underscore the need for proactive measures to strengthen the governance of specific-purpose forest areas through community empowerment and the establishment of demonstration plots to promote agroforestry development. The results of this study provide insights for long-term forest rehabilitation strategies aimed at fostering sustainable forest management that yields environmental and socio-economic benefits in the long run.

TI  - Climatic and cultural changes in the west Congo Basin forests over the past 5000 years
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Central Africa includes the world's second largest rainforest block. The ecology of the region remains poorly understood, as does its vegetation and archaeological history. However, over the past 20 years, multidisciplinary scientific programmes have enhanced knowledge of old human presence and palaeoenvironments in the forestry block of Central Africa. This first regional synthesis documents significant cultural changes over the past five millennia and describes how they are linked to climate. It is now well documented that climatic conditions in the African tropics underwent significant changes throughout this period and here we demonstrate that corresponding shifts in human demography have had a strong influence on the forests. The most influential event was the decline of the strong African monsoon in the Late Holocene, resulting in serious disturbance of the forest block around 3500 BP. During the same period, populations from the north settled in the forest zone; they mastered new technologies such as pottery and fabrication of polished stone tools, and seem to have practised agriculture. The opening up of forests from 2500 BP favoured the arrival of metallurgist populations that impacted the forest. During this long period (2500-1400 BP), a remarkable increase of archaeological sites is an indication of a demographic explosion of metallurgist populations. Paradoxically, we have found evidence of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) cultivation in the forest around 2200 BP, implying a more arid context. While Early Iron Age sites (prior to 1400 BP) and recent pre-colonial sites (two to eight centuries BP) are abundant, the period between 1600 and 1000 BP is characterized by a sharp decrease in human settlements, with a population crash between 1300 and 1000 BP over a large part of Central Africa. It is only in the eleventh century that new populations of metallurgists settled into the forest block. In this paper, we analyse the spatial and temporal distribution of 328 archaeological sites that have been reliably radiocarbon dated. The results allow us to piece together changes in the relationships between human populations and the environments in which they lived. On this basis, we discuss interactions between humans, climate and vegetation during the past five millennia and the implications of the absence of people from the landscape over three centuries. We go on to discuss modern vegetation patterns and African forest conservation in the light of these events.

TI  - The need for a consistent fire policy for Cerrado conservation
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cerrado is a fire-dependent savanna requiring a clear and urgent fire management policy. The extensive misuse of fire for deforestation or pasture management in Brazil has created an overall perception that its use is always deleterious. This view, reinforced by threats of global warming and climatic change, has lead to current policies of fire suppression.2. Cerrado ecosystems depend on the historical fire regime to maintain their structure, biodiversity and functioning. The suppression of fire has transformed savanna vegetation into forests, causing biodiversity losses and drastic changes in ecological processes.3. Policy implications. The National Fire Policy required by law must be urgently implemented in Brazil, including use of fire for Cerrado conservation in public and private lands on the basis of existing knowledge of indigenous people and scientists. Objective regulations on prescribed burning, land manager training, incentives for fire research and experimentation and a broad campaign to disseminate the benefits of fire for Cerrado conservation should be the cornerstones of the policy. If implemented, the policy can give the biodiversity of the Cerrado a future that has previously been severely threatened by fire suppression.

TI  - Influence of meteorological variables on the initial growth of seedlings of native forest species in vegetation restoration plantings
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of forest restoration plantations to restore ecosystems and neutralize greenhouse gases is increasing, especially as a way to combat climate change. Research related to the growth of forest species and the influence of the environment should be considered to determine their potential in neutralizing carbon dioxide. Thus, the objective was to evaluate the growth in diameter at ground level and height of six forest species throughout the first year after planting according to meteorological variables. The experiment was conducted in the Carbon Zero Forest, part of the Open Space for Events on the main campus of the Federal University of Vicosa (UFV), Minas Gerais, Brazil. Planting of the 324 seedlings was conducted in December 2019, with 2.0 m x 2.0 m spacing, in a randomized block design. The meteorological characteristics for the year 2020 were obtained through the bulletins of the institution's own automatic station. The current increment in height and diameter was calculated for three-month intervals, per species. The data were subjected to Spearman's non-parametric correlation test. The significant correlations between increments in diameter at ground height and height with climatic variables were weak or moderate. In general, precipitation and maximum absolute temperature positively affected the current increment in height, while global radiation affected them negatively. Precipitation, average temperature and absolute minimum temperature negatively affected the current increment in diameter. The results obtained can help in the elaboration of strategies that promote the restoration of areas according to the adaptability of the species to adverse conditions, aside from potentiating the neutralization of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

TI  - Quantification of ecosystem services from mangrove silvofishery
T2  - GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Mangrove silvofishery, a unique system that combine aquaculture with mangrove forests, presents a promising sustainable solution for Indonesia's coastal communities. However, in order to achieve broad implementation, it is essential to bridge the existing knowledge gap concerning the economic and environmental benefits associated with it. The aim of this study was to assess the four primary services rendered by the Blanakan mangrove silvofishery area in Subang District, West Java: carbon sequestration, fisheries productivity, naturebased tourism, and bird sanctuary. METHODS: Carbon storage was calculated by conducting vegetation surveys and utilizing allometric equations, which took into account both aboveground and belowground biomass. During the vegetation survey, data regarding the types of mangrove plants and the diameter of each tree at breast height was gathered. To quantify fisheries production, interviews were conducted with area managers and pond farmers who are engaged in silvofishery practices within the region. The pointcount method was used to inventory the diversity of bird species. The analysis of natural tourism services encompassed an examination of visitor statistics, the state of the mangroves as a popular tourist destination, and the range of tourist activities available. FINDINGS: The study revealed the high capacity of the mangrove stands at the study location for carbon storage, with an estimated 137.9 tonnes carbon per hectare aboveground and 79 tonnes carbon per hectare belowground. Local communities actively engage in silvofishery practices within the Blanakan mangroves, cultivating fish and shrimp, with an average annual income of around 1,513 United States dollar per hectare. 2. The natural beauty of the Blanakan mangrove area attracts tourists with its diverse ecosystem and opportunities to see crocodile breeding facilities. Visitor numbers vary, averaging around 128 people per month until mid-2023. The Blanakan mangroves are home to a total of 23 bird species, contributing to a species diversity index of 2.1. Two species with significant conservation value were found: the critically endangered Javan Blue-banded Kingfisher (Alcedo euryzona) and the vulnerable Black-capped Kingfisher (Halcyon pileata). CONCLUSION: The results emphasize the importance of advancing and advocating for silvofishery as a primary alternative in Indonesia's mangrove conservation and rehabilitation initiatives, enhancing coastal environmental management. Community engagement is of utmost importance in the successful development of mangrove silvofishery, as it aims to tackle the issue of limited awareness and participation among the local community.

TI  - Forest biomass recovery twenty-four years after conventional and reduced-impact logging in Eastern Amazon
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the mounting global concerns about mitigating climate change and curbing greenhouse gas emissions, it becomes increasingly crucial to comprehend the effects of logging techniques on biomass dynamics in tropical forests. This understanding is essential for fostering greater carbon retention and sequestration, aligning with the objectives of initiatives like REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation plus sustainable forest management and the conservation and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) and other conservation goals. In this context, this study investigated the effects of two wood harvesting methods, reduced-impact logging (RIL) and conventional logging (CL), on above-ground biomass (AGB) recovery rates 24 years after harvesting. The experimental design was based on three treatments: RIL, CL, and an unlogged control plot, situated in the municipality of Paragominas, State of Para<acute accent>, in the Eastern Amazon region of Brazil. All trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 25 cm, as well as all trees of commercial species with a DBH >= 10 cm, were monitored in a 24.5 ha plot within each treatment. Additionally, a 5.25 ha subplot within each treatment was designated for the monitoring of all trees with DBH >= 10 cm. The biomass data were generated from 11 measurements carried out from 1993 to 2017 (24-year period). Pre-logging AGB stocks were estimated at 181 Mg ha1 in the RIL plot, 187 Mg ha-1 in the CL plot, and 174 Mg ha-1 in the control plot. One year after logging, AGB decreased by 19 % under RIL and 30 % under CL, while the control forest remained unchanged. By 13 years after harvest, the RIL plot achieved 102 % AGB recovery, while the CL plot recovered 86 % of the original pre-harvest stock. Over the 24-year post-logging period, AGB stocks recovered to 128 % in the RIL plot compared to only 90 % in the CL plot, while the control forest maintained 93 % of its original stock. The average annual ABG increment rates were 3.56 Mg ha-1 year-1 after RIL and 2.33 Mg ha-1 year-1 after CL. Our findings demonstrate that implementing RIL is a more effective strategy for maintaining post-logging AGB stocks and accelerating AGB recovery rates, serving as a significant mitigation measure against climate change.

TI  - Community forest management and forest cover change in Lampung, Indonesia
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Community-based forestry (CBF) is often cited as a way for improving livelihood of local communities while conserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change. However, empirical assessments of CBF outcomes are still lacking, especially for their biophysical conditions. This study investigates the extent to which a type of CBF practices in Indonesia, Community Forest (HKM), managed to maintain forest cover. We applied a propensity scoring approach to empirically measure the rates of deforestation between 2007 and 2016 for Conservation Forests and Protection Forests with and without HKM concessions. Our finding is that HKMs are less effective than Conservation Forests (e.g. National Parks) in reducing forest cover loss, but more effective than other similar forests without CBF management. This is a promising starting point for expanding CBF in Indonesia. We recommend: 1) explicit consideration of biophysical characteristics of CBF locations in designating future sites; 2) providing site-specific financial and technical supports for local communities; 3) utilizing remotely sensed data and propensity scoring for monitoring conservation outcomes.

AB  - Globally, habitat loss, deforestation, and climate change are mostly caused by land cover changes (LCC). The amount of land covered by trees has had a major impact on global warming and climate change. Increasing the amount of land cover helps to mitigate climate change and global warming. This study aims to investigate the changes in land cover and carbon storage in Plawangan Hill, Indonesia, over four years (2009, 2013, 2017, and 2023). The study site was defined as a conservation area that has been periodically impacted both directly and indirectly by volcanic eruptions. Images from Landsat 7 and 8 were used to collect data. Additionally, land cover changes were assessed using the forest canopy density (FCD Mapper) model, which was then utilized to quantify the carbon storage of the research site. The findings demonstrated fluctuations in land cover changes between 2009 and 2023. Additionally, changes in land cover have a direct impact on changes in carbon storage. The age of the trees, type of vegetation, succession stage, and history of eruptions were the variables that were apparent to be the main causes of these changes.

TI  - Multiscale land use impacts on water quality: Assessment, planning, and future perspectives in Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Brazil contains the largest volume of freshwater of any nation in the world; however, this essential natural resource is threatened by rapid increases in water consumption and water quality degradation, mainly as a result of anthropogenic pressures. Declining water quality has become an increasingly more significant global concern as economic activities and human populations expand and climate change markedly alters hydrological cycles. Changes in land-use/land-cover (LULC) pattern have been recognized as a major driver of water quality degradation, however different LULC types and intensities affect water quality in different ways. In addition, the relationships between LULC and water quality may differ for different spatial and temporal scales. The increase in deforestation, agricultural expansion, and urban sprawl in Brazil highlights the need for water quality protection to ensure immediate human needs and to maintain the quality of water supplies in the long-term. Thus, this manuscript provides an overview of the relationships between LULC and water quality in Brazil, aiming at understanding the effects of different LULC types on water quality, how spatial and temporal scales contribute to these effects, and how such knowledge can improve watershed management and future projections. In general, agriculture and urban areas are the main LULCs responsible for water quality degradation in Brazil. However, although representing a small percentage of the territory, mining has a high impact on water quality. Water quality variables respond differently at different spatial scales, so spatial extent is an important aspect to be considered in studies and management. LULC impacts on water quality also vary seasonally and lag effects mean they take time to occur. Forest restoration can improve water quality and multicriteria evaluation has been applied to identify priority areas for forest restoration and conservation aiming at protecting water quality, but both need further exploration. Watershed modelling has been applied to simulate future impacts of LULC change on water quality, but data availability must be improved to increase the number, locations and duration of studies. Because of the international nature of watersheds and the consistent relationships between land use and water quality in Brazil, we believe our results will also aid water management in other countries.

TI  - Functional identity explains carbon sequestration in a 77-year-old experimental tropical plantation
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Planting forests is an important practice for climate change mitigation, especially in the tropics where the carbon (C) sequestration potential is high. Successful implementation of this mitigation practice requires knowledge of the role of species identity and diversity on carbon accrual of plantations. Despite this need, solid data on the long-term development of forest plantations are still very scarce. Monospecific and two species mixture plots of a 77-year-old tree diversity experiment in Yangambi in the Congo basin were fully inventoried. We calculated above-ground C stocks using allometric equations, and soil C stocks by analyzing soil samples at multiple depths. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the effect of taxonomic and functional identity and diversity on the aboveground and soil carbon stocks. A high variability in aboveground C stocks across tree species combinations was observed. Apart from a species identity effect, the proportion of planted species in the total stand basal area (BA(pl)) and effective species richness were identified as compositional parameters with a significant effect on the aboveground carbon (AGC), with BApl being more important. Both AGC and BA(pl) were coupled to the functional identity of the planted species; the planting of short-lived pioneers led to low AGC. We found no clear benefits, but also no drawbacks, for AGC of two species mixture plots over monospecific plots or including nitrogen fixing species in the plantation scheme. However, the latter was the only compositional parameter with a significant positive effect on the soil carbon stock up to 1 m depth. We conclude that the different plantation configurations gave rise to a wide range in carbon stocks. This was predominantly caused by large differences in AGC sequestration over the past 77 years. Altogether, short-lived pioneer species had a low BApl resulting in low carbon sequestration, while partial shade tolerant species achieved the highest AGC stocks. Tolerating spontaneous ingrowth during the plantation development can further increase the AGC stock, given that the appropriate functional type is planted.

TI  - Joining forces to fight wildfires: Science and management in a protected area of Pantanal, Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2020, the world's largest continuous stretch of wetlands, the Pantanal in South America, recorded its most catastrophic fire season of the last two decades, resulting in severe economic, ecological and health consequences. Regional environmental institutions and communities are taking measures to protect their unique ecosystem, as is the case of the Reserva Particular do Patrimonio Natural (RPPN) Sesc Pantanal, a national protected area. The reserve was severely affected by the 2020 wildfires and is now en route to recover and intensify prevention strategies. Here, we employ a state-of-the-art satellite-derived burned area dataset and a global climate reanalysis product to map and assess the incidence and vulnerability of this reserve to its most concerning disturbance: wildfires. We validated the remote-sensed burned area product and found that the product successfully maps the years with higher fire activity. Then, we studied historical occurrences of burned areas within the reserve. The results show large burned areas are uncommon, and highlight the year 2020 as an outlier, when around 65 % of the reserve was burned. Climate trends over the last four decades show increasing temperatures and wind speed, and decreasing relative humidity and precipitation. Fire weather is thus steadily rising, bearing favourable conditions for fire activity over the most critical months of the year. This study provides useful information for fire management decisions within the largest privately held natural reserve in Brazil, and further allows the assessment of the applicability and limitations of large-scale and state-of-the-art products to inform decision-making within protected areas.

TI  - Climate change threatens amphibians and species representation within protected areas in tropical wetlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas (PAs) are crucial for biodiversity conservation, yet climate change threatens their long-term effectiveness by displacing species distributions. Among the most climate-threatened organisms are the amphibians, highly dependent on water and wetlands. The world's largest continuous tropical wetland, the Pantanal and surroundings, is situated in the Upper Paraguay River Basin (UPRB) in South America. Of the 74 amphibian species found there, 4% are threatened. Less than 5% of the basin is within PAs. Recurrent droughts and increasing human pressures further endanger the region's semiaquatic fauna if adequate protection measures are not implemented. Using Ensemble of Small Models, we mapped habitat suitability of amphibian species and projected amphibian richness and composition across the UPRB. We applied null models to evaluate the representation of amphibian ranges within the current PA network under both current and future climate scenarios. To prioritize areas for PA network expansion under climate change scenarios, we used a systematic conservation planning algorithm. By 2100, over 80% of amphibian species from the study area are projected to lose suitable habitat, with 99% of amphibian assemblages facing climate-driven species loss. Although the existing PA network had limited species representation, protecting on average less than 5% of amphibian ranges. However, 13.7% of PAs are expected to shelter more amphibian species than expected by chance under future climate conditions. Highlands, particularly in the northern and southeastern boundaries of the UPRB, are identified priority areas for PA network expansion due to their high projected changes in amphibian biodiversity. Synthesis and applications. Our findings reveal the extensive impacts of climate change on a major semiaquatic group in the world's largest tropical wetland. Although the current PA network in the Pantanal and surroundings safeguards fewer amphibians than expected, its limited coverage provides opportunities for systematic, data-driven expansion to achieve the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework's 30 by 30 target. Expanding PAs is urgent, but addressing drivers of environmental degradation, including unsustainable practices in agriculture and livestock farming, is equally critical for conserving this biodiverse ecosystem.As Unidades de Conserva & ccedil;& atilde;o (UCs) s & atilde;o cruciais para a conserva & ccedil;& atilde;o da biodiversidade, mas as altera & ccedil;& otilde;es clim & aacute;ticas amea & ccedil;am a sua efic & aacute;cia a longo prazo ao deslocar a distribui & ccedil;& atilde;o das esp & eacute;cies.

TI  - FIRE-DRIVEN BIOMASS AND PEAT CARBON LOSSES AND POST-FIRE SOIL CO2 EMISSION IN A WEST KALIMANTAN PEATLAND FOREST
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesian peatland forest is considered a huge sink of tropical carbon and thereby make significant contribution to global terrestrial carbon storage. However, landcover and landuse changes in this ecosystem have incurred a synergistic exposure to drought and wildfires. Deforestation and forest degradation through combustion and decomposition of forest biomass and soil carbon have become global issues because of their greenhouse gas contribution to global climate change. Thus fire-driven carbon losses in these peatlands have increased the need to evaluate the impacts of fire at a landscape scale. In 6-10 week dry periods from January to April 2014 and in January 2015, wildfires burnt peatland forest in Kubu Raya, West Kalimantan province (Indonesian Borneo). An assessment was conducted to provide more reliable estimates of the effects of fire on aboveground and soil carbon losses and their dynamics in the coastal peatlands of the province. Carbon loss from combustion of both aboveground biomass and peat soil was substantial. Moreover, CO2 emission from soil respiration at the burnt peat surface increased 46% over the first 9 months after the fire. This study clearly showed the magnitude of fire-driven carbon loss and the scale of CO2 emission to the atmosphere arising from fire in tropical peatland forest.

T2  - STRATEGIES AND TOOLS FOR A SUSTAINABLE RURAL RIO DE JANEIRO
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The Brazilian agricultural sector is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, but climate-smart practices combined with degraded land restoration can result in a more resilient landscape contributing to integrated climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. The Sustainable Rural Development Program of Rio de Janeiro (RIO RURAL) has been supporting the transition of degraded rural areas to sustainable productive systems by providing technical assistance and incentives to small-scale family farmers. RIO RURAL promotes reforestation and sustainable agriculture practices, which can boost productivity as well as carbon stocks in the agricultural landscape. Using estimates of carbon mitigation potential for such practices, we identified methodologies eligible for certification in the voluntary markets. We estimated transaction, implementation, and certification costs and calculated potential revenues associated with RIO RURAL's activities. This did not only allow us to discuss the constraints and identify opportunities and co-benefits from RIO RURAL's contribution to climate mitigation, adaptation, and environmental integrity but also to food security as it targets family farms. We propose a bundling approach to carbon, where multiple benefits are measured and certified including water, food systems, as well as social and cultural benefits. This would allow accessing resources from both mitigation and adaptation programs in addition to markets that value ecosystem integrity as well as water and food security.

TI  - Can we avert an Amazon tipping point? The economic and environmental costs
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon biome is being pushed by unsustainable economic drivers towards an ecological tipping point where restoration to its previous state may no longer be possible. This degradation is the result of self-reinforcing interactions between deforestation, climate change and fire. We assess the economic, natural capital and ecosystem services impacts and trade-offs of scenarios representing movement towards an Amazon tipping point and strategies to avert one using the Integrated Economic-Environmental Modeling (IEEM) Platform linked with spatial land use-land cover change and ecosystem services modeling (IEEM + ESM). Our approach provides the first approximation of the economic, natural capital and ecosystem services impacts of a tipping point, and evidence to build the economic case for strategies to avert it. For the five Amazon focal countries, namely, Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia and Ecuador, we find that a tipping point would create economic losses of US$256.6 billion in cumulative gross domestic product by 2050. Policies that would contribute to averting a tipping point, including strongly reducing deforestation, investing in intensifying agriculture in cleared lands, climate-adapted agriculture and improving fire management, would generate approximately US$339.3 billion in additional wealth and a return on investment of US$29.5 billion. Quantifying the costs, benefits and trade-offs of policies to avert a tipping point in a transparent and replicable manner can support the design of regional development strategies for the Amazon biome, build the business case for action and catalyze global cooperation and financing to enable policy implementation.

AB  - Efforts to reduce deforestation are increasing worldwide through the implementation of climate change mitigation schemes and have recently been promoted as one of the goals of the United Nations' 2015-2030 Sustainable Development Goals. However, existing strategies are associated with high costs, low effectiveness, and potential adverse economic impact on tropical countries and local people. Moreover, because the underlying causes of deforestation are not clearly understood, the policy options that would be most effective in halting deforestation are not known. Therefore, in this study, I examine the main factors influencing forest area change by synthesizing the results of a multinational data analysis, a Malaysian socio-economic survey, and Indonesian household surveys on deforestation that were conducted between 1990 and 2014. I reveal that poverty has a strong impact on forest area change and that high agricultural rent accelerates deforestation. I then use logical equations based on my own findings and those of previous studies to represent the relationships between deforestation, poverty, agricultural rent, and forest scarcity. From these equations, I derive clear and reasonable explanations for the causes of deforestation and assess the effectiveness of various policies and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation strategies to halt deforestation. I suggest that poverty-reduction strategies can represent sound and effective methods for reducing tropical deforestation. These findings will facilitate development of sustainable strategies that will both reduce deforestation over long term and reconcile forest conservation with social welfare. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - This chapter presents the design and development of an Environmental Sustainability Index for the Evaluation of Environmental Agricultural Sustainability (impacts from anthropic action) applied to the Brazilian agricultural production Soybean monoculture area. The Agricultural Sustainability Index (ISAGRI) aims to express the degree of environmental sustainability of any agricultural production system, regardless of the system being of organic or conventional production. As such, it was designed to contain a minimum set of representative indicators of the quality of soil and water, of degradation and of measures compatible with sustainability. These indicators are useful both to compare the degree of sustainability of production systems, watersheds and regions, and to evaluate in any of these dimensions, its evolution over time. The ISAGRI employs mainly quantitative data, being a result of the aggregation of sub-indexes and indicators and it consists of a numerical value. This is because a high degree of comparability, as it proposes, is necessarily linked to the use of numerical data. The indicators part of these indexes were grouped into three dimensions named: Pressure-characterization of the environmental degradation caused by its use; State-identification of environmental quality and of natural resources and Response-measures taken for preservation of environmental quality. For a better comprehension of the circumstances under review, four alternative scenarios were proposed, preceded by some hypotheses, where the parameters that characterize each of them are: changing the type of planting, land use and used area or a combination of the above (planting and area). From these numbers, which are significant, it remains very clear the need for strict compliance with the environmental law that deals with forest reserve, including the restrictions to soil slopes, as well as the use of no-tillage.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Trade-in Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) in the Congo Basin is a source of cash income for stakeholders in their value chains, from harvesters to traders. However, gender-disaggregated data on the benefits of such trade in Gabon remains poorly captured and used by policymakers, despite a decree on women's empowerment enacted by the Republic of Gabon in 2017. This study assesses gender dynamics, reasons for entering the trade, economics, and perceived threats to Coula edulis, Dacryodes buettneri, and Irvingia gabonensis value chains originating in Makokou, Gabon. Data from field observations, key informants, and 79 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders in three markets showed that activities in the value chains of these three NTFPs were highly gender-differentiated. Women dominate in all three chains, particularly in the two lower-value products. This was driven by women's vulnerability and men's preference for higher-value timber and NTFPs. Both men and women enter the trade mostly because they lack other ways to generate income and employment. The men involved in the chains tended to harvest slightly larger volumes and sell at higher prices. The NTFPs and their value chains were all perceived as threatened by climate change, deforestation, and unsustainable forest resources management, with both men and women aware of these threats. The importance of the NTFP trade for women suggested that policies and gender focus interventions, for example on domestication, cultivation, value-adding to improve and sustain their income, could contribute to more sustainable value chains and livelihoods.

TI  - The AFOLU sector's role in national decarbonization: a comparative analysis of low-GHG development pathways in Brazil, India and Indonesia
T2  - CLIMATE POLICY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This paper analyses the role that AFOLU (agriculture, forest and other land use) plays in national deep decarbonization scenarios in Brazil, India and Indonesia between 2020 and 2050. It finds that the LULUCF (land use, land use change and forestry) subsector is important for medium-term mitigation (2020-2030) while continuing to contribute to mitigation over the long-term (2030-2050) in the three countries. Mitigation actions in LULUCF include drastically reducing deforestation (Brazil, Indonesia) and peat degradation (Indonesia), re-/afforestation (all), increased sequestration in standing forests (Brazil, Indonesia) and increasing soil carbon in agricultural lands (India). AFOLU further contributes to mitigation in Brazil and Indonesia by producing biomass feedstock for bioenergy. No country significantly reduces N2O and CH4 emissions from either agriculture or via demand-side actions on diets, due to trade-offs with food security, rural livelihoods and economic growth (although all countries reduce the GHG intensity of agricultural products). Furthermore, the paper analyses national policies to manoeuvre co-benefits and trade-offs between mitigation and other sustainable development goals (SDGs), including no poverty (1); zero hunger (2); decent work and economic growth (8); climate action, including both adaptation and mitigation (13); and life on land (15). Common policy areas were identified, including incentives to land managers for conservation or more environmental agricultural practices; changing regulations of land use to protect ecosystems and/or encourage shifts in agricultural practices; and strengthening enforcement capacity of land protection.

TI  - Spatial and temporal effects of drought on soil CO2 efflux in a cacao agroforestry system in Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change induced droughts pose a serious threat to ecosystems across the tropics and sub-tropics, particularly to those areas not adapted to natural dry periods. In order to study the vulnerability of cacao (Theobroma cacao) - Gliricidia sepium agroforestry plantations to droughts a large scale throughfall displacement roof was built in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. In this 19-month experiment, we compared soil surface CO2 efflux (soil respiration) from three roof plots with three adjacent control plots. Soil respiration rates peaked at intermediate soil moisture conditions and decreased under increasingly dry conditions (drought induced), or increasingly wet conditions (as evidenced in control plots). The roof plots exhibited a slight decrease in soil respiration compared to the control plots (average 13% decrease). The strength of the drought effect was spatially variable while some measurement chamber sites reacted strongly (responsive) to the decrease in soil water content (up to R-2 = 0.70) (n = 11), others did not react at all (non-responsive) (n = 7). A significant correlation was measured between responsive soil respiration chamber sites and sap flux density ratios of cacao (R = 0.61) and Gliricidia (R = 0.65). Leaf litter CO2 respiration decreased as conditions became drier. The litter layer contributed approximately 3-4% of the total CO2 efflux during dry periods and up to 40% during wet periods. Within days of roof opening soil CO2 efflux rose to control plot levels. Thereafter, CO2 efflux remained comparable between roof and control plots. The cumulative effect on soil CO2 emissions over the duration of the experiment was not significantly different: the control plots respired 11.1 +/- 0.5 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), while roof plots respired 10.5 +/- 0.5 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). The relatively mild decrease measured in soil CO2 efflux indicates that this agro-forestry ecosystem is capable of mitigating droughts with only minor stress symptoms.

TI  - Understanding the Greenhouse Gas Impact of Deforestation Fires in Indonesia and Brazil in 2019 and 2020
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation fires are hindering climate change mitigation efforts and compounding global environmental challenges. Indonesia and Brazil have experienced high rates of deforestation fires in recent years, with many of the fires burning in peatland-rich ecosystems. We quantify the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the 2019 and 2020 deforestation fires in both countries and determine the share of emissions originating from peatlands. Specifically, we use publicly available data for deforested area estimates and quantify the above-ground biomass (AGB), dry matter, and peat soil emissions associated with these fires. We find that the cumulative emissions impact from deforestation fires in Indonesia and Brazil was 3.7 (& PLUSMN;0.4) and 1.9 (& PLUSMN;0.2) Gt CO(2)eq in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Nearly half of this GHG impact can be attributed to emissions from peatlands. However, real-time monitoring tools can underestimate these emissions as fires in peatlands smolder underground and can go undetected by satellites. We compare our results with publicly available land-use and fire emissions data and find that the magnitude of underestimation is of the order of 200-300% for severe fire years and highest in the peatland-rich Brazilian Pantanal. We identify the gaps in current policies that are exacerbating the GHG and climate impacts of deforestation fires in Indonesia and Brazil and emphasize the need for regular pre- and post-fire ground measurement, transparent data sharing, and robust policy enforcement for effective forest and peatland protection.

TI  - Measurement of carbon dioxide flux from tropical peatland in Indonesia using the nocturnal temperature-inversion trap method
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluation of CO2 flux from peatland soil respiration is important to understand the effect of land use change on the global carbon cycle and climate change and particularly to support carbon emission reduction policies. However, quantitative estimation of emitted CO2 fluxes in Indonesia is constrained by existing field data. Current methods for CO2 measurement are limited by high initial cost, manpower, and the difficulties associated with construction issues. Measurement campaigns were performed using a newly developed nocturnal temperature-inversion trap method, which measures the amount of CO2 trapped beneath the nocturnal inversion layer, in the dry season of 2013 at a drained tropical peatland near Palangkaraya, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. This method is cost-effective and data processing is easier than other flux estimation methods. We compared CO2 fluxes measured using this method with the published data from the existing eddy covariance and closed chamber methods. The maximum value of our measurement results was 10% lower than maximum value of eddy covariance method and average value was 6% higher than average of chamber method in drained tropical peatlands. In addition, the measurement results shows good correlation with groundwater table. The results of this comparison suggest that this methodology for the CO2 flux measurement is useful for field research in tropical peatlands.

TI  - Does the Establishment of Sustainable Use Reserves Affect Fire Management in the Humid Tropics?
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests are experiencing a growing fire problem driven by climatic change, agricultural expansion and forest degradation. Protected areas are an important feature of forest protection strategies, and sustainable use reserves (SURs) may be reducing fire prevalence since they promote sustainable livelihoods and resource management. However, the use of fire in swidden agriculture, and other forms of land management, may be undermining the effectiveness of SURs in meeting their conservation and sustainable development goals. We analyse MODIS derived hot pixels, TRMM rainfall data, Terra-Class land cover data, socio-ecological data from the Brazilian agro-census and the spatial extent of rivers and roads to evaluate whether the designation of SURs reduces fire occurrence in the Brazilian Amazon. Specifically, we ask (1) a. Is SUR location (i.e., de facto) or (1) b. designation (i.e. de jure) the driving factor affecting performance in terms of the spatial density of fires?, and (2), Does SUR creation affect fire management (i.e., the timing of fires in relation to previous rainfall)? We demonstrate that pre-protection baselines are crucial for understanding reserve performance. We show that reserve creation had no discernible impact on fire density, and that fires were less prevalent in SURs due to their characteristics of sparser human settlement and remoteness, rather than their status de jure. In addition, the timing of fires in relation to rainfall, indicative of local fire management and adherence to environmental law, did not improve following SUR creation. These results challenge the notion that SURs promote environmentally sensitive fire-management, and suggest that SURs in Amazonia will require special attention if they are to curtail future accidental wildfires, particularly as plans to expand the road infrastructure throughout the region are realised. Greater investment to support improved fire management by farmers living in reserves, in addition to other fire users, will be necessary to help ameliorate these threats.

TI  - Conservation value of cacao agroforestry for amphibians and reptiles in South-East Asia: combining correlative models with follow-up field experiments
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - P>Although agricultural expansion is a primary threat to tropical biodiversity, experimental studies evaluating the conservation value of tropical agricultural habitats are scarce. In particular, little is known about the sensitivity of amphibians and reptiles to habitat disturbance in areas of very high diversity such as South-East Asia.We used a two-step approach to determine the relationship between habitat complexity and conservation value of cacao agroforestry for herpetological diversity in Sulawesi (Indonesia). Indonesia is the third largest cacao-exporting country globally and forest conversion to cacao plantations is a major threat to its biodiversity. We first sampled 43 cacao plantations six times to determine the environmental variables that best explained herpetofaunal diversity patterns using a Bayesian model selection approach. Based on these results, we experimentally manipulated leaf litter thickness (LLT), number of branch piles (LOGS) and LLT + LOGS combinations in the cacao plots. The experimental data were analysed using Bayesian hierarchical regression.The best supported correlative models incorporated LLT, LOGS, air temperature and the ratio between leaf litter and shrub cover, showing the importance of habitat heterogeneity and suggesting climate change sensitivity. The subsequent structural manipulation of these attributes changed amphibian and reptile species richness, and reptile abundance, but only addition of leaf litter did so in a biologically meaningful way, providing microhabitat resources. However, the main beneficiaries were common disturbance-tolerant reptiles.Synthesis and applications. The different results from the correlative model and the independent manipulative experiments showed how important such a combined approach is to derive adequate conservation management recommendations. Increasing leaf litter in cacao agroforestry will work best if implemented on a landscape scale to incorporate sufficient environmental variation and species life histories. This will mainly enhance the richness and abundance of disturbance-tolerant species, which still may maintain ecosystem functions such as pest removal. Particularly for rare species, native forests remain critical for herpetological richness. The direct temperature sensitivity suggests that future climate change impacts may be severe for herpetological diversity in plantation habitats and, hence, demand further research.

TI  - Conservation slows down emission increase from a tropical peatland in Indonesia
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatlands are threatened by climate change and land-use changes, but there remain substantial uncertainties about their present and future role in the global carbon cycle due to limited measurements. Here, we present measurements of carbon dioxide and methane emissions between mid-2017 and mid-2020 as well as nitrous oxide emissions between 2019 and 2020 at two contrasting sites at a coastal peatland in Sumatra, Indonesia. We find that greenhouse-gas emissions from intact peatland increased substantially due to an extreme drought caused by a positive Indian Ocean Dipole phase combined with El Nino. The emission in the degraded site was two times greater than that at the intact site. The smaller emission from the intact peatland suggests that protecting the remaining intact tropical peatlands from degradation offers important climate benefits, avoiding greenhouse-gas emissions of 24 +/- 5 tCO(2)e ha(-1) yr(-1) (average +/- standard deviation) at our study site in Indonesia.During a period of drought, an intact tropical peatland in Indonesia released half the amount of greenhouse gases as was released from a degraded site, according to a direct comparison of eddy covariance measurements at a pair of peatland sites in Sumatra.

TI  - Conditions influencing the adoption of effective anti-deforestation policies in South America's commodity frontiers
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing large-scale deforestation in commodity frontiers remains a key challenge for climate change mitigation and the conservation of biodiversity. Public and private anti-deforestation policies have been shown to effectively reduce forest loss, but the conditions under which such policies get adopted are rarely examined. Here we propose a set of conditions that we expect to be associated with the adoption of effective anti-deforestation policies in commodity frontiers. We then examine whether these conditions have influenced policy adoption in South America's major soy-and-cattle frontiers: the Brazilian Amazon, the Cerrado, the Chaco, the Chiquitano, and Paraguay's Atlantic Forest. By collating empirical data from diverse sources, including literature review, extensive expert interviews, and analysis of primary and secondary data, we show that the Cerrado, the Chaco, and the Chiquitano differ from the Brazilian Amazon in multiple ways that might have inhibited adoptions of effective anti-deforestation instruments. These conditions include: a higher importance of the agricultural sector within the respective countries, lower carbon stocks and species richness, higher prevalence of private land tenure, and higher baseline compliance with forest reserve regulations on private lands. We also observe that the adoption of the most effective private anti-deforestation instrument, commodity moratoria, may respond to similar conditions as those influencing the adoption of public instruments. Incentivizing public and private actors to adopt effective anti-deforestation policies in the Cerrado, Chaco, and the Chiquitano will likely be more challenging than it has been in the Brazilian Amazon.

TI  - Climate change could threaten cocoa production: Effects of 2015-16 El Nino-related drought on cocoa agroforests in Bahia, Brazil
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate models predict a possible increase in the frequency of strong climate events such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which in parts of the tropics are the cause of exceptional droughts, these threaten global food production. Agroforestry systems are often suggested as promising diversification options to increase farmers' resilience to extreme climatic events. In the Northeastern state of Bahia, where most Brazilian cocoa is grown in wildlife-friendly agroforests, ENSOs cause severe droughts which negatively affect forest and agriculture. Cocoa (Theobroma cacao) is described as being sensitive to drought but there are no field-studies of the effect of ENSO-related drought on adult cocoa trees in the America's; there is one study of an experimentally-imposed drought in Indonesia which resulted in 10 to 46% yield loss. In our study, in randomly chosen farms in Bahia, Brazil, we measured the effect of the 2015-16 severe ENSO, which caused an unprecedented drought in cocoa agroforests. We show that drought caused high cocoa tree mortality (15%) and severely decreased cocoa yield (89%); the drought also increased infection rate of the chronic fungal disease witches' broom (Moniliophthora perniciosa). Ours findings showed that Brazilian cocoa agroforests are at risk and that increasing frequency of strong droughts are likely to cause decreased cocoa yields in the coming decades. Furthermore, because cocoa, like many crops, is grown somewhat beyond its climatic limits, it and other crops could be the 'canaries in the coalmine' warning of forthcoming major drought effects on semi-natural and natural vegetation.

TI  - Current trends in forestry research of Latin-America: an editorial overview of the Special Issue
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mendoza city (Argentina) hosted the VIII Latin American Forestry Congress (CONFLAT) and the V Forestry Congress of Argentina (CFA) in 2023, where relevant issues were addressed, such as climate change, degradation, reforestation, management and forest industry, monitoring, environmental services, social issues, and governance, among others. The objective of this Special Issue was to present the main advances in Forestry Science for Latin-America in the context of changing governance and forest livelihoods for people. The fifteen articles emphasize the interdisciplinary nature of the forest management and conservation, and that multiple variables must be considered to achieve sustainability. The articles come from studies across Southern South-America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay), and the collaboration of researchers of other countries (M & eacute;xico, Canada, and Spain). Articles include research in tropical, Mediterranean and temperate Sub-Antarctic forests. Together, these articles provide a snapshot of new forestry research carried out locally and internationally to bring about beneficial ecological and environmental outcomes in a world facing the challenges of sustainable management and conservation amongst the threats and uncertainty of climate change and environmental degradation responsible for extensive loss of biodiversity and environmental services. We believe that this Special Issue will encourage more inter-disciplinary research focusing on management and conservation of forests.

TI  - Brazil beyond 2020: from deforestation to the energy challenge
T2  - CLIMATE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The main assumptions and findings are presented on a comparative analysis of three GHG long-term emissions scenarios for Brazil. Since 1990, land-use change has been the most important source of GHG emissions in the country. The voluntary goals to limit Brazilian GHG emissions pledged a reduction in between 36.1% and 38.9% of GHG emissions projected to 2020, to be 610% lower than in 2005. Brazil is in a good position to meet the voluntary mitigation goals pledged to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) up to 2020: recent efforts to reduce deforestation have been successful and avoided deforestation will form the bulk of the emissions reduction commitment. In 2020, if governmental mitigation goals are met, then GHG emissions from the energy system would become the largest in the country. After 2020, if no additional mitigation actions are implemented, GHG emissions will increase again in the period 20202030, due to population and economic growth driving energy demand, supply and GHG emissions. However, Brazil is in a strong position to take a lead in low-carbon economic and social development due to its huge endowment of renewable energy resources allowing for additional mitigation actions to be adopted after 2020. Policy relevance The period beyond 2020 is now relevant in climate policy due to the Durban Platform agreeing a protocol, legal instrument or agreed outcome with legal force' that will have effect from 2020. After 2020, Brazil will be in a situation more similar to other industrialized countries, faced with a new challenge of economic development with low GHG energy-related emissions, requiring the adoption of mitigation policies and measures targeted at the energy system. Unlike the mitigation actions in the land-use change sector, where most of the funding will come from the national budgets due to sovereignty concerns, the huge financial resources needed to develop low-carbon transport and energy infrastructure could benefit from soft loans channelled to the country through nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs).

TI  - Recovery of dung beetle assemblages in regenerating Caatinga dry forests following slash-and-burn agriculture
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding patterns of tropical forest resilience is a central challenge in conservation ecology particularly in seasonally-dry tropical forests, where anthropogenic disturbance and climate change are pervasive threats. Here, we investigate the recovery rate and community organization of dung beetles along a Caatinga dry forest regeneration cline in the context of slash-and-burn agriculture in northeast Brazil. Assemblages were described considering a wide set of attributes, including abundance, taxonomic (Hill orders D-0, D-1 and D-2) and functional diversity (functional richness, evenness and redundancy) and taxonomic/functional composition, across a chronosequence consisting of regenerating and old-growth forest stands exposed to different levels of aridity and chronic disturbance. In addition, we use body mass, diet, food relocation behaviour and habitat specificity of dung beetles as ecological attributes. Our results show that Caatinga dry forests supports dense but relatively impoverished dung beetle assemblages at both local and landscape scales, with the same small set of species dominating local assemblages. Dung beetles do not experience successional replacements along the regeneration gradient, with evidence of high resilience. Moreover, disturbance-associated dung beetle species (predominantly small-bodied generalists) resulted in assemblage convergence across the regeneration cline. Finally, chronic anthropogenic disturbance was a decisive driver of changes in abundance and taxonomic diversity, while aridity positively affected species composition and functional richness. These patterns resulted in the occurrence of spatially structured assemblages in response to a combination of both natural and anthropogenic variables, while under little or no influence of forest regeneration status across human-modified Caatinga landscapes. We conclude that the absence of directional changes in dung beetle assemblages through the forest succession pathway of regenerating second-growth forest is associated with the effect of aridity and human disturbances on community organization, including selection for certain species and functional groups, which in turn, can alter important ecological functions and consequently the resilience of dry forests.

TI  - Intercropping of coffee with the palm tree, macauba, can mitigate climate change effects
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate changes can affect coffee production in Brazil, and in other coffee producing countries. We examined the potential for an agroforestry system with the native species, macauba (Acrocomia aculeata), to mitigate impacts on coffee production by reducing maximal air temperature and photosynthetic active radiation. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of an agroforestry system with macauba on productivity, microclimatic characteristics and soil physical quality on a coffee plantation in the Atlantic Rainforest biome, in Southern Brazil. We measured soil attributes (moisture, temperature, and physical properties), microclimate conditions (air temperature, photosynthetic active radiation) and coffee production parameters (productivity and yield). Macauba palm trees were planted at different planting densities on the rows and distances from the coffee rows. Planting density of macauba and their distance from the coffee rows affected soil thermal-water regime. Compared with the traditional unshaded sole coffee planting, the intercropped cultivation provided more coffee yield on both macauba density planting and distance evaluated. On the other hand, coffee productivity was increased by agroforestry systems just for 4.2 m distance between palm trees and coffee rows. Planting density of macaubas did not affect coffee yield and productivity. Best coffee harvest in agroforestry systems with macauba was related to higher soil moisture at the depth of 20-40 cm, higher photosynthetic active radiation, and maximum air temperatures lower than 30 degrees C. Agroforestry with coffee and macauba trees can be an adaptation strategy under future climatic variability and change related to high temperatures and low rainfall.

TI  - Soil CO2 concentration, efflux, and partitioning in a recently afforested grassland
T2  - NEW FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Relatively few studies have documented the impacts of afforestation, particularly production forestry, on belowground carbon dioxide (CO2) effluxes to the atmosphere. We evaluated the changes in the soil CO2 efflux-a proxy for soil respiration (Rs)-for three years following a native grassland conversion to eucalypt plantations in southern Brazil where minimum tillage during site preparation created two distinct soil zones, within planting row (W) and between-row (B). We used root-exclusion and carbon (C)- isotopic approaches to distinguish Rs components (heterotrophic-Rh and autotrophic-Ra respirations), and a CO2 profile tube (1-m deep) to determine the concentration ([CO2]) and isotopic C signature of soil CO2 (delta(13)[CO2]). The soil CO2 efflux in the afforested site averaged 0.37 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1), which was 56% lower than the soil CO2 efflux in the grassland. The delta(CO2)-C-13 in the afforested site ranged from - 14.1 parts per thousand to - 29.4 parts per thousand, indicating a greater contribution of eucalypt-derived respiration (both Rh and Ra) over time. Higher soil CO2 efflux and lower [CO2] were observed in W than B, indicating that soil preparation creates two distinct soil functional zones with respect to C cycling. The [CO2] and delta(13)[CO2] decreased in both zonal positions with eucalypt stand development. Although the equilibrium in C fluxes and pools across multiple rotations is needed to fully account for the feedback of eucalypt planted forests to climate change, we provide quantitative information on soil CO2 dynamics after afforestation and show how soil preparation can leverage the feedback of planted forests to climate change.

TI  - The Forest Policies of ASEAN and Montreal Process: Comparing Highly and Weakly Formalized Regional Regimes
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are governed by a combination of sub-national and national as well as global and regional regimes. Comparing the institutional variation of regional regimes, including their degrees of formalization, is gaining attention of studies on regionalism in International Relations. This study attempts to analyse the ways in which the selected cases of the forest-related Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and forest-focused Montreal Process (MP) regional regimes may have synergetic overlaps or disparity in their institutional design and forest policy development. For this, we combined IR's 'rational institutional design' theory and a policy analysis approach. Using a qualitative data approach, we analyzed key structure-related historical regime documents (e.g., charters) issued since the inception of both regimes, and their latest forest policy initiatives for the periods 2016-2025 (Strategic Plan of Action for ASEAN Cooperation on Forestry) and 2009-2015 (Conceptual Framework for the Montreal Process Strategic Action Plan) with all relevant policy documents since the adoption of current policies. Based on that, we pose the empirical questions of how both regimes illustrate governance structure (i.e., institutional design), and on the other hand how to explain regime forest policies coherently and consistently in terms of their high versus low degree of formality. The results show that institutional design is highly explanatory based on treaty and non-treaty regime formation as well as forest-related/focused regime formation with the synergistic sustainable forest management (SFM) issue that embraces deforestation and forest degradation, biodiversity, timber certification, and greenhouse gas emission. Additionally, the results suggest that the policy goals adopted by both regimes are coherent and consistent based on the full set of policy elements. Concerning the remedy for fragmented global forest governance arrangements, both regimes would be an example of practicing SFM-focused policies with the incorporation of forest-related policy elements into a larger governance assemblage dealing with issues such as biodiversity conservation or climate change mitigation.

TI  - Modelling nitrogen in the Yesilirmak River catchment in Northern Turkey: Impacts of future climate and environmental change and implications for nutrient management
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent research in catchments of rapidly developing countries such as Brazil and China suggests that many catchments of the developing world are already showing signs of nitrogen pollution reminiscent of past experiences in developed countries. This paper looks at both the individual and combined effects of future climate change and other likely environmental changes on in-stream nitrate concentrations in a catchment in Northern Turkey. A model chain comprised of simulated future temperature and precipitation from a Regional Circulation Model (RCM), a conceptual hydrological model (HBV) and a widely tested integrated catchment nitrogen model (INCA-N) is used to model future changes in nitrate concentrations. Two future periods (2021-2050 and 2069-2098) are compared to the 1961-1990 baseline period in order to assess the effectiveness of several possible interventions available to catchment authorities. The simulations show that in the urbanised part of the catchment. the effects of climate change and other environmental changes act in the same direction, leading to peak nitrate concentrations of 7.5 mg N/l for the 2069-2098 period, which corresponds to a doubling of the baseline values. Testing different available policy options reveals that the installation of wastewater treatment works (WWTWs) in all major settlements of the catchment could ensure nitrate levels are kept at near their baseline values for the 2021-2050 period. Nevertheless, a combination of measures including WWTWs, meadow creation, international agreements to reduce atmospheric N concentrations and controls on agricultural practises will be required for 2069-2098. The approach presented in this article could be employed in order to anticipate future pollution problems and to test appropriate solutions, some of which will necessitate international co-operation, in other catchments around the world.

TI  - A large-scale field assessment of carbon stocks in human-modified tropical forests
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical rainforests store enormous amounts of carbon, the protection of which represents a vital component of efforts to mitigate global climate change. Currently, tropical forest conservation, science, policies, and climate mitigation actions focus predominantly on reducing carbon emissions from deforestation alone. However, every year vast areas of the humid tropics are disturbed by selective logging, understory fires, and habitat fragmentation. There is an urgent need to understand the effect of such disturbances on carbon stocks, and how stocks in disturbed forests compare to those found in undisturbed primary forests as well as in regenerating secondary forests. Here, we present the results of the largest field study to date on the impacts of human disturbances on above and belowground carbon stocks in tropical forests. Live vegetation, the largest carbon pool, was extremely sensitive to disturbance: forests that experienced both selective logging and understory fires stored, on average, 40% less aboveground carbon than undisturbed forests and were structurally similar to secondary forests. Edge effects also played an important role in explaining variability in aboveground carbon stocks of disturbed forests. Results indicate a potential rapid recovery of the dead wood and litter carbon pools, while soil stocks (0-30cm) appeared to be resistant to the effects of logging and fire. Carbon loss and subsequent emissions due to human disturbances remain largely unaccounted for in greenhouse gas inventories, but by comparing our estimates of depleted carbon stocks in disturbed forests with Brazilian government assessments of the total forest area annually disturbed in the Amazon, we show that these emissions could represent up to 40% of the carbon loss from deforestation in the region. We conclude that conservation programs aiming to ensure the long-term permanence of forest carbon stocks, such as REDD+, will remain limited in their success unless they effectively avoid degradation as well as deforestation.

TI  - Carbon payments as a safeguard for threatened tropical mammals
T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - One reason for the rapid loss of species-rich tropical forests is the high opportunity costs of forest protection. In Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo), the expansion of high-revenue oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantations currently threatens 3.3 million ha of forest. We estimate that payments for Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD) could offset the costs of stopping this deforestation at carbon prices of US$ 10-33 per tonne of CO2, or $ 2-16 per tonne if forest conservation targets only cost-efficient areas. Forty globally threatened mammals are found within these planned plantations, including the Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) and Borneo pygmy elephant (Elephas maximus borneensis). Cost-efficient areas for emissions reductions also contain higher-than-average numbers of threatened mammals, indicating that there may be synergies between mitigating climate change and conserving biodiversity. While many policy and implementation issues need clarification, our economic assessment suggests that REDD could offer a financially realistic lifeline for Kalimantan's threatened mammals if it is included in future climate agreements.

TI  - Mainstreaming Ecosystem Services from Indonesia's Remaining Forests
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - With 120 million hectares of forest area, Indonesia has the third largest area of biodiversity-rich tropical forests in the world, and it is well-known as a mega-biodiversity country. However, in 2020, only 70 percent of this area remained forested. The government has consistently undertaken corrective actions to achieve Sustainable Development Goal targets, with a special focus on Goals #1 (no poverty), #2 (zero hunger), #3 (good health and well-being), #7 (affordable and clean energy), #8 (decent work and economic growth), #13 (climate action), and #15 (life on land). Good environmental governance is a core concept in Indonesia's forest management and includes mainstreaming ecosystem services as a framework for sustainable forest management. This paper analyzes efforts to mainstream Indonesia's remaining forest ecosystem services. We review the state of Indonesia's forests in relation to deforestation dynamics, climate change, and ecosystem service potential and options and provide recommendations for mainstreaming strategies regarding aspects of policy, planning, and implementation, as well as the process of the articulation of ecosystem services and their alternative funding.

TI  - Climate and land use change: future impacts on hydropower and revenue for the amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and climate change are expected to significantly alter hydrology and consequently electricity production in countries extremely dependent on their water resources, such as Brazil. Therefore, we used the largescale hydrological model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), which we integrated with climate change and land use scenarios for the Tocantins-Araguaia Watershed (TAW) with a focus on energy production at the Tucurui Hydroelectric Plant (THP) in the southeastern Amazon. We used daily precipitation and temperature data from two General Circulation Models (GCM), HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5 with moderate (+4.5 W/m2 in the year 2100 relative to pre-industrial levels) and severe (+8.5 W/m2) radiative forcing from carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere (Representative Concentration Pathways). For the land use and land cover change (LULCC) scenario, we replaced forest areas only with pasture, then with agriculture, then with reforestation vegetation, and finally with regenerated forest. Each LULCC period was coupled with the highest impact climate scenario found for TAW (MIROC5-RCP 8.5); thus, we investigated five scenarios and their impacts on hydropower production and revenue in THP. Our results highlight that the TAW will face a large water reduction by the end of the century, which in all scenarios will strongly impact the basin's energy production and hydro revenue. Reductions of up to 74% in annual flow and 63% in electricity generation are expected for the most pessimistic scenario (L8.5), triggering a 135% deficit per year in THP revenue. Although some land use change scenarios partially minimize the climate-driven flow decrease trend in the period of higher precipitation, there is still a dramatic reduction in flow during the dry season, thus exacerbating seasonal and inter-annual variability.

TI  - Why were upscaled incentive programs for forest conservation adopted? Comparing policy choices in Brazil, Ecuador, and Peru
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest conservation policies could potentially become a centerpiece for climate change mitigation. Incentive-based conservation policies, such as payments for environmental services (PES), are seen as promising approaches to reduce deforestation. Yet, arguably the adoption of upscaled PES programs has remained slow, and when implemented their design often diverges from the principles laid out in the theory-based PES literature. In this article, we concentrate on some political economy forces that could help explaining the gap between PES theory and practice, with respect to policy adoption, including opportunities and challenges in this process. Public policy theories grasp the adoption determinants of three large, government-led incentive programs for forest conservation in the Amazon, in Peru, Ecuador, and Brazil. We use Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework to analyze decision-making regarding program initiation, including key stakeholder interviews, to understand policy choices. We find that environmental concerns are not always the prime motives for PES programs, as political and institutional contexts limit environmental policy-makers' actions. Yet, policy choice processes become less constrained when environmental issues are closer to a government's priorities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The response of soil respiration to climatic drivers in undrained forest and drained oil palm plantations in an Indonesian peatland
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - To accurately quantify tropical peatlands' contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions, and to understand how emissions from peat may change in the future, long-term measurements over seasons and years are needed. Sampling soil respiration over a range of temperature and moisture conditions in the field is valuable for understanding how peat soil emissions may respond to climate change. We collected monthly measurements of total soil respiration, moisture and temperature from forest and smallholder oil palm plantations on peat in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Our study period, from January 2014 through September 2015, covered wet-dry transitions during 1year with relatively normal precipitation and one El Nino year. Oil palm plots, with lower water table, had 22% higher total soil respiration (0.71 +/- 0.04gCO(2)m(-2)h(-1)) than forest plots (0.58 +/- 0.04gCO(2)m(-2)h(-1)) over the entire monitoring period. However, during the El Nino event in September 2015, despite overall lower water table levels in oil palm plots, total soil respiration was higher in forest (1.24 +/- 0.20gCO(2)m(-2)h(-1)) than in oil palm (0.90 +/- 0.09gCO(2)m(-2)h(-1)). Land-use change continues to be an important driver of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from Indonesian peatlands. However, the stronger response of total soil respiration to extreme drought in forest indicates the potential importance of climate regime in determining future net carbon (C) emissions from these ecosystems. Future warming and increased intensity of seasonal drying may increase C emissions from Indonesian peatlands, regardless of land-use.

T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 6th f-7 Workshop
CL  - MEXICO CITY, MEXICO
AB  - How land-use change and forestry sector options can be used to mitigate global warming will depend on a variety of pending decisions regarding interpretation of the Kyoto Protocol, including treatment of uncertainty. In tropical forest countries, the allocation of effort between plantation silviculture and reduction of deforestation would be influenced by the stringency of requirements regarding certainly. Slowing deforestation offers much greater potential benefits, but the certainty associated with these is much lower than in the case of plantations. In the Brazilian case, deforestation avoidance could produce carbon benefits worth 6-45 times as much as the destructive ranching and logging uses to which the forest is now being converted. Capturing the potential value of carbon benefits from avoided deforestation will depend on increasing our understanding of the deforestation process and consequent ability to reduce the uncertainty associated with the effects of deforestation-avoidance measures. It will also depend on whether carbon credits are defined in terms of a. maximum level of uncertainty. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Brazilian Conservation Units (CUs) and Indigenous Lands (ILs) have effectively prevented deforestation and supported climate regulation. However, these protected areas face increasing threats from forest fires and droughts across the Amazon and Cerrado biomes. This study assesses how disturbances affect climate regulating factors (surface temperature (LST), evapotranspiration (ET), and albedo) in Mato Grosso state, among different land uses (CUs, ILs, and multiple -use areas - MUs). To do so, we analyzed satellite data collected between 2001 and 2020. Results showed that MUs (outside protected areas) had lower ET (-10%), higher daytime LST (-1.5 degrees C), and higher albedo (-10%) than CUs and ILs in both biomes in 2001. Over the study period, MUs experienced a greater increase in LST (Amazon: -1.4 degrees C; Cerrado: -1.1 degrees C) and albedo (Amazon: -6%; Cerrado: -3%) compared to protected areas, regardless of the biome. In contrast, ILs and CUs showed smaller mean changes in LST (-0.2 degrees C), ET (-1.3%), and albedo (-1.3%). These changes were associated with native vegetation loss, forest fires, and water stress. Our results highlight the important role of protected areas in maintaining climate stability, with higher ET, lower LST, and lower albedo than other land uses. However, the long-term preservation of these services within protected areas depends on interventions in surrounding regions, particularly in the Amazon. Protecting and restoring these natural ecosystems is key for safeguarding ecosystem services and climate regulation in tropical regions.

TI  - Revealing the spatial variation in biomass uptake rates of Brazil's secondary forests
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is essential for quantifying the carbon cycle and mitigating climate change. Tropical secondary forests are significant carbon sinks that sequester large amounts of carbon dioxide. While recent studies have attempted to estimate the AGB recovery rates in tropical forests, considerable uncertainty remains in the estimation of AGB recovery of secondary forests and the spatial variability of the effects that different environmental conditions and degrees of human use may have on AGB recovery. These knowledge gaps hinder further understanding of climate change mitigation potential of secondary forests. Remote sensing products provide spatially and temporally explicit information for understanding and monitoring secondary forest dynamics. To explore the local effects of different factors on AGB of secondary forests in Brazil, we used geographically weighted regression (GWR) models that account for spatial heterogeneity in geospatial data to estimate the AGB of secondary forests in Brazil. Secondary forest areas (29142 polygons) were extracted from Brazil's forest age maps between 1984 and 2019. The AGB of these areas was derived from the Climate Change Initiative Biomass maps. The effects of selected predictors such as forest age, climatic water deficit, the cation exchange capacity of soil and surrounding tree cover were analyzed. The two most influential factors, forest age and surrounding tree cover were utilized to estimate the AGB and the recovery rates per year. Our results show the high spatial variation of different predictors' effects on the AGB of secondary forests. Also, the GWR model (with an adjusted R2 of 0.74) showed considerable improvements regarding "goodness of fit" of models compared with the Ordinary Least Squares (with an adjusted R2 of 0.53). Our estimated average AGB recovery rate across all Brazil's biomes is 7.5 Mg ha -1 yr- 1 (using forest age) for the first 20 years. We presented the map of the spatial variation of AGB recovery rates in Brazil. The estimated AGB recovery rates range using forest age is 28.9 Mg ha -1 yr- 1. Our estimated mean AGB recovery rates of different biomes are 17.7 % on average higher than IPCC default rates. Our results provide baseline information for reducing uncertainties related to carbon sink estimation of secondary forests in Brazil, hence assisting in developing sustainable forest management and ecosystem restoration strategies.

TI  - Growth Performance of Exotic Trees in Korea
T2  - Journal of forest and environmental science
M3  - research-article
AB  - There are many countries having a long history of exotic tree introduction from different countries and several countries including New Zealand, Brazil and Hungary have successfully introduced exotic trees. Korea’s tree breeding program for introduction of exotic tree was originally started from 1924. Records reveal that hundreds of tree species were introduced from many countries and tested their germination and viability. About 415 introductions were eliminated since they had been introduced and tested. Subsequently, seven exotic trees that proved successful in trials and plantations have planted for afforestation. Simultaneously, several promising exotic trees are still under the test. In this paper, we will succinctly review and evaluate their comparative growth performance of the exotic trees in the plantation programs of the country to coping with climate change.

AB  - We evaluate the potential of a proposed policy model that would explicitly link the cultivation of biofuels with forest conservation (Biofuel + FC) as part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The model postulates that a ratio of 4:1 forest conservation to biofuel cultivation be linked to proposals for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD + Biofuel), while a ratio of 9:1 biofuel cultivation to reforestation on degraded landscape (RDL + Biofuel) be linked to the afforestation/reforestation component of the Clean Development Mechanism. Both biofuel production options would be limited to the cultivation of woody perennial biofuel species on low biomass landscapes in order to maximize the carbon benefits of the proposed policy model. The potential to conserve forest, avoid GHG emissions, improve carbon sequestration, and produce renewable energy are evaluated by an illustrative model for five case studies (Para - Brazil, East Kalimantan - Indonesia, Madagascar, Colombia and Liberia). The Biofuel + FC policy model is then compared with three counterfactual scenarios: REDO Alone with no biofuel cultivation; Biofuel Alone with expanded biofuel cultivation in the absence of REDD and a Most Likely scenario where REDD and biofuel cultivation are implemented without explicit regulatory linkages. The proposed policy model would leverage forest carbon with biofuel markets, which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and conserve biodiversity, as well as improve human welfare in developing countries, a win-win-win strategy for sustainable development.

TI  - Monitoring early-successional trees for tropical forest restoration using low-cost UAV-based species classification
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Logged forests cover four million square kilometers of the tropics, capturing carbon more rapidly than temperate forests and harboring rich biodiversity. Restoring these forests is essential to help avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Yet monitoring tropical forest recovery is challenging. We track the abundance of early-successional species in a forest restoration concession in Indonesia. If the species are carefully chosen, they can be used as an indicator of restoration progress. We present SLIC-UAV, a new pipeline for processing Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery using simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC)to map early-successional species in tropical forests. The pipeline comprises: (a) a field verified approach for manually labeling species; (b) automatic segmentation of imagery into "superpixels" and (c) machine learning classification of species based on both spectral and textural features. Creating superpixels massively reduces the dataset's dimensionality and enables the use of textural features, which improve classification accuracy. In addition, this approach is flexible with regards to the spatial distribution of training data. This allowed us to be flexible in the field and collect high-quality training data with the help of local experts. The accuracy ranged from 74.3% for a four-species classification task to 91.7% when focusing only on the key early-succesional species. We then extended these models across 100 hectares of forest, mapping species dominance and forest condition across the entire restoration project.

TI  - Harnessing Biomass and Blue Carbon Potential: Estimating Carbon Stocks in the Vital Wetlands of Eastern Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming is a critical factor driving climate change, impacting every aspect of life on Earth. The escalating concentration of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, the primary contributor to global warming, necessitates immediate action through effective climate mitigation strategies. This study aimed to quantify the biomass and blue carbon stocks in the eastern coastal mangrove forests of North Sumatra and Aceh Provinces in Indonesia, focusing on key sites in Langkat, Deli Serdang, Batu Bara, Tanjung Balai, and Aceh Tamiang Regencies. We measured carbon stock in three carbon pools: biomass (above and below ground), necromass, and soil. By analyzing tree stands using parameters such as tree height and diameter at breast height within circular plots (7 m in radius, 125 m apart), we gathered fundamental data on forest structure, species composition, and above- and below-ground biomass. Additionally, we collected soil samples at various points and depths, measuring the amount of wood, stems, or branches (necromass) that fell to or died on the forest floor. Data were collected in plots along a line transect, comprising three transects and six circular plots each. Sixteen diverse mangrove species were found, demonstrating rich mangrove biodiversity. The mangrove forests in the five regencies exhibited significant carbon storage potential, with estimated average above-ground carbon ranging from 96 to 356 MgC/ha and average below-ground carbon from 28 to 153 MgC/ha. The estimated average deadwood carbon varied between 50 and 91 MgC/ha, while soil carbon ranged from 1200 to 2500 MgC/ha. These findings underscore the significant carbon storage potential of these mangrove forests, highlighting their importance to global carbon cycling and climate change mitigation. This research contributes to a broader understanding of mangroves as vital blue carbon ecosystems, emphasizing the necessity of conservation efforts such as forest restoration and rehabilitation to enhance their role in stabilizing coastal areas and improving global climate resilience.

TI  - Beyond trees: Mapping total aboveground biomass density in the Brazilian savanna using high-density UAV-lidar data
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical savanna ecosystems play a major role in the seasonality of the global carbon cycle. However, their ability to store and sequester carbon is uncertain due to combined and intermingling effects of anthropogenic activities and climate change, which impact wildfire regimes and vegetation dynamics. Accurate measurements of tropical savanna vegetation aboveground biomass (AGB) over broad spatial scales are crucial to achieve effective carbon emission mitigation strategies. UAV-lidar is a new remote sensing technology that can enable rapid 3-D mapping of structure and related AGB in tropical savanna ecosystems. This study aimed to assess the capability of high-density UAV-lidar to estimate and map total (tree, shrubs, and surface layers) aboveground biomass density (AGBt) in the Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado). Five ordinary least square regression models estimating AGBt were adjusted using 50 field sample plots (30 m x 30 m). The best model was selected under Akaike Information Criterion, adjusted coefficient of determination (adj.R-2), absolute and relative mot mean square error (RMSE), and used to map AGBt from UAV-lidar data collected over 1,854 ha spanning the three major vegetation formations (forest, savanna, and grassland) in Cerrado. The model using vegetation height and cover was the most effective, with an overall model adj-R-2 of 0.79 and a leave-one-out cross-validated RMSE of 19.11 Mg/ha (33.40%). The uncertainty and errors of our estimations were assessed for each vegetation formation separately, resulting in RMSEs of 27.08 Mg/ha (25.99%) for forests, 17.76 Mg/ha (43.96%) for savannas, and 7.72 Mg/ha (44.92%) for grasslands. These results prove the feasibility and potential of the UAV-lidar technology in Cerrado but also emphasize the need for further developing the estimation of biomass in grasslands, of high importance in the characterization of the global carbon balance and for supporting integrated fire management activities in tropical savanna ecosystems. Our results serve as a benchmark for future studies aiming to generate accurate biomass maps and provide baseline data for efficient management of fire and predicted climate change impacts on tropical savanna ecosystems.

TI  - Oil palm deserves government attention in Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Englund et al (2015 Environ. Res. Lett. 10 044002) have recently analyzed biodiesel production from oil palm plantations as one possible way to mitigate climate change while providing cost effective results. They show that data for detailed quantification of biological carbon sequestration is available allowing a high confidence evaluation of positive impacts when oil palm plantation for food and biodiesel production is carried out in degraded, cultivated soil, and also with some varieties of natural vegetation in the Amazon. Nevertheless, economic risk associated with the future price of fossil fuels and uncertainties related with carbon subsidy are barriers. Here we discuss the assumptions under which such controversial proposal is based and suggest further analysis for Brazilian decision makers.

TI  - Opportunities for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in tropical peatlands
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The upcoming global mechanism for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries should include and prioritize tropical peatlands. Forested tropical peatlands in Southeast Asia are rapidly being converted into production systems by introducing perennial crops for lucrative agribusiness, such as oil-palm and pulpwood plantations, causing large greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines for GHG Inventory on Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Uses provide an adequate framework for emissions inventories in these ecosystems; however, specific emission factors are needed for more accurate and cost-effective monitoring. The emissions are governed by complex biophysical processes, such as peat decomposition and compaction, nutrient availability, soil water content, and water table level, all of which are affected by management practices. We estimate that total carbon loss from converting peat swamp forests into oil palm is 59.4 +/- 10.2 Mg of CO2 per hectare per year during the first 25 y after land-use cover change, of which 61.6% arise from the peat. Of the total amount (1,486 +/- 183 Mg of CO2 per hectare over 25 y), 25% are released immediately from land-clearing fire. In order to maintain high palm-oil production, nitrogen inputs through fertilizer are needed and the magnitude of the resulting increased N2O emissions compared to CO2 losses remains unclear.

TI  - Hydrocarbon and elemental carbon signatures in a tropical wetland: Biogeochemical evidence of forest fire and vegetation changes
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Evidence of changing vegetation in the tropical wetland (Rawa Danau, west Java, Indonesia) over the past 7428 years is illustrated by elemental (soot) carbon (EC) and n-alkane composition of sedimentary geolipids. In this study, vegetation changes and relevant controlling factors (e.g. forest fire and climate change) were documented on a decadal to centennial scale. The n-alkane composition that changes with depth might record changes in sources of organic matter (OM) in the wetland. The presence of EC (0.01-0.24% of organic carbon: OC) during late (0-1700 cal. year BP) and mid (3500-4500 cal. year BP) Holocene (at depths 0-50 cm, and 160-210 cm) indicated that large-scale forest fires severely affected the tropical vegetation. The hydrocarbon indices (CPI: carbon preference index, MCN: mean carbon number, and HVI: hydrocarbon vegetation index) significantly correlated with one another while a comparison of EC profile with the profiles of hydrocarbon indices indicated that n-alkane composition of the geolipid in lake sediment could record signatures of changes in catchment vegetation. Forest fire and vegetation changes might be related to regional climatic shifts relating to ENSO activity as well as being influenced by human influences. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Indonesian peat swamp forest ecosystems provide various environmental services, which are important locally, nationally, and globally. However, due to increasing land scarcity, the pressure to utilize them for agriculture is increasing. This chapter focuses on a case study in Riau and West Kalimantan to discuss the socioeconomic and environmental values of peatland through examples of financial analysis and economic valuation and discussion based on fieldwork data. It shows that the opportunity cost of CO2 emission reductions by conserving peat swamp forests from conversion to oil palm plantation ranged from USD $3.7 to 8.25/t CO(2)e, which is far higher than the current registered emission reduction compensation price. Opportunity costs are higher than the carbon market price, and a carbon market is not available currently, especially for peat forest conservation. This chapter clarifies what models are viable taking the case study as a point of departure and calls for urgent development strategies to establish viable compensation alternatives to landholders beyond the carbon market. Peat conservation measures imply high opportunity costs, however indigenous and adaptive plants show economic promise to help further develop markets, paludiculture techniques, and management options to rewet peatlands.

TI  - Planning for conservation and restoration under climate and land use change in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - AimTo propose and compare priority sites for conservation and restoration of woody plants under diverse climate and land use scenarios, considering socio-economic costs, presence of protected areas and distribution of forest remnants.LocationThe Atlantic Forest Biodiversity Hotspot, Brazil.MethodsWe used ecological niche modelling to estimate geographical distributions for 2,255 species under current and future climate scenarios, which we analysed in relation to spatially explicit land use projections, maps of forest remnants derived from remote sensing and socio-economic variables for each municipality within the Atlantic Forest region. We identified spatial priorities that complement the current network of protected areas under three different prioritization scenarios: (1) conservation of existing forest remnants only; (2) conservation of remnants followed by restoration of degraded habitat; and (3) unconstrained actions, in which management location is not defined a priori. We compared our results under different levels of land protection, with targets of 10%, 17% and 20% of the Atlantic Forest extent.ResultsCurrent forest remnants cover only 12% of the Atlantic Forest, so targets of 17% and 20% were achieved only through active restoration. Targets of 17% and 20% captured most species and represented on average 26%-34% of species' distributions. The spatial pattern of degraded habitats negatively affected representation of biodiversity and implied higher costs and reduced efficiency of planning. We did not observe major differences between conservation prioritizations based on contrasting climate change scenarios.Main conclusionsProtection of forest remnants alone will not suffice to safeguard woody plant species under climate and land use changes; therefore, restoration actions are urgently needed in the Atlantic Forest. With integrated management actions and multicriterion nationwide planning, reaching the 17% of land protection of Aichi biodiversity targets will constitute an important step towards protecting Atlantic Forest biodiversity.

TI  - Alignment of tree phenology and climate seasonality influences the runoff response to forest cover loss
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Trees shape the critical zone and modulate terrestrial water storage yet observed streamflow responses to forest cover change vary. Differences in catchment area, soil water storage, management practices, tree species, and climate are among the many explanations proposed for heterogeneous hydrologic responses. We addressed evidence for the hypothesis that mean annual temperature (MAT) and the phase shift between precipitation and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) peaks,, explain a significant amount of the variation in hydrologic response to forest cover loss. We selected 50 catchments with daily streamflow records spanning eight nations and seven climate regions. Categorical clustering of catchments was performed with MAT, , minimum EVI, catchment area, and percentage forest loss. Similar storm event runoff ratio responses to deforestation were best clustered by MAT and. High MAT tropical monsoonal catchments (Brazil, Myanmar, and Liberia) exhibited minimal evidence of increasing runoff ratios (increases observed in 9% of catchments). Low MAT subarctic, cold semi-arid, and humid continental catchments (US, Canada, and Estonia) showed consistent runoff increases around the time of snowmelt (94%). The deforestation runoff responses of temperate and subtropical catchments with Mediterranean, humid, and oceanic climates depended strongly on. We observe increased runoff following forest loss in a majority of catchments (90%) where precipitation peaks followed peak growing season (max EVI) (US). In contrast, where precipitation peaks preceded the growing season (South Africa and Australia) there was less evidence of increased runoff (25% of catchments). This research supports the strategic implementation of native forest conservation or restoration for simultaneously mitigating the effects of global climate change and regional or local surface runoff.

TI  - Synergies among climate change and biodiversity conservation measures and policies in the forest sector: A case study of Southeast Asian countries
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest conservation contributes to climate change mitigation, adaptation, and biodiversity/ecosystem conservation. To enhance the co-benefits of forest conservation, it is important to promote synergies among the three measures mitigation, adaptation, and biodiversity/ecosystem conservation in the forest sector and eliminate the overlaps among the three measures. However, limited research exists on the analysis of their synergies. This study explores the potential for synergy among the three forest sector measures, utilizing: 1) indicators that assess enabling conditions for synergies among the three measures at the different institutional levels of policies and strategies, institutional arrangements, and financing and programs/projects; and 2) case studies of five countries in Southeast Asia: Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Lao PDR, and Cambodia.This analysis shows that the five countries all require various changes at different institutional levels in order to enhance their synergy potentials. The findings indicate the importance of national actors, financial mechanisms, programs, and projects in addressing the three measures. In terms of national actors, Thailand has the highest synergy potential due to its national-level committees and a single ministry that addresses all three measures. To enhance their synergy potentials, the other countries need to create national-level committees that address the three measures, and/or they need to enhance collaboration between the various ministries that represent the environment and forestry issues. At the financing and program/project aspects, Vietnam has the highest synergy potential. The other four countries need to develop common national funds that finance the three measures and/or develop joint programs and projects that address the three measures simultaneously.

TI  - Modeling soil organic matter changes under crop diversification strategies and climate change scenarios in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In Brazil, land conversion and agricultural management have historically accounted for the largest share of the country's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with the Cerrado region being one of the most affected areas. Although cropping diversification has been proposed as a potential strategy to mitigate GHG emissions through soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration, the long-term effects of these systems in the Cerrado are unknown. The DayCent model was used to simulate the impact of crop diversification and tillage on SOC dynamics until 2070 ( 50 years), including common crop succession systems and crop rotations associated with cover crops under climate change scenarios. First, we calibrated and evaluated the DayCent model using plant and soil observations from three sites in the region, where Pearson coefficients (r values) ranged from 0.50 to 0.94 (calibration sites) and 0.53-0.99 (validation site) for crop yields, SOC, and nitrogen. We then used the model to investigate how cropping systems and climate interact to control SOC levels. Results indicate that SOC stocks would decrease under the long-term (50 years) soybean-cotton succession, regardless of soil management (-0.04 to -0.17 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)). Crop diversification with crop rotation and cover crops (i.e., millet, ruzigrass, sunn hemp) had the highest SOC accrual potential ( 0.71 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)), resulting in SOC stocks of up to 130 Mg C ha(-1) by 2070. Ruzigrass, either single or intercropped with maize on crop succession systems, showed substantial potential for SOC sequestration ( 0.55 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) and could be a viable strategy if implementing more complex rotations is not feasible. The SSP2 - 4.5 and SSP5 - 8.5 climate change scenarios increased SOC stocks by 6.3 and 8.2% in SOC across treatments by 2070, respectively. Results suggest that diversified cropping systems are a promising strategy for increasing SOC sequestration, and they offer valuable guidance for enhancing current management practices in the region.

TI  - I See Fire Inside the Wetlands: Return Interval and Extent on Protected Areas of Pantanal Ecoregion
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooded grasslands and savannas have a long history of seasonal fires. However, recurrent drought events are becoming floodplains more susceptible to human-induced fires. Therefore, we studied the fire regime in six Protected Areas (PA) for Integral Protection of the Pantanal ecoregion. Specifically, we assessed the burned area (occasionally and frequently), the fire extent, and fire seasonality within the PAs between 2004 and 2022. In addition, we established a 10 km buffer from each PA limit to compare landscape trends inside and outside PAs. One-third of fires within the Pantanal PAs occurred in wetlands. Around 10% of the protected area had a fire return interval of less than two years. Most of the PAs burned between July and October. The fire in the buffer zone explained 64% of the variability in the burned area inside PAs. While burned forest cover did not differ between PAs and buffer zones, the burned area in the remaining covers (savanna, grassland, and wetland) was small inside PAs. Our findings highlight the need to focus on the fire management of neighboring private areas in a more preventive way. In addition, Pantanal requires long-term perspectives on wildfires and recurrent burnings in the dry season. With the increasing human pressure on floodplains, translating research into management guidelines is urgently needed.

TI  - Effects of shade trees on robusta coffee growth, yield and quality. A meta-analysis
T2  - AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Productivity of coffee plantations is threatened by both climate change and decreasing revenues of coffee growers. Using shade trees might protect against temperature variability, erosion and excessive radiation but there may be trade-offs in productivity and quality. While impacts of shade trees on arabica (Coffea arabica) have been reviewed, a global synthesis on robusta (Coffea canephora) coffee is lacking. We assessed how shade affects robusta growth and productivity, and what are the interactions and trade-offs. We conducted a systematic literature search in Web of Science and CAB s on 16 December 2019. Thirty papers fulfilled our inclusion criteria of being experimental studies on the impact of overstory trees with approximately half being from Brazil or India. Shade improved robusta tree growth and yield with some contrasting effects on physicochemical and biochemical properties. Shade (> 30%) was associated with reduced beverage quality. Significant interactions between shade and location, rainfall level and robusta clone were found. Among the clones tested, 06V, C153, LB1, GG229 and JM2 showed a higher productivity and growth (from + 17 to + 280%) under moderate shade (41-65%). This is the first meta-analysis of the effects of shade on robusta coffee. By synthesizing data from different studies, we highlight for the first time that the effect of shade on robusta coffee depends on tree age. Shade had positive impacts on older robusta trees (mean of 16 years), while the impact of shade on younger trees was either insignificant or negative. We highlight the importance of both clone type and tree ages. Research gaps included a lack of knowledge on the effects of shade with respect to coffee and shade tree age as well as interactive effects. More in-depth studies are needed to understand the mechanisms of how shade trees affect robusta coffee.

TI  - The Interplay Between Carbon Storage, Productivity, and Native Tree Density of Agroforestry Systems
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry has been widely suggested as a tool for storing carbon while also providing other ecosystem services like food and income production. A greater understanding of how carbon storage in agroforestry systems varies, and particularly how it is intertwined with the productivity of these systems, could enable farmers and policymakers to make changes that simultaneously increase carbon storage and alleviate poverty. In this study, we used allometric equations to evaluate the carbon storage in the biomass of two complex agroforestry systems in Bali, Indonesia-rustic where a native tree canopy is still present, and polyculture where all native trees have been removed, and the canopy consists only of cropping trees. We then compared these figures to that of a nearby primary forest and linked carbon storage to productivity for both agroforestry systems. We found that the primary forest (277.96 +/- 149.05 Mg C ha-1) stored significantly more carbon than either the rustic (144.72 +/- 188.14 Mg C ha-1) or polyculture (105.12 +/- 48.65 Mg C ha-1) agroforestry systems, which were not significantly different from each other. We found productivity and carbon storage to be significantly positively correlated with each other within the polyculture system but not within the rustic system. We also found that for the rustic system, an increase in the density of native trees is accompanied by an increase in carbon storage, but no significant change in productivity. Consequently, we conclude that within the rustic system, carbon storage can be increased or maintained at a high value by the preservation and encouragement of large native trees, and that this need not necessarily result in a decrease in productivity.

TI  - Protected-area planning in the Brazilian Amazon should prioritize additionality and permanence, not leakage mitigation
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The establishment of protected areas (PAs) where human land uses are restricted, especially in Amazonian forests, is an important bulwark against global biodiversity collapse and climate change. Here we assess if restriction of land clearing within Amazonian PAs displaces deforestation pressure to adjacent forests, a spillover effect called leakage, or if it further inhibits deforestation around PAs, a spillover effect called blockage. Leakage can undermine the net impact achieved by PA establishment. We calculated the non-target and target impacts of 91 state-governed (non-indigenous) PAs established between 2005 and 2016 on satellite monitored deforestation rates. We then assessed how well the features of PM, like size and restriction level, explain the spillovers. On average, 2% or less of the assessed spillover zone was deforested more extensively (leakage) or less extensively (blockage) than the area expected to have been deforested without nearby PA establishment. Blockages outnumbered leakages regardless of the method adopted to calculate the deforestation baseline rate. Our results suggest the establishment of PM has inhibited deforestation both within their boundaries and in their adjacent surroundings. The 17 PAs that did not inhibit deforestation within their boundaries and the 19 PAs where leakage occurred were geographically concentrated in southern and western protected regions of Amazonia Legal. High-magnitude leakage of deforestation pressure from PM to their adjacent surroundings seems therefore to be rare in the Brazilian Amazon. For the most effective conservation of Amazonian forests, priority should be given to achieving additionality with any new PA and ensuring the permanence and enforcement of those already established.

TI  - Assessing Genetic Diversity after Mangrove Restoration in Brazil: Why Is It So Important?
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Vital for many marine and terrestrial species, and several other environmental services, such as carbon sink areas, the mangrove ecosystem is highly threatened due to the proximity of large urban centers and climate change. The forced fragmentation of this ecosystem affects the genetic diversity distribution among natural populations. Moreover, while restoration efforts have increased, few studies have analyzed how recently-planted areas impact the original mangrove genetic diversity. We analyzed the genetic diversity of two mangroves species (Laguncularia racemosa and Avicennia schaueriana) in three areas in Brazil, using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Using the local approach, we identified the genetic diversity pool of a restored area compared to nearby areas, including the remnant plants inside the restored area, one well-conserved population at the shore of Guanabara Bay, and one impacted population in Araca Bay. The results for L. racemosa showed that the introduced population has lost genetic diversity by drift, but remnant plants with high genetic diversity or incoming propagules could help improve overall genetic diversity. Avicennia schaueriana showed similar genetic diversity, indicating an efficient gene flow. The principal component analysis showing different connections between both species indicate differences in gene flow and dispersal efficiencies, highlighting the needed for further studies. Our results emphasize that genetic diversity knowledge and monitoring associated with restoration actions can help avoid bottlenecks and other pitfalls, especially for the mangrove ecosystem.

TI  - Mercury critical concentrations to Enchytraeus crypticus (Annelida: Oligochaeta) under normal and extreme conditions of moisture in tropical soils Reproduction and survival
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil provides many ecosystem services that are essential to maintain its quality and healthy development of the flora, fauna and human well-being. Environmental mercury levels may harm the survival and diversity of the soil fauna. In this respect, efforts have been made to establish limit values of mercury (Hg) in soils to terrestrial fauna. Soil organisms such as earthworms and enchytraeids have intimate contact with trace metals in soil by their oral and dermal routes, reflecting the potentially adverse effects of this contaminant. The main goal of this study was to obtain Hg critical concentrations under normal and extreme conditions of moisture in tropical soils to Enchytraeus crypticus to order to assess if climate change may potentiate their acute and chronic toxicity effects. Tropical soils were sampled from of two Forest Conservation Units of the Rio de Janeiro State - Brazil, which has been contaminated by Hg atmospheric depositions. Worms were exposed to three moisture conditions, at 20%, 50% and 80% of water holding capacity, respectively, and in combination with different Hg (HgC12) concentrations spiked in three types of tropical soil (two natural soils and one artificial soil). The tested concentrations ranged from 0 to 512 mg Hg kg(-1) dry weight. Results indicate that the Hg toxicity is higher under increased conditions of moisture, significantly affecting survival and reproduction rate.

TI  - Amazon forest maintenance as a source of environmental services
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazonian forest produces environmental services such as maintenance of biodiversity, water cycling and carbon stocks. These services have a much greater value to human society than do the timber, beef and other products that are obtained by destroying the forest. Yet institutional mechanisms are still lacking to transform the value of the standing forest into the foundation of an economy based on maintaining rather than destroying this ecosystem. Forest management for commodities such as timber and non-timber forest products faces severe limitations and inherent contradictions unless income is supplemented based on environmental services. Amazon forest is threatened by deforestation, logging, forest fires and climate change. Measures to avoid deforestation include repression through command and control, creation of protected areas, and reformulation of infrastructure decisions and development policies. An economy primarily based on the value of environmental services is essential for long-term maintenance of the forest. Much progress has been made in the decades since I first proposed such a transition, but many issues also remain unresolved. These include theoretical issues regarding accounting procedures, improved quantification of the services and of the benefits of different policy options, and effective uses of the funds generated in ways that maintain both the forest and the human population.

AB  - Land use change in the Bangsri sub-catchment of the Brantas basin in East Java during the past three decades has increased both local and global climate vulnerability, by degrading soils and contributing to net greenhouse gas emissions, respectively. Our study aimed to estimate land use change and its impact on net carbon emissions, as well as to formulate strategies for adaptation to and mitigation of climate change downstream of a National park. We analyzed land cover changes from satellite imagery and measured carbon stocks in biomass, necromass and soil (0 to 30 cm) pools. Satellite imagery of land cover in 1994, 2001, 2011 and 2017 showed a decrease in natural forest area and an increase in the area of shrubs, agroforestry, production forests and annual crop land. Net CO2 emission increased from 2.4 to 6.4 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) in the periods 2001 to 2011 and 2011 to 2017, respectively. Sand mining is the most destructive land use pattern in the area, as it leaves soil profiles stripped of their topsoil. Vulnerability to less reliable rainfall has been addressed by the common creation of small reservoirs and the abundant use of irrigation for vegetables growing under partial shade in the agroforestry zone.

TI  - Monitoring the effect of restoration measures in Indonesian peatlands by radar satellite imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of the ongoing climate change discussions the importance of peatlands as carbon stores is increasingly recognised in the public. Drainage, deforestation and peat fires are the main reasons for the release of huge amounts of carbon from peatlands. Successful restoration of degraded tropical peatlands is of high interest due to their huge carbon store and sequestration potential. The blocking of drainage canals by dam building has become one of the most important measures to restore the hydrology and the ecological function of the peat domes. This study investigates the capability of using multitemporal radar remote sensing imagery for monitoring the hydrological effects of these measures. The study area is the former Mega Rice Project area in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, where peat drainage and forest degradation is especially intense. Restoration measures started in July 2004 by building 30 large dams until June 2008. We applied change detection analysis with more than 80 ENVISAT ASAR and ALOS PALSAR images, acquired between 2004 and 2009. Radar signal increases of up to 1.36 dB show that high frequency multitemporal radar satellite imagery can be used to detect an increase in peat soil moisture after dam construction, especially in deforested areas with a high density of dams. Furthermore, a strong correlation between cross-polarised radar backscatter coefficients and groundwater levels above -50 cm was found. Monitoring peatland rewetting and quantifying groundwater level variations is important information for vegetation re-establishment, fire hazard warning and making carbon emission mitigation tradable under the voluntary carbon market or REDO (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) mechanism.

TI  - Net greenhouse gas balance of fibre wood plantation on peat in Indonesia
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatlands cycle and store large amounts of carbon in their soil and biomass(1-5). Climate and land-use change alters greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes of tropical peatlands, but the magnitude of these changes remains highly uncertain(6-19). Here we measure net ecosystem exchanges of carbon dioxide, methane and soil nitrous oxide fluxes between October 2016 and May 2022 from Acacia crassicarpa plantation, degraded forest and intact forest within the same peat landscape, representing land-cover-change trajectories in Sumatra, Indonesia. This allows us to present a full plantation rotation GHG flux balance in a fibre wood plantation on peatland. We find that the Acacia plantation has lower GHG emissions than the degraded site with a similar average groundwater level (GWL), despite more intensive land use. The GHG emissions from the Acacia plantation over a full plantation rotation (35.2 +/- 4.7 tCO(2)-eq ha(-1) year(-1), average +/- standard deviation) were around two times higher than those from the intact forest (20.3 +/- 3.7 tCO(2)-eq ha(-1) year(-1)), but only half of the current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 1 emission factor (EF)(20) for this land use. Our results can help to reduce the uncertainty in GHG emissions estimates, provide an estimate of the impact of land-use change on tropical peat and develop science-based peatland management practices as nature-based climate solutions.

TI  - Local stakeholders' assessment of community-based forest management and the implications for REDD Plus implementation in the Philippines
T2  - ASIA LIFE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Philippines is one of the pioneers to adopt participatory approach in forest management, as embodied in. its national strategy for sustainable forest management and social justice in the uplands, called Community-Based Forest Management (CBFM). The program's almost three decades of implementation saw positive impacts on the livelihood assets of local communities. CBFM has evolved to tackle global concerns as well, such as climate change and biodiversity conservation. Meanwhile, international climate change negotiations have drawn a means to provide financial incentives to reduce deforestation and forest degradation through Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in developing countries (REDD Plus). This mechanism hopes to bring "triple benefits", namely: emission reduction, biodiversity conservation and poverty alleviation. Given their parallel goals, CBFM sites are promising candidates for implementing REDD Plus, and the latter is expected to have important implications on the process and potential outcomes of CBFM. This paper looks into the local stakeholders' assessment of the impacts of CBFM on the livelihood assets of local communities and the potentials of REDD Plus implementation in the future. The literature is replete with examples emphasizing the importance of local stakeholder's participation in REDD Plus, yet their perception particularly on the added value it gives remained unclear. Results of the study revealed that CBFM implementation contributed largely to building the capital assets of people organization (PO) members, especially the human, social, natural and physical capitals. Full positive effects have yet to be realized though for the financial capital. PO members and the local institutions (DENR, LGU, NGO) expressed optimism, though with varied levels, on REDD Plus further enhancing the above capital assets. This optimism, however, does not translate to confidence in achieving the triple-benefits, as risks are also perceived by PO members posed by the likely creation of forest enclosures that could limit areas for livelihood activities. If realized, improved economic conditions could also encourage in-migration that would increase pressure to the forests. Caution should therefore be exercised in implementing REDD Plus to ensure that the intended goals are achieved in the context of views and aspirations of local stakeholders.

TI  - What, when, who and how? A review of peatland research in Amazonia
T2  - MIRES AND PEAT
M3  - Review
AB  - Amazonia is believed to harbour the world's most extensive tropical peatlands, storing significant amounts of carbon and having high value for biodiversity conservation, climate regulation and human welfare. However, a comprehensive assessment is hampered by fragmentary knowledge of the locations of peat -covered areas and this, in turn, prevents their protection and restoration in the face of ongoing anthropogenic destruction. The study reported here reviewed research activities on peatlands in Amazonia, which started with ecological studies in the 1950s. We found a broad and significant thematic increase since 2009, with growing focus first on carbon accumulation and greenhouse gas fluxes then, after 2017, on degradation and conservation, along with a spatial imbalance in favour of the Peruvian lowlands. Hitherto, very little scientific attention has been directed towards the peatlands of western Brazil, the Bolivian lowlands and the Guianas. Most research in Amazonia has been conducted by international institutions with, in recent times, increasing contributions from local institutes and research groups. Nevertheless, research on Amazonian peatlands is still in its early stages, and several scientific questions remain unanswered. Advancing the knowledge base with respect to various scientific disciplines (e.g., ecology, biology, geography, social sciences and economics) is, therefore, essential for understanding how and where peatlands developed, how they are used, which ecosystem services they provide, how climate change will affect them and, finally, what would be the most appropriate conservation, restoration and sustainable use strategies for safeguarding the wellbeing of both peatlands and people.

T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to identify the capacity of intact forests to maintain Above Ground Biomass (AGB) under new climate conditions. Using a predictive approach under different climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5), and considering the mean of General Circulation Models (GCMs) for the period (2021-2040), it was revealed that the regions with the greatest capacity for AGB in the optimistic scenario are concentrated in the northwest and southeast regions, covering the basins of the Negro, Xingu and Tapajo<acute accent>s rivers. In the SSP5-8.5 scenario, although potential AGB gains are concentrated in the same regions, the spatial distribution is more restricted and dispersed. Indigenous Landsemerge as areas with the greatest potential AGB gains in both climate scenarios. However, these predictions do not include the impact of extreme climate events, such as storms, severe droughts, and wildfires, which could lead to an underestimation of actual biomass variations.

TI  - Contribution of agroforests to landscape carbon storage
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - While many studies have measured the carbon (C) stocks of traditional agroforests at the plot level, their contribution to overall landscape C storage has rarely been quantified. Here we demonstrate the significant contribution that traditional agroforests with shaded tree crops can make to landscape C storage, and thus climate change mitigation, focusing on the cocoa (Theobroma cacao) agroforests (locally known as cabrucas) of southern Bahia, Brazil. Using published allometric relationships and tree inventories of 55 shaded cocoa farms, 6 mature forests, 8 disturbed forests and 7 fallows, we calculate average aboveground C stocks of 87 and 46 Mg ha(-1) in traditional and intensified cocoa agroforests, respectively, 183 Mg ha(-1) in old-growth forests, 102 Mg ha(-1) in disturbed forests and 33 Mg ha(-1) in fallows. Based on the most recent land cover data available, we estimate that cocoa agroforests hold 59 % of the total aboveground C stocks of the tree dominated vegetation in this landscape, while forests hold 32 % and fallows hold 9 %. Carbon stocks of intensified cocoa agroforestry systems were only little over one-half of those of traditional agroforests, indicating a threat to landscape C stocks from current land use trends. We show that in agroforests as in natural forests, C stocks are highly concentrated in the largest trees. This suggests that the intensification of traditional agroforests, which generally involves increasing the density of cocoa and other tree crops and reducing the density of shade trees, is possible without greatly affecting their C storage if large trees are conserved. In order to conserve the climate stabilizing effect of traditional agroforests and steer necessary intensification measures towards climate-friendly solutions, we suggest that biodiversity and C-rich traditional agroforests should be included in current discussions about Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) and/or their owners be rewarded for their environmental services through other incentive mechanisms.

TI  - Multiple traps of scientific knowledge transfer: Comparative case studies based on the RIU model from Vietnam, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, and Sweden
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The transfer of scientific knowledge has received great attention by scientists and policymakers especially in fields that are crucially dependent on scientific knowledge like biodiversity conservation or climate change. Although many efforts have been made to better understand how scientific expertise can have an impact on politics, few studies have investigated the influence of limiting factors on scientific knowledge transfer. In this paper, we use a meta-analysis of 13 existing individual case studies from 5 different countries that all have in common that they apply the Research-Integration-Utilization model (the RIU model) to analyze limits of scientific knowledge transfer within research, integration, and utilization. Our results show that the factors of research, integration, and utilization are independent from each other in limiting or increasing the transfer of scientific knowledge. The independence of the RIU's factors also reveals that the increase of scientific knowledge alone will not lead to an improvement in knowledge transfer. There is empirical evidence in our cases providing that utilization could also be possible without a strong scientific basis, and successful integration could be based on weak scientific grounds. As a result of the independence of the different factors the RIU model consists of, the traps of scientific knowledge transfer could be observed in one or multiple RIU's factors and therefore improvements in scientific knowledge transfer should be orientated toward solely one or multiple factors instead of the whole process. We recommend that single improvements of different individual factors (research, integration, utilization) can help to improve the whole process of scientific knowledge transfer.

AB  - Tumih / Parepat (Combretocarpus-rotundatus Mig. Deneer) of the family Anisophylleaceae and Meranti (Shorea Belangerang, ShoreaTeysmanniana Dyer ex. Brandis) of Dipterocarpaceae are groups of species of vegetation that is modeled for the designation of its spread. Pioneer species are predicted as an indicator of ecosystem restoration succession of wet tropical peatland characteristic (unique) and very susceptible (fragile) in an endemic Sundaland hotspot. Projected climate change and conservation planning a topic of heated discussion, the analysis of alternative approaches and the development of a combination of search algorithm projection models within the fabric of the diffusion of the species to attain this through a geospatial information system technology. Model approach used to work out problems in research on this vegetation species level based machine learning is a method (hybrid), which is a combination of wavelet and neural network. Often the approach to field data into general use in the management of natural resources and biodiversity assessment. Expression of the hybrid models provides encouraging results, to decide the classification of the species Tumih / Parepat and Meranti through mapping of vegetation species that are backed up by the pattern of the spectral curve of the field spectrometer.

We present a new estimate that employs recommended good practices to quantify gross tropical forest aboveground carbon (AGC) loss from 2000 to 2012 through the integration of Landsat-derived tree canopy cover, height, intactness and forest cover loss and GLAS-lidar derived forest biomass. An unbiased estimate of forest loss area is produced using a stratified random sample with strata derived from a wall-to-wall 30 m forest cover loss map. Our sample-based results separate the gross loss of forest AGC into losses from natural forests (0.59 PgC yr(-1)) and losses from managed forests (0.43 PgC yr(-1)) including plantations, agroforestry systems and subsistence agriculture. Latin America accounts for 43% of gross AGC loss and 54% of natural forest AGC loss, with Brazil experiencing the highest AGC loss for both categories at national scales. We estimate gross tropical forest AGC loss and natural forest loss to account for 11% and6% of global year 2012 CO2 emissions, respectively. Given recent trends, natural forests will likely constitute an increasingly smaller proportion of tropical forest GHG emissions and of global emissions as fossil fuel consumption increases, with implications for the valuation of co-benefits in tropical forest conservation.

TI  - Occurrence of fire foci under different land uses in the State of Amazonas during the 2005 drought
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work is to evaluate the occurrence of fire foci during the severe drought that occurred in 2005 in the State of Amazonas. The study was conducted in the State of Amazonas, which is inserted in the northern region of Brazil. The main types of vegetation are Igapo Forest, Varzea Forest and Terra Firme Forest. Kernel density was used to spatialize fire foci to quantify them in seven classes of land use and cover (forest, pasture, exposed soil, urban area, pastoral agroforestry system, agroforestry system and agriculture). Through the regression analysis, the relation among the number of fire foci and four meteorological variables was obtained: rainfall, evapotranspiration, relative humidity and average air temperature. Forest and pasture classes were those with the highest number of fire foci corresponding, respectively, to 58 and 37% of the total number of foci. This can be explained by the greater representativeness of these classes in the State and by the high degree of soil exposure in the case of pasture. The number of fire foci was higher in the dry season, covering approximately 85% of the total fire foci. The variable that had the greatest influence on the occurrence of fire foci in the dry season was evapotranspiration. The study puts on alert the vulnerability of the State of Amazonas to the occurrence of fires and may also suggest actions to mitigate carbon emissions and biomass stock. Research like this one may provide subsidies to region's managers in an attempt to preserve forest areas and a greater controlling in priority areas considered very high.

TI  - Holocene climate change in central-eastern Brazil reconstructed using pollen and geochemical records of Pau de Fruta mire (Serra do Espinhaco Meridional, Minas Gerais)
T2  - PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies dealing with the reconstruction of Holocene climate change of tropical areas are scarce. Of these, multi-proxy investigations using peatlands are still absent. In this paper, we present the Holocene record of environmental changes in central-eastern Brazil reconstructed from a core sampled in Pau de Fruta mire (Serra do Espinhaco Meridional, Brazil). We combined palynological and geochemical analyses, supported by core stratigraphy,C-14 dating and multivariate statistics. The location of the mire is ideal because it is in an area which is directly associated with the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). Six main phases of change suggested by vegetation and local and regional landscape dynamics were described. In phase I (similar to 10,000-7360 cal. yr BP) the climate was very wet and cold and was accompanied by soil instability in the mire catchment (severe local erosion) and the 8.2 ka event was easily recognizable by a large increase in the deposition of regional dust. Phase II (similar to 7360-4200 cal. yr BP) was characterized by wet and warm conditions, catchment soil stability and enhanced deposition of regional dust. In phase III (similar to 4200-2200 cal. yr BP), climate was dry and warm and soil erosion in the catchment increased again. In phase IV (similar to 2200-1160 cal. yr BP) dry and punctuated cooling was reconstructed, together with enhanced deposition of regional dust. Phase V (similar to 1160-400 cal. yr BP) reflects sub-humid climatic conditions (like the current climate), the lowest inputs of local and regional dust and the largest accumulation of peat in the mire. While in phase VI (<similar to 400 cal. yr BP) sub-humid conditions continued but both local and regional erosion significantly increased. Our results demonstrate that the tropical peatlands of Serra do Espinhaco Meridional contain relevant records of Holocene climate changes, and that a multi-proxy approach offers good opportunities for a detailed reconstruction of palaeoenvironments.

TI  - Post-fire forest restoration in the humid tropics: A synthesis of available strategies and knowledge gaps for effective restoration
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Humid tropical forests are increasingly exposed to devastating wildfires. Major efforts are needed to prevent fire-related tipping points and to enable the effective recovery of fire-affected areas. Here, we provide a synthesis of the most common forest restoration strategies, thereby focusing on post-fire forest dynamics in the humid tropics. A variety of restoration strategies can be adopted in restoring humid tropical forests, including natural regeneration, assisted natural regeneration (i.e. fire breaks, weed control, erosion control, topsoil replacement, peatland rewetting), enrichment planting (i.e. planting nursery-raised seedlings, direct seeding) and commercial restoration ( i.e. plantation forests, agroforestry). Our analysis shows that while natural regeneration can be effective under favourable ecological conditions, humid tropical forests are often ill-adapted to fire, and therefore less likely to recover unassisted after a wildfire event. Active restoration practices may be more effective, but can be costly and challenging to implement. We also identify gaps in knowledge needed for effective restoration of humid tropical forests after fire, hereby taking into account the ecosystems and socio-economic conditions in which these fires occur. We suggest to incorporate fire severity in future studies, to better understand and predict post-fire ecosystem responses. In addition, as fire poses a recurring and intensifying threat throughout the recovery process, more emphasis should be placed on post- restoration management and the prevention of fire throughout the different phases of the restoration process. Furthermore, as tropical wildfires are increasing in scale, establishing collaborative capacity and setting priorities for efficient resource allocation should become a major priority for restoration practitioners in the humid tropics. Finally, as global fire regimes are changing and expected to intensify in the context of climate change, land use and land cover change, we suggest to put continuous effort into fire monitoring and modelling to inform the development of effective restoration strategies in the long-run.

TI  - Environmental dynamics and carbon accumulation rate of a tropical peatland in Central Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatlands are important for the global carbon cycle as they store 18% of the total global peat carbon. As they are vulnerable to changes in temperature and precipitation, a rapidly changing environment endangers peatlands and their carbon storage potential. Understanding the mechanisms of peatland carbon accumulation from studying past developments may, therefore, help to assess the future role of tropical peatlands. Using a multi-proxy palaeoecological approach, a peat core taken from the Sungai Buluh peatland in Central Sumatra has been analyzed for its pollen and spore, macro charcoal and biogeochemical composition. The result suggests that peat and C accumulation rates were driven mainly by sea level change, river water level, climatic variability and anthropogenic activities. It is also suggested that peat C accumulation in Sungai Buluh is correlated to the abundance of Freycinetia, Myrtaceae, Calophyllum, Stemonuraceae, Fiats and Euphorbiaceae. Sungai Buluh has reasonable potential for being a future global tropical peat C sinks. However, considering the impact of rapid global climate change in addition to land-use change following rapid economic growth in Indonesia, such potential may be lost. Taking advantage of available palaeoecological records and advances made in Quaternary studies, some considerations for management practice such as identification of priority taxa and conservation sites are suggested.

AB  - Crop production and environmental sustainability were threatened by environmental issues such as global warming, climate change and land degradation. Rice is a staple food of more than half of the world's population and the most important source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Rice production accounted for 36% of total emissions from agriculture. The use of organic material management in paddy fields is a potential to support sustainable agriculture. Biochar is reported to enhance soil carbon sequestration and soil productivity. This study aimed to know the effect of combined compost with biochar application on rice yields and greenhouse gas emissions in minted rice fields. The research was conducted for 3 years at research station of Indonesian Agricultural Environment Research Institute, Pati-Central Java. CH4 and N2O emissions were measured using close chamber method. We used combined compost with rice husk biochar for organic fertilizer, namely Biocompost. The results of this study indicated that the application of combined compost with biochar in each planting season improved the grain yield by 17% and reduced global warming potential (GWP) by 5% compared to conventional practice. The combined compost with biochar application in paddy fields has the opportunity as GHG mitigation efforts on rice production.

TI  - Long-term tillage and crop rotation effects on microbial biomass and C and N mineralization in a Brazilian Oxisol
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop rotation and tillage impact microbial C dynamics, which are important for sequestering C to offset global climate change and to promote sustainable crop production. Little information is available for these processes in tropical/subtropical agroecosystems, which cover vast areas of terrestrial ecosystems. Consequently, a study of crop rotation in combination with no tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) systems was conducted on an Oxisol (Typic Haplorthox) in an experiment established in 1976 at Londrina, Brazil. Soil samples were taken at 0-50, 50-100 and 100-200 mm depths in August 1997 and 1998 and evaluated for microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and mineralizable C and N. There were few differences due to crop rotation, however there were significant differences due to tillage. No tillage systems increased total C by 45%, microbial biomass by 83% and MBC:total C ratio by 23% at 0-50 mm depth over CT. C and N mineralization increased 74% with NT compared to CT systems for the 0-200 mm depth. Under NT, the metabolic quotient (CO2 evolved per unit of MBC) decreased by 32% averaged across soil depths, which suggests CT produced a microbial pool that was more metabolically active than under NT systems. These soil microbial properties were shown to be sensitive indicators of long-term tillage management under tropical conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Forest dynamics and carbon stocks in Rio Doce State Park - an Atlantic rainforest hotspot
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests are significant biodiversity epicentres and work as important modulators of climatic change. In natural cycles, carbon stocks are regulated by vegetation dynamics through the rates of mortality, recruitment and turnover. This study was conducted in five permanent monitoring plots (1 ha each: total 5 ha) in the Rio Doce State Park (RDSP), the most continuous Atlantic Forest remaining in Minas Gerais, Brazil and considered one of the world's hotspots. The aboveground biomass ranged from 201 Mg/ha in the primary forest to 92 Mg/ha in the secondary forest. The recruitment rate (1.8) was higher than the mortality rate (1.1); however, the average diameter of dead trees was higher than that of the recruited trees. Notwithstanding this result, the internal diametric increment (ingrowth) in RDSP was compensated by the biomass loss of dead trees, producing positive growth in the annual biomass and increasing their carbon stocks by 1.0 Mg C/ha/yr. Interest in conservation and management of tropical forests has intensified since the 2007 IPCC results. Thus, our study provides data that will help calibrate the use of international methodologies in local projects using data previously collected with a standardized methodology.

TI  - Effects of climate and land cover changes on water availability in a Brazilian Cerrado basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of riparian restoration and soil and water conservation practices on catchment hydrology are still unclear. Here, we assess whether a positive change in soil and water conservation practices and riparian reforestation will affect the water availability and boost resilience in a Brazilian Cerrado basin under climate change scenarios. This study was developed in the Tres Marias basin (50.600 km(2)) located in southeastern Brazil. First, we calibrated (1992-2005) and evaluated (2006-2012) the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Then, we created a land cover and land use change (LCLUC) scenario that considers improving soil and water conservation practices and the reforestation of riparian zones, following the recommendations of the Brazilian Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES). We also used the trend SSP2-4.5 and the fossilbased economy SSP5-8.5 (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) climate scenarios data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) project for the period of 2015-2100. Along with a decrease of 5 %-15 % in precipitation in the projected period, an increase of 7 %-15 % in forest areas due to the LCLUC scenarios generated an increase in evapotranspiration values up to 38 %, resulting in a decrease of surface runoff and baseflow. Riparian reforestation and soil and water conservation practices did not necessarily enhance water availability on the simulations performed, as expected by many PES.

TI  - Carbon storage and CO2 dynamics from wood products harvested in Brazil during 1900-2016
T2  - CARBON MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - How relevant is the role of CO2 from harvested wood products (HWPs) for the Brazilian GHG emission balance? The C stocks and CO2 emissions and removals from the HWPs in Brazil during 1900-2016 were evaluated using three methodological approaches: stock-change approach (SCA), production approach (PA), and stock-change of domestic origin (SCDOA). Data from the FAO's FAOSTAT system on production, import and export of semi-finished products (sawnwood, wood-based panels and paper/paperboard) were analyzed, considering distinct land-use activities: deforestation (D), forest management (FM) and afforestation/reforestation (A/R). Two scenarios to evaluate the effect of HWPs from D were evaluated. The C stock in HWPs in 2016 reached 252 Mt C, by SCA. Contributions to C storage historically were higher from sawnwood, but wood-based panels and paper/paperboard have recently outperformed it. A/R is the major activity responsible for C storage in HWPs. The CO2 removal by HWPs was 521 Mt during 1990-2016, which corresponds to 1.1% of the country's emissions in the same period. It was concluded that Brazil has become a major producer and wood consumer and that HWPs are allies for a positive C balance and fulfillment of the commitments assumed by the country regarding climate change.

TI  - Animal thermal comfort indexes in silvopastoral systems with different tree arrangements
T2  - JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to assess solar radiation transmission and animal thermal comfort indexes in two silvopastoral systems established with different tree arrangements in a tropical region. This study was conducted between 2014 and 2017 in two silvopastoral systems, one composed by an established Urochloa (syn. Brachiaria) decumbens pasture with Brazilian native trees planted in triple rows spaced 17 m apart, and another by an established Urochloa (syn. Brachiaria) brizantha (Hochst ex A. Rich.) Stapf %RS Plata' pasture with Eucalyptus urograndis (clone GG100) trees arranged in single rows spaced 15 m apart. In these systems and in a full-sun pasture, photosynthetically active radiation transmission, air temperature, relative humidity, black globe temperature, and wind speed were measured. These variables were used to calculate black globe temperature and humidity index (BGHI) and radiant thermal load (RU). Higher animal thermal comfort was observed in the silvopastoral systems due to changes in the microclimate induced by the trees; notably, a decrease in solar radiation transmission. Fewer hours of potential animal thermal stress (BGHI > 79) were observed in the silvopastoral systems than under the full-sun conditions, with differences up to 3 h per day. The silvopastoral systems presented lower radiant thermal load than the full-sun pasture with differences up to 22% achieved. The assessed silvopastoral systems may help livestock adapt to climate change, since they achieved the limit of BGHI considered to cause stress to animals following an increase of 2.2 degrees C in air temperature, compared with full-sun pastures.

TI  - Relative fire-proneness of land cover types in the Brazilian Atlantic forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires are increasingly affecting tropical biomes, where landscape-fire interactions remain understudied. We investigate the fire-proneness-the likelihood of a land use or land cover (LULC) type burning more or less than expected based on availability-in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (AF). This biodiversity hotspot is increasingly affected by fires due to human activities and climate change. Using a selection ratio-based approach, we analyzed fire-LULC interactions in 40,869 fires over a 35-year period (1987-2022) across various ecoregions in the AF. Our findings revealed that secondary forests, forest areas that have regrown after major disturbances, burned 61% more than expected by chance, whereas old-growth forests, native forests that have developed over very long periods, burned 57% less than expected, highlighting a nearly inverse relationship in their fire-proneness. Interestingly, our data indicate that pastures in the AF are less prone to fire than expected, despite being considered among the land uses that burn the most in Brazil. Other LULCs showed variable fire-proneness, with some differences between ecoregions. Over time, the fire-proneness of secondary forests decreased, likely due to forest aging and changes in land management practices. We emphasize the necessity for tailored fire management strategies that address the unique vulnerabilities of secondary forests, particularly in the context of ongoing restoration efforts aimed at increasing native forests. Effective measures, including the implementation of 'firesmart management' practices and enhancing the perceived value of secondary forests among local communities, are crucial for mitigating fire risks. Integrating these strategies with incentive-based approaches can bolster fire prevention, ensuring the long-term success of restoration programs. Our study provides a framework for understanding fire-landscape dynamics in tropical forests and offers actionable insights for practitioners working to safeguard these biomes from the escalating threat of wildfires.

TI  - Assessment of Burned Areas during the Pantanal Fire Crisis in 2020 Using Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pantanal biome-a tropical wetland area-has been suffering a prolonged drought that started in 2019 and peaked in 2020. This favored the occurrence of natural disasters and led to the 2020 Pantanal fire crisis. The purpose of this work was to map the burned area's extent during this crisis in the Brazilian portion of the Pantanal biome using Sentinel-2 MSI images. The classification of the burned areas was performed using a machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) in the Google Earth Engine platform. Input variables in the algorithm were the percentiles 10, 25, 50, 75, and 90 of monthly (July to December) mosaics of the shade fraction, NDVI, and NBR images derived from Sentinel-2 MSI images. The results showed an overall accuracy of 95.9% and an estimate of 44,998 km(2) burned in the Brazilian portion of the Pantanal, which resulted in severe ecosystem destruction and biodiversity loss in this biome. The burned area estimated in this work was higher than those estimated by the MCD64A1 (35,837 km(2)), Fire_cci (36,017 km(2)), GABAM (14,307 km(2)), and MapBiomas Fogo (23,372 km(2)) burned area products, which presented lower accuracies. These differences can be explained by the distinct datasets and methods used to obtain those estimates. The proposed approach based on Sentinel-2 images can potentially refine the burned area's estimation at a regional scale and, consequently, improve the estimate of trace gases and aerosols associated with biomass burning, where global biomass burning inventories are widely known for having biases at a regional scale. Our study brings to light the necessity of developing approaches that aim to improve data and theory about the impacts of fire in regions critically sensitive to climate change, such as the Pantanal, in order to improve Earth systems models that forecast wetland-atmosphere interactions, and the role of these fires on current and future climate change over these regions.

TI  - Characterization of properties and main processes related to the genesis and evolution of tropical mountain mires from Serra do Espinhaco Meridional, Minas Gerais, Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - The properties and components of the peat allow peatlands to function as water reservoirs which participate in the hydrological cycle by modulating water discharge. In particular, mountain peatlands from Serra do Espinhaco Meridional (Minas Gerais State, Brazil) provide water of good quality for the nearby cities and also serve as habitats for wildlife and flora, with unique endemic species. In this paper, we present the characterization of four mountain mires (Pau de Fruta, Sao Joao da Chapada, Pinheiros and Sempre Viva) based on morphological, physical, chemical, and elemental properties analyzed in five selected peat cores (PdF-I, PdF-II, SJC, PI and SV). Radiocarbon dating indicates that they started to form during the late Pleistocene. Principal components analysis was applied to synthesize their main peat properties and underlying processes. The first principal component, PC1, is related to the relative content in inorganic versus organic matter of the peat, most probably related to the evolution of the soils of the mires' catchments (i.e. soil erosion); PC2 seems to be related to the incorporation of inorganic material by deposition of dust from regional sources; PO reflects the content and preservation of plant remains; and PC4 indicates the degree of peat decomposition. Our results suggest that mountain tropical mires from Serra do Espinhaco Meridional are complex peatland ecosytems, with a large potential for the reconstruction of environmental changes (i.e. climate change) occurred since the late Pleistocene, and that they should be fully protected.

TI  - A case study on enhancing dairy cattle sustainability: The impact of silvopastoral systems and improved pastures on milk carbon footprint and farm economics in Cauca department, Colombia
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cattle farming accounts for approximately 15% of Colombia's greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE). Silvopastoral systems (SPS) and improved pastures (IP) are recognized as effective strategies for transforming dairy systems by enhancing cattle productivity, reducing climate change impact, and increasing farm profitability. This study aims to (i) calculate the carbon footprint (CF) of four small dairy cattle farms in the Cauca Department and (ii) identify improvements in milk yields, reductions in GHGE intensities after implementing SPS and IP, and changes in profitability indicators. GHGE were calculated using the 2019 Refinement to 2006 IPCC guidelines and impact factors from databases. Using a cradle-to-farm-gate approach, the functional units were one kg of fat and protein-corrected milk (FPCM) and one kg of live weight gain. A biophysical allocation method was applied to handling co-products leaving the farm. Baseline milk CFs ranged from 2.4 to 3.2 kgCO2-eq kgFPCM-1. In the improvement scenario, the area with SPS and IP covered more than 48% of the total farm area on average. SPS and IP increased the availability and quality of forage, leading to higher animal yields and reducing milk CF by up to 40% (ranging from 1.4 to 2.7 kgCO2-eq kgFPCM-1). These findings provide evidence of the positive impact of adopting IP and SPS on the sustainability of small dairy systems in Colombia by enhancing animal productivity and reducing GHGE intensities.

TI  - A socio-eco-efficiency analysis of integrated and non-integrated crop-livestock-forestry systems in the Brazilian Cerrado based on LCA
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop-livestock-forest (CLFi) and crop-livestock (CLi) systems are among the most recent agricultural developments in Brazil, and aligned with the principles of cleaner production. Such integrated systems can provide at least three types of product from the same land area over a defined period. This paper presents a holistic sustainability evaluation using life cycle assessment to compare combinations of integrated and conventional systems in the Brazilian Cerrado region. The study assesses a comprehensive set of indicators in the three sustainability dimensions: environmental, economic, and social (socio-eco-efficiency). By prioritizing CLFi, the production area to meet the demand of grains, meat and energy for 500 Brazilians, from 2007 to 2014, reached 70 ha, while the conventional systems would need 420 ha to meet the same demand. This result shows that it is possible to increase production to meet the growing food global demand without the need of expanding the agricultural frontier, preserving the remaining forestland. CLFi combinations systems decreased 55% in climate change potential (2389 t of CO2 equivalent), when compared to the conventional systems. It was also observed that the more integrated systems improved the quality of employment, promoted future generation investments in society, and decreased the total production costs in 54%, when compared to conventional systems. Therefore, intensification achieved through good practices such as association, rotation, and succession by an agroforestry system, optimization of inputs (including water, energy, fertilizers, and crop protection agents), land use, soil quality, biodiversity and social aspects.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics and potential restoration of mangroves in Circum-Xinying-Bay region, Hainan Province, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests play an important role in absorbing carbon, filtering pollution, and protecting coastal residents from storms. However, mangrove forests are most susceptible to human interference and suffer more than onethird of losses globally. Therefore, quantifying their spatial-temporal changes and identifying their potential distributions are necessary for protection, restoration, and management. We first mapped and analysed the spatial-temporal changes in mangrove forests from 1993 to 2021 in the Xinying-Bay region (XYB), Hainan Province, China. Then, we predicted suitable habitats for mangrove forests by using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model based on mangrove distribution data for 2021 and related environmental data for the CircumXinying-Bay region (CXYB). The results show remarkable changes in mangrove forests in the XYB from 1993 to 2021, with the loss rate reaching 56 ha/y from 1998 to 2002. The MaxEnt model performs well, with the curve (AUC) extending beyond 0.9. Water quality and topography determined the distribution of mangrove forests, with the total contribution exceeding 65%. The six most important influential factors were salinity, DEM, precipitation in the driest quarter, pH, isothermality, and winter sea surface temperature. The area of mangroves highly suitable in the CXYB is approximately 3880 hm2 and is mainly located in the town of Xinzhou, the northeast area of the town of Mutang and the southwest area of the town of E'man. This suggests that areas prioritized for protection should include the northern and western areas of Xinzhou, northeastern areas of Mutang, and northern and western areas of E'man. These findings provide further understanding of mangrove distribution and can guide mangrove restoration and management.

TI  - SPECIES DIVERSITY AND CARBON STORAGE OF UNDERGROWTH AND LITTER IN THE AGROFORESTRY SYSTEM OF NORTH SUMATERA-INDONESIA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this research was to look into the diversity of species and carbon storage in agroforestry systems in the Forest for Special Purpose at Aek Nauli, North Sumatera Province, Indonesia. A total of 60 subplots, 1.0x1.0m were used to represent different undergrowth species in the agroforestry system. By identifying constituent species in the agroforestry system, the diversity of undergrowth species was studied, and the potential for biomass and carbon storage of undergrowth and litter was measured and analyzed. Undergrowth species in agroforestry Toona sureni and Coffee Arabica are significantly richer in plant species (27 species vs. 14 in agroforestry P. Merkusii and C. Arabica). The results showed that the diversity undergrowth was categorized as moderate, and the evenness indices were low, ranging from 0.33 to 44. In the agroforestry system, the mean biomass of undergrowth was 1.65 tons ha(-1), and the carbon storage of undergrowth was 0.43 tons ha(-1). Meanwhile, litter biomass was 5.18 tons ha(-1) on average, with 2.5 tons ha(-1) of litter carbon storage. Both biomass and carbon storage of undergrowth and litter in agroforestry T. Sureni, and C. Arabiba vs. P. Merkusii and C. Arabica are significantly different. By applying sustainable agroforestry management in forests for special purposes, this study helps with future climate change adaptation and mitigation.

TI  - Coordination and cross-sectoral integration in REDD plus : experiences from seven countries
T2  - CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ever since a global mitigation mechanism that aims to reduce emissions by avoiding deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) was introduced in climate change negotiations, governance challenges in implementing this concept in tropical forest countries have received considerable attention. In particular, multilevel governance has been identified as a key challenge, as REDD+ aims to tackle local deforestation activities through a global results-based financial scheme. This paper will present an analysis from seven REDD+ countries (Brazil, Cameroon, Indonesia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Tanzania and Vietnam) where 293 qualitative interviews were conducted with national-level REDD+ actors. We examined what kind of multilevel coordination problems emerge, particularly in relation to horizontal, cross-sectoral coordination, and analysed these problems through the concepts of functional alignment, institutional complexity and accountability. We argue that there are problems with coordination that have emerged due to failures in recognizing the key multilevel issues. REDD+ is not adequately integrated into existing policies, and there is a gap between REDD+ and sectoral and national development policies. This leads to overlapping regulations and unequal resource allocation among sectors. Our analysis suggests that effective coordination mechanisms for REDD+ should be built on existing mechanisms and experience, include all the stakeholders, ensure the flow of information across the levels and harness the potential of REDD+ itself to overcome multi-sectoral problems. At the national level, there is great awareness of the issues that hinder coordination and effective REDD+ implementation, but this awareness does not seem to be matched by the actions taken to date.

TI  - The environmental gradient influences the concentrations of carbon compounds in the biomass of Protium icicariba (DC.) Marchand in restinga area
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to analyze the concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates and cell wall polymers in Protium icicariba individuals along an environmental gradient of a Coastal Brazilian Atlantic Forest (restinga). The concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates (glucose, fructose, sucrose and starch) and cell wall polymers (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) were quantified in samples of stems, branches and leaves of individuals distributed in contrasting zones regarding the occurrence of floods [periodically floodable (PI), transitional (IT) and non-floodable (NI)]. Individuals from the non-flooded zone had higher concentrations of starch and hemicelluloses in the branches and leaves. On the other hand, cellulose and lignin concentrations were higher in the leaves of individuals from the periodically flooded and transitional zones. The variations in the concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates and cell wall polymers were mainly associated with water availability and plasticity of the species, in addition to possible influences of soil nutrient supply and the occurrence of herbivory. The sensitivity in the dynamics of the carbon molecules of P. icicariba in a diverse and spatially short environmental gradient, requires considerable plasticity of the species that, in the imminence of climatic changes, must favor its survival in the face of the imposition of new environmental filters.

TI  - Silvopastoral system as a climate-smart alternative for beef production: Enteric methane emission neutralization and animal thermal comfort increase
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - CONTEXT: Climate-smart agricultural systems must mitigate climate change and adapt to it. OBJECTIVES: (i) test the ability of a silvopastoral system (SPS) in Brazil to neutralize the CH4 enteric emission by tree carbon (C) assimilation, considering solely the stem-C destined to Products with Higher Added Value (HVAP) and furniture as valid, due to their long-term stability; (ii) test the SPS ability to provide increased animal thermal comfort and; (iii) compare the SPS productivity, animal thermal comfort and CH4 emission with a full sun system (FS). METHODS: The systems had four areas managed under rotational stocking with beef cattle and were established with Piata palisadegrass [Urochloa brizantha Stapf cv. BRS Piata] in 2007. In the SPS, eucalyptus trees (Eucalyptus urograndis clone GG100) were planted in 2011, in single east-west oriented rows, with a 15 m x 2 m spacing, and thinned to 15 m x 4 m spacing in 2016. Microclimate data were collected in weather stations to determine the Black Globe and Humidity Index (BGHI). The CH4 enteric emission was estimated using the Tier-2 equation (IPCC Methodological Guide - 2019). Tree height and diameter at breast height were measured every six months from October/2017 to April/2019 to estimate the stem biomass using an allometric equation. The stem biomass was multiplied by its carbon content and by 40 % to consider the break-through yield in sawmill. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: BGHI was lower in the SPS than in the FS. Even considering the stem-C appropriate for HVAP and furniture in a SPS with a stocking rate 256 % greater than the Brazilian average, 77 % of the CH4 enteric emission was offset. When considering all the stem-C, the net C balance was-14.28 Mg CO2 eq. ha- 1 year- 1. SIGNIFICANCE: SPS are interesting alternatives to mitigate climate change while providing satisfactory animal production and increased animal thermal comfort.

TI  - Forest biomass recovery after conventional and reduced-impact logging in Amazonian Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Growing concerns about unnecessarily destructive selective logging of tropical forests and its impacts on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions motivated this study on post-logging biomass dynamics over a 16-year period in a control plot and in plots subjected to conventional logging (CL) or reduced-impact logging (RIL) in Paragominas, Para State, Brazil. All trees >25 cm were monitored in 25.4 ha plots of each treatment, each with a subplot of 5.25 ha for trees >10 cm dbh. The commercial timber volumes in felled trees were 38.9 and 37.4 m(3) ha(-1) in the RIL and CL plots, respectively, but the extracted volumes were 38.6 and 29.7 m(3) ha(-1), respectively. Immediately after logging, plots subjected to RIL and CL lost 17% and 26% of their above-ground biomass, respectively. Over the 16 years after logging, the average annual increments in above-ground biomass (recruitment plus residual tree growth minus mortality) were 2.8 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) in the RIL plot but only 0.5 Mg ha(-1) year in the CL plot. By 16 years post-logging, the RIL plot recovered 100% of its original above-ground biomass while the CL plot recovered only 77%; over the same period, biomass in the control plot maintained 96% of its initial stock. These findings reinforce the claim that conversion from CL to RIL would represent an efficient forest-based strategy to mitigate climate change under the REDD+ and would be an important step towards sustainable forest management.

TI  - Regional air quality impacts of future fire emissions in Sumatra and Kalimantan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire emissions associated with land cover change and land management contribute to the concentrations of atmospheric pollutants, which can affect regional air quality and climate. Mitigating these impacts requires a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between fires and different land cover change trajectories and land management strategies. Wedevelop future fire emissions inventories from 2010-2030 for Sumatra and Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) to assess the impact of varying levels of forest and peatland conservation on air quality in Equatorial Asia. To compile these inventories, we combine detailed land cover information from published maps of forest extent, satellite fire radiative power observations, fire emissions from the Global Fire Emissions Database, and spatially explicit future land cover projections using a land cover change model. Weapply the sensitivities of mean smoke concentrations to Indonesian fire emissions, calculated by the GEOS-Chem adjoint model, to our scenario-based future fire emissions inventories to quantify the different impacts of fires on surface air quality across Equatorial Asia. Wefind that public health impacts are highly sensitive to the location of fires, with emissions from Sumatra contributing more to smoke concentrations at population centers across the region than Kalimantan, which had higher emissions by more than a factor of two. Compared to business-as-usual projections, protecting peatlands from fires reduces smoke concentrations in the cities of Singapore and Palembang by 70% and 40%, and by 60% for the Equatorial Asian region, weighted by the population in each grid cell. Our results indicate the importance of focusing conservation priorities on protecting both forested (intact or logged) peatlands and non-forested peatlands from fire, even after considering potential leakage of deforestation pressure to other areas, in order to limit the impact of fire emissions on atmospheric smoke concentrations and subsequent health effects.

TI  - Indonesia's forest conversion moratorium assessed with an agent-based model of Land-Use Change and Ecosystem Services (LUCES)
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Indonesian government recently confirmed its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to mitigate global climate change. A forest moratorium policy that protects forest and peatland is a significant part of the INDCs; however, its effectiveness is unclear in the face of complex land-use and land-cover change. This study aims to assess the dynamics of land-use change and ecosystem service supply as a function of local decision-making. We developed an agent-based model, Land-Use Change and Ecosystem Services (LUCES), and used it to explore the possible effects of the forest moratorium policy on the land-use decisions of private companies and communities. Our simulations for two districts in Central Kalimantan show that the current implementation of the forest moratorium policy is not effective in reducing forest conversion and carbon emissions. This is because companies continue to invest in converting secondary forest on mineral soils and the moratorium does not affect community decision-making. A policy that combines a forest moratorium with livelihood support and increases farm-gate prices of forest and agroforestry products could increase the local communities' benefits from conservation. Forest and agroforestry areas that are profitable and competitive are more likely to be conserved and reduce potential carbon emission by about 36 %. The results for the two districts, with different pressures on local resources, suggest that appropriate additional measures require local fine-tuning. The LUCES model could be an ex ante tool to facilitate such fine-tuning and help the Indonesian government achieve its INDC goals as part of a wider sustainable development policy.

TI  - Native forest cover safeguards stream water quality under a changing climate
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ensuring a sufficient and adequate supply of water for humans and ecosystems is a pressing environmental challenge. The expansion of agricultural and urban lands has jeopardized watershed ecosystem services and a changing climate poses additional risks for regional water supply. We used stream water quality data collected between 2000 and 2014, coupled with detailed precipitation and land cover information, to investigate the effects of landscape composition and short-term precipitation variability on the quality of water resources in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The state is home to over 45 million people and has a long history of human landscape modification. A severe drought in 2014-2015 led to a major water crisis and highlighted the fragility of the regional water supply system. We found that human-dominated watersheds had lower overall water quality when compared to forested watersheds, with urban cover showing the most detrimental impacts on water quality. Forest cover was associated with a better overall water quality across the studied watersheds, with forested watersheds having low turbidity and high dissolved oxygen. High precipitation led to increased turbidity and fecal coliforms levels and lower dissolved oxygen in streams but these effects depended on watershed land cover. High precipitation diluted concentrations of nitrogen and dissolved solids in highly urbanized watersheds but exacerbated turbidity in pasture-dominated watersheds. Given the high costs of water treatment in densely populated regions, there is a pressing need to plan and manage landscapes in order to ensure adequate water resources. In tropical regions, maintaining or restoring native vegetation cover is a promising intervention to sustain adequate water quality.

TI  - Carbon emission mitigation measures in Brazil - case study of biomass policy for a ferroalloy plant in Ceara State
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - The present work aims at discussing the possibilities of atmospheric carbon emissions mitigation in the scope of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in the forest sector using a case study in the Northeast of Brazil. Taking Cearg State as an example and based on the Ceara State Energy Balances for 1980, 1984 and 1987, the Carbon (C-CO2) Emission Balances were drawn up covering these same years. An exercise was carried out in order to draw up carbon emissions mitigation proposals through both Environmental Education and reforestation policies replacing forest clearing. The first, environmental education and forest management practices, involves more efficient practices in the woody sector. The second, reforestation policies, instead of felling native forests for fuel-wood burned to produce charcoal, is discussed from the economic point of view. An estimate was drawn up of the carbon abatement costs, using a case study for charcoal production based on reforestation instead of deforestation, for a ferroalloy plant in Ceara State.

TI  - Sustainability of Arabica coffee business in West Java, Indonesia: A multidimensional scaling approach
T2  - OPEN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Arabica coffee plantation area is limited, and production is still low while demand increases. The development of Arabica coffee in Indonesia faces many obstacles that threaten its sustainability. The objective of this study is to determine the sustainability status of the Arabica coffee business in West Java and formulate a sustainability strategy. Primary data were obtained through interviews with respondents and key persons from relevant stakeholders from upstream to downstream using a structured questionnaire. The study was conducted in August-October 2021 in Garut District, West Java. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) was used to assess the sustainability status of the Arabica coffee business in five dimensions, i.e., ecological, economic, social, marketing, and institutional. The results show that the Arabica coffee business in West Java is fairly sustainable, with an average score of 55.65%. The MDS analysis for each dimension reveals that the social dimension has the highest score (62.45%), followed by the ecological dimension (59.01%), the economic dimension (53.00%), the institutional dimension (51.92%), and the marketing dimension (51.87%). This study emphasizes five actions as parts of the sustainability strategy, i.e., adaptation and mitigation of climate change, creative efforts to increase farmers' income, human resource capacity building, strengthening business partnerships, and strengthening farmer organizations.

TI  - Gendered Species Preferences Link Tree Diversity and Carbon Stocks in Cacao Agroforest in Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The degree to which the maintenance of carbon (C) stocks and tree diversity can be jointly achieved in production landscapes is debated. C stocks in forests are decreased by logging before tree diversity is affected, while C stocks in monoculture tree plantations increase, but diversity does not. Agroforestry can break this hysteresis pattern, relevant for policies in search of synergy. We compared total C stocks and tree diversity among degraded forest, complex cacao/fruit tree agroforests, simple shade-tree cacao agroforestry, monoculture cacao, and annual crops in the Konawe District, Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. We evaluated farmer tree preferences and the utility value of the system for 40 farmers (male and female). The highest tree diversity (Shannon-Wiener H index 2.36) and C stocks (282 Mg C ha(-1)) were found in degraded forest, followed by cacao-based agroforestry systems (H index ranged from 0.58-0.93 with C stocks of 75-89 Mg ha(-1)). Male farmers selected timber and fruit tree species with economic benefits as shade trees, while female farmers preferred production for household needs (fruit trees and vegetables). Carbon stocks and tree diversity were positively related (R-2 = 0.72). Adding data from across Indonesia (n = 102), agroforestry systems had an intermediate position between forest decline and reforestation responses. Maintaining agroforestry in the landscape allows aboveground C stocks up to 50 Mg ha(-1) and reduces biodiversity loss. Agroforestry facilitates climate change mitigation and biodiversity goals to be addressed simultaneously in sustainable production landscapes.

TI  - Mud, muddle and models in the knowledge value-chain to action on tropical peatland conservation
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatlands are known not only for their high, area-based, carbon emissions in response to land-use change but also as hot spots of debate about associated data uncertainties. Perspectives are still evolving on factors underlying the variability and uncertainty. Debate includes the ways of reducing emissions through rewetting, reforestation and agroforestry. A knowledge value-chain that is long and complex links (a) fundamental understanding of peat and peatland processes leading to sciencebased quantification and default values, (b) willingness and (c) ability to act towards emission reduction, and ultimately (d) to local, national and global actions that effectively provide rules, incentives and motivation to conserve peat and reduce emissions. We discuss this value chain, its stakeholders and issues that still remain partially unresolved. We conclude that, to shorten the denial and conspiracy-theory stages of debate that otherwise slow down steps B and C, networks of international and national scientists have to be involved at the early stage of identifying policysensitive environmental issues. Models span part of the knowledge value-chain but transition of analysis units requires specific attention, from soil volumes through area and commodity flows to opportunities for reductions. While drainage of peatlands triggers landscape-scale increases in emissions, factors beyond drainage depth, including nutrient supply, may have a major influence on decomposition rates. Attempts to disentangle the contributions of plant and peat-based respiration in surface flux measurements involve assumptions that cannot be easily verified in comparisons between land uses. With progress on A leading to new internationally accepted defaults and with resistance on step B reduced, the reality of C and lack of working solutions for D is currently constraining further progress.

TI  - The pitfalls and potential of debt-for-nature swaps: A US-Indonesian case study
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The vital role of forests in limiting the likelihood of dangerous climate change has precipitated renewed interest in debt-for-nature swaps. This article uses evidence on past debt-for-nature deals and similar debt mechanisms to assess a recent second wave of such swaps. It outlines five typical shortcomings of this form of financial transaction: that they often fail to deliver additional resources to the debtor country and/or debtor government budget; often fail to deliver more resources for conservation/climate purposes; often have a negligible effect on overall debt burdens (and, as such, do not generate more 'indirect' benefits); and are often in conflict with principles of alignment with government policy and alignment with government systems (these two last shortcomings being important elements within the new aid delivery paradigm). Our analysis is applied to a recent debt-for-nature swap between the United States and Indonesia. We show that this case, which we consider a litmus test for current swap practice, performs unevenly across the five shortcomings. First, although the US-Indonesian swap does increase available resources to Indonesia at the country level, it does not generate extra budgetary room for the Indonesian government. Second, the extent to which the resources provided by the swap are additional to other donor support and reserved domestic budget lines for conservation goals is unclear. Third, the swap is too insignificant to create indirect (positive) economic effects. Regarding alignment issues, fourth, the swap is very much in line with current national policy, but, fifth, appears at odds with the new aid delivery paradigm's insistence on system alignment. We argue that if a second generation of debt-for-nature swaps is to be pursued then they need to avoid the common pitfalls associated with this form of finance. Moreover, there is a need to debate broader ways of linking debt service repayments to climate mitigation and adaptation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sustainable Production of Robusta Coffee under a Changing Climate: A 10-Year Monitoring of Fertilizer Management in Coffee Farms in Vietnam and Indonesia
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing and prescribing fertilizer use is critical to profitable and sustainable coffee production, and this is becoming a priority concern for the Robusta coffee industry. In this study, annual survey data of 798 farms across selected Robusta coffee-producing provinces in Vietnam and Indonesia between 2008 and 2017 were used to comparatively assess the fertilizer management strategies in these countries. Specifically, we aimed to characterize fertilizer use patterns in the key coffee-growing provinces and discuss the potential for improving nutrient management practices. Four types of chemical (NPK, super phosphate, potassium chloride and urea) and two of natural (compost and lime) fertilizers were routinely used in Vietnam. In Indonesia, NPK and urea were supplemented only with compost. Farmers in Vietnam applied unbalanced quantities of chemical fertilizers (i.e., higher rates than recommended) and at a constant rate between years whereas Indonesian farmers applied well below the recommended rates because of poor accessibility and financial support. The overuse of chemical fertilizers in Vietnam threatens the sustainability of Robusta coffee farming. Nevertheless, there is a potential for improvement in both countries in terms of nutrient management and sustainability of Robusta coffee production by adopting the best local fertilizer management practices.

TI  - Towards an improved understanding of greenhouse gas emissions and fluxes in tropical peatlands of Southeast Asia
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Review
AB  - At present, there is insufficient data to understand the processes driving emissions and fluxes of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from tropical peatlands in Southeast Asia (SEA). In this review, we discuss fundamental factors controlling emissions of major GHGs (CO2, CH4, and N2O) from tropical peatlands and their contribution to global climate change. Classifying peatlands in tropical and subtropical regions can aid in understanding their emission characteristics. The applicability of existing GHG emission factors to land use categories in SEA is discussed. We find that rewetting peatland can increase CH4 emissions, and therefore more studies are needed to establish whether peatlands act as a net sink or net sources of GHGs. Few studies have investigated the effectiveness of liming towards reducing peat soil acidity. The review also finds that there is limited data on CO2 concentrations in drainage and wildfire areas, N2O fluxes in agriculture areas, and the impact and reduction of CH4 in tropical peatlands. Addressing these research gaps could support the development of a framework for GHG emission measurements and abatement in tropical peatlands.

TI  - Global potential for carbon sequestration:: Geographical distribution, country risk and policy implications
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - we have provided a framework for identifying least-cost sites for afforestation and reforestation and deriving carbon sequestration cost curves at a global level in a scenario of limited information. Special attention is given to country risk in developing countries and the sensitivity to spatial datasets. Our model results suggest that within 20 years and considering a carbon price of US$50/tC, tree-planting activities could offset 1 year of global carbon emissions in the energy sector. However, if we account for country risk considerations-associated with political, economic and financial risks-carbon sequestration is reduced by approximately 60%. With respect to the geography of supply, illustrated by grid-scale maps, we find that most least-cost sites are located in regions of developing countries such as the Sub-Sahara, Southeast Brazil and Southeast Asia.

TI  - Monitoring of areas in conflict with the Legislation for the Protection of Native Vegetation in Brazil: opportunity for large-scale forest restoration and for the Brazilian global agenda
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest restoration, combined with the mitigation of climate change, has attracted significant interest from several stakeholders. This can aid in restoring degraded areas and enhancing carbon storage. Brazil's global environmental commitments, particularly in the state of Minas Gerais (MG), require substantial financial investments to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and the Convention on Biological Diversity. Minas Gerais has extensive areas protected by the Legislation for the Protection of Native Vegetation (LPVN) that are not compliant and must be restored in the next 20 years. Geographic data was collected from the government SICAR database. Land use in MG was analyzed using geoprocessing techniques using data from the MapBiomas platform to estimate the area in conflict with LPVN regulations. Minas Gerais has an environmental liability of 3.7 million hectares (Mha) that need restoration in the next 20 years. The Legal Reserve (RL) (2.2 Mha) and Permanent Preservation Areas of watercourses (1.3 Mha) are the most non-compliant protected areas. The "Tri & acirc;ngulo Mineiro" and "Norte de Minas" mesoregions have the largest areas in conflict with the LPVN. The Cerrado faces a more critical situation, with approximately 56% of the conflicting areas located there. This study outlines the extent of restoration needed with native vegetation to comply with LPVN requirements in MG.

TI  - Allometric equation for estimating aboveground biomass of nutmeg (Myristica fragrans Houtt) to support REDD
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the important aspects to support the success of REDD+ programme is the availability of a standard methodology and method to estimate carbon stock in forest or agroforestry land, which is recognized by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This paper aims to describe and discuss a method to estimate the carbon stocks in agroforestry land in Hutumury Village, Ambon. The formulation of allometric equation for nutmeg (Myristica fragrans Houtt) is used to predict the aboveground biomass of nutmeg-based agroforestry land. The carbon mass equation model was constructed based on a significant relationship between carbon mass of nutmeg tree and its diameters at breast height and tree height. In order to analyse the biomass content, a destructive sampling technique was used. After felling, dimensional measurement was performed for each tree. The results of the study showed that the equation model for estimating aboveground biomass of nutmeg tree was allometric equation of Power, i.e., Y=134.353*(D**2.424) or ln (Y)=ln (134.353)+(2.424*ln (D)) with R-2 (adj)=0.977 and standard error (SE)=0.183. This allometric equation is a local allometric model and much needed to support REDD+ especially in Maluku Province. In addition, aboveground biomass predictors are easy to determine as only stem diameters are required to be measured mainly in dense forests.

TI  - Carbon stocks, emissions, and aboveground productivity in restored secondary tropical peat swamp forests
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical wetlands such as peat swamp forests (PSFs) have been known globally as one of the carbon (C)-rich ecosystems. However, there is still a lack of understanding on the C cycle in PSFs, especially in association with land use and cover changes (e.g., ecosystem degradation and restoration). This study presents the C stocks, removals, and emissions dataset, as well as the determining factors from an early restoration stage of secondary tropical PSFs in Central Kalimantan. We assessed various biophysical parameters such as forest structure, above- and belowground C-stocks, aboveground primary productivity, total and heterotrophic soil respirations, and groundwater level (GWL). We found that tree density varied from 1200 to 1825 trees per hectare (ha) across the plots, whereas the mean of stand basal area was 32.86 +/- 4.72m(2)ha(-1). Mean ecosystem C stocks in the study site was 1752 +/- 401Mg-Cha(-1), of which 93% was stored in belowground organic peat soils. A mean aboveground litterfall production of 4.6 +/- 0.5Mg-Cha(-1)year(-1) and biomass C sequestration through tree diameter increment with 2.7 +/- 0.5Mg-Cha(-1)year(-1) was obtained. We observed slightly larger portion of annual mean total soil respiration with 14.2 +/- 1.1Mg-Cha(-1)year(-1) than heterotrophic respiration 11.1 +/- 0.9Mg-Cha(-1)year(-1), emphasizing the lower contribution of autotrophic respiration from the belowground rooting system. Findings imply that further conservation management efforts through ecosystem restoration may preserve C stored and enhance C input in PSFs substantially, and could be potentially included in national climate change mitigation strategies.

TI  - GHGs Emissions and Sustainable Solid Waste Management
T2  - RECYCLING OF SOLID WASTE FOR BIOFUELS AND BIO-CHEMICALS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - In the 21st century, global warming and climate change are among the greatest environmental challenges and humanitarian crisis. Globally, annual greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions from solid waste disposal sites is estimated to be approximately a quarter of total anthropogenic methane emission. Integrated solid waste management, therefore, provides significant opportunities to control environmental pollution and minimize the negative impacts of global climate change. This chapter illustrates the current status of global GHGs emission in relationship with population growth and solid waste generation. Mathematic models used to quantify GHGs generated from the waste sector as the zero-order model (i.e., SWANA, German EPER and IPCC Default Method) and the first-order model (i.e., TNO, LandGEM, IPCC First-Order Decay; FOD) are explained including application to certain inventory in selected countries. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), which involves the cradle-to-grave concept, environmental burden from global warming and selected case studies are described and applied to assess GHGs emissions from various solid waste management options such as recycling, composting, sanitary landfilling, anaerobic digestion, incineration, mechanical biological treatment (MBT), source reduction, and utilization and application of biochar. Existing solid waste management practices and innovative options to achieve GHGs mitigation and community adaptation including resiliency are presented. Lessons learned and best practices in solid waste management from Thailand (i.e., Bangkok Kamphaeng Sean West: Landfill Gas to Electricity Project) and from other countries (i.e., GHGs mitigation project: MBT plant in Gaobeidian, Hebei province, People's Republic of China; municipal solid waste composting project in Ikorodu, Lagos State, Federal Republic of Nigeria; and gasification, landfill gas and anaerobic digestion in Bali, Indonesia) are further discussed.

AB  - In Indonesia, a huge amount of peat has accumulated under peat swamp forest over millennia. However, a repeatable large-scale fire as a result of land clearing has rapidly devastated these tropical peatlands. These disturbances (e.g. climate change, deforestation, peatland drainage, forest and peatland fires, and land conversion) change the ecosystem respiration and resulting a high carbon emitted to the atmosphere. To restore the peatland ecosystem, Indonesia government makes a special force by using three activities, namely rewetting, replantation, and communal empowerment. These activities need an accurate peatland monitoring. However, accessing the spatial variation of the peatland is quite limited, difficult and laborious. Therefore, we investigated the existence of tropical peatland in Siak, Riau Province, Indonesia. We measured soil moisture at four different types of land cover (namely; forest, oil palm, shrubs, and agriculture) a long with two types of peat conditions. We estimated the Constanta Dielectric (epsilon) values obtained from a fully polarimetry for ALOS 2/PALSAR. Results indicated that the e of oil palm was lower in non-peat area than in peat area, whereas the decrease in e probably in peat area resulted from the rapid growth of oil palm.

TI  - Multiple drivers influence tree species diversity and above-ground carbon stock in second-growth Atlantic forests: Implications for the passive restoration
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Second-growth forests (SGF) are critical components for limiting biodiversity loss and climate change mitigation. However, these forests were established after anthropic disturbances such as land use for planting, and in highly human-modified landscapes. These interventions can decrease the ability of biological communities to recover naturally, and it is necessary to understand how multiple drivers, from local scale to landscape scale influence the diversity and carbon stock of these forests in natural regeneration. For this, we used data from 37 SGF growing on areas previously used for eucalyptus plantations in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, after the last cut cycle. For each SGF, the forest tree species diversity was calculated based on the Hills number, and we also calculated the aboveground carbon stock. Then, we evaluated the influence of multiple environmental factors on these indexes: soil properties, past-management intensity, patch configuration, and landscape composition. Little influence of soil properties was found, only soil fertility negatively influenced above-ground carbon stock. However, pastmanagement intensity negatively influenced tree species diversity and carbon stock. The isolation of other forests and tree species propagules source distance (>500 ha) also negatively influenced the diversity of species. This is probably due to the favoring of tree pioneer species in highly human-modified landscapes because they are more tolerant of environmental changes, less dependent on animal dispersal, and have low carbon stock capacity. Thus, areas with higher past-management intensity and more isolated areas are less effective for passive restoration and may require intervention to recover tree diversity and carbon stock in the Atlantic Forest. The approach, which had not yet been applied in the Atlantic Forest, brought similar results to that found in other forests, and serves as a theoretical basis for choosing priority areas for passive restoration in the biome.

TI  - The tension between fire risk and carbon storage: evaluating US carbon and fire management strategies through ecosystem models
T2  - EARTH INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire risk and carbon storage are related environmental issues because fire reduction results in carbon storage through the buildup of woody vegetation, and stored carbon is a fuel for fires. The sustainability of the U. S. carbon sink and the extent of fire activity in the next 100 yr depend in part on the type and effectiveness of fire reduction employed. Previous studies have bracketed the range of dynamics from continued fire reduction to the complete failure of fire reduction activities. To improve these estimates, it is necessary to explicitly account for fire reduction in terrestrial models. A new fire reduction submodel that estimates the spatiotemporal pattern of reduction across the United States was developed using gridded data on biomass, climate, land-use, population, and economic factors. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first large-scale, gridded fire model that explicitly accounts for fire reduction. The model was calibrated to 1 x 1 burned area statistics [ Global Burnt Area 2000 Project (GBA-2000)] and compared favorably to three important diagnostics. The model was then implemented in a spatially explicit ecosystem model and used to analyze 1620 scenarios of future fire risk and fire reduction strategies. Under scenarios of climate change and urbanization, burned area and carbon emissions both increased in scenarios where fire reduction efforts were not adjusted to match new patterns of fire risk. Fuel reducing management strategies reduced burned area and fire risk, but also limited carbon storage. These results suggest that to promote carbon storage and minimize fire risk in the future, fire reduction efforts will need to be increased and spatially adjusted and will need to employ a mixture of fuel-reducing and non-fuel-reducing strategies.

TI  - The effects of land use and climate change on diameter of Dipteryx alata (Leguminosae) in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Diameter at breast height (DBH) is related to various other plant attributes (e.g., height, fruit number, age), and as such, it can indicate important characteristics for species management and conservation. In this study, we aimed to investigate how the DBH of Dipteryx alata Vogel (Leguminosae) varies spatially across the Cerrado biome. Additionally, we examined how environmental factors and land use can influence the variation in DBH of the D. alata. Furthermore, we estimated the current and future potential distribution of D. alata to assess the impact of global climate change on the species' distribution. We utilized a database with 253 records of DBH for D. alata distributed across the Cerrado. For each sample unit, we determined the environmental suitability of D. alata using niche modeling, and land use was characterized and classified into different types (from pasture to remnant vegetation). Our results revealed that the DBH of D. alata ranged from 5 to 75 centimeters, and there was no discernible spatial pattern. Environmental suitability could not predict the spatial variation in DBH. Nonetheless, plants with larger DBH were found in regions classified as pasture in terms of land use. Factors such as reduced competition soil management and age of plants (old plants) may help explain why DBH was greater in pasture areas. It is worth noting that although pasture areas can serve as a refuge for some trees, proper management is essential to promote individuals' recruitment, ensuring population regeneration and the maintenance of diversity in long time. Climate projections anticipate significant loss of climatically suitable areas for D. alata in future scenarios.

TI  - Responses of Senna reticulata, a legume tree from the Amazonian floodplains, to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration and waterlogging
T2  - TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazonian tree Senna reticulata showed an increase in photosynthesis and starch content under elevated [CO (2) ] that led an increment in biomass after 90 days. Elevated [CO (2) ] was also capable of reducing the negative effect of waterlogging.Tree species from the Amazonian floodplains have to cope with low oxygen availability due to annual pulses of inundation that can last up to 7 months. Species capable of adapting to flooding and/or waterlogged conditions usually partition their storage to favor starch and allocate it to roots, where carbohydrates are used to maintain respiration rates during waterlogging. In spite of climate change, virtually nothing is known about how elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]) will affect plants when combined with waterlogging. In this work, we used open top chambers to evaluate the effect of elevated [CO2] during a period of terrestrial phase and in subsequent combination with waterlogged conditions to determine if the surplus carbon provided by elevated [CO2] may improve the waterlogging tolerance of the fast-growing Amazonian legume tree Senna reticulata. During the terrestrial phase, photosynthesis was ca. 28 % higher after 30, 45 and 120 days of elevated [CO2], and starch content in the leaves was, on average, 49 % higher than with ambient [CO2]. Total biomass was inversely correlated to the starch content of leaves, indicating that starch might be the main carbohydrate source for biomass production during the terrestrial phase. This response was more pronounced under elevated [CO2], resulting in 30 % more biomass in comparison to ambient [CO2] plants. After 135 days at elevated [CO2] an inversion has been observed in total biomass accumulation, in which ambient [CO2] presented a greater increment in total biomass in comparison to elevated [CO2], indicating negative effects on growth after long-term CO2 exposure. However, plants with elevated [CO2]/waterlogged displayed a greater increment in biomass in comparison with ambient [CO2]/waterlogged that, unlike during the terrestrial phase, was unrelated to starch reserves. We conclude that S. reticulata displays mechanisms that make this species capable of responding positively to elevated [CO2] during the first pulse of growth. This response capacity is also associated with a "buffering effect" that prevents the plants from decreasing their biomass under waterlogged conditions.

TI  - A Systematic Map of Agroforestry Research Focusing on Ecosystem Services in the Asia-Pacific Region
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry is an intensive land management system that integrates trees into land already used for crop and animal farming. This provides a diverse range of ecosystem services by bridging the gaps between agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. It is an important approach to improve the environmental, economic, and social benefits of complex social-ecological systems in the Asia-Pacific region. This paper aims to examine the research trends in agroforestry and the current state of knowledge, as well as the research gaps in the ecosystem services of agroforestry in this region. A systematic mapping methodology was applied, where analysis units were academic articles related to agroforestry practices in the Asia-Pacific region. The articles published between 1970 and 2018 were collected through the international specialized academic database, SCOPUS. They were coded according to the types of agroforestry practices and ecosystem services. The research result indicates silvorable systems, especially plantation crop combinations, tree management, habitats for species, biological controls, and maintenance of genetic diversity and gene-pools, are the most prominent in the agroforestry research from the Asia-Pacific region. Approximately 60% of all research articles include case studies from India, China, Indonesia, and Australia. Research on agroforestry has changed following the international discourse on climate change and biodiversity. Therefore, this systematic map improves our understanding of the nature, volume, and characteristics of the research on ecosystem services with regard to agroforestry in the Asia-Pacific region. It provides scholars with a springboard for further meta-analysis or research on agroforestry and ecosystem services.

TI  - Screening Potential Bioenergy Production of Tree Species in Degraded and Marginal Land in the Tropics
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bioenergy can produce at least 25% of the global energy demand to combat climate change through reducing emissions in the energy sector. However, information on the bioenergy production potential of woody species and their suitability for silviculture on various soils in the humid tropics is limited. This review aims to identify tree species suitable for bioenergy production under these conditions. Data were compiled from 241 publications and nine freely available databases to assess environmental and silvicultural information on tropical tree species. Energy outputs were derived from the estimated productivity of the reviewed species and ranged from 0.2 to 24.0 Mg biomass ha(-1) yr(-1), 0.1 to 9.0 Mg bio-oil ha(-1) yr(-1), and 0.2 to 20.0 Mg sugar ha(-1) yr(-1), equivalent to an energy yield between 2 and 444 GJ ha(-1) yr(-1). As such, these bioenergy yields are within the range reported for the lignocellulosic biomass of energy crops cultivated in Europe, the USA, and Brazil. Our review identified some high-yielding species (e.g., Dyera polyphylla (Miq.) Steenis, Metroxylon sagu (Rottb.), Pongamia pinnata (L.)) and leguminous species that could be beneficial in mixed stands (e.g., Elaeis oleifera (Kunth) and Pongamia pinnata) or are suitable species to grow on wet or re-wetted peatland (Dyera polyphylla). However, there are limitations to cultivate woody bioenergy species on wet peatland. Sustainable methods for managing and harvesting forests, particularly on wet or re-wetted peatland, need to be developed.

TI  - ASSESSING FIRE EMISSIONS FROM TROPICAL SAVANNA AND FORESTS OF CENTRAL BRAZIL
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires in tropical forest and savanna are a strong source of trace gas and particulate emissions to the atmosphere, but estimates of the continental-scale impacts are limited by large uncertainties in the rates of fire occurrence and biomass combustion. Satellite-based remote sensing offers promise for characterizing fire physical properties and impacts on the environment, but currently available sensors saturate over high-radiance targets and provide only indications of regions and times at which fires are extensive and their areal rate of growth as recorded in ash layers. Here we describe an approach combining satellite- and aircraft-based remote sensing with in situ measurements of smoke to estimate emissions from central Brazil. These estimates will improve global accounting of radiation-absorbing gases and particulates that may be contributing to climate change and will provide strategic data for fire management.

TI  - LOCAL ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE AND IT'S BENEFIT TO CONSERVATION PROGRAMS IN INDONESIA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation efforts in Indonesia in the last decade have been using many strategies to integrate Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK). Recognition of the role of local communities and indigenous peoples is part of efforts to mitigate climate change and the current biodiversity crisis. The mapping of the contribution of local ecological knowledge in forest management approaches for biodiversity conservation is very important. This study aims to describes the contribution of local ecological knowledge (LEK) adaptation in conservation programs in Indonesia. This research method uses a qualitative approach with an ethnoecological strategy. The research locations were in three local communities in Indonesia, namely: the Nusa Lembongan community in Bali, the Tobelo community in ecological knowledge contributes to resilience in the face of climate change, and how indigenous peoples ensure harmony between social capital, the forest environment, and forest use can be of particular concern to face the challenge of achieving zero hunger. This is related to forest ecosystems managed by indigenous peoples showing better results in sustainability based on environmental and social sustainability principles. This study shows that forest management processes based on local ecological knowledge (LEK) can be an alternative approach to biodiversity conservation. Local ecological knowledge shows an emphasis on the ongoing process of experience-based knowledge in communities that utilize the environment. The contribution of studies on LEK adaptation as dynamic knowledge can be used as a more flexible conservation approach and evaluation of forest conservation programs in Indonesia in relating to ecosystem adaptation. The finding of this study was important to LEK integration into the conservation program so it will become more adaptive and flexible to the changes. Understanding the dynamic characterization of LEK has benefit to conservation program that is based on community and participatory.

TI  - Impact of Peat Fire on the Soil and Export of Dissolved Organic Carbon in Tropical Peat Soil, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle, and therefore, their stability has important implications for climate change. In this study, we evaluated the effect of fire on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of peat soils in Indonesia for three years following exposure to fire. The results of the thermal analysis suggest that the organic matter contents of surface soils significantly decreased because of peat fires and that charred materials were produced in the subsurface layer of the burned soils. The atomic ratios of the burned soils and the thermally treated samples indicate that the Indonesian peat soils were dehydrated by these low-severity fires. The microbial abundance and phosphatase activity in the burned soils significantly decreased compared to those of the unburned soils. Leaching of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration from the burned soils is lower than that from the unburned soils. The obtained laboratory results indicate that the concentration of the leached DOC increased drastically after heat treatments near the ignition temperature. It was seen that the denaturation of the soil organic matter caused by the heat from the fire accelerates the exodus of organic carbon in peatlands, which contain huge accumulations of carbon.

AB  - Mangrove forests in North Sumatera existed in the east coast of Sumatera Island and are rapidly threatened due to anthropogenic activities such as conversion for aquaculture, oil palm plantation, filling and use of mangrove for urban development. The present study describes the current and first-year evaluation on mangrove restoration and its impact to socio economic-cultural of community in Lubuk Kertang village, Langkat, North Sumatra, Indonesia. The rehabilitation was carried on December 2015 using direct planting of 6,000 Rhizophora apiculata propagules and May 2016 using 5,000 R. apiculata seedlings. The evaluation parameters of mangrove reforestation consist of seedling diameter and height, leaf thickness and number, and seedling growth rate. Ninety-two of 1,124 households were surveyed using Slovin formula to obtain community perspective on the socio-economic-cultural impact of reforestation. Results show that the growth rate for current and first-year evaluation was 93 and 86 %, respectively. By contrast, the height, diameter, and some leaves seedlings planting were shown better than the performance of propagules planting. No change in the green foliage plant thickness between both farming methods. The reforestation affected 71.74, 55.43 and 39.13% of economic, social, and cultural of Lubuk Kertang community, respectively. The data is likely to provide valuable information for mangrove reforestation in North Sumatra.

TI  - Balancing productivity and emissions: the role of Tithonia diversifolia in tropical silvopastoral system
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Approximately 22% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) originate from agriculture and livestock. Therefore, finding alternatives to mitigate these emissions is crucial for the sector. GHG emissions and soil parameters were quantified in an exclusive grass system (EGS) and a silvopastoral system (SPS) over one year in southeastern Brazil, utilizing Tithonia diversifolia. Our objective was to assess in both EGS and SPS the microclimate conditions, GHG emissions, emission intensity, inorganic nitrogen, carbon stock, and fractionate soil organic matter. Four grazing cycles were conducted over one experimental year to measure GHG fluxes, including methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2), from the soil, employing the static chamber technique linked to a cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) analyzer. Soil samples were collected at the end of the experimental period. Treatments were assigned using a completely randomized design with four replicates. GHGs were expressed in CO2 equivalent (CO(2)eq). The soil temperature in the SPS was 0.6 degrees C lower than in the EGS (p = 0.024). Soil carbon variables did not show significant differences between systems. Cumulative emissions in CO(2)eq were comparable among treatments but varied across cycles (p < 0.001). Emission intensity (mg CO(2)eq kg(-1) accumulated forage mass) was lower in SPS than in EGS (p = 0.002). The absence of discernible differences in GHG emissions and soil carbon variables between systems may be attributed to the short-term establishment period. The intensification of the pasture system emerges as a crucial factor in achieving climate change mitigation, and the utilization of T. diversifolia in SPS appears as a promising alternative to increase productivity without increasing emissions.

TI  - Mapping Forest Stability within Major Biomes Using Canopy Indices Derived from MODIS Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation and forest degradation from human land use, including primary forest loss, are of growing concern. The conservation of old-growth and other forests with important environmental values is central to many international initiatives aimed at protecting biodiversity, mitigating climate change impacts, and supporting sustainable livelihoods. Current remote-sensing products largely focus on deforestation rather than forest degradation and are dependent on machine learning, calibrated with extensive field measurements. To help address this, we developed a novel approach for mapping forest ecosystem stability, defined in terms of constancy, which is a key characteristic of long-undisturbed (including primary) forests. Our approach categorizes forests into stability classes based on satellite-data time series related to plant water-carbon relationships. Specifically, we used long-term dynamics of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the canopy (fPAR) and shortwave infrared water stress index (SIWSI) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for the period 2003-2018. We calculated a set of variables from annual time series of fPAR and SIWSI for representative forest regions at opposite ends of Earth's climatic and latitudinal gradients: boreal forests of Siberia (southern taiga, Russia) and tropical rainforests of the Amazon basin (Kayapo territory, Brazil). Independent validation drew upon high-resolution Landsat imagery and forest cover change data. The results indicate that the proposed approach is accurate and applicable across forest biomes and, thereby, provides a timely and transferrable method to aid in the identification and conservation of stable forests. Information on the location of less stable forests is equally relevant for ecological restoration, reforestation, and proforestation activities.

TI  - Can We Simultaneously Restore Peatlands and Improve Livelihoods? Exploring Community Home Yard Innovations in Utilizing Degraded Peatland
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands support the daily needs of people in many villages in Indonesia, including in Central Kalimantan Province. They provide the natural resources to enable fisheries, agriculture, plantations, and forestry. However, peatland utilization comes with various challenges, including fire, soil acidity, inundation, low fertility, and limited choice of suitable species. Many of the current uses of peatland can result in its degradation, oxidation, and increased risk of peat fire. Avoiding further environmental degradation will require the development of new technology that allows the community to both earn a livelihood and protect the peatland. In this study we assessed a range of technologies applied by 14 farmers at Tumbang Nusa village, Central Kalimantan province, in managing degraded peatlands in their home yard for agricultural business. The study shows that for endemic peatland species, good success can be achieved if they are planted directly. However, for species endemic to mineral land, there are four technologies applied by farmers in managing degraded peatland. The choice of technologies is influenced by their economic capacity/cash flow flexibility and their understanding of peatlands. Technologies intended to adapt to land inundation include the use of polybags, development of raised beds, and making peat mounds with mineral soil in the centre. Technologies to address the acidity and soil fertility include amelioration with dolomite lime and fertilizer. The use of polybags filled with peat soil is the easiest technology to adopt and can be conducted by all family members. However, a farmer's choice of technology needs to always consider the potential environmental impacts in addition to increasing soil fertility so that peat conservation is maintained.

TI  - FOREST RESTORATION PROGRESS AND LESSONS LEARNED IN GUNUNG PALUNG NATIONAL PARK, INDONESIA
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoring forests, especially within deforested or degraded protected areas, is critical to prevent global biodiversity loss and climate change. In this article, we explore the current conditions and progress of forest restoration in Gunung Palung National Park in Indonesian Borneo. The aim of this research was to review forest restoration projects and their success in the park, and to analyse lessons learned from those projects. From 2009 till 2018, nearly 5000 ha of damaged forest in Gunung Palung National Park were replanted, but with only a 1% restoration success rate. The main reason for failed restoration is wildfire. We found four issues that should be resolved in forest restoration projects: fire management, weed management, cost calculation and defining an appropriate restoration strategy. Restoration projects in the park have estimated the price per seedling at around USD0.36 to USD0.78 for one year. We proposed a revised price per seedling of USD1 for the first year, with an additional 10 cents per year for the following three years, to account for maintenance and labour costs. One-time projects that focus only on planting are likely to fail, especially without fire prevention management. Successful forest restoration projects should do more than simply planting trees by also including care and maintenance after they are planted. With this in mind, we provide a standardised framework to guide decision-making and successful forest restoration. Our results should help increase forest restoration success, improve sustainability and allow for the persistence of forested landscapes.

TI  - Shrimp ponds lead to massive loss of soil carbon and greenhouse gas emissions in northeastern Brazilian mangroves
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves of the semiarid Caatinga region of northeastern Brazil are being rapidly converted to shrimp pond aquaculture. To determine ecosystem carbon stocks and potential greenhouse gas emissions from this widespread land use, we measured carbon stocks of eight mangrove forests and three shrimp ponds in the Acarau and Jaguaribe watersheds in Ceara state, Brazil. The shrimp ponds were paired with adjacent intact mangroves to ascertain carbon losses and potential emissions from land conversion. The mean total ecosystem carbon stock of mangroves in this semiarid tropical landscape was 413 +/- 94 Mg C/ha. There were highly significant differences in the ecosystem carbon stocks between the two sampled estuaries suggesting caution when extrapolating carbon stock across different estuaries even in the same landscape. Conversion of mangroves to shrimp ponds resulted in losses of 58%-82% of the ecosystem carbon stocks. The mean potential emissions arising from mangrove conversion to shrimp ponds was 1,390 Mg CO(2)e/ha. Carbon losses were largely from soils which accounted for 81% of the total emission. Losses from soils >100cm in depth accounted for 33% of the total ecosystem carbon loss. Soil carbon losses from shrimp pond conversion are equivalent to about 182years of soil carbon accumulation. Losses from mangrove conversion are about 10-fold greater than emissions from conversion of upland tropical dry forest in the Brazilian Caatinga underscoring the potential value for their inclusion in climate change mitigation activities.

TI  - Non-additive effects on plant mixtures flammability in a tropical mountain ecosystem
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Consumability, a component of flammability, describes how well plants burn and may be influenced by species traits and climate change. However, knowledge gaps remain regarding how species mixtures interact and whether non-additive effects are mediated by functional traits and diversity.Aims This study examined the consumability of species mixtures in Brazil's tropical montane grasslands (campos de altitude), focusing on traits and species interactions.Methods Laboratory tests measured remaining biomass (a proxy for consumability) in monospecific and three-species mixtures for seven species. Traits like specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), fuel moisture at ignition (FMCig) and maximum combustion rate (MCR) were assessed, along with functional diversity, to understand their influence on consumability.Results Consumability in species mixtures differed from predictions based on individual species values, indicating non-additive effects. Leptostelma maximum, Pleroma hospita and Chusquea pinifolia, despite low or medium individual consumability, contributed most to mixture consumability. Higher SLA reduced consumability, whereas higher MCR, LDMC and functional index FRich increased it.Conclusions Our results suggest that low-consumability species like L. maximum may reduce fire severity, offering opportunities for fire management in the campos de altitude.Implications These findings highlight the importance of considering species interactions in mixtures and identifying traits that shape plant community flammability.

TI  - Soil carbon pools in different pasture systems
T2  - SPANISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the carbon pools of a tropical soil where the native forest was replaced with different pasture systems. We studied five pasture production systems, including four monoculture systems with forage grasses such as Andropogon, Brachiaria, Panicum, and Cynodon, and an agroforestry system as well as a native vegetation plot. Greater availability of fulvic acid was detected in the agroforestry system as compared with that in the other systems. Higher lability of C was detected in the Andropogon system during the dry and rainy seasons and during the dry season in Cynodon. During the dry season, all pastures systems showed deficits in the net removal of atmospheric CO2. The structure and practices of the agroforestry system enables more carbon to be sequestered in the soil as compared with the monoculture pasture, suggesting that it is an important practice to mitigate climatic change and to improve soil quality.

TI  - Climate risks and vulnerabilities of the Arabica coffee in Brazil under current and future climates considering new CMIP6 models
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The susceptibility to climate change concerns the coffee market worldwide due to possible severe productivity losses. Brazil is the world's largest Arabica coffee producer and has crops in regions considered persistent climate change hotspots. Our study analyzed risks, vulnerabilities, and susceptibilities to pests and diseases in these regions under current and future climates and outlined adaptive measures to reduce future vulnerabilities. Ten risk indicators based on Arabica coffee requirements were proposed: water supply (Iw), base (TIB) and maximum temperature stresses (TImax), which delimit the temperature range where Arabica coffee grows and productivity is penalized outside both ranges, frost stress (TIfrost), diseases such as rust (DIrust), brown eye spot (DIbrown), and Phoma leaf spot (DIphoma), pests such as coffee berry borer (PIberry), coffee leaf miner (PIminer), and yield loss due to water stress (Iyg). Daily near-surface air temperature (minimum, mean, and maximum), relative humidity, precipitation, and global solar radiation were used from 16 General Circulation Models (GCMs) from the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP), which are derived from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) in three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways scenarios (SSP245, SSP370 and SSP585). All risk indicators were calculated for the current climate (1995-2014) and projected for the near (2041-2060), intermediate (2061-2080), and far future (2081-2100) in three SSPs and then classified into five risk classes (very low, low, moderate, high and very high). Our results indicated that due to increases in TImax and Iyg indicators, with high to very high risk in area and magnitude, Arabica coffee plantations will be negatively affected and economically unfeasible for about 35 % to 75 % of the studied area throughout the 21st century. Furthermore, the rust and the leaf miner will remain a concern in future climates due to increased temperatures and reduced relative humidity. The future of Arabica coffee crops in Brazil will depend on adopting effective adaptive measures and prudent agricultural strategies to address anticipated risks, including shifting crops to higher altitude areas, introducing more climate-resilient coffee cultivars/varieties, using agroforestry or intercropping systems, planting in closer spacing or higher density planting, and employing dripper or partial root-zone irrigation techniques.

TI  - 8000 years of vegetation dynamics and environmental changes of a unique inland peat ecosystem of the Jambi Province in Central Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite their importance as global carbon sinks, peatlands of Southeast Asia have been rarely studied and our current knowledge of the dynamics and ecology of these ecosystems remains incomplete. Paleoecological and palynological multi-proxy analyses including analysis of pollen, spores, charcoal, testate amoebae and sediments were carried out on a 733 cm-long core taken from the Air Hitam peatland in the Jambi Province, Central Sumatra, Indonesia. The radiocarbon chronology reveals that peat formation started ca. 7800 years ago. The site was covered by dipterocarp-swamp mixed rainforest during the first 2000 years, after which freshwater swamp taxa became more important, in particular Durio trees. This lasted until ca. 4500 years ago, when the swamp vegetation shifted to a pole forest with abundant Pandanus thickets in response to a system change from minerotrophic to ombrotrophic conditions. For this period, macro-charcoal analysis reveals that fire frequency increased, possibly as a consequence of climate change linked to the onset of the modern El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the late Holocene. The ombrogenous Pandanus-pole forest phases were characterized by lower water table fluctuations and higher peat accumulation rates. The area of Air Hitam has been for thousands of years a highly effective carbon sequestering peatland. Natural climate variability in the past did not affect the carbon storage function as suggested by the general increase in peat accumulation during relatively drier phases and increasing ENSO variability in the late Holocene. However, the recent changes caused by selective logging, drainage and conversion to oil palm plantations, have caused a decline in the peat swamp forest communities changing the ecological functions of the peatland. It is likely that the accumulated carbon will be released in the atmosphere due to exposure to aerobic conditions and its function will be lost unless a better management of the watershed is applied.

TI  - Trends in climate extreme indices assessed in the Xingu river basin Brazilian Amazon
T2  - WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Xingu River Basin (XRB), located in the Brazilian Amazon, is of great importance both in national and international contexts, especially regarding hydroelectric generation in the Belo Monte Hydroelectric Complex and forest conservation policies, given that the XRB is home to important conservation areas, such as the Xingu Indigenous Park. This paper analyzes climate extreme indices in the XRB, a region that lacks this sort of information. Trends in 22 climate extreme indices were evaluated, 11 of them for air temperature and 11 for rainfall, based on spatially gridded and high resolution daily data, for the period from 1980 to 2016. The temperature indices showed significant upward trends in daily temperatures (both maximum and minimum), an indication that, in recent decades, the days and nights have become warmer in the XRB. For rainfall, the indices indicated a downward trend in the central and southern regions of the XRB (Middle and Upper Xingu), and increasing rainfall in the northern region of the basin (Lower Xingu), however, with lower statistical significance when compared to air temperature indices. Commonly, the areas that presented statistically significant trends in the assessed climate extreme indices correspond to areas where there have been alterations in land cover due to increasing use in recent decades (areas of forest that were modified for pasture and agriculture) and in areas still preserved. This paper is an important tool to support decision making in management and strategic planning of water resources (for power generation and multiple uses) and for the elaboration of forest conservation policies (for combatting and controlling deforestation) in the XRB, in times when the region is under constant pressure from agribusiness for the expansion of agriculture and livestock.

TI  - Coastal flood management in Semarang, Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Semarang is one of the biggest cities in Indonesia and is nowadays suffering from coastal flooding. Land subsidences, high water tide, and inadequate structural measures play important roles in the coastal inundations. Structural and non-structural methods for controlling coastal flooding including dykes, drainage systems, pump stations, polder systems, coastal-land reclamations, coastal planning and management, public education, as well as the establishment of an institutional framework for disaster management have been implemented in the Semarang coastal area. Although some improvements have been made, the current flood management system has generally failed to address a wide range of coastal inundation problems. Some improvement actions have been proposed including stakeholders involvement on the disaster mitigation. For a long period coastal management, accelerated sea level rises due to global warming should also be taken into account.

TI  - Impacts of "Reef Star" coral restoration on multiple metrics of habitat complexity
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coral reefs face threats from climate change and local pressures that lead to reductions in their physical structure, impacting biodiversity by limiting habitat availability. Despite many efforts to actively restore damaged reefs, few projects provide thorough evaluations of their success. This study measured the success of the "Reef Star" method at the Mars Coral Reef Restoration Project in Indonesia in reestablishing the physical structure of reef habitats that were destroyed by blast fishing. We used photogrammetry surveys to measure the physical habitat structure of 17 large sites (1000 m2 each), calculating three complementary measures of small- and large-scale habitat complexity across degraded, restored, and naturally healthy coral reefs. We demonstrate that the restoration efforts have successfully restored small-scale habitat complexity, as described by surface complexity metrics (3.22 +/- 0.27 on restored reefs; 2.85 +/- 0.26 on healthy reefs) and fractal dimension (2.27 +/- 0.02 on restored reefs; 2.24 +/- 0.02 on healthy reefs). This demonstrates the capacity for restored reefs to recover important ecosystem functions that are lost in degradation. However, while restoration has delivered some increases in large-scale habitat complexity compared to degraded reefs, restored reefs still exhibit lower values of maximum vertical relief than healthy reefs, due to a lack of large physical structures. This lack of available large-scale habitat might impact fish populations, meaning that restored reefs with limited large-scale complexity may only support a restricted range of ecosystem functions. Effective reef restoration strategies must use a mixture of different methods that target the recovery of structural complexity at multiple scales.

TI  - Spatial planning for restoration in Cerrado: Balancing the trade-offs between conservation and agriculture
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Cerrado, the most biodiverse savanna globally with great importance for water and carbon conservation, faces the impacts of rapid and extensive land conversion, mainly for agricultural uses. The native Cerrado vegetation originally covered an area of 204 Mha however, 43% has been converted to human use. Pastures are the major land use category in Cerrado, covering 57 Mha, 28% of its area. Most of these pastures are underused and present some degree of degradation, representing an opportunity for restoration programs and agriculture expansion without further conversion of natural areas. The restoration of the Cerrado's degraded pastures is a source of recovery of ecosystem services, however, it might involve synergies and trade-offs between ecosystem services and stakeholders. To evaluate potential trade-offs, we modelled seven scenarios for prioritization for restoration, focusing on pasture areas on a biome scale. We considered biodiversity, water-related ecosystem services, potential carbon stock and agriculture aptitude to understand the trade-offs between each feature and the conflicts with agriculture. We also applied the same prioritization logic for one Cerrado ecoregion to understand the importance of planning on a finer scale. We identified important trade-offs between the scenarios, especially with agriculture. The agriculture conflict scenario showed that 16 Mha of areas suitable to agriculture have also a high importance for restoration, representing a gain around 70% in ecosystem services and biodiversity. By refining the spatial scale of the prioritization process, we could also identify local conflicts and demands, which indicates the relevance of a local approach, allowing a more representative cover of the Cerrado's heterogeneity to minimize trade-offs between different demands associated with restoration. Policy implications. The restoration of degraded lands is an international priority to mitigate climate change as well as protect the biodiversity. Our work provides a better understanding of the trade-offs and conflicts involved in the restoration of the Cerrado, a megadiverse savanna with great importance in agriculture. This understanding is key to implementing public policies that enable large-scale restoration projects while optimizing biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services provision and minimizing conflicts with agriculture.

TI  - Regional variation in responses of a vulnerable bird species to land-use and climate change
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate and land-use changes are expected to negatively affect many species and ecological processes, leading to biodiversity loss. However, some species can adapt to these changes. Wide-ranging species are expected to be less impacted by such changes, but they can occur in different domains with contrasting environmental conditions, resulting in different conservation statuses along their range. To understand whether a species will overall benefit or lose with global change, we evaluated the responses of a wide-ranging but a vulnerable bird (Crax fasciolata) to separate and combined effects of climate and land-use changes under different environmental policies in Brazil. Using ecological niche modeling and a land-use model within the Brazilian political context, we quantified climatic, habitat, and environmental suitability for Crax fasciolata under historical (2000) and future (2050) scenarios. Our findings showed that environmental suitability can increase for Crax fasciolata in Brazil in future, but these effects vary according to the domain and the specific future scenario considered. Climatically suitable areas will increase in all scenarios, and those environmental scenarios that include better habitat conditions will provide more environmentally suitable areas for Crax fasciolata. However, this increase comes from newly suitable areas in the Atlantic Forest and the Amazon, while the Pantanal, the Caatinga, and the Cerrado will lose environmental suitability due to native vegetation loss. Despite the availability of these new areas, reduced landscape permeability may hinder Crax fasciolata from reaching them. This reinforces the urgent call for public policies for native vegetation protection, reforestation, and effective deforestation control. Abstract in Portuguese is available with online material

TI  - Morphological and phenological strategies for flooding tolerance in Cerrado and Pantanal trees: implications for restoration under new legislation
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2012, the Native Vegetation Protection Law 12,651 decreased the extent of Areas of Permanent Preservation in Brazil. While previously the distance from water was measured during the rainy season, the new version only considered the extent of the regular watercourse. This change affects conservation and restoration sites, and restoration programs need to be modified based on the new legislation. For instance, more flood-tolerant species need to be planted, given the higher probability that restoration efforts will be lost during flooding. To identify species suitable for the restoration of such areas, we tested if plants that develop morphological structures to tolerate waterlogging stress are more resistant to hypoxia caused by flooding and can recover better afterwards. We experimentally evaluated survival and morphological or phenological strategies (root dry mass, height, basal diameter, adventitious roots, lenticels, and leaf renewal) of 13 tree species from the Cerrado and Pantanal biomes of Brazil. After 56 days of simulated inundation and 56 days of post-inundation recovery, we found that all study species were able to survive on waterlogged soil and to recover after the flood, and they can be used to restore periodically flooded riparian forests within the new legal zone. Our study is particularly relevant, as climate change is expected to increase flooding. As environmental laws change and new areas get restored including those in artificially flooded areas, such as on banks of hydroelectric dams, the experimental approach introduced in this study should be replicated with other species from various phytogeographic domains worldwide.

TI  - Improvement of the ESA CCI Land cover maps for water balance analysis in tropical regions: A case study in the Muda River Basin, Malaysia
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: The Muda River Basin (MRB), Malaysia.Study Focus: This study proposed a framework to improve the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Land Cover (ESA CCI LC) products through the integration with the Annual Oil Palm Dataset (AOPD). The improved land use land cover (LULC) maps were then used to produce five LULC scenarios as input maps into the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model for analyzing the impact of LULC changes on water balance in the MRB.New hydrological insights for the region: The improved LULC maps have good performance in representing rubber and oil palm, with an overall accuracy up to 81 %. In addition, SWAT simulated monthly streamflow well for the MRB, with the highest R-2 and NSE values of 0.84 and 0.86, respectively. During the 2001-2016 period, the MRB experienced an expansion of oil palm from 7.10%-17.36 %, a reduction of rubber from 34.93 % to 26.38 % and a slight decrease in forest from 54.23%-52.80 %. The urban expansion scenario showed significant increment in surface runoff, while the reforestation scenario helped to reduce surface runoff, while increase lateral flow and groundwater. Oil palm expansion led to a higher reduction in lateral flow and groundwater than rubber trees due to the higher soil water absorption rate. The proposed framework can be duplicated and applied in other tropical basins, particularly in Indonesia and Malaysia.

TI  - Effects of ecological intensification of agriculture on soil fertility and carbon and nitrogen stocks: An 8-year study in southern Brazil
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological intensification (EI) of agriculture aims to optimize soil conservation, crop diversity and nutrient management. Despite growing interest in EI, its impact on soil properties, compared with conventional farming practice (FP), remains poorly understood as a result of limited field evidence. This study, conducted over eight seasons in southern Brazil as part of the 'Global Maize Project' of the International Plant Nutrition Institute, evaluated EI compared with FP, and FP with silage (FPS) using a split-plot design. Four nitrogen application rates (0, 70, 140 and 210 kg ha(-1)) were applied to subplots with four replicates. Soil properties were measured to a depth of 1 m. The trial systems consisted of a maize-soybean rotation under no-till during summer and cover crops and fertilizer application during winter. In the FP system, black oats and wheat were cultivated, while FPS utilized white oats and ryegrass. In the EI system, peas (without N application) and wheat were cultivated. In the 4-years preceding the trial, the area was cultivated in a no-till system with maize-soybean during summer and black oat-wheat in winter. Our results reveal distinct differences in soil properties among the systems, with FPS demonstrating greater soil acidity (pH of 4.4 at 0-5 cm) caused by higher N application than FP and EI systems. The lower soil pH altered soil nutrient dynamics, with decreased available Ca, Mg and K and increased Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn. Furthermore, nutrient availability varied, with EI having more inorganic N and DON at 0-40 cm compared with FP, but less in deeper soil (40-100 cm). Notably, EI system had more soil carbon (175 Mg ha(-1)) compared with FP (161 Mg ha(-1)), a relative annual increase of 1.8 Mg ha(-1) year-1 over 8 years. These findings underscore the potential of EI to promote soil carbon, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation and soil health improvement.

TI  - Sustainability approach in cropping intensity (CI) 400 through optimizing the dosage of compost and chemical fertilizers to early-maturing rice varieties based on multivariate analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND FOOD RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of early maturing rice varieties in the cropping intensity 400 program is one of the alternatives in overcoming the challenges of rice production against land conversion and dynamic climate change. Optimi-zation of the program is feasible through composting and reduction of chemical and synthetic substances in order to avoid excessive soil damage. Therefore, evaluation in the combination of compost and chemical fertilizers is important with evaluation criteria through multivariate analysis. This research aimed to identify evaluation criteria, fertilizer packages and potential of early maturing varieties in supporting the cropping intensity 400 concept on rice. This research was conducted in two locations in South Sulawesi, Indonesia with different environmental conditions ... This study employed a nested split-plot design with a group randomized design as the environmental design. The main plot was the fertilizer package (FP) consisting of 5 levels. The subplots consisted of 7 rice varieties. Each combination of fertilizer package and variety was repeated three times. The results showed that reducing the dose of NPK fertilizer together with compost application is generally effective in the growth of early maturing rice. This study also revealed the characters of chlorophyll a, harvest age, panicle length, 1000-grain weight and yield were effective in evaluating the effect of fertilizer packages on early maturing varieties. The 75 % dose of N:P:K and 3 tons.ha(-1) of compost is effective fertilizer packages to the growth and production of early maturing rice in supporting cropping intensity 400. The Cakrabuana, and Inpari 13 varieties are good early maturing varieties used with the FP3 fertilization packages. Conclusively, the results of this research are important for recommending optimization of rice cultivation with the CI 400 concept, especially in the South Sulawesi region.

TI  - Petroleum refining flexibility and cost to address the risk of ethanol supply disruptions: The case of Brazil
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Biofuels' potential supply is uncertain. This uncertainty involves not only the possibility of expanding bio-energetic cultures in the medium term but also the risk of supply disruptions in the short term. These supply disruptions may be mainly caused by climatic conditions, soil management, plagues and diseases, Global Climatic Change (GCC), producers' strategies and other factors. An ethanol supply shock may force the petroleum refining industry to increase its gasoline output or result in an increase in liquid fuel imports. An intersection of both alternatives may also be a solution. This study developed and applied a methodology to evaluate the capacity of petroleum refineries to address unforeseen ethanol supply deficits in the short term. The tool utilized was a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. The methodology was applied to Brazilian refineries system. Findings show that to build catalytic reforming (CR) units to produced additional gasoline volumes during unexpected ethanol supply shortage is not economically attractive. However, these investments can be justified when the probability of ethanol supply loss is high. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Maximum entropy-based forest fire likelihood mapping: analysing the trends, distribution, and drivers of forest fires in Sikkim Himalaya
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent episodes of forest fires in Brazil and Australia of 2019 are tragic reminders of the hazards of forest fire. Globally incidents of forest fire events are on the rise due to human encroachment into the wilderness and climate change. Sikkim with a forest cover of more than 47%, suffers seasonal instances of frequent forest fire during the dry winter months. To address this issue, a GIS-aided and MaxEnt machine learning-based forest fire prediction map has been prepared using a forest fire inventory database and maps of environmental features. The study indicates that amongst the environmental features, climatic conditions and proximity to roads are the major determinants of forest fire. Model validation criteria like ROC curve, correlation coefficient, and Cohen's Kappa show a good predictive ability (AUC = 0.95, COR = 0.81, kappa = 0.78). The outcomes of this study in the form of a forest fire prediction map can aid the stakeholders of the forest in taking informed mitigation measures.

TI  - Optimal management of cattle grazing in a seasonally dry tropical forest ecosystem under rainfall fluctuations
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change will likely trigger shifts in rainfall regimes that may intensify water scarcity in semi-arid regions. In the semi-arid region of Brazil, the seasonally dry ecosystem is the primary source of forage for livestock. Because the correct stocking rate of livestock (animals per area) is not well understood, overgrazing tends to advance rangeland degradation in this ecosystem. This implies that the region may become even more vulnerable under changing rainfall regimes, which in turn may exacerbate livestock and food insecurity. We developed a coupled soil water balance, vegetation, and cattle biomass model to illustrate the impacts of rainfall seasonality on the dynamics of vegetation and animal growth. The outcomes were simulated by considering different stocking rates and the timing of animal placement and removal from the rangeland. A more pronounced reduction in vegetation biomass was found in grazed vs. non-grazed paddocks. Under strongly seasonal rainfall patterns, the maximum animal weight gain decreases with average rainfall inter-arrival time and increases with total annual rainfall. Thus, a forecast of dry spells could benefit farmers in planning grazing management strategies. Our model can be used to test different management scenarios and give feedback for local herders, and to guide future experiments to reduce the time and cost of acquiring data.

TI  - Growth and survival of potential tree species for carbon-offset in degraded areas from southeast Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil must restore 12 million hectares of degraded areas by 2030 to meet its goal of the Paris Global Climate Agreement (PGCA). In view of this, the development of mixed planting projects related to carbon-offset in degraded areas is increasing, which demonstrates environmental and social responsibility of corporate and governmental organizations. Despite the great potential of mixed restoration plantations to mitigate climate change, Brazil must overcome major challenges in achieving the ratified goals of the PGCA as well as the effectiveness of its carbon-offset projects. In this context, this study has focused on the evaluation of the growth and survival of tree species in a carbon-offset plantation from a degraded area in southeastern Brazil. Five-hundred-and-nine seedlings (15 forest species) were planted in a completely randomized design. Diameter at the soil level and height of individuals were measured at 40 months. Three individuals of each species were selected and was scaling by a non-destructive method. Timber volume was estimated from the sum of the volume of the sections of the individuals, obtained by the Smalian formula. The average annual carbon increment of the individuals was estimated by the equation adjusted from the Schumacher & Hall model. The potential of carbon-offset of the tested plants was evaluated from the SP and mu C analysis. The REML (Restricted Maximum Likelihood)/BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) method was used to predict mu C values for species ordering with carbon -offset potential. Survival was 47.54% at 40 months. The carbon stock of the planting was 2.60 +/- 6.2 Kg C individual(-1), and the average annual increase in carbon (AAIC) was 0.78 Kg C individual(-1) year(-1). The AAIC value was lower than the average value stipulated for carbon-offset projects (6.0 Kg CO2 individual(-1) year(-1)). Pioneer species contributed more to carbon storage than non-pioneer species.

TI  - Near-complete loss of fire-resistant primary tropical forest cover in Sumatra and Kalimantan
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation in Indonesia in recent decades has made increasingly large parts of the region vulnerable to fires. Burning is particularly widespread in deforested peatlands, and it leads to globally significant carbon emissions. Here we use satellite-based observations to assess loss and fragmentation of primary forests and associated changes in fire regimes in Sumatra and Kalimantan between 2001 and 2019. We find that fires did not penetrate undisturbed primary forest areas deeper than two kilometres from the forest edge irrespective of drought conditions. However, fire-resistant forest now covers only 3% of peatlands and 4.5% of non-peatlands; the majority of the remaining primary forests are severely fragmented or degraded due to proximity to the forest edge. We conclude that protection and regeneration of the remaining blocks of contiguous primary forest, as well as peatland restoration, are urgently needed to mitigate the impacts of potentially more frequent fire events under future global warming.

TI  - Improvement of thermal comfort indices in agroforestry systems in the southern Brazilian Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems can minimize heat stress and improve cattle welfare, but the influence of the forest component in micmclimatic changes in the southern Amazon remains unclear. This study aimed to compare the thermal comfort indices in grass monoculture and integrated systems. The three systems were pasture under full sunlight (PFS), integrated (triple-row) livestock-forestry (ILFT), and integrated (single-row) livestock-forestry (ILFs), across four seasons, for two years, from June 2017 to June 2019. We assessed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), air temperature, relative humidity, black globe temperature, and wind speed. Thermal comfort indices such as temperature-humidity index (THI), black globe temperature-humidity index (BGHI), and radiant thermal load (RTL) were calculated based on microclimate data daily-collected from 8:00 to 16:00. The ILFT mean THI (76.8) was slightly lower than ILFS and PFS. The BGHI and RTL values decreased as shading increased (PFS > ILFs > ILFT). The most challenging heat stress conditions for grazing animals occurred predominately during winter and autumn. In conclusion, the presence of trees in pastures of the southern Amazon improved the microclimate and, consequently, the thermal comfort indices. Agroforestry systems can foster an environment with a more suitable thermal comfort or less restrictive to animal performance, which contribute to mitigating global climate change for forage-livestock systems in Brazilian Amazon.

TI  - Eucalyptus Carbon Stock Research in an Integrated Livestock-Forestry System in Brazil
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Eucalyptus plantations play an important role in capturing and storing atmospheric carbon, mitigating global climate change. Forest management policies encouraging integrated livestock-forestry systems require quantitative estimates of temporal and spatial patterns of carbon storage for these agricultural systems. This study quantified the effects of eucalyptus management and arrangement on carbon stock dynamics in integrated livestock-forestry (ILF) systems versus monoculture eucalyptus plantings. Arrangement and management resulted in equal storage of carbon in both monoculture and ILF systems (34.7 kg per tree). Both factors are important to better understand how forest species in integrated systems stock carbon and how this can compensate for other agricultural system components, such as cattle. The extent to which ILF systems offset beef cattle (Nellore) emissions was determined by estimating changes in carbon stock over time for Eucalyptus urophylla x E. grandis, clone H13, under three scenarios (S) of wood use. These scenarios were (S1) tree growth without thinning, (S2) trees used for biomass energy without thinning, and (S3) 50% of trees used for biomass energy at five years old and 50% of trees used for both timber and energy after eight years, considering the full life cycle of eucalyptus. The S1 and S3 systems can stock 510 and 73 metric tons (t) of CO2 ha(-1), respectively, while S2 emits 115 t CO2 ha(-1) of biogenic carbon.

TI  - Soil organic matter quality along rotations in acacia and eucalypt plantations in the Congolese coastal plains
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Afforestation of savannas in the Congolese coastal plains with eucalypt has provided wood pulp for industry and fuel energy for the local population. Typically, following afforestation, Acacia mangium are introduced to improve soil fertility and sustain productivity. Through investigations of particulate organic matter (POM), potential soil organic matter (SOM) quality was assessed in acacia and eucalypt plantations along rotations. Methods Nutrients in POM (4000-50 mu m) in the 0-5 cm soil layer were measured after five years into the second rotation (R2Y5) in relation to soil pH and P availability. Data were compared to those at the end of the first 7-year-rotation (R1Y7) and after two years into the second rotation (R2Y2) to evaluate overall SOM quality in the topsoil. Results At R2Y5, soil pH was higher in the pure eucalypt stands (100E) than in stands containing acacia, either in monoculture (100A) or evenly mixed with eucalypt (50A50E). Coarse POM (cPOM, 4000-250 mu m) beneath 100A had the highest N concentration (1.71%), followed by those beneath 50A50E (1.42%) and 100E (1.30%). Higher N was always found in the stands containing acacia. Lower sulphur (S) concentrations and P availabilities were observed in cPOM (50A50E). The greatest amount of coarse (414.7 g) and fine (214.5 g) forest floor litter were found in 100A stands, whereas higher C concentrations were found in the 100E stands for coarse forest floor litter (36.5%) and in the 50A50E stands for fine forest floor litter (38.7%). The decrease in cPOM N and C concentrations were lower than 20% (R1Y7) and 26% (R2Y5) relative to the younger stage (R2Y2). This tendency was more pronounced in fine POM (250-50 mu m) and organo-mineral fraction (< 50 mu m). Conclusions The main changes occurred in cPOM beneath stands containing acacia while higher weight of forest floor litter was found in 100A. Soil pH decreased in stands containing acacia. Overall N and C dynamics was enhanced in older stands (R2Y5) than in the younger stands (R2Y2). This may reveal a creation of more labile SOM with lower N and C concentrations in POM fractions in the surface layer, i.e., an ecosystem with a lower potential to mitigate climate change along rotations.

TI  - Microtopographic specialization and flexibility in tropical peat swamp forest tree species
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical tree species distributions are determined by a wide range of biotic and abiotic factors, including topography and hydrology. Tropical peat swamp forests (TPSFs) are characterized in part by small-scale variations in topography ('hummocks' and 'hollows') that create distinct microhabitats and thus may contribute to niche diversification among TPSF tree species. Using tree elevations calibrated to daily peat water levels collected using a data logger and a permutation test, we evaluated topographical microhabitat preferences for 21 tree species in a relatively undisturbed TPSF in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, to determine whether these species show preferential association with hummocks or hollows and to quantify the prevalence of microhabitat specialization among them. Only one species, Tetractomia tetrandrum, emerged as a hollow specialist, with no hummock specialists among the species tested. The remaining 20 species, including Psydrax dicoccos, which had the lowest mean observed elevation, and Maasia hypoleuca, which had the highest mean observed elevation, showed no clear microtopographic preference. This suggests that many TPSF species may be resilient to the natural hydrologic variations that occur in relatively intact peat swamp forests. Such studies of microtopographic preferences of tree species in TPSF and other wetland forest ecosystems can inform selection of tree species for reforestation projects, and potentially also provide information on how future climate change may impact these habitats and their resident tree species.

TI  - Sources of soil organic carbon under Eucalyptus silvopastures and other land-use systems in Brazilian Oxisols
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Silvopastoral systems (SPS) incorporating non-native tree species such as Eucalyptus are increasingly being adopted in the Cerrado region of Brazil. The climate-change mitigation potential of the practice, although hypothesized, has not been assessed vigorously. The objective of this research was to measure the extent of SOC accumulation under SPS involving C3 and C4 plants and other prevalent land-use systems in an Oxisol-dominated location in Minas Gerais, Brazil. We determined the overall delta 13C in three soil fraction-size groups within six land-use systems. These systems consisted of 8-year-old planted forests, native forest, managed pastures, and three variations of 8-year-old SPS with diverse tree-planting layouts. In the SPS and planted forest treatments, the tree species was Eucalyptus hybrid, and Urochloa decumbens was the grass species in the SPS and pasture treatments. For each treatment, soil samples were collected at depths of 0-10, 10-30, 30-60, and 60-100 cm. These samples were fractionated into three size classes (2000-250 mu m, 250-53 mu m, and <53 mu m) and analyzed for delta 13C. The native forest had higher C3 contribution in the topsoil layers. The highest C3 derived SOC stock up to 1 m depth was in the pasture (137 Mg ha(-1)), and the lowest in the forest (74 Mg ha(-1)). The pasture also had the highest C4 derived SOC stock and the forest the lowest, but not significantly. The SPS had intermediate values. We infer that the study site had a mixed vegetation in the past, and after the conversion of the land to planted forest/SPS/pasture, the "native" SOC stock could be maintained better in a well-managed pasture than in a degraded native forest. The higher C3-derived SOC stock in the pasture treatment suggests that managed SPS could help retain more soil C in a stable form than in degraded forests.

TI  - Land suitability modeling integrating geospatial data and artificial intelligence
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: Sustainable agricultural practices are critical in a world grappling with climate change and pressure on natural resources. Unplanned agricultural expansion often harms ecosystems and the services they provide. Balancing food production with environmental protection demands sophisticated tools like spatial analysis and artificial intelligence to inform land-use decisions. Objective: This study introduces an AI-driven process to assess land suitability for agrosilvopastoral systems, going beyond traditional methods by incorporating a broader spectrum of landscape characteristics. Our approach integrates climate, water resources, soil properties, morphological features, and accessibility to enhance the accuracy of suitability mapping. Methods: We constructed a data cube comprising 100 geospatial layers representing diverse landscape attributes. Field observations from two watersheds in Minas Gerais, Brazil, were used to train and validate a Random Forest classification model. We evaluated the model's accuracy and quantified the influence of each attribute group on suitability determination. Results: Integrating climate, water, edaphic, and morphological attributes significantly improved the model's accuracy and provided a more nuanced understanding of agrosilvopastoral suitability compared to using only soil class, lithology, and slope. Climate and edaphic variables emerged as key drivers of suitability. This approach identified a more constrained, yet potentially more sustainable, distribution of suitable land. Significance: Our findings highlight the need to transition from conventional land suitability assessments towards more holistic, data-driven approaches that consider the complex interplay of environmental factors. This model offers a valuable tool for guiding sustainable land-use planning, potentially mitigating environmental impacts while optimizing agrosilvopastoral production.

TI  - Unveiling African rainforest composition and vulnerability to global change
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Africa is forecasted to experience large and rapid climate change(1) and population growth(2) during the twenty-first century, which threatens the world's second largest rainforest. Protecting and sustainably managing these African forests requires an increased understanding of their compositional heterogeneity, the environmental drivers of forest composition and their vulnerability to ongoing changes. Here, using a very large dataset of 6 million trees in more than 180,000 field plots, we jointly model the distribution in abundance of the most dominant tree taxa in central Africa, and produce continuous maps of the floristic and functional composition of central African forests. Our results show that the uncertainty in taxon-specific distributions averages out at the community level, and reveal highly deterministic assemblages. We uncover contrasting floristic and functional compositions across climates, soil types and anthropogenic gradients, with functional convergence among types of forest that are floristically dissimilar. Combining these spatial predictions with scenarios of climatic and anthropogenic global change suggests a high vulnerability of the northern and southern forest margins, the Atlantic forests and most forests in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where both climate and anthropogenic threats are expected to increase sharply by 2085. These results constitute key quantitative benchmarks for scientists and policymakers to shape transnational conservation and management strategies that aim to provide a sustainable future for central African forests.A large dataset of 6 million trees from 193 taxa is used to map the floristic and functional composition of central African forests and predict their vulnerability to climate change.

TI  - SCENARIOS FOR MITIGATING GREENHOUSE GASES EMISSIONS AND PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT IN BRAZIL
T2  - INTERCIENCIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents the methodology and results of a study carried out by the Energy and Environmental Planning Program of the Center for Postgraduate Studies in Engineering of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (PPE/ COPPE/UFRJ). An estimate elaborated by PPE/COPPE/UFRJ of Brazilian CO2 emissions due to energy consumption from 1970 to 1990 is presented initially. It is shown that Amazon deforestation is today the largest contributor to the greenhouse effect in Brazil, In the long run, however, emissions from the energy system (due to the burning of oil products, natural gas, coal and coke, wood, and charcoal) are bound to increase and overtake CO, emissions from deforestation.This study evaluates three scenarios of the long-run evolution of Brazilian economic and energy sectors; the scenarios were formulated by PPE/COPPE/UFRJ. The possibility of halving future CO2 emissions (resulting from fossil fuel energy consumption) with small increases of costs and investments linked to the energy sector is illustrated. This abatement scenario would require dramatic efforts to promote energy conservation On the supply side of the Brazilian energy balance, efforts would need to be made to promote the use of alternative fuels such as hydropower, ethanol and bagasse from sugar cane, wood and charcoal from afforestation programmers.However, recent trends in Brazilian energy policy do not coincide with the above abatement scenario due to the lack of ability to fund capital-intensive projects. The transfer of an adequate amount of financial resources from industrialized countries in appropriate soft terms is thus required in order for the Brazilian energy system to curb the greenhouse effect.Vast opportunities exist for a positive working relationship between both sustainable energy development strategies derived from national objectives and the prevention of global climate change. To this end, policies to tap the renewable energy potential should include appropriate measures to minimize any negative social and ecological impacts at the local and regional levels, as well as demonstrating their economic cost-effectiveness.Mechanisms adopted to implement the Convention on Global Climate Change signed an June 1992 during the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, such as the Global Environment Facility (GEF), should support the viability of these strategies in Brazil, as well as in other developing countries.

TI  - Soybean yield in the Matopiba region under climate changes
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The climatic conditions along the cycle are the main factors responsible for the final production of any crop. This study aimed to evaluate the current conditions and the effects of climate change scenarios on the yield of soybean grown in the Matopiba region, located between the states of Tocantins, south and northeast of Maranhao, south of Piaui and west of Bahia, Brazil. The AquaCrop model of FAO, version 5.0, was calibrated with data of 2014 and validated with those of 2016, using climate, soil and crop management parameters collected in two experimental campaigns conducted between June and October in 2014 and 2016 in Palmas, TO, Brazil. The performance of the model was evaluated using the following statistical indicators: prediction error (PE), coefficient of determination (R-2), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (EF) and Willmott's index of agreement (d). It was verified that the AquaCrop model underestimates soybean grain yield under severe water stress conditions throughout the growing cycle. The increase in CO2 concentration and in the air temperature, projected by the climate models HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5 under the scenario of stabilization (RCP 4.5) and the scenario of progression (RCP 8.5), have contributed to the increase in soybean yield by the end of this century.

AB  - Due to the issue of climate change as a public concern, information of carbon stock availability play an important role to describe the condition of forest ecosystems in the context of sustainable forest management. This study has the objective to identify land cover change during 2 decades (1996 - 2016) in the forest region and estimate the value of forest carbon stocks in west Java Province using remote sensing imagery. The land cover change information was obtained by visually interpreting the Landsat image, while the estimation of the carbon stock value was performed using the transformation of the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) which extracted from Landsat image. Biomass value is calculated by existing allometric equations. The results of this study shows that the forest area in the forest region of West Java Province have decreased from year to year, and the estimation value of forest carbon stock in the forest region of West Java Province also decreased from year to year.

TI  - Smallholders' perspectives, motivations, and incentives for restoring the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem restoration, recognized as a critical strategy for climate change adaptation and mitigation, faces significant challenges in achieving widespread implementation. A particular facet of this challenge lies in the active involvement of rural landowners. Our study aimed to understand rural landowners' perspectives, motivations, and characteristics that influence their participation in restoration projects in the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil. Qualitative content analysis was conducted on 68 semi-structured interviews with two groups of landowners: 36 who received support and 32 who did not receive project support from a local non-governmental organization to restore native forests on their landholdings. Approximately three-quarters of the sample are classified as smallholders (<80 ha). The main difference between the two groups is the dependence on agricultural production as the main source of income, with 22% of farmers in the supported group and 72% in the unsupported group. This socio-economic characteristic appeared to influence the decision to restore native forest. Farmers' focus tends to be linked to rural production, and the main obstacle to restoration was the loss of productive land. They usually allow natural forest regeneration to establish on slopes. The other type of landowner (lifestylers) mainly restored land through planting of seedlings, with the main barrier being the cost of restoration. Both groups had water conservation as their main motivation for restoration. Our study shows that understanding the perspectives and motivations of the diversity of rural landowners is crucial to effectively engage them and address the socio-economic feasibility of different restoration approaches.

TI  - Monitoring soil quality changes in diversified agricultural cropping systems by the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) in southern Brazil
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment and monitoring impacts of agricultural systems on soil quality are imperative to establish best management practices and sustainable land use for mitigating climate change, conserving biodiversity and achieving food and energy security. The SMAF has successfully been tested as an objective tool to quantify land use and management effects on soil quality, including under some Brazilian soil conditions. Nevertheless, the SMAF potential to properly address soil quality changes under contrasting soil and climate conditions, and integrated farming systems must still must be investigated. Thus, a field study was conducted to apply the SMAF guidelines as a strategy for assessing land use (native vegetation, pasture, sugarcane, no-tillage, and integrated crop-livestock systems) effects on soil quality in southern Brazil. Soil samples were taken in three layers (0.0-0.10, 0.10-0.20, 0.20-0.30 m) of clay Ferralsol (traditional agricultural region), Sandy loam Ferralsol and Arenosol (new agricultural frontiers), in the state of Parana, Brazil. The soil quality indicators investigated were: chemical attributes (pH, phosphorus and potassium), physical (bulk density) and biological (soil organic carbon). Using the SMAF scoring curves, the measured values were transformed (0 to 1 range) and an overall soil quality index (SQI) was calculated. Our findings revealed that long-term conversion from native vegetation to agricultural land uses (i.e., pasture, no-tillage/integrated crop-livestock system, or sugarcane) reduced soil quality assessed by SMAF scores, compromising the soil's capacity to perform its functions. Nevertheless, conservationist systems, e.g. the no-tillage, associated or not with the integrated crop-livestock system are promising alternative to enhances soil quality by increasing C content and soil chemical fertility compared to degraded pasture or conventional sugarcane cultivation. However, soil physical changes should be monitored to alleviate soil compaction in no-tillage cropping systems. In conclusion, this study provided important insights about soil quality changes induced by land use and diversified cropping systems. In that direction, new studies including a large number of sites, soil types and cropping systems are needed for validating our conclusions in a regional scale, enabling to support decision-making towards more sustainable expansion and intensification of agriculture in Brazil.

TI  - Methane and Carbon Dioxide Production and Emission Pathways in the Belowground and Draining Water Bodies of a Tropical Peatland Plantation Forest
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands are crucial yet vulnerable carbon stores. Here, we investigated carbon biogeochemical processes in tropical peatlands converted to plantations. We measured carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) concentrations, stable isotope ratios and radiocarbon content in an experimental Acacia crassicarpa plantation in Sumatra, Indonesia. We found exceptionally high levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), CO2, and CH4 in porewater and drainage networks, indicating that Acacia plantations are carbon hotspots due to their high productivity and exposed carbon-dense substrates. Stable isotope models revealed that while CO2 and CH4 are produced belowground, CH4 contribution was lower than in natural undrained peatlands. Radiocarbon analysis suggested that remobilized carbon contributed to the carbon pool, with a median age of similar to 470 years before present. These findings constrain the links between land-use, water table levels, and carbon dynamics, with implications for carbon management in plantation peatlands.

TI  - A machine learning approach for country-level deployment of greenhouse gas removal technologies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - The suitability of countries to deploy five greenhouse gas removal technologies was investigated using hierarchical clustering machine learning. These technologies include forestation, enhanced weathering, direct air carbon capture and storage, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and biochar. The use of this unsupervised machine learning model greatly minimises the likelihood of human bias in the assessment of GGR technology deployment potentials and instead takes a more holistic view based on the applied data. The modelling utilised inputs of bio-geophysical and techno-economic factors of 182 countries, with the model outputs highlighting the potential performance of these GGR methods. Countries such as USA, Canada, Brazil, China, Russia, Australia as well as those within the EU and Sub-Saharan Africa were identified as key areas suitable to deploy these GGR technologies. The level of certainty of the obtained deployment suitability categorisation ranged from 65 to 98 %. While the results show the need for regional collaboration between nations, they also highlight the necessity for nations to prioritise and integrate GGR technologies in their revised nationally determined contributions.

TI  - Understanding community awareness of seagrass ecosystem services for their blue carbon conservation in marine protected areas: A case study of Karimunjawa National Park
T2  - ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrasses provide diverse ecosystem services that support communities, yet, they are among the most threatened marine habitats. Efforts to conserve and sustainably manage seagrasses are increasing, particularly amidst the era of climate change, in which they play a critical role. However, these activities often received less attention or were slow in gaining momentum partly due to a lack of societal recognition of seagrasses and their importance. Thus, in this study, we collected community perceptions of seagrass ecosystem services and threats from 391 respondents in Karimunjawa National Park (KNP), a nationally declared protected area in Indonesia. We aim to provide insights on people's recognition of seagrasses from a local scale with strict protection measures. Overall, respondents showed varying perceptions of seagrass ecosystem services, with provisioning services more highly perceived than regulating services. The perceived level of threats was inconclusive, though, reclamation along shorelines received higher rates (leaning toward most damaging) than other threats such as natural disasters and illegal fishing activities. Sociodemographic attributes of respondents were found to influence their perceptions, with occupation as the most pronounced driving factor. The variations observed in seagrass perceptions suggest that there is a need to strengthen and/or enhance seagrass awareness and education campaigns, which is in line with the increasing demand that public perceptions matter for the conservation and sustainable management of seagrass ecosystems. We presented here the use and insights of community perceptions for seagrass blue carbon conservation in KNP, and consequently in Indonesia, where seagrass meadows are considered globally important carbon sinks.

TI  - Dynamics of local governance: The case of peatland restoration in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2016, peatland restoration policy is implemented in Central Kalimantan province through facilitation and coordination by Peat Restoration Agency (Badan Restorasi Gambut [BRG]), with the goals of reducing the peat subsidence, greenhouse gas emissions, and vulnerability to fire of peat areas. After years of implementation, local peat fires persist, however, and knowledge is still lacking about the challenges and opportunities for supporting the restoration process. This study examines policy implementation from the perspective of regional stakeholders by unraveling the dynamics of stakeholder interactions associated with the policy process. It reveals that the current state of governance somewhat restricts the ability of restoration actors to adaptively address emerging policy challenges and proposes measures for addressing these challenges.

TI  - Crop, livestock, and forestry integration to reconcile soil health, food production, and climate change mitigation in the Brazilian Cerrado: A review
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrated crop-livestock (ICL) and crop-livestock-forestry (ICLF) systems have been widely adopted in the Brazilian Cerrado. In this study, we gathered the publications regarding the effects of the ICL and ICLF systems on soil health, plant and animal production, and carbon (C) balance and then synthesized them in comparable terms, aiming to evaluate the sustainability of these systems in a broader and comprehensive approach. On the basis of the evidence from 65 peer-reviewed publications, it was observed that adopting integrated systems can improve soil health in the Brazilian Cerrado. With a few exceptions, positive effects on chemical, physical, and biological indicators of soil health were observed in most of the studies that comprised our data. Accordingly, the results showed that the ICL and ICLF systems can improve plant yield and animal production, but special attention regarding the grazing regime and tree management (e.g., spacing, pruning, and thinning) is required. Moreover, soil C accumulation fully offsets soil N2O emissions, underscoring the feasibility of using the ICL and ICLF systems for decreasing the C footprint of agricultural commodities in this region. The research assembled in this review has undoubtedly advanced our knowledge regarding integrated systems in the Brazilian Cerrado. However, there are still significant knowledge gaps that should be addressed, such as their effects on soil physics and biology. Despite these shortcomings, our literature review demonstrates that the ICL and ICLF systems are essential strategies to intensify agricultural production in the Brazilian Cerrado while ensuring sustainability.

CL  - Univ Hasanuddin, Foresty Fac, Makassar, INDONESIA
AB  - Knowledge of the variation of potential carbon stocks in different types of forests provides information about the capabilities of each forest type in dealing with climate change mitigation. This research was conducted to determine the dynamics of carbon stocks in gofasa plantation community forests and compared to other land use systems in South Sulawesi. The research used sample plots 20 m x 50 m to measure tree biomass and 1 m x 1 m sub plots for undergrowth and litter. The results of the study indicated that there were variations of potential carbon stocks in plantation community forests and agroforestry. Carbon stocks in plantation community forest were varied according to the condition and age of forest stand. The total aboveground carbon stocks in homogenous gofasa stand ranged from 22.34 to 52.65 ton/ha by the difference in stand ages, while in mixed community forest was 77.60 ton/ha. As for agroforestry system, the carbon stocks ranged from 46.40 to 65.89 ton/ha. The dynamics of variations in carbon stocks in plantation community forest and agroforestry were determined by several variables such as species composition, stand age, and stand density. Therefore, a good management of community forests and agroforestry systems will ensure the mitigation of climate changes and environmental preservation through effective carbon storage.

TI  - High greenhouse gas emissions mitigation benefits from mangrove rehabilitation in Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves have generated considerable interest in forest carbon discourse given their disproportionately high carbon storage and sequestration potential compared to terrestrial habitats. Capitalising on this potential, however, remains largely unrealised due in part to an incomplete understanding of the full greenhouse gas mitigation benefits provided, particularly through changes in landuse where aquaculture ponds are converted back to mangroves. Here we address such uncertainties by estimating the overall net greenhouse offset potential from rehabilitating mangroves in Tiwoho, North Sulawesi (Indonesia). Estimates of both baseline emissions and sequestration as mangrove forests regrow after rehabilitation were assessed, with results contrasted against published data on established mangroves and terrestrial forest carbon projects registered with the Verified Carbon Standard. Additionally, net emissions removals and reductions from Tiwoho is scaled-up to the national level in order to estimate the contribution rehabilitation of disused ponds can make to climate change mitigation. We also monetarise potential returns generated to date and frame this against project implementation and opportunity costs. Our data indicates that, on average, Tiwoho's rehabilitating sites could potentially mitigate upwards of -27.6 +/- 1.7 Mg CO2-e per hectare per year. This is upwards of 3 times that of other terrestrial forestry carbon projects and, assuming a voluntary carbon market price of USD $8.1 per Mg CO2-e per hectare for afforestation/reforestation projects, equates to recuperation of 76.2% of initial project implementation costs over approximately 10 years with an annual return of 7.6%. This return rate rivals that of most asset classes targeted by private sector investors. Scaling results to encompass the net emissions removals and reduction potential from rehabilitating the similar to 600, 000 hectares of disused ponds in Indonesia may offset upwards of -16.56 +/- 1.02 million Mg CO2-e per hectare per year. Additionally, mitigation benefits from rehabilitation may equate to 6 times that of terrestrial projects if situated in ponds displaying both high baseline emissions and high rates of re-growth whilst accounting for sequestration from benthic algae and the oceanic burial of dissolved inorganic carbon. These findings strengthen the evidence base needed for public and private sector support for mangrove rehabilitation within the forest carbon sector.

TI  - The effect of reclamation on the significant wave height changes in Jakarta Bay during Hagibis and Mitag typhoons
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN ENGINEERING AND MARINE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The intensity and frequency of extreme events due to climate change in the future will most likely increase, as suggested in the sixth IPCC assessment report. Climate change has been propounded as one of the prominent causes of the ocean's extreme events, particularly those associated with atmosphere-sea interaction occurring in the tropical region of Indonesia. A typhoon is an extreme event that forms in the Western North Pacific Ocean and causes changes in oceanographic parameters in a region far from its origin point. Thus, the goal of this study is to investigate how extreme events like Hagibis and Mitag typhoons affect the Significant Wave Height (SWH) in Jakarta Bay, particularly in the reclamation areas. SWH changes in Jakarta Bay due to the reclamation of Kita, Maju, and Bersama coastal areas have been simulated during both typhoons from 19th to 27th November 2007. The simulation was run from 1st October to 31st December 2007 using the Simulating WAve Nearshore (SWAN) model, and it was performed for two scenarios of pre-reclamation and post-reclamation. The analysis used a lagged correlation between wind speed magnitude in the study area within the South China Sea (SCS) and Indonesian Archipelago and SWH in Jakarta Bay from 19th November to 13th December 2007. It was found that the amplification of SWH changes in Jakarta Bay was associated with swell propagation from the SCS and Philippines, where Hagibis and Mitag typhoons were formed. The result exhibited that the most affected SWH due to the peak phase of Hagibis and Mitag typhoons (23rd November 2007) in Jakarta Bay was after an 11-day travel time, which was on 4th December 2007 compared to other dates. Hence, SWH during post-reclamation with regard to the three established reclamation areas (Kita, Maju, and Bersama coastal areas) responded to changes in SWH in Jakata Bay by up to 38.82% and down to 1.75% in Maju and Kita coastal areas, respectively.

TI  - Challenges and opportunities for large-scale reforestation in the Eastern Amazon using native species
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reforestation and forest restoration are recognized as an effective means of halting biodiversity loss and increasing the performance of ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and the protection and maintenance of water resources. The objective of this review is to describe the main challenges and opportunities for large-scale forest restoration and reforestation using native species in the Amazon, focusing on Para state and the Itacaiunas watershed. Large-scale forest restoration and reforestation in the Eastern Amazon may contribute to meeting national and global restoration commitments and reducing/eliminating the actual forest deficit caused by noncompliance with the Brazilian Native Vegetation Protection Law, concomitantly mitigating impacts on climate change, enhancing ecosystem services (e.g., protection of water resources and reduction of soil erosion) and maintaining biodiversity. The selection of active and passive reforestation approaches depends on land-use history, landscape context and reforestation targets, and the promotion of natural regeneration reduces implementation costs. To measure the ecological and socioeconomic success of forest restoration and reforestation, a large number of on-the-ground and remote indicators are available, and the use of a combination of both methods can reduce the monitoring cost. The socioeconomic benefits of reforestation include financial gains from restoration and carbon programs; furthermore, the commercialization of timber and non-timber products and their use for subsistence may improve livelihoods and farm incomes. Nevertheless, implementation of large-scale reforestation in the Eastern Amazon requires research regarding the selection and the nutritional demands of native species and the development of adequate soil management strategies that promote the growth of native species and yields. The insufficient availability of seeds and seedlings is a major bottleneck for large-scale forest restoration and reforestation with native species. Thus, increasing the availability, diversity and quality of seedlings and seeds of native species to supply the demand for planting activities, as well as the registration of producers in the National Register of Seeds and Seedlings, is necessary to achieve compliance with national legislation and international commitments. Competition between reforestation and the expansion of agricultural and cattle ranching frontiers combined with a lack of markets for commercial products from restored areas constrains the socioeconomic viability of large-scale reforestation. To outweigh deforestation incentives, regulation and effective implementation of markets and programs such as REDD+, CDM and PES is thus paramount. To enhance the integration of human well-being, socioeconomic enhancements and ecological functionality, forest and landscape restoration concepts offer promising tools for the region.

TI  - Diversity of wild yams (Dioscorea spp., Dioscoreaceae) collected in continental Africa
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant genetic resources, especially crop wild relatives like wild yams, are under high risks of extinction due to habitat loss, climate change, unacceptable collection practices, shifting cultivation practice and over-exploitation. To contribute to their conservation, the diversity of wild yams (Dioscorea spp.) collected in continental Africa was analyzed. Specimens from Herbaria (B, BR, K, P, WAG and YA), databases, literature and actual collection from Cameroon were considered. The collection localities were georeferenced and projected to Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection. Spatial analyses of sampling and diversity were conducted at three different resolutions: 50 9 50-, 100 9 100- and 150 9 150-km sized grid cells. Four thousand and eighty-seven specimens, collected in 2895 localities, were inventoried and grouped into 55 taxa including 43 species, five subspecies, four varieties and seven morpho-species. The genus Dioscorea occurred in fifteen out of the eighteen phytochoria recognized on African mainland. The Guineo-Congolian regional centre of endemism was the most sampled and the richest phytochorion with 28 taxa. In terms of floristic composition, the Sudanian regional centre of endemism and the Guinea-Congolia/Sudania regional transition zone were the most similar (similarity coefficient SCi = 0.84). Globally, the most diversified grid cells were located in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, CAR, Congo, DRC, Tanzania and Malawi. In terms of phytogeography, they were found in two regional centres of endemism (Guineo-Congolian and Zambezian), two regional transition zones (Guinea-Congolia/Zambezia and GuineaCongolia/ Sudania) and one regional mosaic (Zanzibar-Inhambane). These areas could therefore be considered as potential sites for in situ conservation of wild yams in continental Africa.

TI  - Impacts of landscape-scale forest loss and a dry event on the demographic structure of the endangered palm Euterpe edulis Mart. in the Atlantic Forest
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest loss is one of the most serious threats to biodiversity in the tropics and mainly occurs due to the conversion of native forests by the expansion of human activities. In addition, regional climate change is likely to adversely affect the remaining biota. These disturbances may have direct or indirect consequences on the demographic structure of plant species in human-modified landscapes. To test this hypothesis, and thus look for management practices aimed at enhancing the population viability, we used the palm species Euterpe edulis Mart. (Arecaceae) to assess the demographic structure of five ontogenetic stages prior (2014) and after (2017) a prolonged drought event (2015) that occurred in the northeastern Atlantic Forest of Brazil. We also investigated the influence of landscape forest cover on the ontogenetic demographic structure, given that forest remnants were embedded within landscapes ranging from 6 to 97% of forest amount. We revealed that forest cover was a key predictor explaining the abundance patterns of E. edulis, with all ontogenetic stages (except seedlings, immature, and adults) exhibiting lower abundance in forest remnants surrounded by lower amount of native forests. Conversely, the regional drought event unaffected the demographic structure of this palm species, which may suggest that populations of E. edulis were able to cope with an isolated, though severe, drought event. The impacts of forest loss on E. edulis demographic structure, particularly on juveniles, raises a concern about the future persistence of E. edulis populations, since the early stages represent the adult generation in the near future. Management measures, including species reintroduction, forest restoration, environmental education programmes and the enforcement of environmental laws must be encouraged to safeguard E. edulis populations in the Atlantic Forest.

TI  - Simulating soil C dynamics under intensive agricultural systems and climate change scenarios in the Matopiba region, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent agricultural expansion in the Matopiba region, Brazil's new agricultural frontier, has raised questions about the risk of increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) loss as large areas of native vegetation (NV; i.e., Cerrado biome) have been replaced by large-scale mechanized agriculture. Although sustainable managements, such as integrated crop-livestock (ICL) systems, are considered strategic to counterbalance the SOC loss associated with land-use change (LUC) while keeping food production, little is known about their long-term effects on SOC stocks in the Matopiba region. To this end, we used the DayCent model to simulate the effects of converting the management commonly used in this region, i.e., soybean-cotton rotation under no-tillage (NT), into ICL systems with distinct levels of intensification (e.g., crop rotations: soybean-pasture and soybean-pasture-cotton; soil and crop management: grass irrigation, scarification/harrowing, and length of grass cultivation) on long term SOC dynamics. Additionally, data from two projected climate scenarios: SSP2-4.5 [greenhouse gases emissions (GHG) will not change markedly over time and global temperature will increase by 2.0 degrees C by 2060] and SSP5-8.5 (marked changes in GHG emissions are expected to occur resulting in an increase of 2.4 and 4.4 degrees C in global temperature in the middle and at the end of the century) were included in our simulations to evaluate climate change effects on SOC dynamics in this region. Based on a 50-yr-time frame simulation, we observed that SOC stocks under ICL systems were, on average, 23% and 47% higher than in the NV (36.9 Mg ha -1) and soybean -cotton rotation under NT (30.9 Mg ha -1), respectively. Growing grasses interlaid with crops was crucial to in-crease SOC stocks even when disruptive soil practices were followed. Although the irrigation of grass resulted in an early increase of SOC stocks and a higher pasture stoking rate, it did not increase SOC stocks in the long term compared to non-irrigated treatments. The SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 climate scenarios had little effects on SOC dynamics in the simulated ICL systems. However, additional SOC loss (-0.065 Mg ha- 1 yr -1) is predicted to occur if the current management is not improved. These findings can help guide management decisions for the Matopiba region, Brazil, to alleviate the anthropogenic pressure associated with agriculture development. More broadly, they confirm that crop-livestock integration in croplands is a successful strategy to regenerate SOC.

TI  - Forestry projects under the clean development mechanism? Modelling of the uncertainties in carbon mitigation and related costs of plantation forestry projects
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Afforestation is considered an important option for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. Recently, plantation projects have been suggested for inclusion under the Clean Development Mechanism. While considered a cheap option, significant uncertainties make it difficult to determine the (net) carbon benefits and profitability of forestry projects. The current uncertainties about the regulatory framework of the CDM and the environmental and economic performance of plantation forestry could create uncertainties with respect to the additionality of such projects and thus their acceptance under the mechanism. Six plantation forestry projects that were proposed in Brazil have been used as cases to study sources of uncertainty for carbon benefits and economics for such projects. These cases vary widely in terms of productivity and products delivered. A quantitative model for calculating greenhouse gas balances and financial benefits and costs, taking a broad range of variables into account, was developed. Data from the developers of the proposed projects was used as main source material. Subsequently, scenario's were evaluated, containing different and realistic options for baseline vegetation, carbon crediting systems and CDM modalities, fluctuations in product prices, discount rates and carbon prices. The real cost of combined carbon sequestration and substitution for the case projects was below $3 per ton of carbon avoided, when based exclusively on data supplied by project developers. However, potential variations in carbon impact and costs based on scenario options were very large. Different baseline vegetation or adopting a different discount rate cause carbon credits to vary by as much as an order of magnitude. Different carbon crediting systems or fluctuations in (commodity) product prices cause variations up to 200% in carbon credits and NPV. This makes the additionality of such projects difficult to determine. Five of the six case projects seem uneligible for development under the CDM. A critical attitude towards the use of plantation projects under the CDM seems justified.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Patterns in Carbon and Nitrogen Inputs by Net Precipitation in Atlantic Forest, Brazil
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding both carbon and nitrogen temporal and spatial inputs by rainfall in tropical forests is critical for proper forest conservation and management and might ultimately elucidate how climate change might affect nutrient dynamics in forest ecosystems. This study aimed to quantify the net precipitation contribution to the Atlantic Forest's total carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N), identifying potential differences between these inputs regarding temporal (seasonal and monthly) and spatial scales. Rainfall samples were collected before and after interacting with the forest canopy from May 2018 to April 2019. The rainfall was enriched after crossing the forest canopy. Significant differences were found for gross rainfall and net precipitation between annual carbon (104.13 kg ha(-1) and 193.18 kg ha(-1)) and nitrogen (16.81 kg ha(-1) and 36.95 kg ha(-1)) inputs, respectively. Moreover, there was seasonal variability in the C and N inputs with 75% occurring in the wet season. Overall, the spatial patterns revealed that the same locations had the highest inputs regardless of the analyzed period. The forest-rainfall interactions provide constant C and N inputs, especially in the wet season, and are fundamental for the maintenance of ecological processes.

TI  - The amount of carbon released from peat and forest fires in Indonesia during 1997
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatlands are one of the largest near-surface reserves of terrestrial organic carbon, and hence their stability has important implications for climate change(1-3). In their natural state, lowland tropical peatlands support a luxuriant growth of peat swamp forest overlying peat deposits up to 20 metres thick(4,5). Persistent environmental change-in particular, drainage and forest clearing-threatens their stability 2, and makes them susceptible to fire(6). This was demonstrated by the occurrence of widespread fires throughout the forested peatlands of Indonesia(7-10) during the 1997 El Nino event. Here, using satellite images of a 2.5 million hectare study area in Central Kalimantan, Borneo, from before and after the 1997 fires, we calculate that 32% (0.79 Mha) of the area had burned, of which peatland accounted for 91.5% (0.73 Mha). Using ground measurements of the burn depth of peat, we estimate that 0.19-0.23 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon were released to the atmosphere through peat combustion, with a further 0.05 Gt released from burning of the overlying vegetation. Extrapolating these estimates to Indonesia as a whole, we estimate that between 0.81 and 2.57 Gt of carbon were released to the atmosphere in 1997 as a result of burning peat and vegetation in Indonesia. This is equivalent to 13-40% of the mean annual global carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and contributed greatly to the largest annual increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration detected since records began in 1957 (ref. 1).

TI  - Analysis of Forest Fire Dynamics, Distribution and Main Drivers in the Atlantic Forest
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The fire susceptibility of the Atlantic Forest has largely increased over the past two decades due to a combination of climate change and anthropogenic factors such as land cover change and human modification. High rates of forest fragmentation have contributed to escalating fires in this imperilled global biodiversity hotspot. Understanding fire patterns is essential to developing an effective forest fire management strategy. In this research, we utilized the Random Forest (RF) machine learning approach for identifying the role of climatic and anthropogenic factors in influencing fire occurrence probability and mapping the spatial distribution of fire risk. We found that the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index value and climate variables (i.e., temperature and solar radiation) were significant drivers of fire occurrence risk. Results also confirm that forest fragmentation increases with fire density in the region.

TI  - Integrating Ecosystems in Risk Assessments: Lessons from Applying InVEST Models in Data-Deficient Countries
T2  - ECOSYSTEM-BASED DISASTER RISK REDUCTION AND ADAPTATION IN PRACTICE
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The linkages between ecosystem conditions and disaster risk reduction have gained increasing international attention. Despite this growing awareness, national and local decision makers often lack the tools to visualize disaster risk under different ecosystem conditions. As a result, the importance of ecosystems continues to be under-appreciated in decision-making processes related to disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. While spatial models have commonly been applied in both ecological assessments and disaster management, there have been relatively few studies that merge these two applications. This chapter demonstrates applications of the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) tool in data-deficient countries where the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is currently implementing ecosystem-based field interventions to reduce disaster risk. InVEST software (developed by the Natural Capital Project) provides spatial tools for assessing ecosystems and disaster risk even when limited data is available. The first study presented in this chapter takes into consideration the role of coastal and marine ecosystems in reducing exposure to coastal hazards in a small municipality in the south of Haiti. It provides an example of a qualitative assessment of exposure to storm surges and coastal flooding under different ecosystem management scenarios. The second study examines realistic land use change scenarios such as reforestation and urbanization and their impacts on soil erosion and sedimentation in a river basin in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Through detailed examination of the two case studies, this chapter aims to demonstrate how integrated models such as InVEST could function as decision-support tools for considering ecosystem-based solutions for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. The limitations, challenges and areas for improvement of each model application, as well as implications for local decision-making and awareness-raising, are discussed.

TI  - The ineffectiveness of current environmental and fire policies in the world's largest wetland
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Upper Paraguay Basin (UPRB) covers 361 338 km2 in Brazil and can be divided into the Planalto (plateau) and the Pantanal, the largest wetland in the world. This area faces pressures from climate change, land use and cover change (LULC), and infrastructure. Therefore, this study evaluates the effectiveness of current environmental policies on native vegetation conservation, water availability, and fire dynamics in the UPRB under current legislation in the state of Mato Grosso (MT). We used LULC data from 1985-2022 to estimate changes in water, native vegetation, exotic grasslands, and areas that could be converted to exotic grasslands for cattle ranching under state Decree N degrees.774/2024. We analyzed water coverage trends, including riparian preservation areas (RPAs) protected by federal law N degrees.12651/2012. Evapotranspiration comparisons were made between regions with and without artificial drainage. We also investigated trends in burned areas and the effectiveness of fire ban decrees. Our results indicate a significant increase in exotic grasslands across the entire UPRB portion of MT. We also found a significant decrease in water cover in the Pantanal, accompanied by an increase in native grass cover. Exotic grasslands can cover an area similar to native vegetation due to the new decree (774/2024), which includes 21 000 km2 of legal reserves (sustainable use areas) now available for grazing. The Pantanal has lost more than 8000 km2 of water over the past 37 yrs, with similar decreasing trend in water cover found within RPAs. Areas with artificial drainage showed lower evapotranspiration. Fire ban decrees were ineffective in reducing burned areas to expected levels. Current policies are insufficient to protect the interconnected ecosystems across the UPRB. Immediate measures, including adaptive management, strengthened legislation, and sustainable land and fire management practices, are essential to mitigate environmental impacts in the UPRB and safeguard its ecological and economic integrity.

TI  - Temperature effects on Zn-responses and Zn-reclamation capacity of two native Brazilian plant species: Implications of climate change
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate changes implications on the physiological responses and Zn-reclamation capacity of two native Brazilian plant species [Albizia polycephala and Pterogyne nitens (Fabaceae)] were studied. Plants were grown in substrate amended with 0 and 200 mg kg(-1), under increasing temperatures (25 degrees C, 30 degrees C and 35 degrees C) and plant physiological responses related to energetic and oxidative metabolism and Zn-uptake and subcellular localization were evaluated. By impairing the mitochondrial metabolism, Zn was seen to induce hydrogen peroxide (H202) production, which was stimulated by increasing temperature. However, increasing temperature was also seen to stimulate the activity of antioxidant enzymes, attenuating oxidative damage induced by H2O2 in leaves and roots. Moreover, increasing temperature was responsible for changes in the subcellular localization of Zn, increasing its allocation in the soluble fraction (mainly composed of vacuoles and cytoplasm) - which could be a tolerance mechanism allowing plants to survive in conditions of toxic levels of Zn under increased temperatures. Our results point to an interactive effect of rising temperature on Zn toxicity to plants. Although rising temperatures led to increased uptake of Zn and increased its deleterious effects to mitochondria metabolism (which led to increased H2O2 production), the increases in temperature also promoted the activity of antioxidant enzymes, responsible for H2O2 scavenging, thus attenuating the deleterious effects of this ROS on the cell metabolism of plants. Finally, increases in temperature do not constrain the ability of A. polycephala and P. nites to reclaim Zn and, therefore, these species should continue to be used in Zn-phytoremediation programs even given the prospects of increasing temperatures over the next century due to climatic changes.

TI  - Climate friendliness of cocoa agroforests is compatible with productivity increase
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - There is increasing demand for agricultural commodities that are produced in a climate-friendly manner. At the same time, in many or most tropical countries there is need for intensification of agricultural production to increase yields and incomes, and this usually requires higher external inputs that may cause additional greenhouse gas emissions. Here we investigate if production methods that have a beneficial effect on the climate (are climate-friendly) are compatible with increased inputs and yields for traditional, shaded cocoa (Theobroma cacao) production systems (locally known as cabrucas) in southern Bahia, Brazil. We use two easily measurable and manageable dimensions of climate friendliness, namely the carbon (C) stocks in the large trees and the C footprint as related to on-farm agrochemical and fuel use. Through interviews and field inventories in 26 cabruca farms representing a range of production practices and intensities, we identify the combinations of management practices, yields, C stocks and C footprints typically found in the region. We find that yield levels up to the highest encountered yield of 585 kg ha(-1), or twice the current regional average of 285 kg ha(-1), are compatible with an aboveground C stock in the large shade trees (> 30 cm diameter at breast height) of up to 65 Mg ha(-1) and up to 55 % shade. Higher C stocks and shade levels are generally associated with yields below the regional average. Input-related C emissions increased non-linearly with increasing yield, but even the highest encountered yields were compatible with low (< 0.25 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) of cocoa) to medium (< 0.5 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) of cocoa) input-related emission levels. Cocoa yields responded positively to increased fertilizer applications, provided that other factors, including shade levels, were not limiting. Consequently, the highest input-related emissions (> 1 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) of cocoa) were related to large fertilizer applications that did not proportionately increase yields. We conclude that doubling the cocoa output from southern Bahia, where cabrucas are the predominant form of growing cocoa, is compatible with climate-friendly production practices, measured by local standards. We suggest that the presented methodology can be used to identify opportunities for climate-friendly intensification of tree crops more generally, thereby increasing the contribution of commodity production to global climate change mitigation.

TI  - Assessing sediment CO2 effluxes in the coastal ecosystem of North Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands including mangrove play a vital role in regulating the local and global carbon cycle. Coastal areas contribute greatly to the carbon exchange process due to the complex interactions that occur between the atmosphere, land, and oceans. One of the important components in coastal carbon dynamics is CO2 gas exchange between soil, water and the atmosphere. This study aims to assess CO2 efflux across various land covers (namely natural mangrove, restored mangrove, and converted mangroves to oil palm and aquaculture pond) in the coastal areas of North Sumatra Province, and analyze the effect of sea tides and ebbs on the rate of CO2 efflux and their connection with the number and area of macrozoobenthos burrows. We applied direct sampling by using the static closed chamber method attached to portable CO2 analyzer. The mean of CO2 efflux in natural mangrove forest land covers was 866 +/- 585 mgCO(2)/m(2)/h during low tide conditions and 1137 +/- 792 mgCO(2)/m(2)/h during high tide conditions, followed by oil palm plantations at 760.71 +/- 341 mgCO(2)/m(2)/h, restored mangroves during low tide of 575.24 +/- 326 mgCO(2)/m(2)/h and 597.11 +/- 180 mg CO2/m(2)/h during high tide conditions, and the lowest was recorded in ponds at 588.55 +/- 358 mgCO(2)/m(2)/h. Further, we observed that tidal conditions affect the magnitudes of CO2 efflux in natural and restored mangrove forests, and we did not observe similar pattern in oil palms and ponds since these land covers were not influenced by regular tidal input. We also observed that no significant relationship between the number and area of macrozoobenthos burrows and CO2 efflux. Our findings suggest that CO2 effluxes in coastal wetlands are highly dynamic and presumably driven by complex factors and therefore, understanding their magnitudes and drivers requires extensive measurement covering large spatial and temporal scales.

TI  - Evaluation of soil organic matter from integrated production systems using laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural areas under integrated production systems, such as Integrated Crop-Livestock-Forest System (CLFS), have the potential to sequestrate carbon (C) since both Soil Organic Matter (SOM) content and trees biomass increase thus mitigating the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from agriculture. Regarding soil aspects, the C content stands out as the main indicator, but the structural aspect of SOM is also relevant since it plays a key role in the chemical stability of C compounds and the soil lifetime of C compounds. Laser-Induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy (LIFS) is an effective technique to evaluate the SOM humification index (HLIFS) from practically intact whole soil samples under different agricultural systems. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze the SOM humification index in different integrated systems, such as Integrated Crop-Livestock-Forest System (CLFS), Integrated Livestock-Forest System (LFS), Integrated Crop-Livestock System (CLS), and in references areas, such as Intensive Pasture (INT), Extensive Pasture (EXT) and Native Forest (NF). For this purpose, samples of Redyellow Latosol (Haplorthox by Soil taxonomy) from the experimental site located at Embrapa Pecu ' aria Sudeste (Southeast of Brazil) were collected five years after the establishment of the integrated systems. Samples were collected at soil depths of 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-60, 60-80, and 80-100 cm. Pellets of the whole soil samples were prepared for LIFS analysis. In these areas, SOM humification indices (HLIFS) presented the following descending order: CLS > EXT > INT > LFS > CLFS > NF. Previous results have shown a greater soil organic carbon stock in these integrated production systems than in the NF area, suggesting C sequestration in agricultural soil. In the present study, SOM was classified by LIFS as more chemically stable in integrated production systems than in native vegetation. Higher amounts of fluorescent compounds were identified from LIFS data, probably resulting from condensed aromatic groups. SOM with more recalcitrant groups normally has a longer lifetime in the soil, indicating a long-term contribution to mitigating climate change by avoiding fast SOM decomposition and CO2 return to the atmosphere. Also, for the first time, this study was able to identify a positive correlation (R = 0.79) between the SOM humification index (HLIFS) and the Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC)/C content ratio of whole soil samples, another innovative contribution from soil LIFS analyses.

TI  - Biomass of native seedlings rescued from a Eucalyptus stand in different seasons of the year
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS AGRARIAS-AGRARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The biomass production of plants originating from natural regeneration may undergo seasonal changes throughout the year, conditioned to changes in climatic factors. In view of the above, the objective of the research was to know the changes that can occur in the biomass of Myrsine coriacea, Vernonia discolor, and Vernonanthura discolor seedlings regenerated under Eucalyptus reforestation, throughout the seasons and by height classes. For this, 36 seedlings of each species were collected quarterly, that is, 12 individuals from each of the following height classes: 5.0 to 25.9 cm; 26.0 to 49.9 cm; greater than or equal to 50.0 cm. On rescue occasions, the following measurements were performed: total height, collar diameter, aerial dry mass and root dry mass. From these variables, the relationship between aerial dry mass/aerial moisture mass and the relation between root dry mass/root moisture mass was calculated. The dry mass contents, as well as the relationship between dry and moisture mass of plants rescued from the three species showed differences in the seasons. Myrsine coriacea presented better performance in autumn, for most of the analyzed variables, while Vernonanthura discolor performed better in winter. As for Vernonia discolor, it was not possible to define a season of the year with better performance for most variables.

TI  - Influence of soil and topography on aboveground biomass accumulation and carbon stocks of afforested pastures in South East Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In light of the devastating loss of forest cover, biodiversity, and ecosystem services in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, people are endeavoring to restore this fragmented forest system. The afforestation of abandoned or degraded land is a practical approach to restore regional ecological functions and to sequester atmospheric carbon to help mitigate the global imbalance of atmospheric carbon associated with climate change. Large gaps, however, remain in understanding the dynamics of afforested tree communities. In this study, the effect of topographical relief and soil properties on growth performance of planted trees has been assessed. Above ground dry biomass (AGB(dry)) accumulation was estimated to evaluate the performance of afforested tree communities on formerly abandoned pastures at the Reserva Ecologica de Guapiacu, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The study revealed large discrepancies in AGBdry and respective organic carbon accumulationThe afforested tree community located on the sloped terrain stored only half the carbon (21.70 +/- 7.3 Mgha(-1)) that the planted trees on the flat terrain stored. (46.67 +/- 8.7 Mgha(-1)). Our results suggest that differences in tree growth performance are complex, depending largely on topography and related soil conditions. These circumstances should be considered to prevent misleading carbon sink estimates when developing regional strategies for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) that promote afforestation activities.

TI  - Understanding the interactive effects of ecotype, seasonality, and rainfall reduction on the soil nutritional status of the Brazilian savanna
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate models forecast a significant reduction in average precipitation and an extension of the dry period over the coming decades, which will likely influence the biogeochemical processes of the Brazilian savanna (i.e. Cerrado). However, studies about the fate of soil nutrient availability in this biome remain scarce. We conducted a field-based experimental rainfall reduction in three Cerrado ecotypes, namely an open savanna (OS), a woodland savanna (WS), and an intermediate savanna (IS), to assess its effects on soil organic matter, total phosphorus, microbial biomass nitrogen, dissolved organic nitrogen and inorganic nitrogen (NH4+-N and NO3--N) pools in dry and rainy seasons for two consecutive years. Despite sharing common soil origins and climatic conditions, these ecotypes showed contrasting levels of soil organic matter as well as phosphorus and nitrogen pools. The WS showed higher soil fertility with organic matter levels of 11.19 %, P levels of 2.54 mg Kg(-1), and NO3--N levels of 2.15 mg Kg(-1), compared to the OS, which had organic matter levels of 7.04 %, P levels of 0.65 mg Kg(-1), and NO3--N levels of 1.49 mg Kg(-1). The IS showed intermediate values, with organic matter levels of 8.94 %, P levels of 0.65 mg Kg(-1), and NO3--N levels of 1.93 mg Kg(-1). Seasonal patterns considerably influenced soil nutrient content, with higher soil inorganic nitrogen levels typically found during the rainy season and higher soil phosphorous levels during the dry season, although these patterns varied among ecotypes. Soil organic matter, dissolved organic nitrogen, and microbial biomass nitrogen exhibited greater sensitivity to the experimental reduction in rainfall compared to soil phosphorus and inorganic nitrogen. However, this sensitivity varied across ecotypes and seasons, with a particularly strong effect observed in the IS and during the rainy season. Our findings suggest that the effects of climate change in the Cerrado might strongly vary among seasons and the different ecotypes, highlighting the need for more comprehensive experimental studies in the different ecotypes to fully understand future nutrient dynamics in the Cerrado.

TI  - A global production network for ecosystem services: The emergent governance of landscape restoration in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last few decades, numerous initiatives have advanced forest landscape restoration in the Amazon, and in 2015 the Brazilian government set an ambitious, still-valid, target to restore 4.8 million hectares of degraded Amazonian land by 2030. This has contributed to an emergent global restoration network that connects multiple stakeholders and processes for funding, implementing and monitoring restoration actions in such a way that prepares various ecosystem services for market integration. The network arose in tandem with the evolution of an institutional framework that includes regulatory requirements within Brazil, global commitments linked to climate change mitigation, corporate sustainability strategies, and the growth of crowd-sourcing activism. This paper presents restoration activities as embedded within a Global Production Network (GPN) for an ecosystem service, which we use as a heuristic device to inform our understanding of emergent environmental governance structures. The resulting multi-scalar, networked mode of environmental governance is presented as a web-like structure co-created by institutional evolution, actor-specific strategies, and interactions between firms and non-firm actors. The article pays particular attention to a case study of how the restoration network manifests territorially in the Upper Xingu region of the Brazilian Amazon. Despite the strong North-South orientation of dominant funding relationships, network governance is also seen to be relational. This is evident from the dissemination of ideas, supply models and seeding techniques from Upper Xingu to other regions of Brazil. These insights could be applied to improve landscape restoration outcomes, and indeed the provisioning of ecosystem services more broadly.

TI  - Can current native tree seedling production and infrastructure meet an increasing forest restoration demand in Brazil?
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent global commitments have placed forest and landscape restoration at the forefront of countries' efforts to recover ecosystem services, conserve biodiversity, and mitigate the effects of climate change. However, it needs to be asked if current native tree seedling supply meets an increase in demand for forest restoration? This study assessed the current configuration, distribution, and production capacity of forest nurseries producing native trees in Brazil. Brazil provides an interesting example of how global agreements aligned with national policies can lead to the proliferation of native seedling nurseries, and the challenges faced to restore species-rich native forest ecosystems. We found that the nurseries in the Atlantic Forest region can still meet an increase in demand-both in terms of seedling quantity and diversity-because most of their production capacity is not currently used. However, not all Brazilian biomes have sufficient nurseries to meet restoration demands, thus there is a risk of using native species from a few biogeographical regions in a much spatially wider and ecologically diverse area. In addition, lack of seed supply and qualified labor can hamper the growth of the market. Barriers to seed supply may also lead to low levels of genetic variability and floristic representation in the populations and ecosystems to be restored. We conclude that restoration of high-diversity forest ecosystems requires policies and supportive programs, with emphasis on private nurseries, to guarantee adequate supply of native tree seedlings and provide the necessary incentives to develop the emergent economy of forest restoration.

TI  - Croton blanchetianus modulates its morphophysiological responses to tolerate drought in a tropical dry forest
T2  - FUNCTIONAL PLANT BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An understanding of variations in morphophysiological leaf traits of plant models in dry tropical forests is essential for quantifying C fluxes from forest ecosystems in response to climate changes. The present study evaluated the influences of seasonal rainfall and different light conditions on the gas exchange, nutrients, organic compounds and morphological traits in Croton blanchetianus Baill. trees within a fragment of Caatinga forest. Stomatal conductance (g(s)) and net photosynthesis (P-N) demonstrated variations within the diurnal cycle, with maximum values at approximately midday and minimum values at predawn. The P-N and the diurnal integrated CO2 assimilation were lower during the dry season than in the rainy season. Water use efficiency was positively correlated with P-N (r = 0.73) during the dry season only. However, the correlation between P-N and g(s) was observed during the rainy season only (r = 0.60). Thus we demonstrated that C. blanchetianus has a remarkable ability to adapt to global climatic changes and could be considered a model in studies exploring water relationships in woody plants; consequently, this species may be important in future reforestation studies.

TI  - Exposure To Climate Risk: A Case Study For Coffee Farming In The Region Of Alta Mogiana, Sao Paulo
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies around the world show an increase in global average temperatures, with a consequent increase in extreme events and changes in the distribution of precipitation, causing a decrease in agricultural production and changes in planting areas. This study analyzed the exposure to climate risk that the coffee crop in the region of Alta Mogiana/SP, Brazil has been presenting in the past thirty years (1991-2021). Time series of daily data of maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation were used. By the statistical tests we observed a trend of increase in maximum temperatures daily of approximately 1.4 degrees C and minimum daily of 0.8 degrees C in the municipalities of the region and a trend towards a decrease in precipitation of 0.9 mm daily, indicating greater exposure of the coffee crop in the region to climate risk and increased vulnerability for the coffee producer. In view of these analyses, a literature review was carried out, suggesting agroforestry systems and mechanical irrigation as the most promising strategies to manage climate risk in coffee plantations. In addition, drought-resistant cultivars, training courses for farmers, increased rural insurance, and nutritional control of the plants can also be considered efficient options for climate exposure in coffee plantations from Alta Mogiana.

TI  - A Field Study of Tropical Peat Fire Behaviour and Associated Carbon Emissions
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatlands store vast volumes of carbon belowground. Human land uses have led to their degradation, reducing their carbon storage services. Clearing and drainage make peatlands susceptible to surface and belowground fires. Satellites do not readily detect smouldering peat fires, which release globally significant quantities of aerosols and climate-influencing gases. Despite national and international desire to improve management of these fires, few published results exist for in situ tropical peat fire behaviour and associated carbon emissions. We present new field methodology for calculating rates of fire spread within degraded peat (average spread rates, vertical 0.8 cm h(-1), horizontal 2.7 cm h(-1)) and associated peat volume losses (102 m(3) ha(-1) in August, 754 m(3) ha(-1) in September) measured at six peat fire sites in Kalimantan, Indonesia, in 2015. Utilizing locally collected bulk density and emission factors, total August and September gas emissions of 27.2 t ha(-1) (8.1 tC ha(-1)) and 200.7 t ha(-1) (60.2 tC ha(-1)) were estimated. We provide much needed, but currently lacking, IPCC Tier 3-level data to improve GHG estimates from tropical peat fires. We demonstrate how calculations of total emission estimates can vary greatly in magnitude (+798% to -26%) depending on environmental conditions, season, peat burn depth methodology, bulk density and emission factors data sources, and assumed versus observed combustion factors. This illustrates the importance of in situ measurements and the need for more refined methods to improve accuracies of GHG estimates from tropical peat fires.

TI  - An integrated greenhouse gas assessment of an alternative to slash-and-burn agriculture in eastern Amazonia
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires set for slash-and-burn agriculture contribute to the current unsustainable accumulation of atmospheric greenhouse gases, and they also deplete the soil of essential nutrients, which compromises agricultural sustainability at local scales. Integrated assessments of greenhouse gas emissions have compared intensive cropping systems in industrialized countries, but such assessments have not been applied to common cropping systems of smallholder farmers in developing countries. We report an integrated assessment of greenhouse gas emissions in slash-and-burn agriculture and an alternative chop-and-mulch system in the Amazon Basin. The soil consumed atmospheric methane (CH4) under slash-and-burn treatment and became a net emitter of CH4 to the atmosphere under the mulch treatment. Mulching also caused about a 50% increase in soil emissions of nitric oxide and nitrous oxide and required greater use of fertilizer and fuel for farm machinery. Despite these significantly higher emissions of greenhouse gases during the cropping phase under the alternative chop-and-mulch system, calculated pyrogenic emissions in the slash-and-burn system were much larger, especially for CH4. The global warming potential CO2-equivalent emissions calculated for the entire crop cycles were at least five times lower in chop-and-mulch compared with slash-and-burn. The crop yields were similar for the two systems. While economic and logistical considerations remain to be worked out for alternatives to slash-and-burn, these results demonstrate a potential 'win-win' strategy for maintaining soil fertility and reducing net greenhouse gas emissions, thus simultaneously contributing to sustainability at both spatial scales.

TI  - Coastal resilience and adaptation strategies: Natural habitats for coastal protection and Atlantic forest restoration on the coast of the Rio de Janeiro state
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change exerts impacts on biodiversity and coastal ecosystems. Given the socio-economic and environmental significance of coastal zones, preventative and mitigative measures are imperative to address the damages resulting from erosive processes and coastal flooding. The state of Rio de Janeiro, with its 1160 km of coastline, holds ecological, socio-economic, and logistical importance in Brazil, necessitating the safeguarding of these assets. We employed the InVEST modeling program to assess coastal vulnerability, incorporating data on populations, logistical infrastructure (ports and aerodromes), and priority areas for fauna protection. Our findings revealed that the state of Rio de Janeiro faces coastal risks ranging from intermediate to high at 66 %, and a substantial portion of legally protected areas does not encompass habitats near the coast. We illustrated the pivotal role of habitats in coastal protection, emphasizing that their removal would significantly augment coastal vulnerability. The amalgamation of these factors allowed us to propose adaptation strategies based on nature-based solutions to address environmental and socioeconomic challenges.

TI  - Yield Gap Management under Seawater Intrusion Areas of Indonesia to Improve Rice Productivity and Resilience to Climate Change
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate (a) the performance of two modern rice varieties (non-tolerant and tolerant for saline soils) under different fertilizer management options, and (b) assess the yield gap and income increase through proper crop and nutrient management at different levels of soil salinity. Experiments were carried out in moderate and high levels of soil salinity in West Java, Indonesia. A split plot design with three replications was used. The main plots included two rice varieties, Inpari-30 Ciherang sub1 and Inpari-34 (tolerant variety for saline soils), and subplots included eight fertilizer management treatments. Farmer participatory field trials were also established across three levels of soil salinity with four different rice varieties, Sidenuk, Inpari 30, Inpari 34, and Inpari 35, and a fertilizer package consisting of organic and inorganic fertilizers. Under low and moderate soil salinities, Sidenuk and Inpari 30 with recommended practice had higher productivity and economic benefit compared to the saline tolerant rice varieties, Inpari 34 and Inpari 35. However, under high soil salinity, the yields of Inpari 34 and Inpari 35 with recommended practice were 93% higher than farmers' practice, representing an exploitable yield gap of 1.3 t ha(-1) and benefit above fertilizer cost of USD 301 ha(-1). The combination of tolerant varieties and improved nutrient management use for rice production can therefore be used as a strategy for improving farmers' income and livelihoods in coastal areas of Indonesia.

TI  - Quantifying the Carbon Stocks in Urban Trees: The Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden as an Important Tropical Carbon Sink
T2  - JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL AND BOTANICAL GARDENS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid urbanization process in recent decades has altered the carbon cycle and exacerbated the impact of climate change, prompting many cities to develop tree planting and green area preservation as mitigation and adaptation measures. While numerous studies have estimated the carbon stocks of urban trees in temperate and subtropical cities, data from tropical regions, including tropical botanic gardens, are scarce. This study aimed to quantify the aboveground biomass and carbon (AGB and AGC, respectively) stocks in trees at the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden arboretum, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Our survey included 6793 stems with a diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 10 cm. The total AGB was 8047 +/- 402 Mg, representing 4024 +/- 201 Mg of AGC. The AGB density was 207 +/- 10 Mg<middle dot>ha-1 (AGC = 104 +/- 5 Mg<middle dot>ha-1), which is slightly lower than the density stored in Brazil's main forest complexes, the Atlantic and Amazon forests, but much higher than in many cities worldwide. Our results suggest that, in addition to their global importance for plant conservation, tropical botanic gardens could function as significant carbon sinks within the urban matrix.

TI  - Urban afforestation: using phytotoxicity endpoints to compare air pollution tolerance of two native Brazilian plants Aroeira (Schinus terebinthifolius) and Cuvata (Cupania vernalis)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban afforestation can mitigate the effects of air pollution, but the suitability of plant species for this purpose needs to be determined according to pollution intensity and climate change. The goal of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of different phytotoxicity endpoints using two native Brazilian plant species as models, Aroeira (Schinus terebinthifolius) and Cuvata (Cupania vernalis). The sensitivity parameters evaluated could help in selecting the most air-pollution-tolerant plant species for use in urban afforestation programs. The two plant species were exposed, in a greenhouse, to the combustion gases of a diesel engine for 120 days, with daily intermittent gas exposure. Every 30 days, leaf injury (chlorosis and necrosis), biomass, and physiological/biochemical parameters (proteins, chlorophyll, and peroxidase enzyme activity) were evaluated for both plant species. For the two selected species, the endpoints studied can be ranked according to their sensitivity (or inversely the tolerance) to diesel oil combustion gases in the following order: peroxidase > biomass approximate to chlorophyll > protein > leaf injury. The endpoint responses of higher plants can be used to assess the suitability of particular plant species for use in urban afforestation areas with relatively intense vehicle traffic.

TI  - Impact of industrial logging concession on deforestation and forest degradation in the DRC
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Congo Basin is home to the second largest tropical humid forest in the world and an important participant in climate change mitigation. While the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) boasts the largest proportion of Congo basin forests, it is also the main contributor to forest loss. Industrial logging concession is a forest man-agement model that is likely to expand in the DRC in the coming years as the Government recently announced the probable end of the 2002 moratorium on logging concessions. It is thus crucial to understand whether this model can further the DRC's deforestation reduction efforts. The literature suggests that the effect of titling forestland on avoided deforestation and forest degradation is generally limited, unless environmental restrictions are enforced. The DRC's 2002 forest code introduced a new logging concession model that includes requirements to submit and implement Forest Management Plans (FMP) and increase benefit-sharing with communities. Our paper evaluates the impact of this new model of concession contracts signed in 2011 and 2014 on deforestation and forest degradation. We use remotely sensed data series to estimate difference-in-difference models. We ensured baseline parallel trends in deforestation and similarity in baseline characteristics between control and treated units. We find no evidence that deforestation and forest degradation is significantly different between logging concessions and control areas, even for concessions that had their FMP accepted. Our study highlights the need for evaluating the impact of FMPs once they are fully implemented, the importance to improve degradation outcome variables and to conduct complementary studies analyzing impact pathways.

TI  - Conservation agriculture cropping systems in temperate and tropical conditions, performances and impacts. A review
T2  - AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Nowadays, in a context of climate change, economical uncertainties and social pressure to mitigate agriculture externalities, farmers have to adopt new cropping systems to achieve a sustainable and cost-effective grain production. Conservation agriculture consists of a range of cropping systems based on a combination of three main principles: (1) soil tillage reduction, (2) soil protection by organic residues and (3) diversification in crop rotation. Conservation agriculture has been promoted as a way to reduce production costs, soil erosion and soil fertility degradation under both tropical and temperate conditions. Conservation agriculture-based cropping systems have diffused widely under Brazilian large-scale farms' conditions and more recently in Europe in the context of medium-size mechanized farms. Their diffusion, however, is still limited under small-scale non-mechanized farms' conditions of tropical countries. To assess the advantages and limits of such new cropping systems, this article compares experiences with conservation agriculture from the tropical Cerrado region of Brazil and from temperate conditions of Europe. It focusses on agronomic performances, environmental impacts and economical results. Conservation agriculture systems appear to be interesting options to achieve sustainable and intensive crop production under different agroecological environments because they use efficiently available resources and maintain soil fertility. However, this mostly results from the permanent presence of an organic mulch on the soil surface and the incorporation of cover crops in the rotations. Such modifications require a significant reorganization of the production process at farm level, and when facing technical or socioeconomic constraints, most farmers usually opt for applying only partially the three main principles of conservation agriculture. Investigating more fully the consequences of such partial implementation of conservation agriculture principles on its actual efficiency and assessing the most efficient participatory approaches needed to adapt conservation agriculture principles to local conditions and farming systems are top priorities for future research.

TI  - Predictive Models to Estimate Carbon Stocks in Agroforestry Systems
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to assess the carbon stock in a pasture area and fragment of forest in natural regeneration, given the importance of agroforestry systems in mitigating gas emissions which contribute to the greenhouse effect, as well as promoting the maintenance of agricultural productivity. Our other goal was to predict the carbon stock, according to different land use systems, from physical and chemical soil variables using the Random Forest algorithm. We carried out our study at an Entisols Quartzipsamments area with a completely randomized experimental design: four treatments and six replites. The treatments consisted of the following: (i) an agroforestry system developed for livestock, (ii) an agroforestry system developed for fruit culture, (iii) a conventional pasture, and (iv) a forest fragment. Deformed and undeformed soil samples were collected in order to analyze their physical and chemical properties across two consecutive agricultural years. The response variable, carbon stock, was subjected to a boxplot analysis and all the databases were used for a predictive modeling which in turn used the Random Forest algorithm. Results led to the conclusion that the agroforestry systems developed both for fruit culture and livestock, are more efficient at stocking carbon in the soil than the pasture area and forest fragment undergoing natural regeneration. Nitrogen stock and land use systems are the most important variables to estimate carbon stock from the physical and chemical variables of soil using the Random Forest algorithm. The predictive models generated from the physical and chemical variables of soil, as well as the Random Forest algorithm, presented a high potential for predicting soil carbon stock and are sensitive to different land use systems.

T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Relevant studies on prescribed fires in tropical parks published in the past 2 years were analyzed considering both political/social issues and environmental effects. Prescribed burning application and regulation in protected areas is recent in Australia, Africa and Brazil. Recognition of traditional indigenous fire practices and improved communication between managers, scientists and local communities has been in great demand. Current studies show concerns about environmental responses to different characteristics of fire management, but also some advantages. Considering the importance of prescribed fires for the conservation of tropical ecosystems, more research on the effects of such practices on fauna and flora is necessary, but also on other environment regulating factors, such as soil.

TI  - Spatially explicit estimates of forest carbon emissions, mitigation costs and REDD plus opportunities in Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon emissions from the conversion and degradation of tropical forests contribute to anthropogenic climate change. Implementing programs to reduce emissions from tropical forest loss in Southeast Asia are perceived to be expensive due to high opportunity costs of avoided deforestation. However, these costs are not representative of all REDD+ opportunities as they are typically based on average costs across large land areas and are primarily for reducing deforestation from oil palm or pulp concessions. As mitigation costs and carbon benefits can vary according to site characteristics, spatially-explicit information should be used to assess costeffectiveness and to guide the allocation of scarce REDD+ resources. We analyzed the costeffectiveness of the following REDD+ strategies in Indonesia, one of the world's largest sources of carbon emissions from deforestation: halting additional deforestation in protected areas, timber and oil palm concessions, reforesting degraded land and employing reduced-impact logging techniques in logging concessions. We discover that when spatial variation in costs and benefits is considered, low-cost options emerged even for the two most expensive strategies: protecting forests from conversion to oil palm and timber plantations. To achieve a low emissions reduction target of 25%, we suggest funding should target deforestation in protected areas, and oil palm and timber concessions to maximize emissions reductions at the lowest cumulative cost. Low-cost opportunities for reducing emissions from oil palm are where concessions have been granted on deep peat deposits or unproductive land. To achieve a high emissions reduction target of 75%, funding is allocated across all strategies, emphasizing that no single strategy can reduce emissions cost-effectively across all of Indonesia. These findings demonstrate that by using a spatiallytargeted approach to identify high priority locations for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, REDD+ resources can be allocated cost-effectively across Indonesia.

TI  - Morphological Characteristics and Regeneration Mechanisms of Uvaria chamae in Benin
T2  - FOLIA GEOBOTANICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The bush banana, Uvaria chamae is a wild plant species that is widely used for medicinal and nutritional purposes in sub-Saharan Africa. There are concerns that anthropogenic and climatic pressures may cause U. chamae to decline in Benin. This study aims to evaluate the demographic variability and regeneration mechanisms of U. chamae in Benin to assess its regeneration ability and guide sustainable management programmes. Based on an initial survey of occurrence sites of U. chamae in Benin, 14 research sites were selected within the distribution range of the species in Benin, covering seven phytodistricts in two biogeographical zones. A total of 172 plots of 30 m x 30 m were installed, with the number of plots per site ranging from four to 20, depending on the abundance of the species at the respective site. The following variables were recorded for each U. chamae individual: stem diameter 20 cm above the ground surface, number of branches, health status (healthy or diseased) and regeneration mechanism (seedling, resprouting, sucker). The density, mean diameter and basal area were calculated and compared between the Guineo-Congolian and Sudano-Guinean biogeographical zones. The results showed that density, basal area, number of branches and regeneration mechanism varied significantly between the two biogeographical zones. The Guineo-Congolian zone showed a higher mean population density (94.42 +/- 31.03 SD individuals per hectare) of the bush banana than the Sudano-Guinean zone which showed a lower mean population density (63.27 +/- 22.37 SD individuals per hectare). The demographic structure of the U. chamae populations with a high proportion of young individuals suggests that regeneration capacity is not a limiting factor. Uvaria chamae regenerates mostly through vegetative propagation by resprouting and suckering, enabling it to spread locally and likely create clonal stands. To address potential threats to the species that are expected to increase due to human population growth and projected climate change, we suggest to explore options for introducing U. chamae in agroforestry systems to promote its sustainable management.

TI  - Mangroves, fauna compositions and carbon sequestration after ten years restoration on Flores Island, Indonesia.
T2  - Scientific Reports
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia has extensively reforested mangroves to stabilize coastal ecosystems and mitigate climate change. Reforestation's long-term effects on recovering mangroves are not extensively established because most projects are only observed for two years. It raises the question of whether mangrove replanting aids biodiversity conservation and ecological recovery. This study will characterize Flores Island mangrove ecosystems after ten years of regeneration. The ecological survey took place at Bangkoor, Kolisia, and Talibura reforestation areas. Floristic composition, wildlife diversity, carbon sequestration, and energy storage were measured at each location. Field observations revealed 10 mangrove species and 11 species, which is varying by site. Flora diversity was highest in Kolisia and fauna diversity was highest in Talibura. Talibura and Kolisia have similar vegetation and wildlife than Bangkoor. Restored mangrove stands sequestered 28.69 - 70.02 Mg CO2 ha- 1 and stored 30.54 x 104 - 54.07 x 104 MJ ha- 1 of energy. Rhizophora apiculata (47.37 [plus or minus] 5.68 kg CO2) had the most carbon sequestration, while Bruguiera gymnorhiza (645.22 [plus or minus] 21.65 MJ) had the highest energy storage. Reforestation-induced mangrove ecosystems have biodiversity, carbon storage, and energy stock features.

TI  - Land-Based Mitigation Strategies under the Mid-Term Carbon Reduction Targets in Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the key mitigation options for achieving the mid-term target for carbon emission reduction in Indonesia. A computable general equilibrium model coupled with a land-based mitigation technology model was used to evaluate specific mitigation options within the whole economic framework. The results revealed three primary findings: (1) If no climate policy were implemented, Indonesia's total greenhouse gas emissions would reach 3.0 GtCO(2)eq by 2030; (2) To reduce carbon emissions to meet the latest Intended Nationally-Determined Contributions (INDC) target, similar to 58% of total reductions should come from the agriculture, forestry and other land use sectors by implementing forest protection, afforestation and plantation efforts; (3) A higher carbon price in 2020 suggests that meeting the 2020 target would be economically challenging, whereas the INDC target for 2030 would be more economically realistic in Indonesia.

TI  - Reducing climate impacts of beef production: A synthesis of life cycle assessments across management systems and global regions
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The global demand for beef is rapidly increasing (FAO, 2019), raising concern about climate change impacts (Clark et al., 2020; Leip et al., 2015; Springmann et al., 2018). Beef and dairy contribute over 70% of livestock greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), which collectively contribute similar to 6.3 Gt CO2-eq/year (Gerber et al., 2013; Herrero et al., 2016) and account for 14%-18% of human GHG emissions (Friedlingstein et al., 2019; Gerber et al., 2013). The utility of beef GHG mitigation strategies, such as land-based carbon (C) sequestration and increased production efficiency, are actively debated (Garnett et al., 2017). We compiled 292 local comparisons of "improved" versus "conventional" beef production systems across global regions, assessing net GHG emission data from Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies. Our results indicate that net beef GHG emissions could be reduced substantially via changes in management. Overall, a 46 % reduction in net GHG emissions per unit of beef was achieved at sites using carbon (C) sequestration management strategies on grazed lands, and an 8% reduction in net GHGs was achieved at sites using growth efficiency strategies. However, net-zero emissions were only achieved in 2% of studies. Among regions, studies from Brazil had the greatest improvement, with management strategies for C sequestration and efficiency reducing beef GHG emissions by 57%. In the United States, C sequestration strategies reduced beef GHG emissions by over 100% (net-zero emissions) in a few grazing systems, whereas efficiency strategies were not successful at reducing GHGs, possibly because of high baseline efficiency in the region. This meta-analysis offers insight into pathways to substantially reduce beef production's global GHG emissions. Nonetheless, even if these improved land-based and efficiency management strategies could be fully applied globally, the trajectory of growth in beef demand will likely more than offset GHG emissions reductions and lead to further warming unless there is also reduced beef consumption.

TI  - The potential of natural shade provided by Brazilian savanna trees for thermal comfort and carbon sink
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study looked at the potential of thermal comfort provided to animals by four different Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) native trees, as well as their potential for carbon sink. The evaluations were carried out during the summer of 2020, which consisted of the collection of microclimate variables. The Mean Radiant Temperature (TMR, degrees C) was derived from the shaded and unshaded areas under the trees, and from that, the Radiant Heat Load (RHL, W m(-2)) was calcu-lated as an index of thermal comfort. Solar radiation was estimated considering the sum of the direct, diffuse, and reflected components (W m(-2)), and carbon stock from trees biomass for CO2 sequestration was estimated from an allometric model applied to the native Cerrado tree species. The shade of the native trees reduced the meteorological variables such as dry bulb and black globe temperatures, to values considered adequate for the thermal comfort of animals, with an average reduction respectively equal to 1.3 degrees C and 6.4 degrees C. This represents a significant difference com-pared to the unshaded area as well as among tree species (P < 0.05), reflecting in lower values of TMR and RHL in the shaded area provided by each species. Carbon sequestration individually estimated by each native tree species was on average 8.85 Mg per tree. These results demonstrate the great potential for native tree species in the Cerrado biome to be used in agroforestry systems to provide higher levels of thermal comfort to animals and to combat climate change through their aptitude of CO2 sink.

TI  - Fast recovery of soil macrofauna in regenerating forests of the Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence of secondary forests in deforested tropical regions represents an opportunity to mitigate biodiversity loss and climate change, but there is still debate on how fast and to which level these forests can recover biodiversity. Recent studies have shown that the recovery of plant and vertebrate species richness is relatively fast, but the pace of recovery for other groups remains unclear. Soil macroinvertebrates play critical roles on litter decomposition and seed dispersal, therefore the pace of their recovery has consequences for the entire forest ecosystem.We investigated how fast broad taxonomic groups of soil macrofauna recover in the first 30 years of forest regeneration using forests older than 50 years as reference.We surveyed the number, diversity and abundance of 19 broad taxonomic groups of soil macrofauna in 85 sites located in Brazilian Amazon, covering forests of different ages and clearing frequencies. Forest age and clearing frequency were obtained accurately from Landsat images in forests up to 30 years old. We used regression analysis to determine (a) the effects forest age and clearing frequency on macrofauna groups in secondary forests up to 30 years old; and (b) the changes in macrofauna groups between young forests (up to 10 years old), median age forests (between 10 and 30 years old) and forests older than 50 years.We found that the number and diversity of macrofauna groups recover rapidly in the first 10 years of forest regrowth, but show slower change among older forests. This rapid recovery was also observed in the abundance of several taxonomic groups and for predators and detritivores as functional groups. Forest clearing frequency had no effect on the number or the diversity of macrofauna groups, but the abundance of ants increased as forest was cleared more often.Our results for soil macrofauna align with those in plant and vertebrate studies showing that secondary forests quickly recover a large part of their biodiversity and ecological functions. Therefore, global-scale conservation strategies are needed to ensure the opportunity for secondary forests to grow.

TI  - Araguaia biodiversity corridor cost benefit analysis: Large scale restoration and sustainable agribusiness in Amazon and Cerrado
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem restoration is an important tool for reducing ecosystem loss and contribute to diminish the negative impacts from deriving from climate change, but can be very costly. This paper focuses on the cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis of recovering almost one million hectares of legally protected areas in the Araguaia Biodiversity Corridor (Brazil) following the Brazilian Forest code regulation. We analyze two paths for recovery, ecological and economic (including timber and agroforestry systems). We consider the direct and indirect local costs, as well as monetized environmental benefits using the social cost of carbon and avoided soil erosion. According to our estimates, in 50 years, the recovery of the Araguaia Corridor will lead to net societal benefits with either the ecological (US$ 19.8 billion) or economic (US$ 18.9 billion) pathways in all macro-regions (north, central, and south) and rural property sizes (small, medium and large). The recovery captures 262 million tCO2eq and avoids 527 million tons of soil erosion with the economic path; these estimates are 23% and 1.7% higher, respectively, when using the ecological path. Importantly, we show that the restoration activity is not carbon credit dependent on being profitable when based on the economic path proposed. Additionally, this study highlights the high profitability of agroforestry systems, especially in small farms. There are also relevant local impacts, from 12 to 38 thousand new direct jobs. Even considering a limited menu of ecosystem services (carbon and soil), we show that social benefits from the Araguaia biodiversity corridor restoration exceed its social costs, justifying the subsidization of ecosystem restoration. In this sense, land use policies can incorporate mechanisms for financial support, grants, or incentives to encourage and facilitate ecosystem restoration efforts in the region.

TI  - Climate benefits of Amazon secondary forests-recent advances and research needs
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Review
AB  - A quarter of the deforested Amazon has regrown as secondary tropical forest and yet the climatic importance of these complex regenerating landscapes is only beginning to be recognised. Advances in satellite remote-sensing have transformed our ability to detect and map changes in forest cover, while detailed ground-based measurements from permanent monitoring plots and eddy-covariance flux towers are providing new insights into the role of secondary forests in the climate system. This review summarises how progress in data availability on Amazonian secondary forests has led to better understanding of their influence on global, regional and local climate through carbon and non-carbon climate benefits. We discuss the climate implications of secondary forest disturbance and the progress in representing forest regrowth in climate models. Much remains to be learned about how secondary forests function and interact with climate, how these processes change with forest age, and the resilience of secondary forest ecosystems faced with increasing anthropogenic disturbance. Secondary forests face numerous threats: half of secondary forests in the Brazilian legal Amazon were 11 years old or younger in 2023. On average, 1%-2% of Amazon secondary forests burn each year, threatening the permanence of sequestered carbon. The forests that burn are predominantly young (in 2023, 55% of burned secondary forests were <6 years old, <4% were over 30 years old). In the context of legally binding international climate treaties and a rapidly changing political backdrop, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of encouraging tropical forest restoration to mitigate anthropogenic climate change. Amazon secondary forests could make a valuable contribution to Brazil's Nationally Determined Contribution provided there are robust systems in place to ensure permanence. We consider how to improve communication between scientists and decision-makers and identify pressing areas of future research.

TI  - Putting fire on the map of Brazilian savanna ecoregions
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) is considered the most floristically diverse savanna in the world, home to more than seven thousand species. The region is a mosaic of savannas, grasslands and forests whose unique biophysical and landscape attributes are on the basis of a recent ecoregional map, paving the way to improved region-based strategies for land management actions. However, as a fire-prone ecosystem, Cerrado owes much of its distribution and ecological properties to the fire regime and contributes to an important parcel of South America burned area. Accordingly, any attempt to use ecoregion geography as a guide for management strategies should take fire into account, as an essential variable. The main aim of this study is to complement the ecoregional map of the Cerrado with information related to the fire component. Using remotely sensed information, we identify patterns and trends of fire frequency, intensity, seasonality, extent and scar size, and combine this information for each ecoregion, relying on a simple classification that summarizes the main fire characteristics over the last two decades. Results show a marked north-south fire activity gradient, with increased contributions from MATOPIBA, the latest agricultural frontier. Five ecoregions alone account for two thirds of yearly burned area. More intense fires are found in the Arc of Deforestation and eastern ecoregions, while ecoregions in MATOPIBA display decreasing fire intensity. An innovative analysis of fire scars stratified by size class shows that infrequent large fires are responsible for the majority of burned area. These large fires display positive trends over many ecoregions, whereas smaller fires, albeit more frequent, have been decreasing in number. The final fire classification scheme shows well defined spatially-aggregated groups, where trends are found to be the key factor to evaluate fire within their regional contexts. Results presented here provide new insights to improve fire management strategies under a changing climate.

TI  - Comparing contemporary and lifetime rates of carbon accumulation from secondary forests in the eastern Amazon
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary forests (SFs) growing on previously cleared land could be a low-cost climate change mitigation strategy due to their potential to sequester CO2. However, given widespread changes in climate and land-use in the Amazon in the past 20 years, it is not clear whether current rates of carbon uptake by SFs reflect estimates based on dividing the carbon stock by the estimated age of the forest. This is important, as differences between methodological approaches could lead to important discrepancies in estimates of carbon accumulation. Furthermore, we know little about how carbon uptake rates of secondary forests vary across some of the most deforested regions of the Amazon, where reforestation actions are most needed. Here, we compare the rates of carbon accumulation estimated over the lifetime of a stand (by stand age) with the contemporary rates estimated by recensus data, based on 28 permanent SFs plots distributed across four regions. Then, we compare how carbon uptakes rates vary across regions and how they compare to previous studies. The average rates of contemporary (1.23 +/- 0.57 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) and lifetime (1.14 +/- 0.63 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) carbon accumulation were strongly correlated (r = 0.78) and similar between regions. Overall, our carbon accumulation rates were much lower than other estimates of Amazonian SFs, which suggests that regions with the greatest opportunities for large-scale implementation of SFs have some of the slowest rates of carbon accumulation. Contrary to predictions from chronosequence analysis, the lack of difference between lifetime and contemporary rates of carbon accumulation suggests forests are maintaining a consistent rate of growth in the first decades after abandonment. These results-combined with the high rates of ongoing environmental change - highlight the importance of continuing to monitor the rate of carbon accumulation in secondary forests. This is necessary to support the implementation and monitoring of large-scale passive restoration in the highly-deforested Amazon.

TI  - A review of the freshwater diversity in the Okavango Delta and Lake Ngami (Botswana): taxonomic composition, ecology, comparison with similar systems and conservation status.
T2  - Aquatic Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater organisms in the Okavango Delta and Lake Ngami (Botswana) provide direct and indirect benefits to people and the economy of the region. However, their existence could be potentially threatened by human activities (primarily, upstream water abstraction and planned hydropower structures) coupled with climate change. For their protection, it is essential to know their distribution, ecology, and status of the ecosystems that they inhabit. Publications that record taxa from the Delta at species level are scarce, particularly aquatic macroinvertebrates. Identifying organisms to species level can provide more accurate information for environmental monitoring and conservation programmes but requires significant training and expertise. Here, we present a comprehensive taxonomical review of 2204 freshwater species from the Okavango Delta and Lake Ngami, with additional 355 species found in other areas of Botswana that are likely to be present in the study region. We also compare the diversity of the Okavango Delta and Lake Ngami with two other tropical wetlands: the Pantanal (Brazil) and the Kakadu Region (Australia). We show that biodiversity in the Okavango Delta and Lake Ngami is higher than in previous estimates, with recorded species richness dominated by phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates. Most species are widespread across the system and southern Africa. The resulting database includes new records (Bryozoa, Porifera), information on species conservation status, habitat, ecology, distribution in continental Africa, site details and taxonomical notes. This will be an essential resource for researchers, conservation managers, policy makers and consultants investigating freshwater biodiversity in tropical wetlands in the region.

TI  - Bibliometric Analysis of Trends and Future Directions of Research and Development of Seed Orchards
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Seed orchards are important seed resources for producing improved tree crops for future plantations, forest restoration, and forestry practices (i.e., gene conservation) and for transmitting current gene diversity to future generations. Seed orchards are a major sub-division in forest science. The establishment and management of a seed orchard involves many steps, from the selection of superior trees to the harvesting of a seed crop. Studying the trends and future directions of seed orchards using different analysis methods is critically important, especially to establish resistant forests via the production of climate-smart, biotic/abiotic-stress-resistant seedling materials. Published papers related to seed orchards should be analyzed to determine the current trends in this field and to contribute to its future directions. Bibliometric analysis has been used for different purposes in various scientific fields. However, it has not been performed for publications in seed orchards. This study was carried out to analyze the current trends of research on seed orchards and to determine the future directions of these orchards based on published papers. For these purposes, 1018 published papers were obtained from the Science Citation Index, Science Citation Index Expanded, and citation index databases of "Web of Science" using the keyword "seed orchard". The papers were published between 1980 and 2022 and were subjected to bibliometric analysis based on the most prolific contributors, references, countries, and keywords. CiteSpace software 6.1 R6 was applied to visualize information about seed orchard research. The average number of citations per publication was 13.05, and the 4 H-Index of the publication set was 48. The most prolific contributors with the strongest citation bursts, the highest centrality, and the greatest numbers of published papers were from Canada, Sweden, South Korea, Finland, and Czech Republic, while Canada (186 published articles), the USA (140), and Sweden (115), together with China, Brazil, and Germany, were active countries, especially based on citations from recent years. The "keywords" of the papers were the core of the research. "Mating pattern", "Swedish forestry", "fertility variation", "Hymenoscyphus fraxineus", "threatened Pacific sandalwood", "outbreeding depression", "climate change", "management", and "growth", together with others such as "genetic improvement" and "effective size", were active study areas and keywords, based on results of the analysis. They also guided the literature search and inventory and classification of early studies and served as predictors for future studies. The results of this study are discussed based on the trends and future directions of the research and development of seed orchards.

TI  - Synthesizing Global and Local Datasets to Estimate Jurisdictional Forest Carbon Fluxes in Berau, Indonesia
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundForest conservation efforts are increasingly being implemented at the scale of sub-national jurisdictions in order to mitigate global climate change and provide other ecosystem services. We see an urgent need for robust estimates of historic forest carbon emissions at this scale, as the basis for credible measures of climate and other benefits achieved. Despite the arrival of a new generation of global datasets on forest area change and biomass, confusion remains about how to produce credible jurisdictional estimates of forest emissions. We demonstrate a method for estimating the relevant historic forest carbon fluxes within the Regency of Berau in eastern Borneo, Indonesia. Our method integrates best available global and local datasets, and includes a comprehensive analysis of uncertainty at the regency scale.Principal Findings and SignificanceWe find that Berau generated 8.91 +/- 1.99 million tonnes of net CO2 emissions per year during 2000-2010. Berau is an early frontier landscape where gross emissions are 12 times higher than gross sequestration. Yet most (85%) of Berau's original forests are still standing. The majority of net emissions were due to conversion of native forests to unspecified agriculture (43% of total), oil palm (28%), and fiber plantations (9%). Most of the remainder was due to legal commercial selective logging (17%). Our overall uncertainty estimate offers an independent basis for assessing three other estimates for Berau. Two other estimates were above the upper end of our uncertainty range. We emphasize the importance of including an uncertainty range for all parameters of the emissions equation to generate a comprehensive uncertainty estimate-which has not been done before. We believe comprehensive estimates of carbon flux uncertainty are increasingly important as national and international institutions are challenged with comparing alternative estimates and identifying a credible range of historic emissions values.

TI  - Transaction and abatement costs of carbon-sink projects in developing countries
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Projects in the forestry sector, and land-use change and forestry projects more generally, have the potential to help mitigate global warming by acting as sinks for greenhouse gasses, particularly CO(2). However, concerns have been expressed that participation in carbon-sink projects may be constrained by high costs. This problem may be particularly severe for projects involving smallholders in developing countries. Of particular concern are the transaction costs incurred in developing projects, measuring, certifying, and selling the carbon-sequestration services generated by such projects. This paper addresses these issues by reviewing the implications of transaction and abatement costs in carbon-sequestration projects. An approach to estimating abatement costs is demonstrated through four case studies of agroforestry systems located in Sumatra, Indonesia. A typology of transaction costs is presented and related to existing pilot projects. The paper concludes with recommendations to reduce the disadvantages that smallholders may face in capturing the opportunities offered by carbon markets.

TI  - Tree-crop interactions and their environmental and economic implications in the presence of carbon-sequestration payments
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing emphasis on market-based solutions to environmental problems, both under and outside of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, means that carbon sequestered in the biomass and soils of agroforestry systems is likely to acquire a direct market value. If the incentive provided by carbon markets is large enough, this may alter the economics of growing trees, which is often not an attractive land-use alternative due to high establishment costs and delayed revenues. In this paper, the effect of carbon payments on the economic attractiveness of growing trees is investigated for a tree-crop agroforest in Indonesia using a simulation-modelling approach. An economic model is developed to analyze the economic implications of carbon payments from the standpoint of the individual landholder. The simulation is implemented in WaNuLCAS, a model that accounts for water, nutrients, light and carbon in agroforestry systems. The value of switching from a continuous-cropping system to an agroforestry system participating in carbon trading was estimated at $109 ha(-1) in present value terms. Although these results vary depending on assumptions regarding carbon prices and costs of carbon monitoring, they essentially show that the benefits of participating in markets for carbon sequestration can exceed the costs. The optimal management regime, both with and without carbon payments, was to plant 15% of the area to trees and to adopt a low firewood-harvest regime, with 75% of tree prunings being returned to the soil to restore carbon and nutrients. Approximately 22% of the economic benefits obtained by switching land use were attributed to carbon trading and the remaining 78% were attributed to improvements in land productivity. The paper ends with a brief discussion of the implications of the findings for policy and management. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Indigenous Burning as Conservation Practice: Neotropical Savanna Recovery amid Agribusiness Deforestation in Central Brazil
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - International efforts to address climate change by reducing tropical deforestation increasingly rely on indigenous reserves as conservation units and indigenous peoples as strategic partners. Considered win-win situations where global conservation measures also contribute to cultural preservation, such alliances also frame indigenous peoples in diverse ecological settings with the responsibility to offset global carbon budgets through fire suppression based on the presumed positive value of non-alteration of tropical landscapes. Anthropogenic fire associated with indigenous ceremonial and collective hunting practices in the Neotropical savannas (cerrado) of Central Brazil is routinely represented in public and scientific conservation discourse as a cause of deforestation and increased CO2 emissions despite a lack of supporting evidence. We evaluate this claim for the Xavante people of Pimentel Barbosa Indigenous Reserve, Brazil. Building upon 23 years of longitudinal interdisciplinary research in the area, we used multi-temporal spatial analyses to compare land cover change under indigenous and agribusiness management over the last four decades (1973-2010) and quantify the contemporary Xavante burning regime contributing to observed patterns based on a four year sample at the end of this sequence (2007-2010). The overall proportion of deforested land remained stable inside the reserve (0.6%) but increased sharply outside (1.5% to 26.0%). Vegetation recovery occurred where reserve boundary adjustments transferred lands previously deforested by agribusiness to indigenous management. Periodic traditional burning by the Xavante had a large spatial distribution but repeated burning in consecutive years was restricted. Our results suggest a need to reassess overreaching conservation narratives about the purported destructiveness of indigenous anthropogenic fire in the cerrado. The real challenge to conservation in the fire-adapted cerrado biome is the long-term sustainability of indigenous lands and other tropical conservation islands increasingly subsumed by agribusiness expansion rather than the localized subsistence practices of indigenous and other traditional peoples.

TI  - Sustainable development in Sao Paulo's Green Belt Biosphere Reserve: between the void of municipal environmental policies and the ecosystem management of the territory
T2  - REVISTA DE GESTAO AMBIENTAL E SUSTENTABILIDADE-GEAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The Green Belt Biosphere Reserve, with 2.33 million hectares and its internal urban area with 220 thousand hectares, is configured as a water security territory and expresses a direct relationship between urban development and areas that ensure well-being and ecosystem services for 12% of Brazil's population. With seventy-eight municipalities that fully or partially integrate the GBBR, the socioeconomic differences and the different contexts of urbanization and governance reflect on territorial management at the local level and impact the environmental and regional sustainable development agendas. Objective: Based on a survey of environmental policies and correlations between economic and socio-environmental indicators on a municipal scale for the entire study area, this article assesses the level of development of the main environmental public policies and identifies the relationship between these policies and socio-environmental indicators. Originality: Although the Green Belt Biosphere Reserve is an area recognized by the United Nations (UN), the management of its territory depends on municipal actions that comprise it. Little attention has been paid to environmental management, especially in terms of public environmental policies and a broad and ongoing understanding of the conservation of this area. Results: The analysis shows that the different municipalities in the GBBR have different levels of implementation regarding Environmental Agenda. When considering the Municipal Plans for Urban Afforestation, Adaptation to Climate Change, Atlantic Forest and Solid Waste, only Guaruja, Mogi das Cruzes, Santos and Sao Paulo have these four policies in preparation or completed, while for 33.3% (n=25) of the municipalities, none of these agendas was developed, and a positive correlation was identified between the HDI and the largest number of implemented policies. Contribution: Large and medium-sized cities in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, present studies addressing ecological patterns and processes, however, they do not address specific questions on the environmental sector itself, which this paper aimed at providing. Conclusion: As the Green Belt accounts for 72% of the volume of drinking water in all of Sao Paulo, the disparities between the municipal indicators analyzed reinforce the need to adopt the GBBR as a platform for adequate governance to integrate policies at different scales for sustainable regional development. Systemic efforts are needed, especially at the municipal scale, in order to carry out adequate environmental management of the GBBR territory.

TI  - Towards the reference ecosystems for quartzitic campo rupestre: Floristic composition and soil relationships
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The loss and fragmentation of tropical habitats, especially extreme megadiverse environments like the campo rupestre (rupestrian grassland), impacts biodiversity and ecosystem services essential to millions of people. The campo rupestre is a grassy ecosystem of the Cerrado biome, a center of endemism in Brazil with high floristic richness and environmental heterogeneity, where plants have developed multiple adaptive strategies and form a vegetation mosaic shaped by local soil and microhabitat conditions. However, this ecosystem has been under severe land use conversion, while signs of augmenting pressure from climate change are now recorded at faster pace. Thus, understanding the particularities of its multiple habitats is fundamental to define habitat specific references to guide conservation and restoration projects that lead to increased biodiversity. In this work, for the first time, we characterize the floristic composition of the shrub and herbaceous strata and related them to the edaphic characteristics of the four main habitats that form the campo rupestre mosaic: rocky outcrop, stony grassland, sandy grassland, and peat bog. A total of 12,000 m2 of shrub layer (120 plots of 10 x 10 m) and 120 m2 (120 plots of 1 x 1 m) of herbaceous layer were sampled. We recorded 257 species belonging to 47 different families, and also observed a high species turnover among the four different habitats. Furthermore, we identified species from both ends of the edaphic gradient of the four habitats and emphasized the importance of multi- regional studies to evaluate the association among species and soils before implementing any restoration project. This study provides the knowledge base to build the reference ecosystems for the mosaic of campo rupestre habitat types.

T2  - 1ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SUSTAINABLE TROPICAL LAND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 1st International Conference on Sustainable Tropical Land Management (ICSTLM)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Previous studies have been recognized that biochar addition to poor soil may lead to improve soil and crop productivity, also reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the results were varied and the mechanisms were not clear. Two rates of rice husk (RH) and cacao shell (CS) biochar namely 0 and 15 t ha(-1) were applied to soil, to investigate the effect of RH and CS biochar on soil chemical properties, nutrient uptake, crop yield, and N2O emissions reduction on upland rice at acidic soil of East Lampung. It was residual effect study; biochar was applied only in the first planting season of 2012. In addition, N2O emissions from the soil were monitored with close chamber method. The result showed that 15 t ha(-1) CS biochar treatment was the best treatment, resulted 1.21 t ha(-1)yield. Meanwhile on 15 t ha(-1) RH biochar treatment was only 0.22 t ha(-1). However, no significance difference on both nutrient uptake and N2O emissions among the treatments. N2O emissions from RH and CS biochar treatment were reduced 26% and 21% compare to control. Our result proposed that CS biochar may use as soil amendment, to improve crop productivity and also to combat climate change.

TI  - One Health tropical wetlands: a transdisciplinary framework for assessing the risks of emerging zoonotic diseases in the Brazilian Pantanal.
T2  - Wetlands Ecology and Management
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pantanal wetland ecosystem of Brazil is experiencing unprecedented local challenges from anthropogenic pressures, as well as from global climate change. These pressures escalate the zoonotic risks from wildlife populations, whose own susceptibility to disease is enhanced by stressors including habitat loss and fragmentation with the resulting decrement in food availability, immunity and resilience in the face of compounding disease risks. This continuous degradation and fragmentation of the ecosystem increases interactions between animals and humans (including indigenous peoples and local communities) further increasing disease risks for the human populations. Weak health systems across the Pantanal are reflected in limited pathogen surveillance, and poor sanitation and disease control measures, serving to further amplify the region's epidemic and pandemic potential. Using a transdisciplinary One Health (OH) approach to understand the ecological, social and biological drivers of infectious diseases, our research network developed a framework to conceptualise the current tools, evidence and processes for effective research and knowledge production in the Pantanal Wetland ecosystem. Drawing on the expertise of researchers and non-academic key-stakeholders can inform the work of global OH research networks and strengthen the evidence base for OH policy and practice in the Pantanal and other tropical wetland systems.

TI  - Effects of agricultural management and of climate change on N2O emissions in an area of the Brazilian Cerrado: Measurements and simulations using the STICS soil-crop model
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil-plant simulation models have been ever more used as predictive tools to evaluate productivity and envi-ronmental impacts of agriculture practices. The aims of this work were to evaluate the STICS model's capacity of simulate the emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) under different management systems. And, to predict, by applying the calibrated and validated STICS model, the N2O emissions, under different management systems, in the edaphoclimatic conditions of the Brazilian Cerrado. The study was conducted in a long-term experiment at Embrapa Cerrados, located in Planaltina/DF, Brazil. The experiment started in 1995. The following land use systems were evaluated: CT -conventional tillage with disc harrow, and biannual grass/legume rotation; NT1 -No-tillage, with biannual crop rotation - soybean/sorghum; NT2 -No-tillage, with biannual crop rotation - maize/pigeon pea.Closed static chambers and gas sample analysis by gas chromatography were used to measure N2O fluxes. The model was calibrated with the data measured in the CT and NT1 treatments. The attributes used in the calibration were: growth, development and yield of crops and N2O fluxes. To test the model, data from the NT2 treatment was used. Data for all treatments were collected at the same time. After calibration and validation, the STICS model was used to predict the effects of soil management systems, conventional (CT) and no-tillage (NT) on greenhouse gas emissions and on grain and biomass crops production. The simulation was made for the period from 2021 to 2070. The STICS model performed well at simulation of the following parameters: N2O emissions, soil water dynamics, soil temperature; and leaf area, aerial biomass and grain yield of soybean and maize. The performance of the model was good for the conventional soil management system as well as in the no-tillage system. Based on the predicted increase in temperature for the period 2021-2070, we can conclude from the data generated through the STICS model that there is strong evidence that grain yield and total aerial biomass of plants will decrease. The data show that there is a rising tendency in N2O emissions over the simulated period. This is expected to occur for the two soil management systems studied (NT and CT). We believe this increase in emissions along the years is related to temperature increase and to the reduction of crop cycle.

TI  - Applied nucleation under high biodiversity silvopastoral system as an adaptive strategy against microclimate extremes in pasture areas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to assess the influence of the high biodiversity silvopastoral system (SPSnu) on the microclimate, pasture production, and pasture chemical composition. Microclimate variables and pasture production and chemical composition were measured in pared paddocks under SPSnu and treeless pasture (TLP) in a commercial farm during four seasons in Southern Brazil. SPSnu measurements were subdivided into two areas: around the nuclei (AN) and area inter-nuclei (IN). In the TLP paddocks, we plotted fictitious nuclei with the same areas and distributions of SPSnu, however without trees. For the microclimate measurements, these areas were noted when shaded or unshaded by the nuclei trees. In each season, the microclimate variables air temperature (AT, degrees C), relative humidity (RH, %), illuminance (Ilu, lux), wind speed (WS, m/s), and soil surface temperature (SST, degrees C) were measured. In addition, botanical composition (%), pasture production (kg/DM/ ha), and pasture chemical composition were evaluated. The SPSnu provided the lowest values of microclimate variables in all seasons (p < 0.05), except for the relative humidity. Winter had the highest thermal amplitude in the systems. The highest difference between SPSnu and TLP for AT (4.3 degrees C) and SST (5.2 degrees C) was measured during the hot seasons (spring and summer). In contrast, during cold seasons (autumn and winter) it observed highest thermal amplitude between SPSnu and TLP. Overall, the highest annual pasture production was observed in the SPSnu (p < 0.05). During the summer, the SPSnu areas showed the highest values of crude protein and dry matter (p < 0.05). During the winter, the TLP showed the lowest values (p < 0.05) of pasture production and dry matter. It was observed that SPSnu improved the microclimate at the pasture level, influencing pasture production and pasture chemical composition. The enhanced microclimate can partially mitigate some of the effects of climate change on pastoral agroecosystems, creating conditions for ecological rehabilitation of ecosystem processes and services. These conditions could be amplified to a biome level through a payment for ecosystem services program.

TI  - Roads and forest edges facilitate yellow fever virus dispersion
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape connectivity is important for a wide range of ecological processes, including to disease spread, once it describes the degree to which landscapes facilitate or impede vector and hosts dispersion. Understanding connectivity is extremely important to identify where pathogens can move, and at what speed, allowing the organization of vaccination campaigns or other preventive measures. To better understand the effects of landscape connectivity on yellow fever virus (YFV) dispersion in Brazil, we used a network approach and modelled the movement of non-human primates' cases, the so-called epizootic events, over time. The networks consider each epizootic event as a node and the dispersion between nodes as links. Those links were established considering, respectively, the date of each epizootic event, the distance among the nodes and the permeability of the landscape between each pair of nodes. Our results demonstrated that on average YFV dispersed 1.42 km/day, with the largest movement being 6.9 km/day. Dispersions were longer in summer (1.2 km/day) than in winter (0.22 km/day). Most dispersal movements occurred up to 1 km/day (71%) and within a week after the arrival of the virus in the source node (73%), except in winter, where dispersions occurred within a period of up to 20 days. The best model indicates that YFV disperses mainly through roads adjacent to forest areas, and along forest edges (within a range of 100 m) in interface with agricultural areas, water and forestry areas. Core areas of urban, agricultural and forest regions were important barriers for virus movement. Synthesis and applications. Through landscape connectivity analyses, we provided here the first evidence that highly fragmented landscapes with a wide road network and large densities of forest edges facilitate yellow fever virus propagation, and that the maintenance of large blocks of forest can help to inhibit this spread. These results can contribute to guide forest restoration and landscape management actions in order to amplify health benefits related to restoration projects, in addition to their benefits for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation.

TI  - Integrating farmers' views, field soil erosion assessment, and pot experiments to evaluate different agroforestry systems in Timor-Leste
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Over 75% of subsistence farmers in rural Timor-Leste face challenges from unsustainable land use practices, particularly slash-and-burn farming on degraded steep slopes. These practices contribute to soil erosion, and poor crop yields, ultimately leading to land and environmental degradation and food insecurity. Recently, agroforestry projects have aimed to improve land productivity and farmers' livelihoods, though their impact remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate these impacts through three research questions: (1) How do agroforestry interventions impact field crop performance and smallholder farmers' livelihoods? (2) What is the extent of farmer adoption of these interventions? (3) What is the effect of agroforestry interventions on soil physical and chemical characteristics? The study was conducted at the Global Climate Change Alliance (GCCA) project site at Saraida, Quelicai, Baucau municipality, during the rainy season from December 2021 to April 2022. Interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with 35 farmers involved in the project, alongside field assessments of soil erosion and pot experiments. The results showed that most farmers reported improved production and outcomes from growing trees and would like to replicate agroforestry systems, suggesting adoption likelihood due to the multiple benefits of agroforestry, including soil improvement, animal feed, fuelwood provision, and environmental and biodiversity sustainability. Measurements of soil loss and plant productivity confirmed the positive impact of agroforestry, reducing soil erosion by nearly 15 times compared to traditional fallow systems and improving crop growth and yields in both fallow and slash-and-mulch systems. This study provides essential baseline data and guidance for future farmland management in Timor-Leste.

TI  - Characteristics and utilization of black soils in Indonesia
T2  - SAINS TANAH
M3  - Article
AB  - Black soils store a high amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) and play a crucial role in climate change, food security, and land degradation neutrality. However, data and information regarding black soils in tropical regions, including Indonesia, are limited. This study aimed to characterize and identify the utilization of black soils in Indonesia based on legacy soil survey data. We collated 142 soil pedon samples of Mollisols from articles, technical reports, and existing datasets. The site information (site position, elevation, land use type, parent material) and selected physicochemical properties were stored in a spreadsheet, from which exploratory data analysis was conducted. The result showed that the median SOC content was 1.53%, ranging from 0.6 to 8.2 %; cation exchange capacity was 30 cmol kg(-1) , ranging from 9 to 95 cmol kg(-1) ; base saturation was 87%, ranging from 11 to 100 %; and bulk density was 1.21 g cm(-3 ), ranging from 1.13 to 1.36 g cm(-3) . Other soil characteristics (particle size distribution, exchangeable bases, pH, pore, and water retention) varied with horizon type and land use/land cover. The black soils have been used for paddy fields, dryland farming, and gardens with low management intensity. Main cultivated crops include rice (Oryza sativa), corn (Zea mays), cassava (Manihot esculenta), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), and nutmeg (Myristica fragrans), clove (Syzygium aromaticum), coconut (Cocos nucifera), and cocoa (Theobroma cocoa). Threats to black soil functions include soil erosion, carbon loss, and nutrient imbalance. Soil and water conservation measures, integrated soil nutrient management, and agroforestry are among the best land management practices for black soils.

TI  - Low-carbon agricultural technologies improve forage and feed production in the Caatinga biome, Brazil: Characteristics, comparison, effects of climate change, resilience, local development, and food security
T2  - SCIENTIA AGROPECUARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Adjustments in Brazilian livestock are necessary to minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, since the largest source of methane comes from ruminants' enteric fermentation, and of carbon from deforestation. Low-carbon agriculture technologies (LCAT) contribute to mitigating these emissions and this study evaluates the role of these technologies on ruminant forage production in Caatinga. A Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threats analysis was used to elucidate the main features, followed by an Analytic Hierarchical Process, ranking the LCAT, and a risk analysis. Integrated Crop-Livestock-Forest System (ICLFS) is the most recommended technology, followed by Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) and Recovery of Degraded Areas with Pastures (RDA-P). The results can aid in the choice of the LCAT to be implemented by the smallholder in Caatinga, demonstrating the need to strengthen rural technical assistance, so that there is a real benefit to the producer and the environment.

TI  - Rice in cropping systems-Modelling transitions between flooded and non-flooded soil environments
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water shortages in many rice-growing regions, combined with growing global imperatives to increase food production, are driving research into increased water use efficiency and modified agricultural practices in rice-based cropping systems. Well-tested cropping systems models that capture interactions between soil water and nutrient dynamics, crop growth, climate and management can assist in the evaluation of new agricultural practices. The APSIM model was designed to simulate diverse crop sequences, residue/tillage practices and specification of field management options. It was previously unable to simulate processes associated with the long-term flooded or saturated soil conditions encountered in rice-based systems, due to its heritage in dryland cropping applications. To address this shortcoming, the rice crop components of the ORYZA2000 rice model were incorporated and modifications were made to the APSIM soil water and nutrient modules to include descriptions of soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics under anaerobic conditions. We established a process for simulating the two-way transition between anaerobic and aerobic soil conditions occurring in crop sequences of flooded rice and other nonflooded crops, pastures and fallows. These transitions are dynamically simulated and driven by modelled hydraulic variables (soil water and floodwater depth). Descriptions of floodwater biological and chemical processes were also added. Our assumptions included a simplified approach to modelling O-2 transport processes in saturated soils. The improved APSIM model was tested against diverse, replicated experimental datasets for rice-based cropping systems, representing a spectrum of geographical locations (Australia, Indonesia and Philippines), soil types, management practices, crop species, varieties and sequences. The model performed equally well in simulating rice grain yield during multi-season crop sequences as the original validation testing reported for the stand-alone ORYZA2000 model simulating single crops (n = 121, R-2 = 0.81 with low bias (slope, alpha = 1.02, intercept, beta = -323 kg ha(-1)), RMSE = 1061 kg ha(-1) (cf. SD of measured data = 2160 kg ha(-1))). This suggests robustness in APSIM's simulation of the rice-growing environment and provides evidence on the usefulness of our modifications and practicality of our assumptions. Aspects of particular strength were identified (crop rotations; response to applied fertilizers; the performance of bare fallows), together with areas for further development work (simulation of retained crop stubble during fallows, greenhouse gas emissions). APSIM is now suitable to investigate production responses of potential agronomic and management changes in rice-based cropping systems, particularly in response to future imperatives linked to resource availability, climate change, and food security. Further testing is required to evaluate the impact of our simplified assumptions on the model's simulation of greenhouse gas emissions in rice-based cropping systems.

TI  - Evaluating year-to-year anomalies in tropical wetland methane emissions using satellite CH4 observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural wetlands are the largest source of methane emissions, contributing 20-40% of global emissions and dominating the inter-annual variability. Large uncertainties remain on their variability and response to climate change.This study uses atmospheric methane observations from the GOSAT satellite to evaluate methane wetland emission estimates. We assess how well simulations reproduce the observed methane inter-annual variability by evaluating the detrended seasonal cycle. The latitudinal means agree well but maximum differences in the tropics of 28.1-34.8 ppb suggest that all simulations fail to capture the extent of the tropical wetland seasonal cycle.We focus further analysis on the major natural wetlands in South America: the seasonally flooded savannah of the Pantanal (Brazil) and Llanos de Moxos (Bolivia) regions; and the riverine wetlands formed by the Parana River (Argentina). We see large discrepancies between simulation and observation over the Pantanal and Llanos de Moxos region in 2010, 2011 and 2014 and over the Parana River region in 2010 and 2014. We find highly consistent behaviour between the time and location of these methane anomalies and the change in wetland extent, driven by precipitation related to El Nino Southern Oscillation activity.We conclude that the inability of land surface models to increase wetland extent through overbank inundation is the primary cause of these observed discrepancies and can lead to under-estimation of methane fluxes by as much as 50% (5.3-11.8 Tg yr(-1)) of the observed emissions for the combined Pantanal and Parana regions. As the hydrology of these regions is heavily linked to ENSO variability, being able to reproduce changes in wetland behaviour is important for successfully predicting their methane emissions.

TI  - Locating REDD: A global survey and analysis of REDD readiness and demonstration activities
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mechanisms that support reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD/REDD+) have potential to counteract a large share of global greenhouse gas emissions if implemented effectively across the tropics. In 2007 the conference of parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change called upon parties and international organizations to promote REDD through investments in capacity building and demonstration activities. This prompted many new actors to become involved in REDD activities at a variety of locations and scales. A global survey of REDD activities was undertaken in 2009 to enable better understanding of the intensity and geographic distribution of these activities. Existing compilations, literature review, web-based sources, face-to-face and telephone interviews, and e-mail questionnaires were used to compile data for the inventory. Inter alia, data were collected on the location of activities and official and unofficial factors influencing location choices. Inventory data were combined with secondary data to estimate a statistical count model (Poisson) of factors affecting the number of REDD activities undertaken in the 64 developing countries that experienced significant emissions from deforestation. The results show that there were at least 79 REDD readiness activities and 100 REDD demonstration activities as of October 2009. Of these, the largest shares of REDD readiness and demonstration activities were implemented in Indonesia (7 and 15 respectively) and Brazil (4 and 13 respectively), countries widely agreed to have the greatest potential for reducing forest-based emissions. The statistical results found no national characteristic to have a statistically-significant effect on the number of REDD readiness activities, but five national characteristics to have significant effects on the number of REDD demonstration projects. Baseline CO2 emissions, forest carbon stock, number of threatened species, quality of governance, and region all had significant effects. The results reveal the importance of biodiversity and good governance, and the relative unimportance of human need and opportunity cost of land. The results also reveal a bias against Africa and toward Latin America. Unless this pattern is countered, REDD and REDD+ may have geographic biases that undermine its broad political support.

AB  - In 1998, Peugeot and the French Forestry Office (Office National des Forets - ONF) launched a carbon sink project in Brazil, in the north of the Mato Grosso. Planting began in 1999 over an area of 2 500 ha which had been used as pasture by the previous owner. The main objective of the plantation was to fix maximum quantities of carbon while preserving the area's biodiversity and local development potential. The species planted were mostly native and chosen for their success rates and their environmental and market value. Effects on the local environment are monitored as part of the project. A specific method was developed to monitor carbon flows by comparing the project's carbon budget with the budget in the reference scenario (which represents the situation had the project not taken place). As well as testing technical schemes for a plantation of mixed native species, the pilot project also provides opportunities for fieldwork on carbon sink monitoring methods as required under the Kyoto Protocol. The project does not aim to provide Peugeot with carbon credits, but should produce useful new data for other projects stemming from the Clean Development Mechanism.

TI  - A new data-driven map predicts substantial undocumented peatland areas in Amazonia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatlands are among the most carbon-dense terrestrial ecosystems yet recorded. Collectively, they comprise a large but highly uncertain reservoir of the global carbon cycle, with wide-ranging estimates of their global area (441 025-1700 000 km2) and below-ground carbon storage (105-288 Pg C). Substantial gaps remain in our understanding of peatland distribution in some key regions, including most of tropical South America. Here we compile 2413 ground reference points in and around Amazonian peatlands and use them alongside a stack of remote sensing products in a random forest model to generate the first field-data-driven model of peatland distribution across the Amazon basin. Our model predicts a total Amazonian peatland extent of 251 015 km2 (95th percentile confidence interval: 128 671-373 359), greater than that of the Congo basin, but around 30% smaller than a recent model-derived estimate of peatland area across Amazonia. The model performs relatively well against point observations but spatial gaps in the ground reference dataset mean that model uncertainty remains high, particularly in parts of Brazil and Bolivia. For example, we predict significant peatland areas in northern Peru with relatively high confidence, while peatland areas in the Rio Negro basin and adjacent south-western Orinoco basin which have previously been predicted to hold Campinarana or white sand forests, are predicted with greater uncertainty. Similarly, we predict large areas of peatlands in Bolivia, surprisingly given the strong climatic seasonality found over most of the country. Very little field data exists with which to quantitatively assess the accuracy of our map in these regions. Data gaps such as these should be a high priority for new field sampling. This new map can facilitate future research into the vulnerability of peatlands to climate change and anthropogenic impacts, which is likely to vary spatially across the Amazon basin.

TI  - Aquatic processing enhances the loss of aged carbon from drained and burned peatlands
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water-logged peatlands store tremendous amounts of soil carbon (C) globally, accumulating C over millennia. As peatlands become disturbed by human activity, these long-term C stores are getting destabilized and ultimately released as greenhouse gases that may exacerbate climate change. Oxidation of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) mobilized from disturbed soils to streams and canals may be one avenue for the transfer of previously stored, millennia-aged C to the atmosphere. However, it remains unknown whether aged peat-derived DOC undergoes oxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2) following disturbance. Here, we use a new approach to measure the radiocarbon content of CO2 produced from the oxidation of DOC in canals overlying peatland soils that have undergone widespread disturbance in Indonesia. This work shows for the first time that aged DOC mobilized from drained and burned peatland soils is susceptible to oxidation by both microbial respiration and photomineralization over aquatic travel times for DOC. The bulk radiocarbon age of CO2 produced during canal oxidation ranged from modern to similar to 1300 years before present. These ages for CO2 were most strongly influenced by canal water depth, which was proportional to the water table level where DOC is mobilized from disturbed soils to canals. Canal microbes preferentially respired older or younger organic C pools to CO2, and this may have been facilitated by the use of a small particulate organic C pool over the dissolved pool. Given that high densities of canals are generally associated with lower water tables and higher fire risk, our findings suggest that peatland areas with high canal density may be a hotspot for the loss of aged C on the landscape. Taken together, the results of this study show how and why aquatic processing of organic C on the landscape can enhance the transfer of long-term peat C stores to the atmosphere following disturbance.

TI  - Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi and Soil Quality Indicators in Eucalyptus genotypes With Different Drought Tolerance Levels
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FUNGAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Silviculture has great importance worldwide, and the use of Eucalyptus species, which account for 75% of the local planted forest in Brazil, is one of the factors that contributes to the success of this activity in the country. Despite its adaptability, the yield of Eucalyptus is often affected by climate change, particularly water deficiency. Plants have developed strategies to mitigate water stress, for example, through their association with mycorrhizal fungi. The genus Eucalyptus, particularly in the plant domain, establishes symbioses with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECMF). The influence of Eucalyptus species on AMF and soil quality indicators is not well understood. Our aim was to conduct a preliminary evaluation of the various responses of soil AMF communities and soil nutrient dynamics in the presence of Eucalyptus species with different degrees of drought tolerance. A field experiment was established containing six Eucalyptus species, E. brassiana, E. camaldulensis, E. citriodora, E. cloeziana, E. grandis, and E. urophylla, all of which were planted in large plots. Soil and root samples were taken when the plants were 1.7 and 2.2 years old. We found that Eucalyptus species with low (E. grandis and E. urophylla) and intermediate drought tolerance (E. citriodora and E. cloeziana) showed stronger correlations with the AMF community than Eucalyptus species with high drought tolerance (E. brassiana and E. camaldulensis). Differences were also found between Eucalyptus species for AMF spore numbers and root colonization percentages, which was most evident for E. urophylla. The microbiological attributes found to be most responsive to Eucalyptus species were soil enzyme activities, AMF spore numbers, root colonization percentages, and fungal abundance. Soil organic carbon, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, copper, and iron were the main chemical drivers related to the soil AMF community structure in the presence of E. brassiana.

TI  - Assessing Community Readiness for Payments for Ecosystem Service Schemes for Tropical Primary Forest Protection in the Democratic Republic of Congo
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Primary forest conservation is essential for limiting climate change, for meeting conservation objectives, and the Sustainable Development Goals. Schemes that compensate communities for forgone extractive uses are important policy tools, but effective deployment demands an understanding of local deforestation drivers and host communities' preferences. We use Q-methodology to reveal discourses present in three communities in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Our results reveal three factors with a common emphasis on forest conservation and preferences for compensation in the form of social investments, rather than cash. The main contrasts were in attitudes towards farming. The first discourse, we call conservationist-open to ideas, displayed a commitment to learning better practices for community material benefit in service of forest conservation. The second discourse, which demonstrated greater confidence in their capacity to support livelihoods from farming, we call aspirational artisans. The third, which was acutely aware of the impact of their farming on forest conservation, we called passive, conflicted farmers. We also demonstrate an aspiration for the continued development of farming amongst participants, which although still correlated with preferences for forest conservation, may lead to compensation schemes inadvertently stirring future land use tensions if design does not reconcile agricultural development and conservation.

TI  - Influence of climate variability, fire and phosphorus limitation on vegetation structure and dynamics of the Amazon-Cerrado border
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate, fire and soil nutrient limitation are important elements that affect vegetation dynamics in areas of the forest-savanna transition. In this paper, we use the dynamic vegetation model INLAND to evaluate the influence of interannual climate variability, fire and phosphorus (P) limitation on Amazon-Cerrado transitional vegetation structure and dynamics. We assess how each environmental factor affects net primary production, leaf area index and above-ground biomass (AGB), and compare the AGB simulations to an observed AGB map. We used two climate data sets (monthly average climate for 1961-1990 and interannual climate variability for 1948-2008), two data sets of total soil P content (one based on regional field measurements and one based on global data), and the INLAND fire module. Our results show that the inclusion of interannual climate variability, P limitation and fire occurrence each contribute to simulating vegetation types that more closely match observations. These effects are spatially heterogeneous and synergistic. In terms of magnitude, the effect of fire is strongest and is the main driver of vegetation changes along the transition. Phosphorus limitation, in turn, has a stronger effect on transitional ecosystem dynamics than interannual climate variability does. Overall, INLAND typically simulates more than 80% of the AGB variability in the transition zone. However, the AGB in many places is clearly not well simulated, indicating that important soil and physiological factors in the Amazon-Cerrado border region, such as lithology, water table depth, carbon allocation strategies and mortality rates, still need to be included in the model.

TI  - What is the impact of pasture reform on organic carbon compartments and CO2 emissions in the Brazilian Cerrado?
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The emission of CO2 from the soil in agricultural areas is the result of the interaction of several factors, including soil and crop management practices and local edaphoclimatic conditions. The dynamics of organic carbon (OC), in the midst of reform processes in agricultural areas, can be used as an indicator of chemical soil quality because carbon loss is directly related to its lability, quality, or decomposition capacity. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the reform of degraded pastures in the soil organic matter compartment and its effect on mitigating CO2 emissions. The study was carried out in the municipality of Selviria, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, in two areas destined for extensive beef cattle grazing, subsidized by the forage plant Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu. Geostatistical meshes were installed in the areas, and soil samples of deformed and undeformed structures were taken to evaluate the physical and chemical attributes of the soil. The results indicated that soil management practices, followed by the cultivation of sorghum intercropped with U. brizantha, increased the total OC (TOC) stocks through the stable fraction (OC associated with the mineral fraction) and consequent reduction in CO2 emissions from the soil. This highlights the spatial variability in CO2 emissions and how soil attributes affect the flow of CO2 into the atmosphere. The use of multivariate geostatistics has made it possible to forecast CO2 emissions from the soil. This small-scale study provides a theoretical basis for the large-scale spatial monitoring of biogeochemical processes that control CO2 emissions in agricultural ecosystems, particularly in degraded pasture areas.

TI  - REDD plus and Green Growth: synergies or discord in Vietnam and Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Green Growth (GG) has emerged as a global narrative, replacing to some extent and integrating earlier sustainable development narratives, while Reducing Emissions through avoiding Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) has developed as major item in climate change negotiations. GG and REDD+ are both considered important strategies and are often seen as synergistic in achieving major changes in economic, regulatory and governance frameworks. Of concern, however, is that GG is sometimes seen as greenwashing of economic activities (which could include forest conversion to other land uses) by an oversimplified presentation of win-win solutions without challenging the actual root causes of unsustainable growth. How GG and REDD+ can contribute to transformational change in policy and practice depends on the relationship between these narratives, especially whether their adoption in national level policies manifests synergies or discord. In this paper, we will answer this question through analysing: (1) how the two narratives have unfolded in Vietnam and Indonesia and to what extent REDD+ and GG rhetoric include concrete policy objectives; (2) what issues policy actors perceive as challenges for their implementation. A comparative, mixed methods approach was employed to analyze how REDD+ and GG are framed in national policy documents. This analysis was supported by data from interviews with policy actors in both countries in two points of time, 2011/12 and 2015/16. The findings highlight the challenges for implementation of both REDD+ and GG as individual policy programmes, and the dilution of the REDD+ agenda and decision makers' confusion about a GG strategy when these narratives are joined and translated by decision makers. Actors still perceive development and environmental objectives as a zero-sum struggle, favouring a development narrative that might lead to neither REDD+ nor green policy action. We conclude that REDD+ and GG can go hand in hand, if there is action to tackle deforestation and degradation.

TI  - High tree diversity enhances light interception in tropical forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the processes that underlie the effects of tree diversity on primary production is of foremost importance to enhance climate change mitigation by tropical forests. Here, we investigated the effects of tree diversity on light interception over space and time in two tropical tree experiments, located in Panama-Sardinilla site (monocultures to 18-species mixtures), and in Brazil-Anhembi site (20- to 114-species mixtures).We assessed intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (iPAR) over horizontal grids and vertical transects (up to 5 m high in Sardinilla and up to 4 m high in Anhembi), in plots containing different richness levels and combinations of species.Light interception increased from monocultures to 5-species mixtures in Sardinilla and from 20- to 114-species mixtures in Anhembi (during the dry season). At the Sardinilla site, five-species mixtures showed iPAR comparable to the best performing monocultures, despite substantial differences observed among monocultures. Diversity-iPAR relationships changed seasonally and were more pronounced during the dry season. Tree richness promoted a less variable temporal and spatial (i.e. both horizontal and vertical) distribution of light interception.Synthesis. High tree diversity (i.e. over a hundred species in mixture) maximizes the amount of light intercepted by the canopy in restored tropical forests through more even capture in space and time. Diversity-light interception relationships should be critically considered for designing cost-efficient large-scale tropical forest restoration programs.

TI  - Characteristics of fire-generated gas emission observed during a large peatland fire in 2009 at Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To investigate the characteristics of gas emissions from a tropical peatland fire, ground-level measurement of fire-generated gases was conducted during a large fire event in Kalimantan, Indonesia in 2009. Concentrations of CO and CH4 showed positive linear correlations with that of CO2. The relationship between concentrations of N2O and CO2 were divided into two parts, suggesting the influence of additional N2O generation during sample storage. The CO2-normalized emission ratio was calculated for CO, CH4, and N2O. The molar ratio of these fire-generated gas emissions was summarized as CO2:CO:CH4:N2O = 1.00:0.382:0.0261:0.000156, whereas the emission ratio calculated on the global warming potential (GWP) basis was CO2:CH4:N2O = 1.00:0.237:0.0465. The GWP emission based on this ratio was 87.8-91.2% of a simple evaluation in which all carbon was assumed to be emitted as CO2. This is the first trial to evaluate the emission ratios of major greenhouse gases on the basis of ground-level observation during an actual tropical peatland fire. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The large Amazonian peatland carbon sink in the subsiding Pastaza-Maranon foreland basin, Peru
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The carbon (C) dynamics of tropical peatlands can be of global importance, because, particularly in Southeast Asia, they are the source of considerable amounts of C released to the atmosphere as a result of land-use change and fire. In contrast, the existence of tropical peatlands in Amazonia has been documented only recently. According to a recent study, the 120 000 km(2) subsiding Pastaza-Maranon foreland basin in Peruvian Amazonia harbours previously unstudied and up to 7.5 m thick peat deposits. We studied the role of these peat deposits as a C reserve and sink by measuring peat depth, radiocarbon age and peat and C accumulation rates at 513 sites. The basal ages varied from 1975 to 8870 cal yr bp, peat accumulation rates from 0.46 to 9.31 mm yr(-1) and C accumulation rates from 28 to 108 g m(-2) yr(-1). The total peatland area and current peat C stock within the area of two studied satellite images were 21-929 km(2) and 3.116 Gt (with a range of 0.837-9.461 Gt). The C stock is 32% (with a range of 8.7-98%) of the best estimate of the South American tropical peatland C stock and 3.5% (with a range of 0.9-10.7%) of the best estimate of the global tropical peatland C stock. The whole Pastaza-Maranon basin probably supports about twice this peatland area and peat C stock. In addition to their contemporary geographical extent, these peatlands probably also have a large historical (vertical) extension because of their location in a foreland basin characterized by extensive river sedimentation, peat burial and subsidence for most of the Quaternary period. Burial of peat layers in deposits of up to 1 km thick Quaternary river sediments removes C from the short-term C cycle between the biosphere and atmosphere, generating a long-term C sink.

TI  - Global reforestation and biodiversity conservation
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The loss of forest is a leading cause of species extinction, and reforestation is 1 of 2 established interventions for reversing this loss. However, the role of reforestation for biodiversity conservation remains debated, and lacking is an assessment of the potential contribution that reforestation could make to biodiversity conservation globally. We conducted a spatial analysis of overlap between 1,550 forest-obligate threatened species' ranges and land that could be reforested after accounting for socioeconomic and ecological constraints. Reforestation on at least 43% (similar to 369 million ha) of reforestable area was predicted to potentially benefit threatened vertebrates. This is approximately 15% of the total area where threatened vertebrates occur. The greatest opportunities for conserving threatened vertebrate species are in the tropics, particularly Brazil and Indonesia. Although reforestation is not a substitute for forest conservation, and most of the area containing threatened vertebrates remains forested, our results highlight the need for global conservation strategies to recognize the potentially significant contribution that reforestation could make to biodiversity conservation. If implemented, reforestation of similar to 369 million ha would also contribute substantially to climate-change mitigation, offering a way to achieve multiple sustainability commitments at once. Countries must now work to overcome key barriers (e.g., unclear revenue streams, high transaction costs) to investment in reforestation.

TI  - Amazon Fund 10 Years Later: Lessons from the World's Largest REDD plus Program
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Results-Based Funding (RBF) for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) has become an important instrument for channeling financial resources to forest conservation activities. At the same time, much literature on conservation funding is ambiguous about the effectiveness of existing RBF schemes. Many effectiveness evaluations follow a simplified version of the principal-agent model, but in practice, the relation between aid providers and funding recipients is much more complex. As a consequence, intermediary steps of conservation funding are often not accounted for in effectiveness studies. This research paper aims to provide a nuanced understanding of conservation funding by analyzing the allocation of financial resources for one of the largest RBF schemes for REDD+ in the world: the Brazilian Amazon Fund. As part of this analysis, this study has built a dataset of information, with unprecedented detail, on Amazon Fund projects, in order to accurately reconstruct the allocation of financial resources across different stakeholders (i.e., governments, NGOs, research institutions), geographies, and activities. The results show that that the distribution of resources of the Amazon Fund lack a clear strategy that could maximize the results of the fund in terms of deforestation reduction. First, there are evidences that in some cases governmental organizations lack financial additionality for their projects, which renders the growing share of funding to this type of stakeholder particularly worrisome. Second, the Amazon Fund allocations did also not systematically have privileged the municipalities that showed the recent highest deforestation rates. rom the 10 municipalities with the higher deforestation rates in 2017, only 2 are amongst the top 100 receiving per/Ha considering the 775 municipalities from Legal Amazon. Third, the allocation of the financial resources from the Amazon Fund reflects the support of different projects that adopt significantly diverging theories of change, many of which are not primarily concerned with attaining further deforestation reductions. These results reflect the current approach adopted by the Amazon Fund, that do not actively seek areas for intervention, but instead wait for project submissions from proponents. As a consequence, project owners exert much influence on to the type of activities that they support how deforestation reduction is expected to be attained. The article concludes that the Amazon Fund as well as other RBF programs, should evolve over time in order to develop a more targeted funding strategy to maximize the long-term impact in reducing emissions from deforestation.

TI  - Net carbon dioxide exchange in a hyperseasonal cattle pasture in the northern Pantanal wetland of Brazil
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pantanal is the largest seasonal wetland in the world with a landscape that consists of a mosaic of permanent aquatic habitats, and floodable and non-floodable savannas, pastures and forests. Drought events are expected to occur more frequently in the Pantanal biome under future climate conditions, but the effects of land management and hydrological extremes on pastures have been poorly studied at spatial scales relevant to local livestock. In this study, we measured CO2-C fluxes using eddy covariance over a hydrological year on pastures within a cattle farm in the Brazilian Pantanal that experienced seasonal flooding. Our measurements show that seasonally flooded pastures were large emitters of CO2-C, contributing 337 g CO2-C m(-2) year(-1) to the atmosphere. During flooding, when the soils were anaerobic, and soil O-2 was close to zero, the flooded pasture was a net sink of -18 g CO2-C m(-2), while during the aerobic phase (soil O-2 > 15%) the pasture was a significant CO2 source to the atmosphere (301 g CO2-C m(-2)). Transitions to and from anaerobic conditions corresponded to 54 g CO2-C m(-2). Our results indicate that the seasonally flooded cattle pastures in the Brazilian Pantanal may be an important regional source of CO2-C for the atmosphere. Better management, and use of drought resistant grasses, may be a way to improve soil C stocks and limit emissions, especially as global climate change is anticipated to increase heating and drying for the Pantanal biome.

TI  - Tropical peatlands under siege: the need for evidence-based policies and strategies
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is widely known that tropical peatlands, including peat swamp forests (PSFs), provide numerous ecosystem services in both spatial and temporal dimensions. These include their role as large stores for organic carbon, which when not managed well could be released as carbon dioxide and methane, accelerating climate warming. Massive destruction and conversion of peatlands occur at an alarming rate in some regions. We hope that the lessons learned from those regions currently under siege from conversion can inform other regions that are at the precipice of mass conversion to agriculture. Much has been learned about high latitude, northern hemisphere peatlands but less is known about tropical peatlands. We collate, analyze, and synthesize the evidence revealed from the set of articles in this special issue. This special issue is a step forward, presenting new information generated from a considerable amount of field data collected from peatlands across the tropics in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The hard data collected using comparable scientific methodologies are analyzed and compared with existing published data to form a larger dataset as scientific evidence. The synthesis is then interpreted to generate new knowledge to inform the policy community on how to strategize the sustainable management of tropical peatlands. Carbon (C) stocks in tropical peatland ecosystems can be as large as 3000Mg C ha(-1), but the rate of loss is also phenomenal, causing substantial emissions of greenhouse gases of more than 20Mg C ha(-1)year(-1). These losses have mainly taken place in Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, where peatland development for oil palm and pulpwood has accelerated over the past few decades. Although peatlands in the Amazon and Congo Basin are less developed, it is possible that the same unsustainable pathway would be followed in these regions, if lessons from the dire situation in Southeast Asia are not learned. Strong policies to halt further loss of tropical peatlands may be drawn up and combined with incentives that promote a global agenda under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 21st Conference of the Parties, Paris, France, Agreement. However, we also propose a framework to address national and local agendas that can be implemented under the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) by balancing conversion/development and conservation/restoration objectives.

TI  - Science and environmental policy establishment: the case of the Forest Act in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Natural ecosystems are under severe threat worldwide and environmental policies are essential to minimize present and future impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem services and climate change. The New Forest Act in Brazil is the main policy to protect native vegetation in private lands, which comprise 54% of the remaining Brazilian native vegetation. However, conflicts between environmental and agricultural concerns in its implementation demand for balanced solutions based on scientific evidence. To face the challenge of applying science in environmental policy establishment, we developed a scientific project funded by the Sao Paulo State Research Foundation (FAPESP) to support the implementation of the New Forest Act in Sao Paulo State, as part of the Biota/FAPESP Program. The project was conducted differently from a regular research project: the broad objective was to provide scientific support to the State's implementation of the New Forest Act, based on a participatory interaction among stakeholders to build specific objectives, methods, and discussion of results, within an interdisciplinary and intersectoral research team. Here, we present the lessons learned during and after the four years of the research project development to evaluate how scientific knowledge can be produced and adopted in the implementation of a specific environmental policy. We present the main outcomes and the challenges faced in trying to include scientific data in the decision-making process. We also present current and future challenges in the New Forest Act implementation that could be solved with scientific evidence. The lessons learned showed that even designing the project in order to meet the needs to support the implementation of the environmental policy, avoiding difficulties normally pointed out by similar projects, there was a great difficulty for scientific contributions to be adopted in the decision-making process. Most of the scientific information and advice, even after discussion and common understanding among a diverse stakeholder group, were ignored or over-ruled in the final decision-making phases.

TI  - Climatic Benefits From the 2006-2017 Avoided Deforestation in Amazonian Brazil
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over three-fourths of Brazil's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions originate from land-use/cover change (LUCC). Alarming rates of forest loss in the Amazon region gained international attention in the past, but deforestation declined substantially since 2004 (although the rate has trended upwards since 2012). This result conforms to the GHG emission reduction targets set by the National Climate Change Plan, originally divided into three phases: 2006-2009; 2010-2013; and 2014-2017. According to the plan, emission reductions are measured against a deforestation baseline, initially corresponding to the average forest loss observed from 1996 to 2005 (reference period). We used an artificial neural network (ANN) model to spatialize the plan's original three-phase baseline and compare (i) the simulated carbon emissions from the baseline scenario to (ii) the emissions from observed deforestation during 2006-2017. Baseline spatialization was performed at the state level and informed by the 2000-2004 deforestation patterns in each state, resulting in nine state-specific calibrated ANNs. Simulated (baseline) and observed deforestation were compared to five biomass-density maps in order to estimate Brazil's GHG emission reductions. Our results indicate that forest loss during the study period was 62,321 km(2) lower than the baseline and associated with 1.5 +/- 0.4 Pg of avoided CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Virtually all emission reductions (93%) occurred in the states of Mato Grosso (74%) and Rondonia (19%). In contrast, Roraima, Amazonas, and Amapa states increased GHG emissions by 44.8, 36.7, and 14.7 Tg CO2, respectively. Lastly, we discuss the issue of attribution of deforestation reductions for results-based payments (REDD+) and the emission reduction certificates issued by the Amazon Fund.

TI  - Meteorological and biophysical controls of evapotranspiration in tropical grazed pasture under rainfed conditions
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is the main driver of the energy balance partitioning and influences hydrological and carbon cycles at global, regional and local scales. Furthermore, it is the main requirement for developing strategies to improve water use in agriculture. It is known that there is a close relationship between ET and rainfall, especially in tropical environments. Thus, the main goal of this article was to evaluate how ET and its controls (surface conductance - Gs; decoupling coefficient - Omega; Priestley-Taylor parameter - alpha) respond to the seasonal variability of meteorological forcing in tropical grazed pastures under the climatic conditions of Northeast Brazil. ET was measured using an Eddy covariance (EC) system and analyzed based on data from two agricultural years (2015-2016 and 2016-2017) with negative (-59 mm) and positive (356 mm) rainfall anomaly, respectively. ET exhibited pronounced seasonality, closely aligned with the seasonality of rainfall. Lower daily averages were observed during the dry season in both agricultural years (1.01 +/- 0.60 and 0.89 +/- 0.44 mm, respectively). On the other hand, higher daily averages were observed during the rainy season (2.44 +/- 0.75 and 4.83 +/- 0.96 mm, respectively). The Gs patterns and the significant correlation between Gs, Omega, and alpha (p < 0.01) indicate that surface control prevails over atmospheric control on an annual scale. This finding is confirmed by the annual mean values of Omega (0.27, 2015-2016) and alpha (0.38, 2016-2017). This relationship is likely induced by a vegetative stomatal control mechanism, which protects the vegetation against excessive water loss during periods of high temperatures and low humidity levels. These findings are crucial for understanding how droughts modulate components of the energy balance and water fluxes in pastures, especially given the intensification of these events. This has implications for the implementation of climate change mitigation policies and soil management.

TI  - Who Should Benefit from REDD plus ? Rationales and Realities
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Benefit-sharing mechanisms are a central design aspect of REDD+ because they help to create the necessary incentives to reduce carbon emissions. However, if stakeholders do not perceive the benefit sharing as fair, the legitimacy of REDD+, and support for the mechanism, will be weakened. In this paper, drawing on data from CIFOR's Global Comparative Study on REDD+, we analyze national policy processes in 6 countries and incipient benefit-sharing arrangements in 21 REDD+ project sites. Through our analysis of current practices and debates, we identify six rationales that have been put forward to justify how benefits should be distributed and to whom. These rationales encompass a range of perspectives. Some hold that benefit sharing should be related to actual carbon emission reductions or to costs incurred in achieving the reduction of emissions; others emphasize the importance of a legal right to benefit, the need to consider aspects such as poverty reduction or the appropriateness of rewarding those with a history of protecting the forest. Each rationale has implications for the design of benefit-sharing mechanisms and the equity of their outcomes. We point out that, given the wide range of rationales and interests at play, the objectives of REDD+ and benefit sharing must be clearly established and the term "benefit" defined before effective benefit-sharing mechanisms can be designed. For stakeholders to support REDD+, the legitimacy of decision-making institutions, consideration of context, and attention to process are critical. Building legitimacy requires attention not only to fair distributional outcomes but also to consensus on relevant institutions' authority to make decisions and to procedural equity.

AB  - Indonesia is currently one of the regions with the highest transformation rate of land surface worldwide related to the expansion of oil palm plantations and other cash crops replacing forests on large scales. Land cover changes, which modify land surface properties, have a direct effect on the land surface temperature (LST), a key driver for many ecological functions. Despite the large historic land transformation in Indonesia toward oil palm and other cash crops and governmental plans for future expansion, this is the first study so far to quantify the impacts of land transformation on the LST in Indonesia. We analyze LST from the thermal band of a Landsat image and produce a high-resolution surface temperature map (30 m) for the lowlands of the Jambi province in Sumatra (Indonesia), a region which suffered large land transformation towards oil palm and other cash crops over the past decades. The comparison of LST, albedo, normalized differenced vegetation index (NDVI) and evapotranspiration (ET) between seven different land cover types (forest, urban areas, clear-cut land, young and mature oil palm plantations, acacia and rubber plantations) shows that forests have lower surface temperatures than the other land cover types, indicating a local warming effect after forest conversion. LST differences were up to 10.1 +/- 2.6 degrees C (mean +/- SD) between forest and clear-cut land. The differences in surface temperatures are explained by an evaporative cooling effect, which offsets the albedo warming effect.Our analysis of the LST trend of the past 16 years based on MODIS data shows that the average daytime surface temperature in the Jambi province increased by 1.05 degrees C, which followed the trend of observed land cover changes and exceeded the effects of climate warming. This study provides evidence that the expansion of oil palm plantations and other cash crops leads to changes in biophysical variables, warming the land surface and thus enhancing the increase of the air temperature because of climate change.

TI  - 'Seasons of the Anthropocene': Politicization of the haze season in Southeast Asia
T2  - SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past three decades, a new 'haze season' has emerged in the public discourse in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. The semantic construction of 'haze season' signifies societal acknowledgement of recurring and hazardous air pollution episodes caused by the widespread burning of tropical peatlands. This study problematizes the underlying political ecology of the discursive framing of haze as 'seasonal.' Through a comprehensive discourse analysis of news media and government/corporate/NGO documents, this paper identifies and analyses three storylines used by divergent groups of actors seeking to attribute meaning and value to haze: (1) 'it keeps coming back'; (2) 'it will go away'; and (3) 'it is normal'. Political actors draw upon these storylines to meet their distinctive political and ecological objectives. Divergent framing of seasonality by different actors reveals some of the mechanisms influencing haze mitigation and adaptation. Our study highlights the importance of unearthing and interrogating the underlying politics involved in constructing 'seasons of the Anthropocene'. The semantic construction and popularization of 'seasonality' for anthropogenic environmental events can be a double-edged sword, with familiarity enhancing societal preparedness, while normalization can lead to desensitization and inertia towards mitigation. Untangling the divergent pathways of politicizing Anthropocene seasonalities is key to determining whether and how societies can build a 'liveable future'.

TI  - Active restoration leads to rapid recovery of aboveground biomass but limited recovery of fish diversity in planted mangrove forests of the North Brazil Shelf
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal degradation has spurred active restoration of mangrove ecosystems, from local initiatives to global commitments to increase mangrove forest area by 20% over the next decade. Mangrove restoration projects typically have multiple objectives, including carbon storage, coastal resilience, and fisheries recovery. How planting seedlings, the most common form of active restoration, can promote recovery of mangrove ecosystem functions remains an urgent research need. We quantified multiple ecosystem outcomes of Guyana's national mangrove restoration program, approximately a decade after seedling planting, and compared restoration outcomes with conditions in intact and degraded mangrove forests. Multivariate analyses indicate that intact and restored sites' environmental conditions were similar to each other but different from degraded sites. Aboveground biomass in restored sites (103 Mg ha(-1)) was 13 and 99% greater than intact (89.4 Mg ha(-1)) and degraded (0.12 Mg ha(-1)) sites, respectively. Active restoration successfully increased seedling abundance of both planted and unplanted species, with similar abundance between intact and restored sites. In contrast, fish communities in restored sites remained similar to degraded sites. Restored sites were dominated by a single algivorous fish species, with lower species diversity and commercially valuable fisheries than intact sites. Our results demonstrate that active restoration is a viable option to restore mangrove forest tree biomass and tree species composition in this region. However, even under a best-case scenario for mangrove forest restoration, fisheries did not recover during our study's timespan. Long-term monitoring and controlled experiments will be essential to further understand restoration outcomes for multiple ecosystem services in mangrove forests.

TI  - Simultaneous detection of burned areas of multiple fires in the tropics using multisensor remote-sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires associated with recurrent El Nino events have caused severe damage to tropical peat swamp forests. Accurate quantitative information about the frequency and distribution of the burned areas is imperative to fire management but is lacking in the tropics. This article examines a novel method based on principal component analysis (PCA) of the normalized difference water index (NDWI) from multisensor data for simultaneously detecting areas burned due to multiple El Nino-related fires. The principal components of multitemporal NDWI (NDWI-PCs) were able to capture the areas burned in the 1998 and 2003 El Nino fires in NDWI-PC3 and 2, respectively. The proposed method facilitates the reduction of dimensionality in detecting the burned areas. From 22 image bands, the proposed method was able to accurately detect the burned areas of multiple fires with only three NDWI-PCs. The proposed method also shows superior performance to unsupervised classifications of the principal components of combined image bands, multitemporal NDWI, NDWI differencing and post-classification comparison methods. The results show that the 1998 El Nino fire was devastating especially to intact peat swamp forest. For degraded peat swamp forest, there was an increase in the burned area from 1998 to 2003. The proposed method offers the retrieval of accurate and reliable quantitative information on the frequency and spatial distribution of burned areas of multiple fires in the tropics. This method is also applicable to the detection of changes in general as well as the detection of vegetation changes.

TI  - An appraisal of Indonesia's immense peat carbon stock using national peatland maps: uncertainties and potential losses from conversion
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: A large proportion of the world's tropical peatlands occur in Indonesia where rapid conversion and associated losses of carbon, biodiversity and ecosystem services have brought peatland management to the forefront of Indonesia's climate mitigation efforts. We evaluated peat volume from two commonly referenced maps of peat distribution and depth published by Wetlands International (WI) and the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), and used regionally specific values of carbon density to calculate carbon stocks.Results: Peatland extent and volume published in the MoA maps are lower than those in the WI maps, resulting in lower estimates of carbon storage. We estimate Indonesia's total peat carbon store to be within 13.6 GtC (the low MoA map estimate) and 40.5 GtC (the high WI map estimate) with a best estimate of 28.1 GtC: the midpoint of medium carbon stock estimates derived from WI (30.8 GtC) and MoA (25.3 GtC) maps. This estimate is about half of previous assessments which used an assumed average value of peat thickness for all Indonesian peatlands, and revises the current global tropical peat carbon pool to 75 GtC. Yet, these results do not diminish the significance of Indonesia's peatlands, which store an estimated 30% more carbon than the biomass of all Indonesian forests. The largest discrepancy between maps is for the Papua province, which accounts for 62-71% of the overall differences in peat area, volume and carbon storage. According to the MoA map, 80% of Indonesian peatlands are < 300 cm thick and thus vulnerable to conversion outside of protected areas according to environmental regulations. The carbon contained in these shallower peatlands is conservatively estimated to be 10.6 GtC, equivalent to 42% of Indonesia's total peat carbon and about 12 years of global emissions from land use change at current rates.Conclusions: Considering the high uncertainties in peatland extent, volume and carbon storage revealed in this assessment of current maps, a systematic revision of Indonesia's peat maps to produce a single geospatial reference that is universally accepted would improve national peat carbon storage estimates and greatly benefit carbon cycle research, land use management and spatial planning.

TI  - Environmental performance of agroforestry systems in the Cerrado biome, Brazil
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture and land use practices must be significantly improved to satisfy the needs of future generations without placing further pressure on global ecosystems. Agroforestry systems (AFS) have been quoted as one of the best options to mitigate environmental impacts and at the same time, improve smallholders' livelihoods in agricultural areas. However, studies investigating the environmental aspects and yield of agroforestry systems in rural settlements, established by governmental initiatives, are still uncommon in the literature. Therefore, the goal of this paper was to assess the contribution of five bio-diverse AFS, located in the Cerrado biome, to global warming mitigation and the provision of ecosystem services to smallholder farmers. Additionally, the importance of agroforestry projects to family farms in Brazil was discussed. Relying on data from forestry inventory and in-depth interviews with farmers, the crop yield (including fruit) was estimated; and the life cycle assessment method was used to determine the Global Warming Potential (GWP), accounting for all emissions to establish and manage the AFS up until the date of analysis. The results show the significant capacity of AFS sequester carbon, represented by the negative values of GWP, ranging from (-263) to (-496) t CO2 equivalents per hectare. Each farmer adopted different tree and crop species at the AFS establishment what influenced yields and GWP. The high number of fruit trees contributed positively to the AFS outputs, allowing farmers to consume and sell a large variety of products. Furthermore, the households also benefit from microclimate and aesthetic benefits provided by the AFS5. Future agroforestry projects in rural settlements can contribute significantly to improve household livelihoods, as well as environmental protection. However, efforts should be taken to provide farmers with sound knowledge, financial support, and access to markets to thrive. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Linking above and belowground carbon sequestration, soil organic matter properties, and soil health in Brazilian Atlantic Forest restoration
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest restoration mitigates climate change by removing CO2 and storing C in terrestrial ecosystems. However, incomplete information on C storage in restored tropical forests often fails to capture the ecosystem's holistic C dynamics. This study provides an integrated assessment of C storage in above to belowground subsystems, its consequences for greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes, and the quantity, quality, and origin of soil organic matter (SOM) in restored Atlantic forests in Brazil. Relations between SOM properties and soil health indicators were also explored. We examined two restorations using tree planting ('active restoration'): an 8-year-old forest with green manure and native trees planted in two rounds, and a 15-year-old forest with native-planted trees in one round without green manure. Restorations were compared to reformed pasture and primary forest sites. We measured C storage in soil layers (0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm), litter, and plants. GHG emissions were assessed using CH4 and CO2 fluxes. SOM quantity was evaluated using C and N, quality using humification index (HLIFS), and origin using & delta;13C and & delta;15N. Nine soil health indicators were interrelated with SOM attributes. The primary forest presented the highest C stocks (107.7 Mg C ha-1), followed by 15- and 8-year-old restorations and pasture with 69.8, 55.5, and 41.8 Mg C ha-1, respectively. Soil C stocks from restorations and pasture were 20% lower than primary forest. However, 8- and 15-year-old restorations stored 12.3 and 28.3 Mg ha-1 more aboveground C than pasture. The younger forest had & delta;13C and & delta;15N values of 2.1 and 1.7 & PTSTHOUSND;, respectively, lower than the 15-year-old forest, indicating more C derived from C3 plants and biological N fixation. Both restorations and pasture had at least 34% higher HLIFS in deeper soil layers (10-30 cm) than primary forest, indicating a lack of labile SOM. Native and 15-year-old forests exhibited higher soil methane influx (141.1 and 61.9 & mu;g m-2 h-1). Forests outperformed pasture in most soil health indicators, with 69% of their variance explained by SOM properties. However, SOM quantity and quality regeneration in both restorations approached the pristine forest state only in the top 10 cm layer, while deeper soil retained agricultural degradation legacies. In conclusion, active restoration of the Atlantic Forest is a superior approach compared to pasture reform for GHG mitigation. Nonetheless, the development of restoration techniques to facilitate labile C input into deeper soil layers (>10 cm) is needed to further improve soil multifunctionality and long-term C storage.

TI  - Temporal and phenological profiles of open and dense Caatinga using remote sensing: response to precipitation and its irregularities
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Caatinga is a typical biome of Brazil's semiarid regions and subject to climate changes. Research is needed on the relation of its features to climate events. This study analyzed the influence of rainfall and its irregularities in open and dense woody Caatinga vegetation. Phenological curves were generated by means of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time profiles in the Grota do Angico Conservation Unit study area in Sergipe State. Rainfall data from 2000 to 2018 were collected and phenological curves generated using various estimate methods that produced the following variables: [start of season, end of season, peak of season position, length of season, mean growing season and maximum seasonal]. Rainfall showed a standard intra-annual behavior, with inter-annual variations related to irregularities influencing Caatinga response. Dense Caatinga vegetation had higher values of NDVI in all periods, even in anomalous years compared to open Caatinga, in addition to having longer leaf coverage over the year, with an anticipated start and a more extended seasonal end. The analysis of the rainfall regime made it possible to assess its influence on the Caatinga and phenological profiles proved to be fundamental to understand periods of physiological change of open and dense Caatinga. These results indicate that dense Caatinga maintains physiological activity longer, which may be associated with greater moisture maintenance in a semiarid region. In addition, because it has a greater leaf cover for longer periods, the soil may be preserved and maintain its characteristics longer, reducing the effects of desertification. The results may be associated with the type of forest management and conservation in this region. The total or partial suppression of individual remnants of Caatinga should be avoided, since the most open areas have lower photosynthetic capacity, affected to a considerable extent from the effects of adverse climatic conditions. Additionally, open Caatinga has a reduced capacity for regenerating naturally and its use by communities in this semiarid region should be limited.

TI  - Spatial variation of soil carbon stability in sugarcane crops, central-south of Brazil
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The decay constant (k) of soil organic carbon can be used in the decision making of soil management practices and it is an indicative of the spatial variability of soil carbon stability, which depends on the interactions of physical, chemical and biological factors within agroecossystem. The aim of this work was to determine the spatial variability structure of soil carbon losses, expressed by the factor k, and its relationship with the soil attributes in sugarcane crops, in the central-south region of Brazil. The experiments were carried out in areas of commercial sugarcane plantations, in the cities of Motuca (MOT), Guariba (GUA) and Pradopolis - SP (PAD), in the State of Sao Paulo, and Aparecida do Taboado (APT), in Mato Grosso do Sul. The measurements of soil CO2 emission (FCO2) were recorded in the areas of study by the LI-COR system (LI-8100). The multivariate approach indicated that the two principal components (PC1 and PC2) explained around 55% to 68% of the total variability contained in the dataset in the areas studied, respectively. The soil physical attributes showed discriminatory power within PC1 and indicated a contrast between air-filled pore space and soil water content. In PC2, the chemical attributes indicated a joint action of the cations exchange capacity and available phosphorous content. PAD and APT areas presented negative and significant spatial patterns between factor k and PC1. For the spatial patterns between k and PC2 in GUA and APT, values with negative and significant correlations occurred. The results indicate that the soil carbon accumulation potential presented high spatial variability on a small scale; thus, in the same area, there were changes in the spatial patterns of factor k, presenting regions with potential accumulations or sources of carbon in the system of cultivation of raw cane, being able to be carried out the specific management in the same productive area.

TI  - Sources of anthropogenic fire ignitions on the peat-swamp landscape in Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire disturbance in many tropical forests, including peat swamps, has become more frequent and extensive in recent decades. These fires compromise a variety of ecosystem services, among which mitigating global climate change through carbon storage is particularly important for peat swamps. Indonesia holds the largest amount of tropical peat carbon globally, and mean annual CO2 emissions from decomposition of deforested and drained peatlands and associated fires in Southeast Asia have been estimated at, similar to 2000 Mt y-1. A key component to understanding and therefore managing fire in the region is identifying the land use/land cover classes associated with fire ignitions. We assess the oft-asserted claim that escaped fires from oil palm concessions and smallholder farms near settlements are the primary sources of fire in a peat-swamp forest area in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, equivalent to around a third of Kalimantan's total peat area. We use the MODIS Active Fire product from 2000 to 2010 to evaluate the fire origin and spread on the land use/land cover classes of legal, industrial oil palm concessions (the only type of legal concession in the study area), non-forest, and forest, as well as in relation to settlement proximity. We find that most fires (68-71%) originate in non-forest, compared to oil palm concessions (17%-19%), and relatively few (6-9%) are within 5 km of settlements. Moreover, most fires started within oil palm concessions and in close proximity to settlements stay within those boundaries (90% and 88%, respectively), and fires that do escape constitute only a small proportion of all fires on the landscape (2% and 1%, respectively). Similarly, a small proportion of fire detections in forest originate from oil palm concessions (2%) and within close proximity to settlements (2%). However, fire ignition density in oil palm (0.055 ignitions km(-2)) is comparable to that in non-forest (0.060 km-2 ignitions km(-2)), which is approximately ten times that in forest (0.006 ignitions km(-2)). Ignition density within 5 km of settlements is the highest at 0.125 ignitions km(-2). Furthermore, increased anthropogenic activity in close proximity to oil palm concessions and settlements produces a detectable pattern of fire activity. The number of ignitions decreases exponentially with distance from concessions; the number of ignitions initially increases with distance from settlements, and, around from 7.2 km, then decreases with distance from settlements. These results refute the claim that most fires originate in oil palm concessions, and that fires escaping from oil palm concessions and settlements constitute a major proportion of fires in this study region. However, there is a potential for these land use types to contribute substantially to the fire landscape if their area expands. Effective fire management in this area should therefore target not just oil palm concessions, but also non-forested, degraded areas where ignitions and fires escaping into forest are most likely to occur.

TI  - Slope position controls prescribed fire effects on soil: a case study in the high-elevation grassland of Itatiaia National Park
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a need for greater knowledge about the medium-and long-term effects of prescribed fire management on soil in ecosystems prone to wildfires and more vulnerable to climate change. This study examined the short-and medium-term effects of prescribed fire on soil chemical properties and chemical fractions of soil organic matter (SOM) in two positions of the landscape in a high-elevation grassland environment. The ecosystem is located in the mountain peaks of southeastern Brazil associated with the Atlantic Forest biome. Prescribed fire was conducted in 2017 to reduce understory vegetation and thus prevent potential severe wildfires. Soil samples were collected at the layers of 0.00-0.10, 0.10-0.20, and 0.20-0.40 m, at eight composite sampling. The composite samples were collected on five different occasions: before the prescribed fire, and 10, 30, 90, and 240 days after the prescribed fire. Soil chemical properties, total organic carbon, labile C, and chemical fractionation of SOM were analyzed. All soil properties investigated were affected by the prescribed fire, with variations in landscape position, duration of effect, and soil layer. In the backslope area, the medium-term effect of fire was negative and induced soil degradation and induced soil degradation. In the footslope area, the system showed greater resilience to the effects of fire, as indicated by the recovery of the soil's chemical properties. These results can help assess the suitability of controlled burning of vegetation for managing risks of fire in mountainous regions, such as high-elevation grasslands.

TI  - Bayesian state-space synthetic control method for deforestation baseline estimation for forest carbon credits
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL DATA SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon credits from the reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD+) projects have been criticized for issuing junk carbon credits due to invalid ex-ante baselines. Recently, the concept of ex-post baseline has been discussed to overcome the criticism, while ex-ante baseline is still necessary for project financing and risk assessment. To address this issue, we propose a Bayesian state-space model that integrates ex-ante baseline projection and ex-post dynamic baseline updating in a unified manner. Our approach provides a tool for appropriate risk assessment and performance evaluation of REDD+ projects. We apply the proposed model to a REDD+ project in Brazil and show that it may have had a small, positive effect but has been overcredited. We also demonstrate that the 90% predictive interval of the ex-ante baseline includes the ex-post baseline, implying that our ex-ante estimation can work effectively.Impact StatementOur novel approach estimates deforestation baselines for forest carbon credits, addressing criticisms of junk carbon credit issued from REDD+ projects and problems of early financing simultaneously. By integrating ex-ante baseline projection and ex-post dynamic updating, we evaluate ex-ante risks and ex-post project performance in a unified manner. Our approach can contribute to sound allocation of funds for forest conservation projects with significant positive impacts on climate change action.

TI  - Reducing deforestation and forest degradation in Democratic Republic of Congo: market-based conservation in a context of limited statehood
T2  - REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) is an international mechanism linked to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. It has been described in the field of political ecology as the panacea of neoliberal nature conservation policies, in particular though the decreasing role of the state in the definition and implementation of forest policies in favour of market-based-mechanisms and non-governmental actors. The article explores the links between the privatisation of forest conservation and national sovereignty in the context of limited statehood through a case study in the Mai Ndombe province of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It proposes an original approach combining African political anthropology with Franz Neumann's political economy analyses of the power of authoritarian states. It argues that this model of forest conservation uses carbon accounting and results-based payment, which privileges private actors for the design and implementation of REDD+ activities; it also paradoxically strengthens Congelese state legitimacy.

TI  - Soil greenhouse gas fluxes partially reduce the net gains in carbon sequestration in mangroves of the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - There is interest in assessing the potential climate mitigation benefit of coastal wetlands based on the balance between their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and carbon sequestration. Here we investigated soil GHG fluxes (CO2 2 and CH4) 4 ) on mangroves of the Brazilian Amazon coast, and across common land use impacts including shrimp farms and a pasture. We found greater methane fluxes near the Amazon River mouth (1439 to 3312 mu g C m- 2 h-1),-1 ), which on average are equivalent to 37% of mangrove C sequestration in the region. Soil CO2 2 fluxes were predominant in mangrove forests to the East of the Amazon Delta. Land use change shifted mangroves from C sinks (mean sequestration of 12.2 +/- 1.4 Mg CO2e 2 e ha- 1 yr-1)- 1) to net GHG sources (mean loss of 8.0 +/- 3.3 Mg CO2e 2 e ha- 1 yr-- 1 ). Our data suggests that mangrove forests in the Amazon can aid decreasing the net annual emissions in the Brazilian forest sector in 9.7 +/- 0.8 Tg CO2e 2 e yr-- 1 through forest conservation and avoided deforestation.

TI  - Climate mitigation by dairy intensification depends on intensive use of spared grassland
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Milk and beef production cause 9% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Previous life cycle assessment (LCA) studies have shown that dairy intensification reduces the carbon footprint of milk by increasing animal productivity and feed conversion efficiency. None of these studies simultaneously evaluated indirect GHG effects incurred via teleconnections with expansion of feed crop production and replacement suckler-beef production. We applied consequential LCA to incorporate these effects into GHG mitigation calculations for intensification scenarios among grazing-based dairy farms in an industrialized country (UK), in which milk production shifts from average to intensive farm typologies, involving higher milk yields per cow and more maize and concentrate feed in cattle diets. Attributional LCA indicated a reduction of up to 0.10 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) milk following intensification, reflecting improved feed conversion efficiency. However, consequential LCA indicated that land use change associated with increased demand for maize and concentrate feed, plus additional suckler-beef production to replace reduced dairy-beef output, significantly increased GHG emissions following intensification. International displacement of replacement suckler-beef production to the "global beef frontier" in Brazil resulted in small GHG savings for the UK GHG inventory, but contributed to a net increase in international GHG emissions equivalent to 0.63 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) milk. Use of spared dairy grassland for intensive beef production can lead to net GHG mitigation by replacing extensive beef production, enabling afforestation on larger areas of lower quality grassland, or by avoiding expansion of international (Brazilian) beef production. We recommend that LCA boundaries are expanded when evaluating livestock intensification pathways, to avoid potentially misleading conclusions being drawn from "snapshot" carbon footprints. We conclude that dairy intensification in industrialized countries can lead to significant international carbon leakage, and only achieves GHG mitigation when spared dairy grassland is used to intensify beef production, freeing up larger areas for afforestation.

TI  - Resilience to fire and climate seasonality drive the temporal dynamics of ant-plant interactions in a fire-prone ecosystem
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Animal-plant interactions have a major influence on ecosystem structure and functioning. Understanding to what extent the temporal dynamics of interactions is determined by climate and disturbances is thus relevant to predict ecological and evolutionary outcomes in a changing world. Here, we assessed whether the temporal dynamics of ant-plant interactions in a mountainous fire-prone ecosystem is driven by seasonal variation in abiotic conditions, and to what extent fire disturbance alters this dynamic. We also examined the thermal responses of foliage-dwelling ants in order to predict the effects of seasonal oscillations of temperature on ant activity. To do so, we monitored ant-plant associations in 35 sampling plots for one year before an unmanaged fire has occurred. Then, 26 burned and nine unburned plots were monitored for another year after fire. We found that warmer and wetter conditions let to increases in the diversity and frequency of ant-plant interactions, mainly via upturns in plant resource availability and ant foraging activity. Beyond the positive effects of temperature on interaction networks, however, ant species exhibited a low heterogeneity and a huge overlap in thermal niches. Moreover, fire has led to short-term negative effects on the diversity and frequency of interactions in ant-plant networks. In spite of it, these network metrics in burned plots took up to half a year to return to similar levels from unburned plots, highlighting the resilience of ant-plant interactions after fire disturbances. This study shows that wide thermal niches of ant species and fire resilience likely beget ant-plant networks reliability over seasons. The high overlap and broad thermal niches of ant species interacting with plant resources suggest that ant diversity plays a minor role in the tolerance against climatic changes in this fire-adapted community. These findings open a new pathway to explore thermal responses of species and their ecological interactions in broader gradients of environmental conditions and ecosystem disturbances. We advocate that long-term studies comprising assisted burnings are desirable to forecast the impact of fire regimes and how their synergy with climate would affect the functioning of fire-prone ecosystems. Lastly, this study adds evidence that studied interaction networks can be useful to monitor the impacts of environmental changes such as anthropogenic disturbances, being representative of many even more complex species interactions in ecosystems.

TI  - Record-breaking wildfires in the world's largest continuous tropical wetland: Integrative fire management is urgently needed for both biodiversity and humans
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Brazilian Pantanal, wildfire occurrence has increased, reaching record highs of over 40,000 km2 in 2020. Smoke from wildfires worsened the situation of isolated, as well as urban communities, already under an increasing toll of COVID-19. Here we review the impacts and the possible causes of the 2020 mega-fires and recommend improvements for public policies and fire management in this wetland. We calculated the amount of area burnt annually since 2003 and describe patterns in precipitation and water level measurements of the Paraguay River. Our analyses revealed that the 2020 wildfires were historically unprecedented, as 43% of the area (over 17,200 km2) had not been burnt previously in the last two decades. The extent of area affected in 2020 represents a 376% increase compared to the annual average of the area burnt annually in the last two decades, double than the value in 2019. Potential factors responsible for this increase are (i) severe drought decreased water levels, (ii) the fire corridor was located in the Paraguay River flood zone, (iii) constraints on firefighters, (iv) insufficient fire prevention strategy and agency budget reductions, and (v) recent landscape changes. Climate and land use change will further increase the frequency of these extreme events. To make fire management more efficient and cost-effective, we recommend the implementation of an Integrated Fire Management program in the Pantanal. Stakeholders should use existing traditional, local ecological, and scientific knowledge to form a collective strategy with clear, achievable, measurable goals, considering the socio-ecological context. Permanent fire brigades, including indigenous members, should conduct year-round fire management. Communities should cooperate to create a collaborative network for wildfire prevention, the location and characteristics (including flammability) of infrastructures should be (re)planned in fire-prone environments considering and managing fire-catalysed transitions, and depending on the severity of wildfires. The 2020 wildfires were tackled in an ad-hoc fashion and prioritisation of areas for urgent financial investment, management, protection, and restoration is necessary to prevent this catastrophe from happening again.

TI  - Tropical Peatland Burn Depth and Combustion Heterogeneity Assessed Using UAV Photogrammetry and Airborne LiDAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We provide the first assessment of tropical peatland depth of burn (DoB) using structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry, applied to imagery collected using a low-cost, low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system operated over a 5.2 ha tropical peatland in Jambi Province on Sumatra, Indonesia. Tropical peat soils are the result of thousands of years of dead biomass accumulation, and when burned are globally significant net sources of carbon emissions. The El Nino year of 2015 saw huge areas of Indonesia affected by tropical peatland fires, more so than any year since 1997. However, the Depth of Burn (DoB) of these 2015 fires has not been assessed, and indeed has only previously been assessed in few tropical peatland burns in Kalimantan. Therefore, DoB remains arguably the largest uncertainty when undertaking fire emissions calculations in these tropical peatland environments. We apply a SfM photogrammetric methodology to map this DoB metric, and also investigate combustion heterogeneity using orthomosaic photography collected using the UAV system. We supplement this information with pre-burn airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, reducing uncertainty by estimating pre-burn soil height more accurately than from interpolation of adjacent unburned areas alone. Our pre-and post-fire Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) show accuracies of 0.04 and 0.05 m (root-mean-square error, RMSE) respectively, compared to ground-based global navigation satellite system (GNSS) surveys. Our final DoB map of a 5.2 ha degraded peat swamp forest area neighboring Berbak National Park (Sumatra, Indonesia) shows burn depths extending from close to zero to over 1 m, with a mean (+/- 1 sigma) DoB of 0.23 +/- 0.19 m. This lies well within the range found by the few other studies available (on Kalimantan; none are available on Sumatra). Our combustion heterogeneity analysis suggests the deepest burns, which extend to similar to 1.3 m, occur around tree roots. We use these DoB data within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default equation for fire emissions to estimate mean carbon emissions as 134 +/- 29 tC.ha(-1) for this peatland fire, which is in an area that had not had a recorded fire previously. This is amongst the highest per unit area fuel consumption anywhere in the world for landscape fires. Our approach provides significant uncertainty reductions in such emissions calculations via the reduction in DoB uncertainty, and by using the UAV SfM approach this is accomplished at a fraction of the cost of airborne LiDARalbeit over limited sized areas at present. Deploying this approach at locations across Indonesia, sampling a variety of fire-affected landscapes, would provide new and important DoB statistics for producing optimized carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions estimates from peatland fires.

TI  - Dynamics of Land use and Land cover in the Belitung Island, Indonesia
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Belitung Island, situated in the Southeast Asian tin belt, experiences substantial transformations in land use and land cover (LULC) driven by mining activities, impacting both local economic growth and the ecosystem. This study aims to elucidate the dynamic LULC changes on Belitung Island and evaluate deforestation trends. LULC data spanning from 1990 to 2020 were acquired from The Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry (KLHK), employing supervised classification of satellite imageries. The dataset demonstrated an overall accuracy ranging from 0.79 to 0.92 and was reclassified into six types based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or IPCC's classes, encompassing forest, cropland, grassland, other land, settlements, and wetlands. Our research unveiled a notable reduction of over 25 % in forest cover within the past 30 years. Notably, 2020 exhibited instances of reforestation, which subsequently transformed into cropland (0.57 %), grassland (0.32 %), and other lands (0.39 %). Belitung Island grapples with challenges related to sustainable development, environmental conservation, and food security. Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) emerges as a potential strategy to address some of the socioeconomic and ecological issues.

AB  - Biomass burning, in a broad sense, encompasses different burning practices, including open and confined burnings, and different types of vegetation. Emission factors of gaseous or particulate trace compounds are directly dependent both on the fuel type and the combustion process. Emission factors are generally calculated by stoichiometric considerations using the carbon mass balance method, applied either to combustion chamber experiments or to field experiments based on ground-level measurements or aircraft sampling in smoke plumes. There have been a number of experimental studies in the last 10 years to investigate wildfires in tropical, temperate, or boreal regions. This article presents an overview of measurement methods and experimental data on emission factors of reactive or radiatively active trace compounds, including trace gases and particles. It focuses on fires in tropical regions, that is, forest and savanna fires, agricultural bums, charcoal production, use of fuelwood, and charcoal combustion.

TI  - Strategic Analysis of the Forest Carbon Market in Brazil
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The forest carbon market in Brazil presents a complex scenario filled with challenges and opportunities. This study employed SWOT analysis to evaluate the dynamics of this market, based on the perceptions of 77 specialists from various professional fields. The analysis revealed that extensive forest cover and biodiversity preservation are significant strengths that position Brazil as a potential leader in the global carbon credit market. However, weaknesses such as illegal deforestation and fragile public policies undermine the effectiveness of conservation efforts. Opportunities include the growing international demand for carbon credits and the recognition of the importance of local communities in forest conservation. Nevertheless, external threats like land conflicts and political instability pose considerable risks. The study concludes that it is crucial to strengthen public policies and regulatory frameworks, promote technological innovation, and ensure the active inclusion of local and indigenous communities to guarantee the sustainability and growth of Brazil's forest carbon market. The research suggests that despite significant challenges, Brazil can overcome these obstacles with the implementation of effective strategies.

TI  - Short-term CO2-C emissions from soil prior to sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) replanting in southern Brazil
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - New management strategies should be identified to increase the potential of bioenergy crops to minimize climate change. This study quantified the impact of sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) harvest systems, straw and soil management on carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes prior to crop replanting carried out on February 2010 in southern Brazil. The soil studied was classified as Haplustult (USDA Soil Taxonomy). Three sugarcane harvest systems were considered: burned (BH) and green harvest with straw maintained on (GH SM) or removed from (GH SR) the soil surface. Our hypothesis is that intensive tillage and the management of sugarcane crop straw could lead to higher CO2 emissions from soil. We measured CO2 emissions in no-till (NT) conditions and after conventional tillage (CT), and with or without dolomite and agricultural gypsum applications. Soil CO2 emissions were measured with a Li Cor chamber (Model Li-8100). Water content of soil and soil temperature readings were first taken 24 h after tillage, over the next 25 days after tillage with 18 measurement days. The removal of sugarcane straw from the soil surface resulted in the rapid reduction of water content of soil (6% in volume) followed by a 64% increase in soil CO2-C emissions, supporting our hypothesis. Additional soil CO2-C emissions caused by removal of crop straw were 253 kg CO2-C ha(-1), which is as high as CO2-C losses induced by tillage. Dolomite and agricultural gypsum applications did not always increase CO2 emissions, especially when applied on soil surface with crop straw and tilled. The conversion from burned to green harvest systems can improve the soil C sequestration rate in sugarcane crops when combined with reduced tillage and straw maintenance on soil surface. The effect of straw removal and related CO2 emission for electricity generation should be considered in further studies from sugarcane areas.

TI  - Constructing soils for climate-smart mining
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface mining is inherently linked to climate change, but more precise monitoring of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is necessary. Here we combined the geolocation of mine sites and carbon stock datasets to show that if all legal active mining sites in Brazil are exploited over the next decades, 2.55 Gt of CO2 equivalent (CO(2)eq) will be emitted due to the loss of vegetation (0.87 Gt CO(2)eq) and soil (1.68 Gt CO(2)eq). To offset these emissions, we propose constructing soils (Technosols) from mine and other wastes for mine reclamation. We show that this strategy could potentially offset up to 60% (1.00 Gt CO(2)eq) of soil-related CO2 emissions. When constructed with suitable parent materials, Technosols can also restore important soil-related ecosystem services while improving waste management. The construction of healthy Technosols stands out as a promising nature-based solution towards carbon-neutral mining and should, therefore, be considered in future environmental policies of major mining countries.Soils constructed from mine waste can help mitigate future mining-related carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 1 Gt CO(2)eq in Brazil through supporting ecosystem carbon stock recovery, suggest estimates derived from geospatial analysis of legal mining activity and soil carbon in Brazil.

T2  - CLIMATE CHANGE EFFECTS ON GROUNDWATER RESOURCES: A GLOBAL SYNTHESIS OF FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The Pipiripau river basin, a 235 km(2) catchment in central Brazil, has experienced a substantial increase in land use intensity (mostly agriculture and pastureland) in the last 40 years. This has contributed to a significant decrease in the base flow discharge, responsible for the maintenance of the stream flow during the dry winter season. To assess the hydrological and economic benefits of three land conservation programs in the basin, an empirical relationship was obtained between the base flow index and the normalized basin curve-number, calibrated with observed stream flow and precipitation data. The results indicate that if reforestation and best management practices are implemented in the basin, up to 755 x 106 m(3)/a of additional base flow discharge would result during the dry season, with additional revenues up to US$ 1.03 million per year for the water utility company. The simplicity of the presented methodology allows for its application in other data-scarce tropical basins.

T2  - FOREST AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the growing interest in social forestry (SF), how much do we understand the social, economic and environmental outcomes and the conditions that enable SF to perform? In this article, we use a content analysis of literature on existing traditional SF practiced throughout Indonesia. It examines the outcomes of these systems and the conditions that enabled or hindered these outcomes to understand possible causal relations and changing dynamics between these conditions and SF performance. We discuss the gaps in how SF is assessed and understood in the literature to understand the important aspects of traditional SF that are not captured or that are lost when the diverse traditional systems are converted into other land uses. It aims to understand the potential trade-offs in the State's push for formalizing SF if these aspects continue to be ignored.

TI  - The southern Brazilian grassland biome: soil carbon stocks, fluxes of greenhouse gases and some options for mitigation
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The southern Brazilian grassland biome contains highly diverse natural ecosystems that have been used for centuries for grazing livestock and that also provide other important environmental services. Here we outline the main factors controlling ecosystem processes, review and discuss the available data on soil carbon stocks and greenhouse gases emissions from soils, and suggest opportunities for mitigation of climatic change. The research on carbon and greenhouse gases emissions in these ecosystems is recent and the results are still fragmented. The available data indicate that the southern Brazilian natural grassland ecosystems under adequate management contain important stocks of organic carbon in the soil, and therefore their conservation is relevant for the mitigation of climate change. Furthermore, these ecosystems show a great and rapid loss of soil organic carbon when converted to crops based on conventional tillage practices. However, in the already converted areas there is potential to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by using cropping systems based on no soil tillage and cover-crops, and the effect is mainly related to the potential of these crop systems to accumulate soil organic carbon in the soil at rates that surpass the increased soil nitrous oxide emissions. Further modelling with these results associated with geographic information systems could generate regional estimates of carbon balance.

TI  - Unveiling economic dimensions of peatland restoration in Indonesia: A systematic literature review
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
M3  - Review
AB  - Indonesian peatlands play a critical role in global carbon storage and biodiversity conservation, but they face significant ongoing threat of degradation and loss due to human-induced pressures, including the development of industrial plantations, agricultural expansion, extractive forestry practices, and recurrent fires. The imperative to restore these peatlands is significant, but the restoration effort has, so far, been underwhelming. This paper systematically reviews studies that have assessed the economic costs and benefits of peatland restoration in Indonesia. It summarizes the substantial economic stakes involved in peatland restoration efforts, ranging from millions to billions of dollars. The collective findings emphasize the significant costs required for restoration, alongside the potential economic benefits derived from environmental conservation, climate change mitigation, and sustainable land management. These economic valuations are complemented by a holistic consideration of ecological, social, and cultural factors, providing valuable insights for policymakers and decision-makers. However, while these studies have offered valuable insights into various aspects such as local preferences, willingness to pay, financial costs, and potential economic benefits, none have comprehensively explored the potential trade-offs or forgone opportunities resulting from the proposed restoration programs. This is a critical gap in current research and practice. We illustrate the need for more systemic learning about how peatlands are valued to advance a transition towards healthier peatlands in Indonesia.

TI  - Coupled Ground- and Space-Based Assessment of Regional Inundation Dynamics to Assess Impact of Local and Upstream Changes on Evaporation in Tropical Wetlands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Modifications of human land use and climate change are known to be a threat for the health and proper functioning of tropical wetlands. They interfere with the seasonal flood pulse, which is seen as the most important driver for biodiversity and directly controls evaporation. In order to investigate the impact of local and upstream changes on wetlands, a regional assessment of evaporation is crucial but challenging in such often remote and poorly gauged ecosystems. Evaporation is the major water balance component of these wetlands and links the flood pulse with the ecosystem. It can therefore be seen as a proxy for their functioning. In the last decades, information from space became an important data source to assess remote wetland areas. Here, we developed a new approach to quantify regional evaporation driven by inundation dynamics as its dominant control. We used three water and vegetation indices (mNDWI (modified Normalized Difference Water Index), NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index)) from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) surface reflectance products to assess regional inundation dynamics between the dry and wet seasons. Two years of continual in situ water level measurements at different locations in our study area, the Pantanal wetland of South America, provided the reference to evaluate our method. With process-based modeling that used the inundation dynamics to determine the water available for evaporation, we were able to estimate actual evaporation (AET) on a regional scale. Relating AET to changes in discharge due to upstream flow modifications and on local precipitation over the last 13 years, we found that the Pantanal is more vulnerable to alternated inundation dynamics than to changes in local precipitation. We concluded that coupling ground- and space-based information in this remote wetland area is a valuable first step to investigate the status of the Pantanal ecosystem.

TI  - Estimating Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Peat Combustion in Wildfires on Indonesian Peatlands, and Their Uncertainty
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands play an important role as carbon pools, storing a third of the world's soil carbon. However, peatlands in Southeast Asia have suffered from depletion due to economic pressure and the demand for natural resources, often caused by land use changes and fires. Usually, land preparation requires drainage and fires, resulting in major greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions into the atmosphere. In this work, we propose a general equation to estimate GHG emissions from fires on peatlands. The contribution of each parameter to the variance of the estimated GHG emissions was also evaluated. We used Monte Carlo simulation, meta-analyses, and an analytical expression of variance. GHG emissions of a single fire episode were estimated at 842 Mg ha(-1) CO2 eq. with a standard deviation of 466 Mg ha(-1) CO2 eq. The parameter contributing most to variance was the depth of burn, at 94.2%, followed by bulk density, at 5.5%, and emission factors, at 0.3%. Our estimated GHG emissions were close to the amount estimated from the default values provided by the IPCC, strengthening confidence in the IPCC methodology. When the depth of burn was assessed by remote sensing, the parameter that most contributed to variance became the fire-damaged area, followed by the depth of burn. The contribution of each parameter to variance, as estimated in this study, made it possible to prioritize the effort in uncertainty reduction. Combining Monte Carlo simulation and an analytical expression of variance could be a promising way of obtaining more reliable confidence intervals.

T2  - Agronomy Research
M3  - Article
AB  - Food Estate is a government program as a solution to meeting food demand. However, in order to meet food needs, environmental impacts must be considered. The study objective was to investigate the impacts of shallot production in Food Estate Hutajulu, Indonesia. The study was conducted with the first stage determining the functional unit, namely an area of 0.2 hectares with a gate-to-gate scope. The second is the inventory data analysis by grouping the categories of nursery, tillage, maintenance, harvesting, and transportation. The third is life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) according to the ISO 14044 standard. Every data obtained from each process was processed using the software OpenLCA 1.11.0; the following is the workflow and use of the software. Processes were made based on the five categories of data (soil processing, planting, maintenance, harvesting and transportation), which had been determined to be connected to flow. The product system was adjusted according to the data in each process and then calculated, and the results of calculation data and graph models appear from each processed data category. Fourth is the interpretation that considers the highest environmental impact, namely acidification in the transportation process of 1.8974 kg SO2 eq, global warming potential in the transportation process of 415.3188 kg CO2 eq, eutrophication in the transportation process of 0.4364 kg PO4 eq, and human toxicity in the maintenance process of 1,409.07377 kg 1,4-DB eq. To minimize the impact on subsequent production, reducing diesel fuel, chemical pesticides and chemical fertilizers are recommended.

TI  - Challenges and directions toward a general theory of ecological recovery dynamics: A metacommunity perspective
T2  - ONE EARTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Global change degrades ecosystems worldwide. Scientific research has advanced our knowledge of the impacts of global change on ecosystems. Comparatively, however, it remains unclear how ecosystems recover after disturbances. In this perspective, I contend that ecological restoration should advance toward a general, dynamic theory that describes the recovery rates and trajectories of ecosystems along restoration. This approach should address three fundamental challenges corresponding to three components of ecological systems: complexity (how do we quantify ecological restoration?), space (what are the spatial scales of restoration?), and global change (how does global change determine restoration's reference states?). A generic model and experiment based on metacommunities is used to illustrate how these challenges can be addressed. Given the extent of ecosystem degradation and the international consensus to restore ecosystems, revealing the patterns and mechanisms underlying recovery is a fundamental and timely issue toward a general theory of ecological restoration.

TI  - CA-Markov prediction modeling for the assessment of land use/land cover change in two sub-basins of the Tocantins-Araguaia River Basin
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the anthropogenic pressures of expansion areas for livestock and agricultural production in the Brazilian Cerrado, it is of paramount importance to understand the dynamics of land use/land cover (LULC) changes in this region. Thus, we investigated LULC changes in two sub-basins of the Tocantins-Araguaia River basin from 1997 to 2015 and consequently projected future changes for the timespan between 2030 and 2050. The Formoso sub-basin experienced significant expansion of agricultural and pasture areas, whereas the Sono sub-basin limited farmland expansion (more stable native vegetation) due to substantial protected areas, trends that were also observed for future projections (2030 and 2050). Pastureland in the Formoso sub-basin increased by 5.8%, while the Sono sub-basin saw significant gains in cultivated land, according to change detection analyses during the 1997-2015 period. High stability probabilities of no change (> 70%) for grassland areas in the Sono River sub-basin and pasturelands in the Formoso River sub-basin were computed. The CA-Markov model demonstrated a high consistency level with actual LULC classes for both sub-basins, as indicated by an overall Kappa coefficient above 0.8. Future projections for 2030 and 2050 show a substantial expansion of agriculture and pasture in both sub-basins, driven by specific factors such as soil organic carbon stocks, distance from rural settlements, and proximity to rivers. Short- and mid-term simulations indicate substantial expansion of agriculture and pasture in both basins, with potential adverse impacts on water erosion. Consequently, developing policies for soil management and sustainable land use planning is essential for agroecosystem sustainability, promoting a balanced approach to economic development while addressing climate change and anthropogenic challenges.

TI  - Assessing strategies to enhance soil carbon sequestration with the DSSAT-CENTURY model
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The adoption of no-till (NT) has been proposed to recover soil organic carbon (SOC), which will aid the mitigation of climate change. However, studies have questioned the potential of NT soils to deliver SOC sequestration and sustain crop yields. No-till experiments are relatively recent (<50 years) and very few studies were able to assess SOC dynamics in high-yield agroecosystems. We used the DSSAT-CENTURY model to predict long-term SOC (0-30 cm) using datasets from two experiments assessing tillage and nitrogen (N) sources in a Mollisol from the midwest United States (28 years) and tillage and crop rotations in an Oxisol from southern Brazil (33 years). The conversion of prairie and grassland soils to conventional agriculture decreased SOC by 61 and 12% in the Mollisol and Oxisol, respectively. Soil organic C accrual in NT soils was >0.5 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) under medium-low-yield maize in the Mollisol and negligible in the Oxisol under soybean/wheat rotation. Organic fertilization and crop rotation increased SOC accrual at both sites. Simulated SOC had good agreement with observations for NT soils but overestimated SOC in tilled soils. The model's parameters were then modified for tilled soils. Long-term simulations (100 years) revealed that SOC accrual in NT soils (0-15 cm) is partially offset by losses at 15-30 cm under low C inputs. Simulations with best crop management practices (BP; irrigation, high-yield cultivars, higher plant density and improved N fertilization) augmented C inputs and SOC stocks, ultimately recovering SOC to the levels of prairie soils. Our results suggest that the adoption of NT, recycling of organic fertilizers and the use of BP should be further promoted for recovery and permanence of SOC in agricultural soils.HighlightsStudies have questioned the potential of conservation agriculture (CA) to deliver SOC sequestration and sustain crop yields.We used the DSSAT-CENTURY model to simulate SOC dynamics in temperate and subtropical soils.No-till under moderate C/N inputs recovered topsoil SOC, but subsurface losses offset SOC accrual.Use of CA, organic amendments and best practice crop management (BP) is crucial for long-term SOC storage and permanence.

TI  - Fire danger assessment using geospatial modelling in Mekong delta, Vietnam: Effects on wetland resources
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mekong Delta (MD), Vietnam is a large tropical wetland important for commodity provision, water balance regulation, and biodiversity conservation. However, the delta is under severe fire risk due to prolonged drought and rising temperatures largely emanating from climatic change. Our study applied MODIS Terra land surface reflectance (MOD09A1), MODIS Terra land surface temperature (MOD11A2), and ASTER digital elevation model (DEM) to develop fire danger models to assess spatial patterns in fire danger in the MD. Four variables: Potential Surface Temperature (PST), Modified Normalized Difference Fire Index (MNDFI), Perpendicular Moisture Index (PMI) and Normalized Multiband Drought Index (NMDI), were extracted from the satellite products to develop the models using Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) and weighted overlay methods to generate fire danger maps during the 2019 fire season. The models were validated using MODIS Terra and Aqua thermal anomaly product (MOD14), with overall accuracy of 84.13%. The result demonstrated that the model accurately estimates fire risk over the MD. The study also found that forests, especially Melaleuca wetland forests in U Minh wetlands, and agricultural land were under severe fire risk. The implication is that measures such as proper management of forests and agricultural activities for mitigating forest fires and integrated fire and water strategies for either fire risk mitigation or biodiversity conservation are necessary for sustainable management of the MD wetland.

TI  - Climate and land-use changes effects on the distribution of a regional endemism: Melanophryniscus sanmartini (Amphibia, Bufonidae)
T2  - IHERINGIA SERIE ZOOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Amphibians are the most threatened vertebrate group according to the IUCN. Land-use and land cover change (LULCC) and climate change (CC) are two of the main factors related to declining amphibian populations. Given the vulnerability of threatened and rare species, the study of their response to these impacts is a conservation priority. The aim of this work was to analyze the combined impact of LULCC and CC on the regionally endemic species Melanophryniscus sanmartini Klappenbach, 1968. This species is currently categorized as near threatened by the IUCN, and previous studies suggest negative effects of projected changes in climate. Using maximum entropy methods we modeled the effects of CC on the current and mid-century distribution of M. sanmartini under two IPCC scenarios -A2 (severe) and B2 (moderate). The effects of LULCC were studied by superimposing the potential distribution with current land use, while future distribution models were evaluated under the scenario of maximum expansion of soybean and afforestation in Uruguay. The results suggest that M. sanmartini is distributed in eastern Uruguay and the south of Brazil, mainly related to hilly and grasslands systems. Currently more than 10% of this species' distribution is superimposed by agricultural crops and exotic forest plantations. Contrasting with a recent modelling study our models suggest an expansion of the distribution of M. sanmartini by mid-century under both climate scenarios. However, despite the rise in climatically suitable areas for the species in the future, LULCC projections indicate that the proportion of modified habitats will occupy up to 25% of the distribution of M. sanmartini. Future change in climate conditions could represent an opportunity for M. sanmartini, but management measures are needed to mitigate the effects of habitat modification in order to ensure its survival and allow the eventual expansion of its distribution.

TI  - Mapping deep peat carbon stock from a LiDAR based DTM and field measurements, with application to eastern Sumatra
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Reduction of carbon emissions from peatlands is recognized as an important factor in global climate change mitigation. Within the SE Asia region, areas of deeper peat present the greatest carbon stocks, and therefore the greatest potential for future carbon emissions from degradation and fire. They also support most of the remaining lowland swamp forest and its associated biodiversity. Accurate maps of deep peat are central to providing correct estimates of peat carbon stocks and to facilitating appropriate management interventions. We present a rapid and cost-effective approach to peat thickness mapping in raised peat bogs that applies a model of peat bottom elevation based on field measurements subtracted from a surface elevation model created from airborne LiDAR data. Results In two raised peat bog test areas in Indonesia, we find that field peat thickness measurements correlate well with surface elevation derived from airborne LiDAR based DTMs (R-2 0.83-0.88), confirming that the peat bottom is often relatively flat. On this basis, we created a map of extent and depth of deep peat (> 3 m) from a new DTM that covers two-thirds of Sumatran peatlands, applying a flat peat bottom of 0.61 m +MSL determined from the average of 2446 field measurements. A deep peat area coverage of 2.6 Mha or 60.1% of the total peat area in eastern Sumatra is mapped, suggesting that deep peat in this region is more common than shallow peat and its extent was underestimated in earlier maps. The associated deep peat carbon stock range is 9.0-11.5 Pg C in eastern Sumatra alone. Conclusion We discuss how the deep peat map may be used to identify priority areas for peat and forest conservation and thereby help prevent major potential future carbon emissions and support the safeguarding of the remaining forest and biodiversity. We propose rapid application of this method to other coastal raised bog peatland areas in SE Asia in support of improved peatland zoning and management. We demonstrate that the upcoming global ICESat-2 and GEDI satellite LiDAR coverage will likely result in a global DTM that, within a few years, will be sufficiently accurate for this application.

TI  - Infrastructuring coastal futures: Key trajectories in Southeast Asian megacities
T2  - ERDE
M3  - Article
AB  - The search for suitable adaptation pathways to accommodate for rising sea levels resulting from global climate change is an ongoing concern for many megacities in Southeast Asia and beyond. Addressing already existing challenges resulting from land subsidence and increased occurrence of inland flooding, adaptation can take varied forms and cover widely differing concerns, spaces and time spans. Based on research carried out in the cities of Singapore, Jakarta (Indonesia), and Manila (Philippines), this paper looks at some key trajectories of current adaptation planning. We argue that the processes of infrastructuring coastal futures in these cities are characterized by different aims and measures that overlap and converge in their material effects but also compete in articulating diverging new claims to the coast. In this perspective, we describe and analyze three main trends of infrastructuring coastal futures: the securitization of coastal futures by way of transforming disaster risk reduction practices and integrating new policy concerns, the greening of coastal spaces in material and operational terms, and finally, the valorization of coastal areas through reclamation, waterfront development and the creation of high-end real estate. Along these three trajectories, coastal adaptation planning becomes a key force that can influence virtually every sector of urban development and governance, and has strong implications for the futures of coastal cities in social and political terms.

TI  - The role of social forestry in achieving NDC targets: Study cases of Lampung and DI Yogyakarta
T2  - FOREST AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Social Forestry (SF) in Indonesia has emerged as a keystone strategy for to be managed by local communities, the government has set in motion an ambitious plan for SF to reduce poverty, empower local people, and improve forest conditions. More recently, SF is framed for its opportunity to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation. This study focused on examining the contribution of SF to the Nationally analyzing spatial data of SF areas and land cover changes using ArcView 10.8, the study assessed the carbon stock potential in SF areas. Carbon stock calculations were based on the 2022 National Forest Reference Level (FRL) for the periods before and after SF implementation. The finding of the study indicated that the carbon stock of SF areas in Yogyakarta and Lampung ranged from 9,214,381 to 9,923,420 ton CO2eq prior to SF, while the current carbon stock ranges from 8,703,489 to 9,393,706 ton CO2eq, representing a decrease (around 5.4%) rather than an increase. Overall, the changes in carbon stock were relatively small and localized, and the magnitude of the increase was insufficient to offset the overall decrease. To achieve the objectives of SF, such as meeting emission targets and achieving sustainable land use, it is crucial to carefully manage forest edges and fragmented forests, as they can contribute to carbon stock losses. Additionally, further studies and research are needed to improve the accuracy of carbon stock calculations, particularly for non-forest categories, which have higher uncertainty in the reference levels.

TI  - Framing Illegal Logging and Its Governance Responses in Brazil A Structured Review of Diagnosis and Prognosis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Review
AB  - In 2012, the new, revised Forest Code was established as the legal and regulatory framework for Brazilian forests. Though illegal logging has continued, frames about Brazil's forest policy and management have changed since that time. While until 2010 the successful implementation of forest policies and the resulting decline in deforestation rates were there for all to see and appreciate, the increase in the deforestation rate since then has become the focus of international criticism. With the help of a structured review of international scientific literature, newspaper articles, and programmes initiated by non-governmental organizations' (NGO) and international organizations' (10), this paper aims to analyse the frames of illegal logging and its governance responses in Brazil since 2012. The review is guided by the framework of diagnostic (What is the problem? Who is to blame?) and prognostic framing (proposed policy and governance solutions). The main findings revealed a master frame of environmental justice that combines injustice toward indigenous people with the victimization of forest and environment at large. Embedded in this master frame, specific frames that follow the institutional logic of the single policy discourses have been identified. Finally, the results show a strong national focus of governance with continued emphasis on command and control instruments.

TI  - Challenges for reducing carbon emissions from Land-Use and Land Cover Change in Brazil
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil, a crucial player in global climate change mitigation, faces challenges in reducing its carbon emissions, of which nearly half are from land use changes. Despite potential reductions that can be achieved through halting deforestation and fostering forest restoration, setbacks in environmental governance have heightened emissions. This article assesses challenges and proposes solutions for conserving and restoring Brazilian biomes in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement by 2030. Notably, net carbon emissions from land-use change and forestry increased twofold from 2017 to 2022 due to deforestation in the Amazon and Cerrado. Native vegetation clearing peaked at 2.8 Mha in 2022, the largest area since 2008. The deficit of native vegetation within Legal Reserves and Permanent Protection Areas must be addressed through restoration. Achieving SDGs by 2030 demands urgent action against illegal deforestation, reinforced legislation for secondary forest protection, large-scale restoration programs, and economic incentives for forest conservation through payment for ecosystem services to rural landowners.

TI  - Impacts of the tillage systems on the production of green corn (Zea mays L.) in long-term plots in Northeastern Brazil
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the current global context of climate change and the increasing demand for sustainability, optimizing agricultural production is very important in order to meet the demands for food and to mitigate environmental impact. To achieve sustainable agricultural production, particularly in regions with tropical soil and climate conditions, is necessary to adopt conservation-oriented techniques. This includes no-tillage system, the use of soil-cover crops, and the application of inoculants. The objective of this research was, at the end of the 22nd cropping season, to assess the influence of soil compaction in the production of green corn (Zea mays L.) in a long-term field experiment. This study was conducted under different soil tillage systems in a Red-Yellow Ultisol from the Coastal Tablelands of northeastern Brazil. Three soil tillage systems were applied: Conventional Tillage (CT), Minimum Tillage (MT), and No-tillage (NT). These were combined with four previous crops: cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), crotalaria (Crotalaria juncacea), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), and millet (Pennisetum glaucum), as well as two levels of nitrogen fertilizer application: (1) 100% of the recommended N dose, and (2) 50% of the recommended N dose plus Azospirillum brasilense inoculant. The experimental design consisted of strip plots with subplots divided and randomized within each strip, with three replications. Soil compaction was assessed using parameters of soil density (SD) and soil mechanical resistance to penetration (MRP) in conjunction with moisture content (MC). The principal component analysis (PCA) highlighted that conservation-oriented systems exhibited greater soil organic carbon (SOC) levels, leading to increased productivity of commercial green corn cobs. The synergistic effect of diversifying previous crops and adopting conservation tillage systems, especially in soils under long-term tillage, resulted in heightened productivity of commercial green corn ears.

TI  - Effects of grassland controlled burning on symbiotic skin microbes in Neotropical amphibians.
T2  - Scientific Reports
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has led to an alarming increase in the frequency and severity of wildfires worldwide. While it is known that amphibians have physiological characteristics that make them highly susceptible to fire, the specific impacts of wildfires on their symbiotic skin bacterial communities (i.e., bacteriomes) and infection by the deadly chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, remain poorly understood. Here, we address this research gap by evaluating the effects of fire on the amphibian skin bacteriome and the subsequent risk of chytridiomycosis. We sampled the skin bacteriome of the Neotropical species Scinax squalirostris and Boana leptolineata in fire and control plots before and after experimental burnings. Fire was linked with a marked increase in bacteriome beta dispersion, a proxy for skin microbial dysbiosis, alongside a trend of increased pathogen loads. By shedding light on the effects of fire on amphibian skin bacteriomes, this study contributes to our broader understanding of the impacts of wildfires on vulnerable vertebrate species.

TI  - VEGETATIVE GROWTH AND YIELD OF ROBUSTA COFFEE GENOTYPES CULTIVATED UNDER DIFFERENT SHADING LEVELS
T2  - BIOSCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing in shaded systems is one of the strategies adopted to mitigate the impacts of climate change on coffee trees. However, there are few studies about the effect of shading on the growth and production of clones of robusta coffee (Coffea canephora). Besides that, exist a paradigm in Brazil of that the shading in coffee robusta is synonymous of less yield. Thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate whether C. canephora genotypes subjected to shading increase their yield and growth vegetative under field conditions. The study was performed between September 2013 and July 2017 (four harvests) in Alegre, Espirito Santo state, Brazil. Three genotypes of cultivar Conilon Vitoria - Incaper 8142 were evaluated (03V, 06V, and 12V) and four levels of shade: full sunlight (witness) and, low, moderate and, high shade, with 38, 48 and, 68% of real capacity of shade, respectively. The shade was performed using black polyolefin screens; plants growing in full sunlight were only fenced. The tested shade levels affected the growth rate and yield of Robusta coffee plants. The shading caused a greater leaf expansion as compared to the full sunlight, as well as greater etiolation of the plagiotropic and orthotropic branches. The genotype 06V was shown to be responsive to shading, with a statistically equal production independently of shade level. The low, moderate, and high shade levels affected negatively the yield of genotypes 03V and 12V. The shading can improve the yield of Robusta coffee, in this case, of the genotype 06V of the cultivar Conilon Vitoria - Incaper 8142. The success of shaded plantations depends the choice of the shade responsive genotypes and appropriate shading level.

TI  - One Health tropical wetlands: a transdisciplinary framework for assessing the risks of emerging zoonotic diseases in the Brazilian Pantanal
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pantanal wetland ecosystem of Brazil is experiencing unprecedented local challenges from anthropogenic pressures, as well as from global climate change. These pressures escalate the zoonotic risks from wildlife populations, whose own susceptibility to disease is enhanced by stressors including habitat loss and fragmentation with the resulting decrement in food availability, immunity and resilience in the face of compounding disease risks. This continuous degradation and fragmentation of the ecosystem increases interactions between animals and humans (including indigenous peoples and local communities) further increasing disease risks for the human populations. Weak health systems across the Pantanal are reflected in limited pathogen surveillance, and poor sanitation and disease control measures, serving to further amplify the region's epidemic and pandemic potential. Using a transdisciplinary One Health (OH) approach to understand the ecological, social and biological drivers of infectious diseases, our research network developed a framework to conceptualise the current tools, evidence and processes for effective research and knowledge production in the Pantanal Wetland ecosystem. Drawing on the expertise of researchers and non-academic key-stakeholders can inform the work of global OH research networks and strengthen the evidence base for OH policy and practice in the Pantanal and other tropical wetland systems.

TI  - Mitigating GHG emissions in the humid tropics: Case studies from the alternatives to slash-and-burn program (ASB)
T2  - Environment Development and Sustainability
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forest conversion contributes as much as 25% of the net annual CO2 emissions and up to 10% of the N2O emissions to the atmosphere. The net effect on global warming potential (GWP) also depends on the net fluxes of greenhouse gases from land-use systems following deforestation. Efforts to mitigate these effects must take into account not only the greenhouse gas fluxes of alternative land-use systems but also the social and economic consequences that influence their widespread adoption. The global alternatives to slash-and-burn program (ASB) investigated the net greenhouse gas emissions and profitability of a range of land-use alternatives in the humid tropics. The analysis showed that many tree-based systems reduced net GWP compared to annual cropping and pasture systems. Some of these systems are also profitable in terms of returns to land and labor. The widespread adoption of these systems, however, can be limited by start-up costs, credit limitations, and number of years to positive cash flow, in addition to the higher labor requirements. Projects that offset carbon emissions through carbon sinks in land use in the tropics might be a means of overcoming these limitations. A synthesis of the findings from this program can provide guidelines for the selection and promotion of land-use practices that minimize net global warming effects of slash-and-burn.

TI  - Circulise, a model-driven framework to build and align socio-technical systems for the twin transition: Fanyatu's case of sustainability in reforestation
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Building circular economic systems is crucial to address ecological challenges like climate change. The twin transition suggests that, to maximize the impact of sustainable solutions, humans and (disruptive) technologies need to be effectively integrated. Methods to conceptually build such (eco)systems integrating these and assess their ecological impact before implementation are lacking. This paper addresses this gap by proposing the Circulise framework, a model-driven method designed to build circular systems and evaluate their environmental performance. The approach promotes design-thinking to create socio-technical ecosystems that can be evaluated at the light of their alignment with circular economy and/or sustainability principles and be used to generate operational software behavior. The Circulise framework was developed following the methodological guidance of design science research. It is applied in this paper to the case of Fanyatu, a non-profit organization focused on reforestation in the Congo Basin, showing its ability to create a circular ecosystem not only supporting the creation of regenerative CO2-absorbing forests but also empowering and improving the quality of life of the local communities involved in the planting of trees. In Fanyatu's case, Circulise's strategic planning and technology integration lead to virtuous cycles, enabling a snowball effect in forest creation and the promotion of sustainable projects. The framework's scalability and versatility allow it to be applied across various contexts, enabling the creation of customized circular ecosystems for sustainability tailored to specific human and technological needs.

TI  - Future precipitation changes and their implications for tropical peatlands
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon ( C) in tropical peatlands over Southeast Asia and Amazonia, if released to the atmosphere, can substantially increase the growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Over Southeast Asia, where the most extensive tropical peatlands in the world occur, 11 climate models for the IPCC Fourth Assessment show an overall decrease of rainfall in future dry seasons. Over Amazonia, future rainfall changes in dry seasons are highly uncertain; five models predict increased rainfall, and the remaining models predict the opposite. We have further examined the UKMO-HadCM3, GISS-ER, and GFDL-CM2.1 models. Over Southeast Asia, all three models predict similar decreases of rainfall and evaporative fraction, implying an increase of water table depth and surface dryness during the dry season south of the equator. Such changes would potentially switch peat ecosystems from acting as C sinks to C sources. Over Amazonia, the two models with the best simulations of current rainfall produce conflicting results for the future of peat stability.

TI  - Soil carbon stocks in sugarcane cultivation: An evidence synthesis associated with land use and management practices
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Biofuels are essential to ensure the energy transition and mitigating of climate change. However, understanding the impact of land use change (LUC) and management practices on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks is fundamental to ensuring well-founded policymaking and assessing the sector's carbon footprint. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis (511 pairwise observations) to obtain Brazil's SOC stock change factors (SOCscf) for LUC and management practices in sugarcane fields. Our results showed that converting native vegetation to sugarcane reduced the SOC stock in all assessed periods. The conversion from annual crops to sugarcane showed a reduction in SOC stock in the first 10 years but with a recovery over time. The conversion of pasture to sugarcane reduced the SOC stock only in the 10-20-year period and had a neutral effect in other periods evaluated. However, our dataset showed high variability in SOCscf, with many observations indicating an increase in SOC stock, which is related to degraded pastures. We observed that the SOC accumulation rate for each ton of sugarcane straw was affected by the interaction between soil texture and precipitation. Regarding straw management, a low removal rate (< 34%) did not affect the SOC stock, while moderate (34%-66%) and high (> 66%) removal resulted in losses of 5.0% (SOCscf 0.950) and 9.9% (SOCscf 0.901), respectively. Our results also showed that reduced tillage and vinasse application increased SOC stocks by 24.0% (SOCscf 1.24) and 10.0% (SOCscf 1.10) respectively, proving to be good strategies to support C sequestration in sugarcane fields. Finally, we highlight that our results can contribute to the improvement of public policies and also be used in future life cycle assessment (LCA) and modeling studies, as they provide robust data to establishing regional SOCscf induced by LUC and management practices, enhancing the reliability of the C footprint assessment of biofuel production.

TI  - The regime complex for tropical rainforest transformation: Analysing the relevance of multiple global and regional land use regimes in Indonesia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasingly, international agreements, treaties, and conventions address tropical deforestation and specific causes of rainforest transformation. Such international regimes may aim to conserve natural forests or to support the exploitation of lands for a particular purpose, e.g. agricultural commodities. This paper's goal is to map the international regime complex for rainforest transformation by identifying those global and regional regimes that are relevant for tropical rainforest transformation systems in Indonesia. The relevance of international regimes for rainforest transformation is assessed based on a novel methodology using two criteria: First, international' regimes may be relevant in Indonesia because the core problem they address exists in Indonesia (problem dimension). Second, specific international regimes may be made relevant by the actions of specific actors and their coalitions in pursuit of their interests (actor dimension). To achieve the study's goals we used (I) content analysis of international policy documents and treaty texts, (2) expert interviews with key informants in Indonesia, and (3) own field observations in current Indonesian land use politics. The results indicate that regimes dealing with biological diversity, climate change, trade in endangered species, wetland management, international tropical trade, illegal logging, Southeast Asian (ASEAN) forest and environment, the Asia Pacific free trade, and the southeast Asian rubber trade regime are relevant in both the problem and actor dimensions. The regimes concerned with desertification and international forestry research are relevant only in the actor dimension. In contrast, the following regimes are relevant only in the problem dimension: indigenous rights, forest certification, palm oil certification, agroforestry certification, and international rubber trade. We discuss our results considering global and regional regimes relevant to Indonesian rainforest transformation systems. We conclude that regimes relevant solely due to the engagement of domestic actors and not in respect of the problem dimension are unlikely to maintain their relevance in the long term. In the short term, however, they have the potential for creating substantial political benefits for the actors using them. In contrast, regimes with high problem relevance but low actor backing are unlikely to even enter the political agenda, and therefore will have only limited impact. This suggests that future research should consider that, whilst relevance in the problem dimension is necessary to establish regime influence, it alone does not suffice. We can expect global and regional regimes to have an influence only when powerful actors back them in their agenda setting, domestic policy formulation and actual implementation.

TI  - Linking soil respiration and water table depth in tropical peatlands with remotely sensed changes in water storage from the gravity recovery andclimate experiment
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from Southeast Asia peatlands are contributing substantially to global anthropogenic emissions to the atmosphere. Peatland emissions associated with land-use change, and fires are closely related to changes in the water table level. Remote sensing is a powerful tool that is potentially useful for estimating peat CO2 emissions over large spatial and temporal scales. We related ground measurements of total soil respiration and water table depth collected over 19months in an Indonesian peatland to remotely sensed gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) terrestrial water storage anomoly (TWSA) data. GRACE TWSA can be used to predict changes in water storage on land. We combined ground observations from undrained forest and drained smallholder oil palm plantations on peat in Central Kalimantan to produce a representation of the peatland landscape in one 0.5 degrees x0.5 degrees GRACE grid cell. In both ecosystem types, total soil respiration increased with increasing water table depth. Across the landscape grid, monthly changes in water table depth were significantly related to fluctuations in GRACE TWSA. GRACE TWSA explained 76% of variation in water table depth and 75% of variation in total soil respiration measured on the ground. By facilitating regular sampling across broad spatial scales that captures essential variation in a major driver of soil respiration and peat fires, our approach could improve information available to decision makers to monitor changes in water table depth and peat CO2 emissions. This would enable measures better targeted in space and time to more effectively mitigate CO2 emissions from tropical peat drainage and fires. Testing over larger regions is needed to operationalize this exploratory approach.

TI  - The Potential of Agroforestry in Supporting Food Security for Peatland Community - A Case Study in the Kalampangan Village, Central Kalimantan
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Food security is one of the main problems under the pandemic and climate change condition that we currently face. Managing peatland to fulfill community needs faces several problems including peat fire, GHG emissions and loss of biodiversity. Agroforestry is one of land use systems on peatland that is capable of accommodating different interests while still concerning the conservation purposes. This study aimed to assess the potential of agroforestry for ensuring the food security of local communities. This research was carried out in the Kalampangan Village, Palangka Raya City central Kalimantan for six months. This study used both quantitative and qualitative approaches, including interviews and field observations. Interviews were carried out with 13 farmers in Kalampangan who applied an agroforestry system. The data gathered included all agroforestry components and number of the food production component. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The results showed three agroforestry types were applied by the Village community Kalampangan, namely agrosilviculture, agrosilvopasture, and agrofisheries. The biodiversity of agroforestry in Kalapangan is relatively high, with a total of 58 different species identified. A total of 86% of all agroforestry components are sources of food, including fruits, vegetables, seeds, tubers, spices and livestock. The information above shows that the peatland agroforestry in the Kalampangan Village has the potential to support food security while maintaining the biodiversity. Thus, agroforestry can be recommended as a peatland land use and rehabilitation strategies to accommodate the basic needs of local communities and increasing their prosperity.

Mangrove reforestation as a mesotidial coastal protection and clean develepment mechanism on Macau-Serra oil field, Potiguar Basin, Northeast Brazil. Journal of Coastal Research, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 1268 - 1271. Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208Mangrove ecosystem changes are commonly mentioned among a variety of coastal effects caused by climate change and human intervention. On the Rio Grande do Norte northern coast of Brazil intense sediment transport, is controlled by a high dynamic energy factors. This causes widespread erosion and shoreline morphological instability. Through the observation of wetland natural deposits, it was possible to make a physicochemical characterization which indicated over an area of approximately 0.89 km(2) appropriated to reforestation with local mangrove. To assess the amount of atmospheric carbon sequestration by the mangrove ecosystem, following the principles of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), an inventory was conducted based on geoprocessing and ground accuracy techniques, especially regarding the structural characterization of the mangrove areas. With this approach a mangrove planting project is planned to stabilize a tidal channel northwest of Ponta do Tubarao Island. This is expected to reduce the energy of the channel which is responsible for the currently intense erosion and migration of the channel over the oil field infrastructure. Remote sensing, GIS and DGPS were used to compare the current and past mangrove cover, allowing plausible projections for the future impacts and changes in that region. Currently 7.1% of the mangrove forests of the studied area is dead or suffering ongoing breakdown.

TI  - The Effectiveness of "ProKlim"in Controlling Landslide by Vegetative Method in the Sambak Village, Kajoran, Magelang
T2  - AGRITECH
M3  - Article
AB  - Engagement of the community at Sambak Village in climate change adaptation and mitigation has been recognized with the ProKlim Award. Sambak is located in the transition zone of the Sumbing Volcano and Menorah Mountains, making it is prone to erosion, landslides, and drought. Therefore, this study focused on assessment the effectiveness of ProKlim activities in the context of landslide mitigation by using vegetative method. The identification of landslides distribution was carried out through a visual interpretation of aerial photographs followed by a field work which was employed to construct a landslide susceptibility map using the frequency ratio method. Landslide control identification was performed by involving community. The spatial pattern was determined by the nearest neighbor analysis method. The effectiveness analysis emphasized identifying landslide control points through tree planting activities in landslide-prone areas. This study showed that tree planting activities was not conducted in areas at risk of landslides. Based on the results, there were 42 landslides on the slopes of 15-25 & DEG; and 8-15 & DEG;, dry land agricultural cover, shrubs, and open land, the direction of the slope towards southeast and east, curvature profile (+) and (-), the distance by road 100-200 and 200-300 m, and the distance to the river < 150 m. The AUC value of susceptibility model validation was 0.66, while tree planting distribution in the vegetative landslide control was found in mixed garden land cover and secondary dry forests. The landslides and tree planting distribution had a random spatial pattern.

TI  - Floristic diversity and carbon stocks in the periphery of Deng-Deng National Park, Eastern Cameroon
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon is continuously being removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis and stored in carbon pools (live, dead, and soil carbon) of forest ecosystems. However, carbon stock in dead wood and of trees with diameters at breast height (dbh) between 5 and 10 cm is often not considered in many studies carried out in the Congo Basin Forest. The relationship between tree diversity, life-forms and carbon stocks has received little attention. This study was carried out on the outskirts of Deng Deng National Park (DDNP) to determine tree diversity (dominant families, species richness and Shannon index), assess carbon stocks in the five carbon compartments (living tree, understory, fine roots, dead wood and litter) as well as to analyze the relationship between (1) carbon stocks and tree diversity; and, (2) between carbon stock and life-forms. The Shannon index of trees >= 10 cm dbh ranged from 2.6 in riparian forest to 4.3 in secondary forest; and for the tree between 5 and 10 cm, it ranged to 1.56 in riparian forest to 3.68 in the secondary forest. The study site housed 16 species, 7 genera and 3 families which are only found in trees of dbh between 5 and 10 cm. The average total carbon stock of the five compartments varied from 200.1 t ha(-1) in forest residues to 439.1 t ha(-1) in secondary forest. Dead wood carbon stock varied from 1.2 t ha(-1) in riparian forests to 12.51t ha(-1) in agroforests. The above ground carbon stocks for trees with diameter between 5 and 10 cm varied from 0.7 t ha(-1) in young fallow fields to 5.02 t ha(-1) in old secondary forests. This study reveals a low but positive correlation between species richness and total carbon stocks, as well as a significant positive relationship between life-forms and total carbon stocks. The findings highlight the need for more data concerning carbon content of dead wood, carbon of trees >= 5 cm < 10 cm dbh and the relationship between carbon stocks and tree diversity from other areas of the Congo Basin for a good understanding of the contribution of tropical forests to climate change mitigation.

TI  - Permanence of avoided deforestation in a Transamazon REDD plus project (Para, Brazil)
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rigorous impact evaluations of local REDD+ (reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) initiatives have shown some positive outcomes for forests, while well-being impacts have been mixed. However, will REDD+ outcomes persist over time after interventions have ended? Using quasi-experimental methods, we investigated the effects of one REDD+ project in the Brazilian Amazon on deforestation and people's well-being, including intra-community spillover effects (leakage). We then evaluated to what extent outcomes persisted after the project ended (permanence). This project combined Payments for Environmental Services (PES) with sustainable livelihood alternatives to reduce smallholder deforestation. Data came from face-to-face surveys with 113 households (treatment: 52; non-participant from treatment communities: 35; control: 46) in a three-datapoint panel design (2010, 2014 and 2019). Results indicate the REDD+ project conserved an average of 7.8% to 10.3% of forest cover per household and increased the probability of improving enrollees' well-being by 27-44%. We found no evidence for significant intra-community leakage. After the project ended, forest loss rebounded and perceived well-being declined - yet, importantly, past saved forest was not cleared. Therefore, our results confirm what the theory and stylized evidence envisioned for temporal payments on activity-reducing ('set-aside'): forest loss was successfully delayed but not permanently eradicated.

TI  - Unfavorable successional pathways and the conservation value of logged tropical forest
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation agencies are increasingly advocating that the survival of many tropical forest species may depend on disturbed forests and are directing scarce conservation resources to managing logged forests. This requires critical evaluation. In this 10-year study, we quantify tree community dynamics in three selectively logged areas harvested at different intensities and compare their recovery to two unlogged areas in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Over the 10 years, 527 of the original 4840 tagged trees (greater than or equal to 10 cm DBH) died; while the mortality rate was highest in the heavily logged area, it was only significantly greater than one of the unlogged sites. The density of new trees varied significantly among areas being highest in the lightly logged area, but the density of new recruits in the heavily logged area did not differ from the unlogged areas. Overall, the more heavily logged areas had higher growth rates than the unlogged or lightly logged areas. However, there was no difference among areas in the magnitude of the change in basal area; and in both 1990 ( 20+ years post-harvest) and 2000 the basal area in the heavily logged area was significantly less than the unlogged areas. In general, findings from the heavily logged area suggest that the expectation that in logged areas a number of processes of forest regeneration will be accelerated relative to unlogged forest was not met. Thus, 30+ years after logging evidence suggests that forest recovery will be slower than expected. We also present evidence to suggest that the climate in the region is changing, which may account for changes in the population dynamics of certain species in the unlogged forests.

TI  - Identifying the global potential for baobab tree cultivation using ecological niche modelling
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The benefits provided by underutilised fruit tree species such as baobab (Adansonia digitata L.) in combating increasing malnutrition and poverty become more apparent as awareness grows regarding concerns of climate change and food security. Due to its multiple uses, its high nutritional and medicinal value, drought tolerance and relatively easy cultivation, baobab has been identified as one of the most important edible forest trees to be conserved, domesticated and valued in Africa. In order to contribute towards the cultivation of the species, suitability of sites in Africa and worldwide was evaluated for potential cultivation using species' locality data and spatial environmental data in MAXENT modelling framework. A total of 450 geo-referenced records of the baobab tree were assembled from herbarium records, commercial firm's databases and fieldwork for modelling site suitability for global cultivation of the baobab tree. Climatic and topographic data were acquired from the Worldclim data while soil data was obtained from the Harmonized World Soil Database. MAXENT was found to be a successful modelling method for studying cultivation potential. The main variables that contributed towards predicting baobab's global cultivation potential were annual precipitation and temperature seasonality. Results suggest that baobab tree could be widely cultivated in most countries in southern Africa and in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa from Senegal to Sudan. Angola and Somalia were found to be highly suitable for cultivating baobab in Africa. Model suggests, India, where the baobab tree already exists and is used, to be the most suitable country for baobab cultivation outside Africa. North-west Australia, Madagascar, north-east Brazil and Mexico resulted to be other suitable places for cultivating the tree species. Although it is recommended model results be validated with in situ seedling experiments, there seems to be a great potential for the cultivation of this species globally.

TI  - Structures of tropical dry forests in the Andes: forest conservation, composition and the role of fabaceae and myrtaceae
T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Tropical Dry Forests (TDFs) are repositories of biodiversity, ecosystem services and carbon that are threatened by fragmentation and climate change. Floristic and phytosociological studies are fundamental database for many studies of conservation and sustainability, but there is a knowledge gap concerning TDFs, especially in the Andes valleys. The aim of this study was to determine the phytosociological structure and composition of woody vegetation of seven TDFs in the Colombian Andes, and because the flora associated with this type of forest has a geographical distribution restricted to each locality where this biome exists, provide information on the main species, genera and families for conservation and restoration actions as well as for future metaanalyses. We sampled seven TDFs with 20 plots of 25 m x 4 m. Results: In the 1.88 hectares of samples, 8422 individuals were surveyed, distributed in 170 species, 120 genera and 50 botanical families. Of these species, 78.82% were identified at the species level, 17.05% at the genus level, and 4.11% at the family level. The most important families were Fabaceae and Myrtaceae. Nitrogen-fixing Fabaceae species were prominent amongst the important species, especially in low altitude and more stressing sites.Conclusion: The structure, composition and ecological importance of these forests must be considered for conservation and ecological restoration plans, in particular the habitat preference of species along the topographic gradient. Particularly noteworthy for conservation are the Myrtaceae species because promote connectivity and regeneration by providing resources for the fauna, a driver of dispersal, as well as nitrogen-fixing Fabaceae species, because promote the resilience and natural regeneration of TDFs in the Andes, a key feature of stability.

TI  - Soil Quality and CO2 Emissions in Response to Six Years of Conventional and Integrated Agricultural Production in the Central-West Region of Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Determine the soil quality and the emissions of mineralizable soil carbon (C-CO2) in conventional and integrated systems in the Midwest region of Brazil. Methods: The evaluated systems include original pasture (OP), reformed pasture (RP), conventional tillage (CT), direct seeding (DS), and cultivated eucalyptus forest (CF), as well as crop-livestock integration (CLI) and crop-livestock-forest integration (CLFI) systems in both the pasture phase (p) and crop phase (c). The soil organic carbon (SOC), carbon and carbon stock (StoC) of the particulate organic matter (C-POM) and mineral-associated organic matter (C-OMM) fractions, indexes of soil quality, and daily CO2 emission and accumulation in the 0-0.05, 0.05-0.10, 0.10-0.20, and 0.20-0.40 m layers were determined. Results: The CLIp and CLIc systems had the highest SOC contents, reaching 15.47 and 15.04 g kg-1 of C in the 0-0.05 m layer, respectively. For C-POM, the integrated systems in the pasture phase had the highest contents and stocks, storing up to 19 t ha-1 at 0.4 m. For C-OMM, CLIc had the highest contents and stocks, storing up to 57 t ha-1 of C up to 0.4 m. The systems with pasture had the best carbon management indexes. The LI, L, C-POM stock, and CMI remained the most representative variables related to the CLFIp system. Conclusions: integrated systems improve soil quality and store Carbon, especially in recalcitrant fractions of the SOM, with reduced C-CO2 emissions, helping to mitigate climate change in the Central-West region of Brazil.

TI  - Toward Water, Energy, and Food Security in Rural Indonesia: A Review
T2  - WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - Indonesia is an archipelago with significant variations in natural resources, infrastructure, socioeconomic, culture, human resource capacity, accessibility, and access to financial and technical assistance. In this situation, integrated and unique efforts are needed to manage natural resources and build synergy between their protection and utilization to achieve water, energy, and food (WEF) security in accordance with the SDG targets. This paper analyzes the implementations of the WEF nexus in rural Indonesia by examining existing legal frameworks and other related policies, journals, textbooks, and publications. We explore factors influencing the success and failure of the implementation of the WEF nexus approaches from technical, socioeconomic, cultural, political, and institutional perspectives of the rural development framework.

TI  - Implications of regional agricultural land use dynamics and deforestation associated with sugarcane expansion for soil carbon stocks in Brazil
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of bioenergy to replace fossil energy has grown in recent years, raising concerns about the "carbon (C) neutrality" of bioenergy and the benefits of its use to enhance energy security and mitigate climate change. In Brazil, sugarcane ethanol is a feasible option and can result in negative greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through replacement of fossil fuels. This study evaluated the direct deforestation triggered by sugarcane expansion in Mata Atlantica and Cerrado biomes considering the periods of intense expansion from 2002 to 2008 and the stagnation of sugarcane production from 2009 to 2016. The expansion and associated land use changes (LUC) were evaluated and quantified to address direct effects on deforestation, soil C stocks, and associated GHG emissions/removals in two Brazilian watersheds. Most of deforestation in both biomes occurred before 2002. Two percent of the sugarcane expansion caused direct deforestation between 2002 and 2008. From 2009 to 2016, 3% of the new sugarcane areas were located outside the Sugarcane Agroecological Zoning program. Regarding the assessed basins, almost six times more deforestation was observed in Goias basin (similar to 15,000 ha) than in Sao Paulo basin (similar to 2500 ha). Deforestation in Goias basin was strongly linked to expansion of annual crops, while in Sao Paulo basin reforestation has occurred. Lastly, sugarcane expansion had negligible impacts on the overall soil C budget for both basins. This assessment is an important step forward for incorporating LUC-induced emissions to develop and evaluate GHG mitigation strategies towards greater sustainability of sugarcane production in Brazil.

AB  - Environmental factors, especially climate, soil and pest attack, are limiting factors in citrus production. The purpose of this study was to determine the limiting factors on RGL citrus productivity. This research was carried out in 2019 in Pal VII Village, Bermani Ulu Raya District, Rejang Lebong Regency, Bengkulu Province with seven farmers at the research location. Data was collected from primary and secondary data consist of 10 years climate data, soil characteristics and citrus pest and diseases identification, which are then analyzed descriptively. The results showed that the productivity of RGL citrus in the research location was influenced by high rainfall during the fruiting period. Another limiting factor is the relatively low soil nutrient content because farmers generally do not apply fertilization technology that based on crop needs. Pests and diseases that had been potential reduced the productivity and quality of citrus fruits were fruit borers, fruit flies and scurvy, and climate factors also influenced the quality.

TI  - Understanding landowners' intention to restore native areas: The role of ecosystem services
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding landowners' intention to voluntarily engage in conservation initiatives is essential to designing more realistic projects and interventions. In this study, we used the Theory of Planned Behavior to identify the psychological constructs underlying landowners' intention to restore areas with native vegetation on their properties over the next three years. We extended the model, investigating whether the perception of ecosystem services, age, number of springs, and size of property affect the intention studied. We interviewed 75 landowners whose properties are in the surroundings of a public protected area in Brazil and applied structural equation modeling to analyze the acquired data. The results agree with the predicted relationship between attitudes and intention. Furthermore, perception of the ecosystem services and the number of springs on a given property are two factors which directly affect attitude and indirectly affect the intention to restore. Younger landowners are more willing to restore. These results suggest that understanding the benefits of conserving biodiversity on farmland affects management practices. Investing in educational initiatives to promote more knowledge about ecosystem services will increase the involvement of more landowners in future conservation programs.

AB  - There are concerns that local people will not be genuinely involved in initiatives to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). We analyzed local participation in the design of one REDD+ project in the eastern Brazilian Amazon, and assessed local hopes, worries and recommendations for the project through four community focus groups and interviews with 137 households at the site. Our results showed that only one-third of households interviewed (31%) had enough information about the project to describe it accurately. Of those, the majority (60%) hoped that the project would improve their incomes, followed by improving their agricultural production (33%) and helping protect forests (26%). While increasing household incomes was the dominant hope, people's recommendations revealed that they favored non-monetary forms of compensation over the direct cash payments included in the proponents' package of incentives. Their main recommendation was that the project should help improve their production systems through access to technical assistance, machinery and training, while valuing local production systems (46%). Our study highlights the need for participation that goes beyond passive consultation with local people to develop REDD+ interventions that best reflect local knowledge, land use practices and aspirations.

TI  - The role of seed rain and soil seed bank in the regeneration of a Caatinga dry forest following slash-and-burn agriculture
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use changes have contributed to an increased interest in understanding the drivers of forest regeneration in human-modified landscapes. This is particularly true for arid ecosystems, in which regeneration is relatively less known, but more sensitive to land-use intensification and climate change. This paper aims to identify the relative contribution of seed rain and soil seed banks for the regeneration of the Caatinga dry forest in northeastern Brazil as well as their drivers. We monitored seed rain and soil seed bank of woody plant species during a 14-month period across 15 regenerating (4-70 yr old) and 5 old-growth forest stands. Stand age, precipitation, chronic anthropogenic disturbance, and forest aboveground biomass were our explanatory variables. A total of 5081 seeds from 61 species were recorded in the seed rain across all forest stands (1.81 intact seeds per m2 per month). Regenerating and old-growth stands did not differ relative to average seed rain scores, with the proportion of zoochoric seeds positively associated with forest biomass. In the seed bank, we recorded a total of 5660 seeds from 64 species (5.05 intact seeds per m2 per month), with no differences among stands, except for species richness; with mean seed size positively associated with stand age. Collectively, seed rain and seed bank captured only 40% of the woody regional flora, mostly dry-fruited species (70% of all species). Moreover, assemblages were dominated by a few hyper-abundant species. Our results suggest that the Caatinga dry forest supports relatively low-density and impoverished seed rain and soil seed bank. Additionally, seed rain and soil seed bank do not exhibit directional changes through forest regeneration for most of the attributes, and deviate little from the scores of old-growth forest stands. Compared to resprouting, they may pose limited influence on woody plant recruitment and dry forest regeneration across human-modified landscapes. In this context, Caatinga restoration approaches based on natural seed rain and soil seed banks may be of limited effectiveness.

TI  - Modeling Air Quality Determinants in Indonesia Using Generalized Linear Models for Sustainable Development
T2  - CHALLENGES IN SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and Goal 13 (Climate Action), underscore the interconnectedness between air quality and climate change. Escalating levels of air pollution in both urban and rural regions of Indonesia necessitate a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to air quality degradation. This study employs a generalized linear modeling approach, specifically focusing on ordinal logistic regression, to explore the determinants influencing the Air Quality Index (AQI) across 34 provinces in Indonesia. Key predictors, including motor vehicle density, population density, Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, and forest cover, are analyzed to assess their impact on air quality levels. The findings indicate that the number of motor vehicles and the extent of forest cover are significant predictors of air quality. Elevated motor vehicle density is shown to deteriorate the AQI, while larger forest cover areas are associated with improvements in air quality. These results emphasize the importance of targeted environmental interventions, particularly those aimed at reducing vehicle emissions and preserving forest ecosystems. The study highlights the need for the development and enforcement of policies that promote sustainable urban mobility and forest conservation to mitigate air pollution. By providing a comprehensive statistical framework through ordinal logistic regression, this research offers actionable insights for policymakers. The findings can guide the formulation of effective environmental management strategies, supporting efforts to achieve sustainable development objectives. Moreover, this study demonstrates the relevance of adopting rigorous statistical models to address complex environmental challenges, contributing to the broader discourse on sustainability and climate action.

TI  - Coastal and Marine Ecosystems of the Arafura and Timor Seas - Characterization, Key Features and Ecological Significance
T2  - COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The tropical Arafura and Timor Seas (ATS) region lies on the edge of the Coral Triangle, located at the intersection of two major Large Marine Ecosystems, the Northern Australian Shelf and the Indonesian Sea. Under the influence of the Indonesian Through Flow current and Pacific-Indian Ocean exchange, the ATS also lies at a major 'cross-road' of global ocean circulation and climate regulation. The 'semi-enclosed' ATS is characterized by diverse seascapes, pronounced ecological connectivity (marine biodiversity, shared fisheries, land-sea interactions), extensive coastal wetlands and shallow-water ecosystems, and globally-significant marine biodiversity (particularly corals reefs, mangroves, seagrasses, and populations of marine megafauna). Complex oceanography, bathymetry and large-scale, tidal and monsoon-driven circulation, and localized, seasonal upwellings are major features across the region, driving patterns of ocean productivity, reef biodiversity and sustaining rich pelagic ecosystems. With some of the most extensive, productive and near-pristine tropical coastal ecosystems in the world, the waters of the ATS are a global marine biodiversity 'hotspot' and play a crucial role in maintaining regional/global tropical marine biodiversity. Including providing major migration corridors, critical habitats and a regional/global refuge for some of the world's most threatened marine megafauna and wildlife populations (particularly sea turtles, sharks/rays, sawfish/river sharks, whales, dolphins and dugongs). Coastal habitats in the ATS also provide a range of ecosystem services of fundamental importance to human well-being, including climate change; with climate-resilient coral reefs and some of the largest and intact, tropical wetlands (mangroves, saltmarshes, seagrasses) in the world, the ATS region is a recognized global blue carbon hotspot. The characterization and assessment of key ecosystems and processes in the ATS in this study provide the basis for protecting these resources through the Arafura and Timor Seas Ecosystem Action Program.

TI  - Soil chemical quality indicators for agricultural life cycle assessment: a case of study in Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern agriculture has had to face complex environmental issues, many of which result from land use, which includes the degradation of its fertility properties. Soil quality is fundamental to the sustainability of the planet, as it also affects other natural resources. Therefore, it must be seen as a fundamental action for the sustainability of the planet and be evaluated using methodologies capable of holistically relating the environmental impacts of production systems, as does the Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. However, due to the lack of suitable models, LCA is still ineffective in assessing soil quality. Therefore, our objective was to evaluate the use of chemical soil quality indicators in the context of LCA, contributing new information to the debate. To this end, a set of soil quality indicators from the APOIA-NovoRural method were applied in some agricultural production systems in southern Brazil. Thus, the LCA results confirmed soil quality maintenance activities as those that most contribute to impacts, particularly in the categories of climate change, (eco)toxicities and land use. However, the indicators efficiently contributed direct information about the agricultural environment, relating them to the impacts estimated by the LCA. Therefore, the use of indicators makes it possible to improve soil management by adjusting chemical parameters, accurately contextualizing activities, and use of inputs to the real conditions of the area assessed. Thus, we demonstrate that indicators can be useful in providing information for agricultural environmental management in interrelation with LCA, whose application alone is not yet capable of achieving such results.

TI  - Land allocation to meet sectoral goals in Indonesia An analysis of policy coherence
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land is a scarce resource affecting the implementation of many sectoral policies. In Indonesia, the expansion of palm oil plantations has led to non-sustainable land use practices in past years, particularly deforestation. More recently, the government has set ambitious targets for the adoption of biodiesel which will require expansion of oil palm plantations, thus putting further pressure on land. Meanwhile, the need to guarantee.food supply, forest conservation and climate change mitigation also imply challenges when it comes to land allocation and use. This paper examines the role that land plays in the implementation of sectoral policies in Indonesia, exploring the availability of land to satisfy the multiple goals defined in national policies. We explore land competition resulting from allocations made in official policy documents starting with biofuel policy. The analysis of policy goals and coherence when it comes to land allocation is made in relation to agriculture, climate and forestry policies. We conclude that adjustments need to be made in the policies to avoid overlappings and misinterpretations when it comes to land allocation. The area made available for meeting each sectoral policy goal when taking into account cross sectoral interactions is: 14.2 Mha for agriculture, 43 Mha for climate mitigation measures, 9.2 Mha for forestry, and 20.9 Mha for biofuels. A more uniform land classification and development of a common reference database will increase transparency on land allocation and use, and help to monitor land use change, ultimately supporting the achievement of multiple national goals.

TI  - A political ecology of speculative urbanism: The role of financial and environmental speculation in Jakarta's water crisis
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Jakarta, Indonesia's capital, is increasingly characterized by luxury real estate developments and high-profile infrastructural projects made possible by economic liberalization and finance capital. Yet these developments have contributed to Jakarta's struggles with chronic flooding, land subsidence, and water shortages. This paper contributes an empirical study of the spatial-temporal dynamics of speculative urbanism and the associated impacts on water resources and flood events in Jakarta. I use an urban political ecology approach to analyze mainland and offshore development. First, I show how financial speculation generates flood risk and the overexploitation of water resources, producing uneven socio-spatial distributions of risk. These transformations in Jakarta's hydroscape in turn threaten to undermine the city's viability as a site for speculative investment. I thus show how speculative urbanism can be threatened or disrupted by nonhuman agencies. Second, I illustrate a second form of speculation, which I refer to as environmental speculation. As Jakarta's water crisis has cast doubt on the future of the city itself as a place of habitation, the state explored an ambitious and potentially lucrative coastal defense project, while private developers have engaged in land reclamation. The turn toward offshore development illustrates how environmental speculation creates new opportunities for capital accumulation. I advance two arguments: first, in order to capture the full costs of speculative urbanism, it is imperative that urban scholars attend to its ecological dimensions. Second, an urban political ecology approach advances our understandings of speculative urbanism by illuminating its contradictions and limits.

TI  - Agricultural development with rainforest conservation: Methods for seeking best bet alternatives to slash-and-burn, with applications to Brazil and Indonesia
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests continue to fall for agricultural purposes throughout the humid tropics, with immediate and potentially large consequences for climate change and biodiversity loss-issues of key interest to the international community. Some of the actors directly responsible for forest conversion fell trees to meet food security needs and alleviate poverty-issues of urgent interest to them and also to national policymakers. This multiplicity of groups with differing (often conflicting) interests in the multifarious goods and services produced by tropical forests complicates the search for alternative agricultural activities for forest margins since these alternatives must satisfy such divergent objectives. This paper sets out a conceptual framework for comparing the impacts of different land use systems and agricultural practices at the margins of tropical rainforests in terms of the concerns and objectives of two key interest groups: small-scale farmers seeking livelihoods at the forest margins and the 'international' interests in the global public goods and services supplied by tropical rainforests. This framework should be useful to a third key group, the national and regional policymakers who must consider these and other policy objectives and then decide on courses of action. The paper identifies data needs and analytical methods capable of supplying an empirical base for this conceptual framework, based on quantifiable indicators. It then presents preliminary results of the application of this conceptual framework in Indonesia and Brazil in association with a global, collaborative, multidisciplinary research program. Even using preliminary order-of-magnitude estimates (to be replaced by more precise measurements as they become available), this conceptual framework presents results in ways that allow researchers and policymakers to select clear 'best bets' for development, when they exist, and to assess tradeoffs and options for complementary policy action and research efforts, when they do not.

TI  - Groundwater dominates terrestrial hydrological processes in the Amazon at the basin and subbasin scales
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The hydrology of the Amazon River basin (ARB) has been extensively studied; however, critical scientific gaps remain regarding key processes that govern hydrologic dynamics and the resilience of the rainforest. This inhibits the understanding of hydrological considerations needed for sustainable forest management under climate change and growing human stressors. Here, using high resolution (similar to 2km), long-term simulations from a process-based hydrological model (LEAF-Hydro-Flood), we investigate the dominant hydrological processes across the ARB, their key roles in shaping basin functions, and the decadal evolution therein. Results indicate that shallow groundwater (<5m deep) strongly modulates the seasonality of the surface fluxes across the ARB and at least 34% of the Amazonian Forest is supported by groundwater during the dry season. A two-month lag between the seasonal peak of evapotranspiration (ET) and river discharge is a key mechanism that potentially prevents the rainforest from tipping into savanna. The dry season in the ARB is getting drier and the wet season is getting wetter, pointing to an accelerating hydrologic cycle. The ARB is dominantly energy limited, however, our results imply that in the absence of groundwater support, and with less than similar to 125 mm/month of precipitation, the basin could have become water-limited over some regions. The long-term basin-averaged ET-dominated by transpiration-changed with a split pattern of +/- 9% in the past three decades. Similarly, water table depth (+/- 19%) and runoff (+/- 29%) changed with heterogenous patterns across the ARB. Further, the contribution of canopy interception loss and ground evaporation changed heterogeneously across the ARB in response to deforestation. River discharge did not change substantially due to the crucial buffering role of groundwater, but terrestrial water storage (TWS) decreased (increased) in the 2000s (2010s) compared to that in the 1990s. Although groundwater is the dominant contributor to total TWS, the dynamics of TWS over the major river channels are controlled by flood water, given relatively shallow groundwater. This study provides crucial insights on the dominant hydrological processes in the ARB to inform forest management practices.

TI  - A review of the freshwater diversity in the Okavango Delta and Lake Ngami (Botswana): taxonomic composition, ecology, comparison with similar systems and conservation status
T2  - AQUATIC SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Freshwater organisms in the Okavango Delta and Lake Ngami (Botswana) provide direct and indirect benefits to people and the economy of the region. However, their existence could be potentially threatened by human activities (primarily, upstream water abstraction and planned hydropower structures) coupled with climate change. For their protection, it is essential to know their distribution, ecology, and status of the ecosystems that they inhabit. Publications that record taxa from the Delta at species level are scarce, particularly aquatic macroinvertebrates. Identifying organisms to species level can provide more accurate information for environmental monitoring and conservation programmes but requires significant training and expertise. Here, we present a comprehensive taxonomical review of 2204 freshwater species from the Okavango Delta and Lake Ngami, with additional 355 species found in other areas of Botswana that are likely to be present in the study region. We also compare the diversity of the Okavango Delta and Lake Ngami with two other tropical wetlands: the Pantanal (Brazil) and the Kakadu Region (Australia). We show that biodiversity in the Okavango Delta and Lake Ngami is higher than in previous estimates, with recorded species richness dominated by phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates. Most species are widespread across the system and southern Africa. The resulting database includes new records (Bryozoa, Porifera), information on species conservation status, habitat, ecology, distribution in continental Africa, site details and taxonomical notes. This will be an essential resource for researchers, conservation managers, policy makers and consultants investigating freshwater biodiversity in tropical wetlands in the region.

TI  - Indonesian Forest and Land Fire Prevention Patrol System
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - (1) Background: The management of forest and land fires has become of concern to the Indonesian government, as demonstrated by the issuing of the Presidential Instruction of the Republic of Indonesia Number 11 of 2015, then replaced by Number 3 of 2020, concerning Forest and Land Fire Management. In 2002, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MoEF) established Manggala Agni, a forest fire management organization, at the central government level. This study aims to explain the development of the Indonesian Forest and Land Fire Prevention Patrol System. The system development was conducted by the Computer Science Department of IPB University, in collaboration with the Agency for Climate Change and Forest and Land Fire Management, as well as the Directorate of Forest and Land Fire Management, MoEF. (2) Methods: The system development adopted the steps in the prototyping method, namely communication, quick planning, rapid design modeling, and prototype construction, as well as dissemination, submission, and feedback. (3) Results: The web-based system for the real-time monitoring and analysis of the forest and land fire prevention patrol is integrated into a mobile application for recording field observations during patrol activities. The system testing was successfully conducted by involving the users. The test results show that all features in the system are working correctly and meet the user's requirements. The mobile application has saved 36.02% of the time for recording the patrol data and 40.32% for creating the patrol reports. In addition, using the web-based application has saved time in preparing the patrol reports by 56.48%.

TI  - Biomass Equations and Carbon Stock Estimates for the Southeastern Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests play an important role in mitigating global climate change, emphasizing the need for reliable estimates of forest carbon stocks at regional and global scales. This is essential for effective carbon management, which involves strategies like emission reduction and enhanced carbon sequestration through forest restoration and conservation. However, reliable sample-based estimations of forest carbon stocks require accurate allometric equations, which are lacking for the rainforests of the Atlantic Forest Domain (AFD). In this study, we fitted biomass equations for the three main AFD forest types and accurately estimated the amount of carbon stored in their above-ground biomass (AGB) in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. Using non-destructive methods, we measured the total wood volume and wood density of 172 trees from the most abundant species in the main remnants of rainforest, semideciduous forest, and restinga forest in the state. The biomass and carbon stocks were estimated with tree-level data from 185 plots obtained in the National Forest Inventory conducted in Rio de Janeiro. Our locally developed allometric equations estimated the state's biomass stocks at 70.8 +/- 5.4 Mg ha-1 and carbon stocks at 35.4 +/- 2.7 Mg ha-1. Notably, our estimates were more accurate than those obtained using a widely applied pantropical allometric equation from the literature, which tended to overestimate biomass and carbon stocks. These findings can be used for establishing a baseline for monitoring carbon stocks in the Atlantic Forest, especially in the context of the growing voluntary carbon market, which demands more consistent and accurate carbon stock estimations.

TI  - Forest carbon stocks and fluxes in physiographic zones of India.
T2  - Carbon balance and management
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reducing carbon Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) is of central importance to combat climate change. Foremost among the challenges is quantifying nation's carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation, which requires information on forest carbon storage. Here we estimated carbon storage in India's forest biomass for the years 2003, 2005 and 2007 and the net flux caused by deforestation and degradation, between two assessment periods i.e., Assessment Period first (ASP I), 2003-2005 and Assessment Period second (ASP II), 2005-2007.RESULTS: The total estimated carbon stock in India's forest biomass varied from 3325 to 3161 Mt during the years 2003 to 2007 respectively. There was a net flux of 372 Mt of CO2 in ASP I and 288 Mt of CO2 in ASP II, with an annual emission of 186 and 114 Mt of CO2 respectively. The carbon stock in India's forest biomass decreased continuously from 2003 onwards, despite slight increase in forest cover. The rate of carbon loss from the forest biomass in ASP II has dropped by 38.27% compared to ASP I.CONCLUSION: With the Copenhagen Accord, India along with other BASIC countries China, Brazil and South Africa is voluntarily going to cut emissions. India will voluntary reduce the emission intensity of its GDP by 20-25% by 2020 in comparison to 2005 level, activities like REDD+ can provide a relatively cost-effective way of offsetting emissions, either by increasing the removals of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by afforestation programmes, managing forests, or by reducing emissions through deforestation and degradation.

TI  - Low predictability in aboveground biomass accumulation in Brazilian semi-deciduous seasonal Atlantic Forest restoration sites
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There are high expectations about the role of active reforestation in mitigating climate change, by means of carbon sequestration and storage, fueling the carbon credit market. Carbon credits are calculated in advance based on the number of planted trees or, at best, the expected size and wood density of planted trees. However, the contribution of tropical reforestations with native species for carbon sequestration in the long term is still unclear, since most sites being monitored are less than 20 years old, thus limiting the ability to make forecasts of what is a dynamic, multifactor restoration outcome. We used a chronosequence to analyze aboveground biomass (AGB) accumulation in 30 Brazilian semi-deciduous seasonal Atlantic Forest restoration sites sharing the same climate, soil type, and restoration technique. We evaluated the entire age range of 1-19 years, and three age intervals, 1-3 years, 4-8 years, and over 9 years. AGB, basal area, and tree density increased considering all ages (1-19 years). Our results showed, however, that the AGB, tree density, and basal area can increase linearly from 1 to 3 years but present no significant trend after 4 years. Adjusted model r(2) values decreased with time, suggesting that the controlled effects of active restoration are quickly replaced by other natural, uncontrolled, and, to some extent, unknown factors. Although continued efforts are needed to make more realistic predictions of long-term carbon stocks based on tree planting, high levels of biomass estimates for time intervals as short as 20 years may never be achieved.

TI  - Globally significant changes in biological processes of the Amazon Basin: results of the Large-scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon River, its huge basin, and the changes in biological processes that are rapidly occurring in this region are unquestionably of global significance. Hence, Global Change Biology is delighted to host a special thematic issue devoted to the Large-scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA), which is a multinational, interdisciplinary research program led by Brazil. The goal of LBA is no less modest than its subject: to understand how Amazonia functions as a regional entity in the Earth system and how these functions are changing as a result of ongoing changes in land use. This compilation of 26 papers resulting from LBA-related research covers a broad range of topics: forest stocks of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N); fluxes of greenhouse gases and volatile organic compounds from vegetation, soils and wetlands; mapping and modeling land-use change, fire risk, and soil properties; measuring changes caused by logging, pasturing and cultivating; and new research approaches in meteorology to estimate nocturnal fluxes of C from forests and pastures. Some important new synthesis can be derived from these and other studies. The aboveground biomass of intact Amazonian forests appears to be a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), while the wetlands and soils are a net source of atmospheric methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), respectively. Land-use change has, so far, had only a minor effect on basin-wide emissions of CH4 and N2O, but the net effect of deforestation and reforestation appears to be a significant net release of CO2 to the atmosphere. The sum of the 100-year global warming potentials (GWP) of these annual sources and sinks of CH4, N2O, and CO2 indicate that the Amazonian forest-river system currently may be nearly balanced in terms of the net GWP of these biogenic atmospheric gases. Of course, large uncertainties remain for these estimates, but the papers published here demonstrate tremendous progress, and also large remaining hurdles, in narrowing these uncertainties in our understanding of how Amazonia functions as a regional entity in the Earth system.

TI  - Converting Forests to Farms: The Economic Benefits of Clearing Forests in Agricultural Settlements in the Amazon
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural expansion into tropical forests is believed to bring local economic benefits at the expense of global environmental costs. The resulting tension is reflected in Brazilian government policy. The national agrarian reform program has settled farm families in the Amazon region since the 1970s, with the expectation that they will clear forests in order to farm the land. On the other hand, recent Brazilian policy initiatives seek to reduce deforestation to mitigate climate change. We contribute to the policy debate that surrounds these dual goals for the Amazon by estimating the marginal effects of new agricultural land on the full income and assets of farm settlers over a 13-year period from 1996 to 2009. Using micro panel data from agrarian settlements where forest was being rapidly cleared, and controlling for factors that would otherwise confound the relationship, we estimate the effect of converting forest to agriculture on total household income to estimate the opportunity cost of conserving forest. Our measure of income reflects any re-allocation of resources by utility maximizing households and any productivity effects due to loss of forest ecosystem services. The estimated effect of new agricultural land on income is positive, but small relative to the income per hectare of previously cleared land. However, we show that income increases investment in physical assets, which raises households' income generating capacity and future accumulation of assets. Thus, while there is only a small immediate income gain from clearing more forest, the long-term effects on wealth are still substantial. This demonstrates that given the right conditions, conversion of forest to agricultural land can be an impetus for asset accumulation by smallholders. It also highlights the importance of considering the indirect and long-term welfare benefits of new agricultural land when assessing the opportunity costs of forest conservation.

TI  - ANTECEDENTS OF URBAN TREES TO WALKABILITY: AN EXPLORATORY STUDY IN BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA DE GESTAO AMBIENTAL E SUSTENTABILIDADE-GEAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: This study investigates if living in a household surrounded by trees stimulates walking in the Brazilian context. We searched for the correlation between the Tree Cover Index (TCI) surrounding the participant ' s household and the weekly walking trips undertaken. Also, we analyzed the correlation between the participant ' s perception of neighborhood walkability and TCI in five dimensions: Walking facilities, crime safety, pedestrian/traffic safety, street connectivity, and access to services. Methodology: Nine neighborhoods were selected; 3042 participants responded to a face-to-face questionnaire, "Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale" (NEWS). Geoprocessing tools calculated individualized environment characteristics for each participant ' s household surroundings. Originality/Relevance: Promoting active urban mobility reduces greenhouse gas emissions in the cities, which in turn contributes to climate change mitigation effects. A forested city may create a more walkable environment, an association that lacks empirical evidence in South America. Main Results: The results indicate that the socio-economic characteristics of the neighborhood exert a significant influence on TCI predictions on the perception of Walkability. Notably, the presence of trees made participants living in formal neighborhoods perceive their environment as safer against crime. Also, higher levels of TCI decrease the perception of services available in low- and high-income neighborhoods due to the more inaccessible green areas. Contributions: Ultimately, it is pertinent that urban planning agencies recognize the contribution of trees to the quality of life in general, extending the concept of "urban afforestation" to contemplate the social and economic

T2  - AGRIVITA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to determine bamboo agroforestry system in maintaining sustainability of privately owned forest and contribution of bamboo community forests to the farmers' economy. Research on the composition of privately owned forest species was carried out using a survey method. There were 37 observation plots evenly distributed in the study location villages. Land cover image data obtained from Sentinel-2 Imagery were compared based on land-cover classification. Thirty respondents were interviewed to obtain social and economic data. Data related to the pattern and composition of species diversity of privately owned forest were displayed in an ordinal space and processed by employing Non-metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling analysis. Data from interviews were analyzed using descriptive methods which were presented in the form of tables and graphs. Results showed that privately owned forest were able to increase tree vegetation cover in Ciamis Regency by 3.367%. The bamboo privately owned forest was composed of wood and bamboo, fruit plants, plantation crops, horticulture, and food plants. Privately owned forest contribute 24.49% to farmers' income with coffee as the main commodity. Bamboo has contributed 15.42% of the income from privately owned forest. Farmers will keep maintaining bamboo trees because they have provided economic, social, and environmental benefits.

TI  - Relationships between soil nutrient status and nutrient-related leaf traits in Brazilian cerrado and seasonal forest communities
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims In Brazil, cerrado and seasonal forest occur in close proximity but on soils with very different chemistry and texture. We aimed to compare species from these two vegetation types in terms of leaf N and P concentrations (of green and senesced leaves) and proportional nutrient resorption, quantifying the relationships among these traits, with other key leaf traits, and with soil properties. Methods We collected topsoil at 100 25 m(2) sample plots in south-eastern Brazil and measured leaf traits of 89 woody species occurring therein, expressing them as community-weighted means. Soil nutrient status was indexed using eight standard variables. Results In terms of properties such as pH, clay content, and cation exchange capacity, cerrado soils were deemed as being less "fertile" than forest soils, yet cerrado and forest sites did not differ in soil total N or available P (which themselves were negatively correlated). On average, forest species showed higher proportional P resorption but lower N resorption. Leaves with higher nutrient concentrations were less scleromorphic. Conclusion In Brazilian cerrado and forests, variation in green-and senesced-leaf nutrients was better aligned with generalised measures of soil fertility than with total N or available P and showed far more clear patterns than nutrient resorption efficiencies.

TI  - Social life cycle assessment of non-timber forest products in Indonesia: The case of Gum Rosin
T2  - SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Gum rosin, a distillation product of pine sap with turpentine as a co-product, is a significant non-timber forest product (NTFP) in Indonesia. This study evaluated the social sustainability of gum rosin production across four factories in Central Java during a three-year period of 2020-2022 through a Social Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA). The study focused on social performance and identifying social hotspots using the Subcategory Assessment Method (SAM) based on basic requirements. Data collection involved reviews of documents, reports, and records of the organization with triangulation interviews and surveys of other stakeholders to validate data in the inventory analysis. The results indicated that all factories met the basic requirements in the majority of subcategories for all stakeholder groups involved. Each stakeholder group had specific subcategories requiring improvement, such as "working hours," "fair wages," and "health and safety" for forestry workers; "access to material resources" for local communities; "promoting social responsibility" for value chain actors; and "transparency" for consumers. These areas were found to not meet basic standards and need specific improvements. These findings are intended to support the government, as the industry's sole shareholder, in developing strategies for its future growth while recognizing the potential of pine sap to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. While this study focuses on industry activities, future research should expand its scope to include the broader social impacts of sustainable forest management more comprehensively.

TI  - Cropland expansion as a driver of land-use change: the case of Cerrado-Caatinga transition zone in Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In Brazil, forest conservation policies have centered primarily on the Amazon rainforest, given its significance to the actual discussion on climate change. Until 2018, and under a period of rigorous macroeconomic conditions, Brazil had successfully decreased Amazon's deforestation by strengthening national environmental policies. On the other hand, in 2015, the Brazilian government had institutionalized the Matopiba region, placed in the northeast of the Cerrado biome. In the present study, we used linear and spatial regression models to evaluate determinant factors of land-use change in the southwest region of Piaui, Brazil, placed among Cerrado and Caatinga biomes. We considered determinant factors: distribution and proportions of deforestation and significant temporary agricultural products. Our results show that the natural vegetation represented 69.68% of the total area in 2016. The distance to roads variable does not play a substantive function in defining the deforestation patterns (Coef. = - 0.03). We found that variables as distance to ports, large proprieties size, and land price significantly impact land-use transition models. Also, the study shows that protected areas have reduced the probability of deforestation in the region (Coef. = - 0.22).

TI  - Sustainable development of carbon sinks? Lessons from three types of peatland partnerships in Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatland conversion for agriculture is the leading cause of Indonesia's terrestrial carbon emissions that contribute substantially to global warming. Indonesia's peatlands contain 55-57 billion tonnes of carbon, the equivalent of almost 2 years of global carbon emissions at existing rates. This paper examines initiatives to retain soil-based carbon in Indonesia's province of Riau, where over half the surface area is composed of agriculturally productive peatlands. We qualitatively evaluate three types of partnership programmes (bilateral, co-governed and internationally funded local initiatives) in Riau aimed at the sustainable development of peatlands. The article finds that carbon loss is likely to persist in all case studies. Public, private and civil society actors in each partnership have exploited funding and political opportunities to advance agendas not directly related to the environment. The administrative category of the peatland hydrological unit as an ecologically meaningful scale of peatland governance is also under-utilised by the partnerships studied.

TI  - National forest cover change in Congo Basin: deforestation, reforestation, degradation and regeneration for the years 1990, 2000 and 2005
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This research refers to an object-based automatic method combined with a national expert validation to produce regional and national forest cover change statistics over Congo Basin. A total of 547 sampling sites systematically distributed over the whole humid forest domain are required to cover the six Central African countries containing tropical moist forest. High resolution imagery is used to accurately estimate not only deforestation and reforestation but also degradation and regeneration. The overall method consists of four steps: (i) image automatic preprocessing and preinterpretation, (ii) interpretation by national expert, (iii) statistic computation and (iv) accuracy assessment. The annual rate of net deforestation in Congo Basin is estimated to 0.09% between 1990 and 2000 and of net degradation to 0.05%. Between 2000 and 2005, this unique exercise estimates annual net deforestation to 0.17% and annual net degradation to 0.09%. An accuracy assessment reveals that 92.7% of tree cover (TC) classes agree with independent expert interpretation. In the discussion, we underline the direct causes and the drivers of deforestation. Population density, small-scale agriculture, fuelwood collection and forest's accessibility are closely linked to deforestation, whereas timber extraction has no major impact on the reduction in the canopy cover. The analysis also shows the efficiency of protected areas to reduce deforestation. These results are expected to contribute to the discussion on the reduction in CO2 emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) and serve as reference for the period.

TI  - Land use and land cover scenarios: An interdisciplinary approach integrating local conditions and the global shared socioeconomic pathways
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes have profound impacts on the functioning of (agro)ecosystems and have potential to mitigate global climate change. However, we still lack interdisciplinary methods to project future LULC scenarios at spatial scales that are relevant for local decision making and future environmental assessments. Here we apply an interdisciplinary approach to develop spatially explicit projections of LULC at a resolution of 30 x 30 m informed by historic relationships between LULC and their key drivers, within the context of the four qualitative scenarios of global shared socioeconomic pathways. We apply this methodology to a case study in the Zona da Mata, Brazil, which has a history of major LULC changes. The analysis of LULC changes from 1986 to 2015 indicates that pasture area decreased from 76 to 58 % of total area, while forest areas increased from 18 to 24 %, and coffee from 3 to 11 %. Environmental protection legislation, rural credit for smallholder farmers, and demand for agricultural and raw products were identified as main drivers of LULC changes. Projected LULC for 2045 strongly depends on the global socioeconomic pathway scenarios, and forest and coffee areas may increase substantially under strong government measures in the environmentally conscious Green Road scenario or decrease in the high consumption Rocky Road scenario. Our study shows that under the set of drivers during the past three decades reforestation can go hand in hand with increase of agricultural production, but that major and contrasting changes in LULC can be expected depending on the socioeconomic pathway that will be followed in the future. To guide this process, LULC scenarios at the local scale can inform the planning of local and regional development and forest conservation.

TI  - Assessment of coastal vulnerability to support mangrove restoration in the northern coast of Java, Indonesia
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The northern coast of Java has been more severely affected by sea level rise (SLR) than other islands in the Indonesian archipelago. This warrants a coastal area risk assessment to ascertain the multiple hazards that could impact on this densely populated island. Using environmental and physical variables - including geomorphology, rate of shoreline change, sea level rise, wave height, coastal slope, bathymetry, tidal range, and mangrove density - the main objective of this study is to determine a coastal vulnerability index (CVI) and mangrove vulnerability index (MVI) in the northern Javanese coastline. Assessment was carried out for three regencies - Banten, Demak, and Banyuwangi regency - with the goal of helping to identify areas where mangrove restoration efforts can be prioritized. Using line and 1 x 1 km2 grid representation of the entire coastline, the research found that in terms of CVI, Demak coast is most vulnerable (with 82% of grids and 89% of coastline falling into the highly vulnerable categories), Banten coast ranked as moderately vulnerable (43% of grids and 35% of coastline fall into the moderately vulnerable categories), while 91% of grids and 93% of coastline in Banyuwangi fall into the least vulnerable category. Assessment of mangrove vulnerability revealed that Banten and Banyuwangi regency were low vulnerability as respectively, 100% and 94% of grids fell into this category, while Demak coast was highly vulnerable (with 46% of grids falling into highly vulnerable categories). This vulnerability mapping provides useful information to assist planners and managers to deploy resources for mangrove restoration and the long-term sustainable management of these coastal ecosystems.

TI  - Fire management and climate variability: Challenges in designing environmental regulations
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Designing fire management regulations is a challenging task given the spatial and temporal variation of climate conditions. Using the burning calendar, a fire management tool to prevent forest fires in Mexico, we assessed the temporal and spatial overlap between this regulation, climate variability and fire use in Calakmul, Mexico. Based on technical recommendations and fieldwork, we defined ranges of wind speed, relative humidity and rainfall that are needed for burning. We studied how these conditions varied over periods of 10 to 50+ years based on meteorological records in 5 locations. Participant observation of agricultural burns and interviews with community leaders and government officials allowed us to study the challenges of following regulations. Results indicate that during the legal time to burn, from 4 to 11 am, there is, on average, only 1 h with suitable climate conditions for agricultural fire. Farmers burn in the afternoon, when moisture is lower, increasing the chances of successful agricultural burns to 25% and up to 80% compared to morning conditions. However, in the afternoon, wind speed tends to increase, elevating the likelihood of uncontrolled secondary fires. In terms of seasonality, the period to burn is suitable for some years in some locations but it is not infallible. Environmental rules aimed at fire management must be sensitive to local climate variations in order to achieve both wildfire prevention and support livelihood systems relying on fire. Rules that do not correspond to the physical context are not only less likely to be followed, but are not legitimate to actors whose behaviors are intended to be regulated. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Forest law enforcement in the Brazilian Amazon: Costs and income effects
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite recent success in reducing forest loss in the Brazilian Amazon, additional forest conservation efforts, for example, through 'Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation' (REDD+), could significantly contribute to global climate-change mitigation. Economic incentives, such as payments for environmental services could promote conservation, but deforestation often occurs on land without crucial tenure-security prerequisites. Improving the enforcement of existing regulatory disincentives thus represents an important element of Brazil's anti-deforestation action plan. However, conservation law enforcement costs and benefits have been much less studied than for conditional payments. We develop a conceptual framework and a spatially explicit model to analyze field-based regulatory enforcement in the Brazilian Amazon. We validate our model, based on historical deforestation and enforcement mission data from 2003 to 2008. By simulating the current conservation law enforcement practice, we analyze the costs of liability establishment and legal coercion for alternative conservation targets, and evaluate corresponding income impacts. Our findings suggest that spatial patterns of both deforestation and inspection costs markedly influence enforcement patterns and their income effects. Field-based enforcement is a highly cost-effective forest conservation instrument from a regulator's point of view, but comes at high opportunity costs for land users. Payments for environmental services could compensate costs, but will increase budget outlays vis-A-vis a command-and-control dominated strategy. Both legal and institutional challenges have to be overcome to make conservation payments work at a larger scale. Decision-makers may have to innovatively combine incentive and disincentive-based policy instruments in order to make tropical forest conservation both financially viable and socially compatible.

TI  - Co-occurring tree species show contrasting sensitivity to ENSO-related droughts in planted dipterocarp forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the diversity in sensitivity to drought of moist tropical forest tree species. Yearly tree growth records collected over a ten-year period in two one-hectare 70-year-old damar agroforest plots in Sumatra are analysed. These agroforests are mixed tree plantations, dominated by Shorea javanica K. & V., a dipterocarp tree cultivated and tapped for its commercially valuable resin (damar). Many indigenous fruit tree species grow in these agroforests, as well as timber tree species originating from the nearby natural forest. During the census period the multi-species stands were subjected to three El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related droughts (1994, 1997 and 2002). At the tree community level, these droughts were associated with a marked decrease in radial stem growth. Multilevel modelling was used to explore the relative contribution of species, tree size and individual tree characteristics to the observed response to drought.All tree species appeared to be sensitive to drought but the amplitude of the response varied significantly across species. Predicted species mean decrease in stem radial growth rate on drought years (i.e. years with 6 months with less than 50 mm/month rainfall) ranged from less than 5% to more than 80%. Shared species were ranked consistently between plots indicating that the results were robust. Stem diameter significantly affected tree sensitivity to drought in two species only, but in opposite ways: in S. javanica, larger trees appeared to be less sensitive while the opposite was true for Lansium domesticum, an abundant fruit tree. Individual tree sensitivity to drought contributed significantly albeit to a small extent to the overall response to drought. This individual tree effect did not show any pattern of spatial correlation and hence could not be related to topographic features. It is likely to reflect the individual's unique history and genotype. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Managing forest plantation landscapes for water conservation
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest ecosystems play an important role in water conservation yet forest plantations are considered detrimental because of their high water use. The current worldwide trends of reduction in natural forest and expansion of forest plantations increases the need for forest managers to contribute to water conservation, implementing management plans that integrate economic (productivity and growth), social (equity of access to water and land-use conflicts) and environmental (climate change and biodiversity impacts) factors. In this paper, we show examples of forest management alternatives at macro- and meso-scales that could contribute to improve water conservation in forest plantation landscapes. At the macroscale, we assess water use in different forest plantation areas in Brazil by analyzing the theoretical thresholds for the management of evapotranspiration. Then, using data from an experimental catchment, we modeled water yield reduction by a forest plantation over multiple years and assessed how different meso-scale forest plantation management alternatives affected water flow regulation. Results show that at a macroscale it is important to consider the natural climatic constraints of water availability. Evidence shows that forest plantations in the tropics use water according to its availability, and the appropriate choice of species/varieties and associated forest management options are crucial for water conservation. At the meso-scale we found that the proportion of native forest plays an important role in the reduction and regulation of water use, and therefore a system of mosaic management may be able to stabilize water flow across plantation landscapes.

TI  - Global and regional importance of the tropical peatland carbon pool
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Accurate inventory of tropical peatland is important in order to (a) determine the magnitude of the carbon pool; (b) estimate the scale of transfers of peat-derived greenhouse gases to the atmosphere resulting from land use change; and (c) support carbon emissions reduction policies. We review available information on tropical peatland area and thickness and calculate peat volume and carbon content in order to determine their best estimates and ranges of variation. Our best estimate of tropical peatland area is 441 025 km2 (similar to 11% of global peatland area) of which 247 778 km2 (56%) is in Southeast Asia. We estimate the volume of tropical peat to be 1758 Gm3 (similar to 18-25% of global peat volume) with 1359 Gm3 in Southeast Asia (77% of all tropical peat). This new assessment reveals a larger tropical peatland carbon pool than previous estimates, with a best estimate of 88.6 Gt (range 81.7-91.9 Gt) equal to 15-19% of the global peat carbon pool. Of this, 68.5 Gt (77%) is in Southeast Asia, equal to 11-14% of global peat carbon. A single country, Indonesia, has the largest share of tropical peat carbon (57.4 Gt, 65%), followed by Malaysia (9.1 Gt, 10%). These data are used to provide revised estimates for Indonesian and Malaysian forest soil carbon pools of 77 and 15 Gt, respectively, and total forest carbon pools (biomass plus soil) of 97 and 19 Gt. Peat carbon contributes 60% to the total forest soil carbon pool in Malaysia and 74% in Indonesia. These results emphasize the prominent global and regional roles played by the tropical peat carbon pool and the importance of including this pool in national and regional assessments of terrestrial carbon stocks and the prediction of peat-derived greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Mapping aboveground biomass in Indonesian lowland forests using GEDI and hierarchical models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne lidar (light detection and ranging) instruments such as the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) provide a unique opportunity for global forest inventory by generating broad-scale measurements sensitive to the vertical arrangement of plant matter as a supplement to in situ measurements. Lidar measurables are not directly relatable to most physical attributes of interest, including biomass, and therefore must be related through statistical models. Further, GEDI observations are not spatially complete, necessitating methods to convert the incomplete samples to predictions of area averages/totals. Such methods can face challenges in equatorial and persistently cloudy areas, such as Indonesia, where the density of quality observations is diminished. We developed and implemented a hierarchical model to produce gap-free maps of aboveground biomass density (AGBD) at various resolutions within the lowlands of Jambi province, Indonesia. A biomass model was trained between local field plots and a metric from GEDI waveforms simulated with coincident airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. After selecting a locally suitable ground-finding algorithm setting, we trained an error model depicting the discrepancies between the simulated and GEDI-observed waveforms. Finally, a geostatistical model was used to model the spatial distribution of the on-orbit GEDI observations. These three models were nested into a single hierarchical model, relating the spatial distribution of GEDI observations to field-measured AGBD. The model allows spatially complete predictions at arbitrary resolutions while accounting for uncertainties at each stage of the relationship. The model uncertainties were low relative to the predicted biomass, with a median relative standard deviation of 8% at the 1 km resolution and 26% at the 100 m resolution. The spatially consistent information on AGBD provided by our model is beneficial in support of sustainable forest management, carbon sequestration initiatives and the mitigation of climate change. This is particularly relevant in a dynamic tropical landscape like Jambi, Indonesia in order to understand the impacts of land-use transformations from forests to cash crops like oil palm and rubber. More generally, we advocate for the use of hierarchical models as a framework to account for multiple stages of relationships between field and sensor data and to provide reliable uncertainty audits for final predictions.

TI  - Implications of local peoples' preferences in terms of income source and land use for Indonesia's national REDD-plus policy: evidence in East Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This article tries to reveal the field reality in East Kalimantan, especially the preferences of villagers in terms of income source and land use, to ascertain the implications for Indonesia's national REDD-plus policy or one of the emerging regimes under UNFCCC. In forest lands, the villagers have no expectations for labour opportunities involving logging and planting trees in concession areas. In non-forest lands, villagers want to continue practicing swidden agriculture, to expand traditional rubber gardens, and to develop commercialised rubber plantations. They also think that rattan gardens and orchards are important. In order to suppress competition over land used for coal mining and oil palm plantations, to ensure villagers' rights to resources, and to conserve natural resources, it is recommended that Indonesia introduce programmes to support, as REDD-plus activities, the sustainable management of remaining forest and forest-like land uses such as orchards, rattan gardens, and traditional rubber gardens. This study shows the importance of not confining one's perspective to the REDD-plus policy framework determined by the government, but rather evaluating it by checking actual conditions in the field to aid constructive discussion.

TI  - Controls on the Carbon Balance of Tropical Peatlands
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The carbon balance of tropical peatlands was investigated using measurements of gaseous fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) at several land-use types, including nondrained forest (NDF), drained forest (DF), drained regenerating forest (DRF) after clear cutting and agricultural land (AL) in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Soil greenhouse gas fluxes depended on land-use, water level (WL), microtopography, temperature and vegetation physiology, among which WL was the strongest driver. All sites were CH4 sources on an annual basis and the emissions were higher in sites providing fresh litter deposition and water logged conditions. Soil CO2 flux increased exponentially with soil temperature (T-s) even within an amplitude of 4-5 degrees C. In the NDF soil CO2 flux sharply decreased when WLs rose above -0.2 and 0.1 m for hollows and hummocks, respectively. The sharp decrease suggests that the contribution of surface soil respiration (RS) to total soil CO2 flux is large. In the DF soil CO2 flux increased as WL decreased below -0.7 m probably because the fast aerobic decomposition continued in lower peat. Such an increase in CO2 flux at low WLs was also found at the stand level of the DF. Soil CO2 flux showed diurnal variation with a peak in the daytime, which would be caused by the circadian rhythm of root respiration. Among the land-use types, annual soil CO2 flux was the largest in the DRF and the smallest in the AL. Overall, the global warming potential (GWP) of CO2 emissions in these land-use types was much larger than that of CH4 fluxes.

TI  - Can savanna burning projects deliver measurable greenhouse emissions reductions and sustainable livelihood opportunities in fire-prone settings?
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Savannas constitute the most fire-prone vegetation type on earth and are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. Most savanna fires are lit by people for a variety of livelihood applications. 'Savanna burning' is an accountable activity under the Kyoto Protocol, but only Australia, as a developed economy, accounts for emissions from this source in its national accounts. Over the past decade considerable effort has been given to developing savanna burning projects in northern Australia, combining customary indigenous (Aboriginal) approaches to landscape-scale fire management with development of scientifically robust emissions accounting methodologies. Formal acceptance by the Australian Government of that methodology, and its inclusion in Australia's developing emissions trading scheme, paves the way for Aboriginal people to commercially benefit from savanna burning projects. The paper first describes this Australian experience, and then explores options for implementing community-based savanna burning emissions reduction projects in other continental savanna settings, specifically in Namibia and Venezuela. These latter examples illustrate that savanna fire management approaches potentially have broader application for contributing to livelihood opportunities in other fire-prone savanna regions.

TI  - Improved crop productivity and soil properties under varying planting densities of Pentaclethra macrophylla Benth. and Acacia auriculiformis A. Cunn. in Congo Basin
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil fertility depletion is a major constraint to agricultural production in the Congo Basin and is aggravated by climate change. Therefore, agroforestry systems (AFS) are used to improve soil fertility and crop productivity. Indeed, Pentaclethra macrophylla and Acacia auriculiformis are among the most agroforestry species used in this basin. However, smallholders are limited in their choice of agroforestry species and the spacing. Hence, this study comparatively evaluated the effects of P. macrophylla (native) and A. auriculiformis (exotic) legume tree species on soil macronutrients and food crops' yield during four cropping seasons. To do this, a multifactor trial design was implemented in Lobilo catchment, Congo Basin, with two tree species, four tree planting densities (T-1: 2500 trees x ha(-1), T-2: 625 trees x ha(-1), T-3: 278 trees x ha(-1); and T-0: crop monoculture), and three intercrops (cassava, maize, and peanut). The results revealed that both agroforestry species did not significantly differ regarding their impact on soil macronutrients. The total nitrogen and the pH in soil have increased with the cropping seasons. With regard to the food crops, cassava and maize yield were greater under P. macrophylla than under A. auriculiformis. However, the 2500 trees x ha(-1) density negatively affected food crops' yield and did not allow food crop production after the second cropping season. To maximize the positive effects of these AFS, it is essential to plant or co-plant these two agroforestry species at 625 trees x ha(-1) density. Future research could investigate other native species and include water and light interactions.

TI  - Communities' Adaptation and Vulnerability to Climate Change: Implications for Achieving a Climate-Smart Landscape
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Rural landscapes in many parts of Indonesia are rapidly being transformed, due to the expansion of agrocommodity plantations-oil palm in particular. At the same time, communities in those landscapes face declining crop yields and ecosystem degradation as a result of both climate and non-climate factors. We assessed local perceptions on climate stressors, adaptation and vulnerability using focus group discussions in Ketapang, West Kalimantan. We found that the main perceived climatic stressors were extreme and unpredictable seasons, fires, and saltwater intrusion, affecting ecosystem services and agricultural production. Land clearing and forest loss were mentioned as exacerbating non-climatic stressors. Respondents indicated willingness to adapt to these changes by investing in long-term measures, such as tree-planting. To adapt to yield declines, respondents indicated that many farmers shifted from rubber to oil palm. Such adaptation actions benefit households in the short term but may be at odds with long-term adaptation objectives at the landscape level. Finally, we found that perceptions about vulnerability differed between landscapes, and between communities at the landscape level and stakeholders at the district level. This stresses the importance of participatory and inclusive planning and multi-stakeholder processes towards context-based climate action planning to accommodate the differences in contexts and scale, and to reconcile the differences in perceptions.

TI  - Tropical Forest Landscape Restoration in Indonesia: A Review
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia has the second-largest biodiversity of any country in the world. Deforestation and forest degradation have caused a range of environmental issues, including habitat degradation and loss of biodiversity, deterioration of water quality and quantity, air pollution, and increased greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. Forest restoration at the landscape level has been conducted to balance ecological integrity and human well-being. Forest restoration efforts are also aimed at reducing CO2 emissions and are closely related to Indonesia's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) from the forestry sector. The purpose of this paper is to examine the regulatory, institutional, and policy aspects of forest restoration in Indonesia, as well as the implementation of forest restoration activities in the country. The article was written using a synoptic review approach to Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR)-related articles and national experiences. Failures, success stories, and criteria and indicators for forest restoration success are all discussed. We also discuss the latest silvicultural techniques for the success of the forest restoration program. Restoration governance in Indonesia has focused on the wetland ecosystem such as peatlands and mangroves, but due to the severely degraded condition of many forests, the government has by necessity opted for active restoration involving the planting and establishment of livelihood options. The government has adapted its restoration approach from the early focus on ecological restoration to more forest landscape restoration, which recognizes that involving the local community in restoration activities is critical for the success of forest restoration.

TI  - Polycultivation and agroforestry systems impact the vegetative growth of vegetables
T2  - REVISTA DE AGRICULTURA NEOTROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was carried out with the aim of evaluating the performance of vegetable production in different agrobiodiverse cropping systems, comparing two successive agroforestry systems (SAFS) with a non-tree vegetables polyculture. The experiment was conducted in an experimental design in randomized blocks, with three treatments and four replications. The treatments consisted of two SAFS with biological diversity: one SAFS with fruit trees (SAFS-F) and another with conilon coffee (SAFS-C), in addition to the non-tree vegetables polyculture (SC-H). The results showed that, on average, the agroforestry systems had a lower performance than the non-tree vegetables polyculture. However, the vegetables submitted to the non-tree polyculture and to the agroforestry system with fruit trees had a better vegetative growth, while the vegetables cultivated in agroforestry system with coffee did not show satisfactory results in the evaluated parameters. This study contributes to the development of sustainable agricultural production technologies, seeking solutions to mitigate the effects of climate change on agriculture.

TI  - Assessing Fire Regimes in the Paraguayan Chaco: Implications for Ecological and Fire Management
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzed the fire regime in the highly diverse Paraguayan Chaco, focusing on different aspects of fire patterns, including spatial (area burned) and temporal (frequency) aspects and magnitude (severity). We focused on fire as it is a natural phenomenon that drives ecosystem change and has significant economic, ecological and social impacts of particular concern in vulnerable ecosystems. Using the K-means clustering technique, we identified four distinct fire regimes in the study region: High (H), Moderately High (MH), Moderately Low (ML) and Low (L). On the one hand, the Dry Chaco predominantly featured Low and Moderately High regimes, characterized by a low fire frequency due to arid conditions. On the other hand, the Humid Chaco was particularly affected by agricultural burning, driven by extensive livestock activity and higher biomass productivity. Finally, in the Pantanal, the variations in fire intensity were influenced by flood pulses and rainfall patterns. Our findings highlight the distinct fire regimes across the Paraguayan Chaco and detail the differences in the regimes. The study's findings are valuable for developing efficient management strategies that account for fire behaviour during agricultural burning in this poorly studied region.

TI  - Climate-Driven Projections of Future Global Wetlands Extent
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are crucial components of the Earth's system, interacting with various processes such as the hydrological cycle, energy exchanges with the atmosphere, and global nitrogen and carbon cycles. The future trajectory of wetlands is anticipated to be influenced not only by direct human activities, but also by climate change. Here we present our assessment of climate-driven global changes in wetlands extent, focusing on the main wetland complexes. We used an approach based on the Topographic Hydrological model (TOPMODEL) and soil liquid water content projections from 14 models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). Our analysis reveals a consistent decrease in wetlands extent in the Mediterranean, Central America, and northern South America, with a substantial loss of 28% in the western Amazon Basin for the end of the 21st century (2081-2100) under the SSP370 scenario. Conversely, Central Africa exhibits an increase in wetlands extent, except in the Congo Basin. Nevertheless, most of the areas studied (80%) present uncertain results, due to conflicting projections of changes between the models. Notably, we show that there is significant uncertainty among CMIP6 models regarding liquid soil water content in high latitudes. By narrowing our focus to 10 models, which seem to better represent the thawing of permafrost, we obtain a better inter-model agreement. We then find a modest declines in the overall global area (<5%), but an average loss of 13% beyond 50 degrees N. Specific areas like the Hudson Bay Lowlands experiencing a 21% decrease and the Western Siberian Lowlands a 15% decrease.

TI  - The economic impacts of the diffusion of agroforestry in Brazil
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The diffusion of agroforestry systems is among the priority actions to reduce carbon emissions in Brazil. However, the economic impacts of agroforestry are still poorly understood. We evaluate the impacts of the diffusion of agroforestry systems on the cattle herd and the total value of agricultural production in Brazil. We use panel data models with municipal-level information from the Agricultural Censuses 2006 and 2017. We check the robustness of our estimates combining several empirical strategies, including spatial panel data model and instrumental variable estimators. We also consider that agroforestry impacts may differ according to the biome and crops used in the integrated systems. Our results highlight that agroforestry systems' diffusion had positive and relevant impacts on the stocking rate (heads/pasture area). Agroforestry may have also stimulated the shift from cattle raising to other activities with higher gross added value, such as soybean. In fact, the most significant economic impacts of agroforestry occur when the diffusion of agroforestry systems is related to soybean cultivation.

AB  - The evidence that environmental imbalances pose a serious and imminent threat to the future of mankind has prompted concrete actions in the environment. However, in Brazil, the challenge is to integrate the various regulations, public policies, new opportunities, and incentive mechanisms for forest protection and restoration. This paper discusses specific forms of action in Brazilian systems of Law, Economics and Politics that can influence environmental issues. It systemically presents economic instruments and analyzes the adoption of programs of Payment for Environmental Services to encourage voluntary practices of environmental protection. We suggest a mandatory strengthening of local power to increase the effectiveness of environmental legislation. The local sphere relates more closely with the more tangible reality and, therefore, is the closest instance of political decision-making that most directly affects people's lives. It is also where the exercise of citizenship is more fruitful and where popular participation is more intense. We assume that sustainable development is unachievable without governance because it promotes common goals through collective action and requires structural changes in the dominant institutions.

TI  - Secondary forest growth deviation from chronosequence predictions in central Amazonia
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nearly all published rates of secondary forest (SF) regrowth for Amazonia are inferred from chronosequences. We examined SF regrowth on abandoned pastures over a 4-year period to determine if measured rates of forest recovery differ from chronosequence predictions. We studied the emergence, development and death of over 1300 stems in 10 SFs representing three age classes (< 1-5, 6-10 and 11-14 years old). Mean tree biomass accumulation in both the < 1-5 and 6-10 years old (4.4 and 5.7 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively) abandoned pastures was lower than predicted and deviated significantly (57% and 41%) from rates estimated from the chronosequence. The older SFs, with a mean growth rate of 9.9 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) followed the rate predicted by the chronosequence. Understocking was the primary cause of low biomass recovery rates in the youngest forests; although the youngest stands had a diameter at breast height increment three times the oldest stands, the youngest stands lacked sufficient density to cumulatively produce high biomass accumulation rates. Four years of measurement indicated that the youngest stands had developed 59% of the stems measured in the older stands during the same time period. The 6-10-year-old stands were rapidly self-thinning and approached stem density values measured in the same aged stands at the onset of the study. Mortality was high for all stands, with 54% of the original stems remaining after 4 years in intermediate-aged stands. The forests were dominated by the tree Vismia, which represented 55-66% of the biomass in all stands. The Vismia share of the biomass was decreasing over time, with other genera replacing the pioneer. Our measured rates of regrowth indicate that generalized estimates of forest regrowth through chronosequence studies will overestimate forest regrowth for the youngest forests that were under land use for longer time-periods before abandonment. Certified Emission Reductions under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto protocol should consider these results when predicting and compensating for carbon sequestered under natural forest management.

TI  - Determination of the amount of carbon stored in Indonesian peatlands
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive peatlands in Indonesia are a major store of carbon. Deforestation, conversion to other land uses, especially plantations of oil palm and pulpwood trees, and recurrent fires have recently caused the release of large amounts of this carbon to the atmosphere. If these large emissions from degrading peatlands are taken into account Indonesia is one of the largest emitters of CO2 worldwide. To improve estimates of the amount of carbon stored in Indonesian peatlands we applied 3D modelling based on the combined analysis of satellite imagery (Landsat ETM+, SRTM) and 750 in situ peat thickness measurements. We demonstrate that SRTM radar data can be used to determine the extent and topography of the dome shaped surface of a selection of peatlands in Central Kalimantan, South Sumatra and West Papua. A strong correlation was obtained between the convex peat dome surface and the underlying mineral ground, which was used to calculate the peat volume and carbon store. Conservatively, we estimate that at least 55 +/- 10 Gt of carbon are stored in Indonesia's peatlands. This amount is higher than previous results published because it takes into account the biconvex nature of the tropical peatlands. With this huge carbon storage and the current rate of degradation the tropical peatlands of Indonesia have the power to negatively influence the global climate. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Prospecting plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria in grapevines in the São Francisco Valley
T2  - REVISTA CAATINGA
M3  - Article
AB  - - Viticulture is the main agricultural production in the Sao Francisco Valley, Brazil; however, farm soil management systems require large volumes of fertilizer that could contribute to climate change. Therefore, using plant growth -promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) has been reported to reduce or replace plant input. This study aimed to evaluate the bacteria in the rhizosphere of Vitis vinifera cultivated in the Sao Francisco Valley in Pernambuco, Brazil, and to characterize the mechanisms that promote plant growth. The PGPR with the greatest biotechnological potential was identified using sequencing. The bacteria were isolated from tryptic soy agar (TSA) culture medium inoculated with 100 mu L of a serial dilution. The isolates obtained were characterized phenotypically and tested for their ability to solubilize phosphate, promote biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), and produce indole-3 acetic acid (IAA), biofilms, and antibiotic factors against Xanthomonas campestris pv. viticola. A total of 423 bacteria were obtained, of which 99 presented positive results for at least one of the growth -promotion mechanisms, representing 6.85% for phosphate solubilizers, 0.74% for BNF, 5.7% for IAA synthesizers, 11.27% for biofilm producers, and 4.01% for promoting antibiosis against X. campestris pv. viticola. Isolates 3.19 and 31.14; 3.17 and 17.04; 5.35 and 5.42; and 5.37 identified as Stenotrophomonas, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, and Clostridium, respectively, presented a biotechnological potential for future experiments to promote vine growth.

TI  - Silvopastoral management of beef cattle production for neutralizing the environmental impact of enteric methane emission
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is well recognized that commercial beef cattle production systems have a major impact on climate change, mainly due to the emission of enteric methane (CH4). The objective of this research was to evaluate if integrating animal + pasture + timber production in silvopastoral systems (SPS) would help neutralize the impact of enteric CH4 emission by facilitating carbon storage as soil organic carbon (SOC). This paper reports a study conducted in Brazil with a herd of 150 cows in 100 ha of Urochloa brizantha with Eucalyptus urograndis, on four tree configurations: SPS 1-clone GG-100 at 2 x 3 x 15 m spacing; SPS 2-clone i-144 at 2 x 3 x 15 m; SPS 3-clone GG-100 at 3 x 15 m; and SPS 4-clone i-144 at 3 x 15 m. Based on data collected through eight consecutive years, the gas balance was estimated. For all SPS treatments average, the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) of additional C stock exceeded the emissions. Considering only C sequestration from trees, the average CO(2)e sequestration was - 26.27 Mg center dot CO(2)e ha(-1), while the average emissions of CO2 e was 23.54 Mg center dot CO(2)e ha(-1) for enteric CH4 + pasture + tree, giving a net balance of - 2.73 Mg center dot CO(2)e ha(-1). The "loss" of CO(2)e analyzed was compensated by the soil C sequestration in long-lived SOC pools, enhancing the resilience of farming systems by increasing soil organic matter and soil fertility capacity, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, therefore, providing benefits in livestock production and for environmental remediation.

TI  - Land Use, Land Cover Change and Sustainable Intensification of Agriculture and Livestock in the Amazon and the Atlantic Forest in Brazil
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon and the Atlantic Forest are Brazilian biomes that suffered an intense land use and land cover change, marked by the loss of native forest and expansion of agriculture and livestock. This article aims to analyze land use and land cover change history and to propose a sustainable alternative for agriculture and livestock as an opportunity for rural development in these biomes. The statistics of the platform from the Annual Mapping Project for Land Use and Land Cover in Brazil (MapBiomas) were used in an annual historical series from 1985 to 2020. The analysis of land use and land cover changes indicates that the Amazon native forest was reduced by 44.53 million hectares (Mha), while pasture, agriculture and planted forest increased by 38.10, 6.06 and 0.26 Mha, respectively, over the 35 years (1985 to 2020). In the Atlantic Forest, for the same period, forest and pasture reduced by 0.99 and 11.53 Mha, respectively, while agriculture expanded by 8.06 Mha and planted forest by 2.99 Mha. Sustainable land use strategies, such as the Integration Crop-Livestock-Forest (ICLF), can support the increase in agricultural production while recovering and preserving the environment. Policies and programs should consider regional particularities and barriers for more significant adoption of this strategy.

TI  - Prospects for land-use sustainability on the agricultural frontier of the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Amazon frontier shows how remarkable leadership can work towards increased agricultural productivity and environmental sustainability without new greenhouse gas emissions. This is due to initiatives among various stakeholders, including national and state government and agents, farmers, consumers, funding agencies and non-governmental organizations. Change has come both from bottom-up and top-down actions of these stakeholders, providing leadership, financing and monitoring to foster environmental sustainability and agricultural growth. Goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from land-cover and land-use change in Brazil are being achieved through a multi-tiered approach that includes policies to reduce deforestation and initiatives for forest restoration, as well as increased and diversified agricultural production, intensified ranching and innovations in agricultural management. Here, we address opportunities for the Brazilian Amazon in working towards low-carbon rural development and environmentally sustainable landscapes.

TI  - The economics of restoration: looking back and leaping forward
T2  - YEAR IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Since the publication of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment in 2005 there has been a surge of interest in ecological restoration (ER) to recover biodiversity, re-establish ecosystem functioning and connectivity, and reactivate the delivery of ecosystem services. In policy spheres, there have also been repeated calls for expansion of restoration efforts. In many countries, new legislation now requires some form of restoration and/or a form of offset investment. All of this will require major increases in financial allocations toward restoration science, technology, and implementation, and much more detailed valuation techniques. The economics of restoration is a new field emerging to support these needs. Our paper here starts with an analysis of the articles and reviews published on this broad subject from 1928 to 2012, as captured in the Scopus academic search platform. Our goal is to present and summarize what has been said and done in this area to date. Next, we map out one possible way forward, illustrated by examples and based on a coherent bundle of decision parameters related to the economics of ER and, more broadly, to the restoration of natural capital. The restoration of natural capital is defined as activities that integrate investment in, and replenishment of, natural capital stocks to improve the flows of ecosystem goods and services, and the preservation of biodiversity, while enhancing all aspects of human well-being. We give special attention to system dynamic approaches and other promising tools and techniques.

TI  - Forest protection and permanence of reduced emissions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests are essential for climate change mitigation. With growing interest over the use of credits from reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) and other natural climate solutions within both voluntary and compliance carbon markets, key concerns about the long-term durability of the reductions, or their permanence, arise for countries, corporations, regulators, and policy makers. This paper seeks to analyze the longevity of emissions reductions from different policies to slow down and stop deforestation. To establish conditions of permanence, we conduct numerical analyses using a model based on a cellular automata algorithm that learns from historical deforestation patterns and other spatial features in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. First, we simulate increased law enforcement to curb deforestation at a jurisdictional scale from 2025 to 2034, followed by potential policy rollbacks from 2035 to 2050. Second, we consider alternative scenarios to avoid potentially legal deforestation coupled with reforestation. We find spatial and path dependence - a successful policy intervention may permanently change the deforestation trajectory even after potential policy reversals. Hence, permanence depends both on the probability of policy reversals and the risk of emissions overshooting. Our results are important for advancing the understanding around the unsettled debate on the permanence of avoided emissions. Further, this paper argues that as policies to prevent deforestation or reduce emissions otherwise are reversible, permanence should be understood and discussed in a probabilistic and time-dependent framework.

TI  - Reconsidering priorities for forest conservation when considering the threats of mining and armed conflict
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - Many threats to biodiversity can be predicted and are well mapped but others are uncertain in their extent, impact on biodiversity, and ability for conservation efforts to address, making them more difficult to account for in spatial conservation planning efforts, and as a result, they are often ignored. Here, we use a spatial prioritisation analysis to evaluate the consequences of considering only relatively well-mapped threats to biodiversity and compare this with planning scenarios that also account for more uncertain threats (in this case mining and armed conflict) under different management strategies. We evaluate three management strategies to address these more uncertain threats: 1. to ignore them; 2. avoid them; or 3. specifically target actions towards them, first individually and then simultaneously to assess the impact of their inclusion in spatial prioritisations. We apply our approach to the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and identify priority areas for conserving biodiversity and carbon sequestration services. We found that a strategy that avoids addressing threats of mining and armed conflict more often misses important opportunities for biodiversity conservation, compared to a strategy that targets action towards areas under threat (assuming a biodiversity benefit is possible). We found that considering mining and armed conflict threats to biodiversity independently rather than simultaneously results in 13 800-14 800 km(2) and 15 700-25 100 km(2) of potential missed conservation opportunities when undertaking threat-avoiding and threat-targeting management strategies, respectively. Our analysis emphasises the importance of considering all threats that can be mapped in spatial conservation prioritisation.

TI  - Soil Carbon and Nitrogen Stocks under Agrosilvopastoral Systems with Different Arrangements in a Transition Area between Cerrado and Caatinga Biomes in Brazil
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Production systems that promote the accumulation of soil organic matter (SOM) must be implemented to maintain the sustainability of agriculture, livestock, and forestry. Since increases in MOS content contribute to improving the chemical, physical, and biological quality of the soil, as well as helping to reduce carbon emissions to mitigate climate change. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N) stocks after the implementation of agrosilvopastoral (ASP) systems in a Cerrado-Caatinga transition zone in Brazil. Native vegetation of Cerrado-Caatinga (NV), regenerating stratum of Cerrado-Caatinga (RS), two arrangements of ASP systems cultivating Cenchrus ciliaris L. intercropped with Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. x Eucalyptus tereticornis Sm. hybrid (ASP1 and ASP2), and intercropped with Eucalyptus urophylla S.T. Blake x Eucalyptus grandis W. Mill ex Maiden hybrid (ASP3 and ASP4) were evaluated. Soil C and N stocks and the C content in the humic fractions of SOM were evaluated at 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm soil depths. The introduction of ASP2, ASP3, and ASP4 systems in an area previously occupied by low productivity pasture increased and restored SOC stocks to levels found in NV, at a depth of 0-30 cm. N stocks were higher in ASP systems, regardless of the arrangement studied. As a result, the ASP systems provided accumulations that ranged from 1.0 to 4.31 Mg SOC ha(-1) yr(-1) and from 0.33 to 0.36 Mg N ha(-1) yr(-1). The carbon contents in humic fractions remained higher in NV. The hierarchical grouping and principal component analysis showed that the implementation of the ASP systems was efficient in increasing soil C and N stocks over time. In conclusion, the present study identified that integrated production systems can support land use intensification strategies based on sustainable and low-carbon agriculture in a transition area between the Cerrado and Caatinga biomes in Brazil.

TI  - Adaptation behavior of Bornean Orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus morio) reintroduction in Kehje Sewen Forest, East Kalimantan, Indonesia.
T2  - Biodiversitas
M3  - Article
AB  - Bornean Orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) are grouped into three subspecies, including Pongo pygmaeus morio that spreads from Sabah to the southern parts of Mahakam River in East Kalimantan. Forest conversion is the main threat to the populations and habitat of Bornean orangutans. The orangutans which have been confiscated are going through rehabilitation process and reintroduction. Efforts should be taken to seize or confiscate orangutans as much as possible and return them to their natural forest habitat. This research aimed: (i) to measure the development of rehabilitated orangutans in their post-release adaptation in native forest, especially in activity budget, diet, nesting and strata usage, in comparison to wild orangutans in the Danum Valley, (ii) to identify factors determining successful reintroduction of orangutans based on their final stage in rehabilitation process. Daily activities of four adult females of the orangutan with different types of last stage rehabilitation processes (pre-release island vs. cages) were compared during the monitoring of their behavior one year after their release in Kehje Sewen forest using focal animal sampling method. The analysis showed that diet pattern of all individuals resembled that of their wild orangutan counterparts. Meanwhile, activity pattern, strata usage, and nesting behavior was related to individual's capabilities and not determined by the type of final stage in the rehabilitation process. We assumed other factors should be considered as success factors of reintroduction.

TI  - Effects of an experimental drought on the functioning of a cacao agroforestry system, Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems may play a critical role in reducing the vulnerability of farmers' livelihood to droughts as tree-based systems provide several mechanisms that can mitigate the impacts from extreme weather events. Here, we use a replicated throughfall reduction experiment to study the drought response of a cacao/Gliricidia stand over a 13-month period. Soil water content was successfully reduced down to a soil depth of at least 2.5 m. Contrary to our expectations we measured only relatively small nonsignificant changes in cacao (-11%) and Gliricidia (-12%) sap flux densities, cacao leaf litterfall (+8%), Gliricidia leaf litterfall (-2%), soil carbon dioxide efflux (-14%), and cacao yield (-10%) during roof closure. However, cacao bean yield in roof plots was substantially lower (-45%) compared with control plots during the main harvest following the period when soil water content was lowest. This indicates that cacao bean yield was more sensitive to drought than other ecosystem functions. We found evidence in this agroforest that there is complementary use of soil water resources through vertical partitioning of water uptake between cacao and Gliricidia. This, in combination with acclimation may have helped cacao trees to cope with the induced drought. Cacao agroforests may thus play an important role as a drought-tolerant land use in those (sub-) tropical regions where the frequency and severity of droughts is projected to increase.

TI  - Estimation of Aboveground Biomass in Agroforestry Systems over Three Climatic Regions in West Africa Using Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, ALOS, and GEDI Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems (AFS) offer viable solutions for climate change because of the aboveground biomass (AGB) that is maintained by the tree component. Therefore, spatially explicit estimation of their AGB is crucial for reporting emission reduction efforts, which can be enabled using remote sensing (RS) data and methods. However, multiple factors including the spatial distributions within the AFS, their structure, their composition, and their variable extents hinder an accurate RS-assisted estimation of the AGB across AFS. The aim of this study is to (i) evaluate the potential of spaceborne optical, SAR and LiDAR data for AGB estimations in AFS and (ii) estimate the AGB of different AFS in various climatic regions. The study was carried out in three climatic regions covering Cote d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso. Two AGB reference data sources were assessed: (i) AGB estimations derived from field measurements using allometric equations and (ii) AGB predictions from the GEDI level 4A (L4A) product. Vegetation indices and texture parameters were generated from optical (Sentinel-2) and SAR data (Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2) respectively and were used as predictors. Machine learning regression models were trained and evaluated by means of the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the RMSE. It was found that the prediction error was reduced by 31.2% after the stratification based on the climatic conditions. For the AGB prediction, the combination of random forest algorithm and Sentinel-1 and -2 data returned the best score. The GEDI L4A product was applicable only in the Guineo-Congolian region, but the prediction error was approx. nine times higher than the ground truth. Moreover, the AGB level varied across AFS including cocoa (7.51 +/- 0.6 Mg ha(-1)) and rubber (7.33 +/- 0.33 Mg ha(-1)) in the Guineo-Congolian region, cashew (13.78 +/- 0.98 Mg ha(-1)) and mango (12.82 +/- 0.65 Mg ha(-1)) in the Guinean region. The AFS farms in the Sudanian region showed the highest AGB level (6.59 to 82.11 Mg ha(-1)). AGB in an AFS was mainly determined by the diameter (R-2 = 0.45), the height (R-2 = 0.13) and the tree density (R-2 = 0.10). Nevertheless, RS-based estimation of AGB remain challenging because of the spectral similarities between AFS. Therefore, spatial assessment of the prediction uncertainties should complement AGB maps in AFS.

TI  - PREDICTING OF LAND COVER CHANGES UNTIL 2030 AND ASSESSING SUSTAINABILITY STATUS IN THE MANDEH REGION, INDONESIA
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to analyze land cover dynamics and evaluate the sustainability status of marine tourism in the Mandeh region. Despite its significant tourism potential, the region faces ecological and socio-economic challenges. This research integrates land cover change analysis with sustainability assessments to provide a foundation for policy recommendations and strategic development approaches. A descriptive research approach was employed, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative data were gathered through field observations, while quantitative data were analyzed using remote sensing to assess land cover changes and sustainability status. The study applied purposive sampling for data selection and utilized supervised classification with the Maximum Likelihood method to analyze land cover changes. Additionally, the Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) method, specifically the Rapid Appraisal of the Mandeh Region (Rap-MR), was used to evaluate sustainability across economic, social, and environmental dimensions. The results indicate significant land cover transformations in the Mandeh region from 2020 to 2030. Water Bodies (WB) remain dominant but exhibit a slight decline due to sedimentation and climate change. Secondary Forest (SF) and Primary Forest (PF) are expected to decrease, mainly due to agricultural expansion and infrastructure development. Mangroves (Ms) and Mixed Gardens (MG) are also projected to shrink, reflecting conservation challenges. Conversely, Built-up Land (BuL) and Palm Plantations (PP) are anticipated to expand, driven by tourism and economic growth. Land cover classification achieved high accuracy, with an overall accuracy rate exceeding 87%. The sustainability analysis highlights economic benefits from tourism but reveals conflicts in resource utilization. The economic dimension shows a need for infrastructure investment and revenue optimization, while the social dimension emphasizes education and disaster preparedness. The environmental dimension calls for stricter conservation policies and land-use planning. In conclusion, the Mandeh region requires a balanced approach to development, integrating economic growth with environmental sustainability. Policy interventions should focus on reforestation, controlled urban expansion, and sustainable tourism management to ensure long-term ecological and socio-economic stability.

TI  - Trees modify the dynamics of soil CO2 efflux in coffee agroforestry systems
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems may help significantly reduce atmospheric carbon levels in forthcoming years through photosynthesis and regulation of soil CO2 efflux. This study aimed to characterise the soil CO2 efflux dynamics of coffee plants cultivated under agroforestry and full-sun production systems and identify the factors that regulate this process. The study was carried out in agroforestry and full-sun coffee systems on three family farms in Minas Gerais, the Atlantic Forest Biome, Brazil during three consective days on each farm. Twenty 1-m(2) sampling areas (10 for each system), each separated by a distance of 5 x 5 m and located between coffee plant rows, were selected on each farm. Soil physical and chemical attributes, air temperature and humidity, soil temperature and moisture, the percentage of canopy cover, and soil CO2 efflux were measured at each sampling area in the two systems. The air and soil temperature in the agroforestry systems were lower and soil moisture was higher than in the full-sun systems. Soil CO2 efflux showed different dynamics in the two systems. Daytime soil CO2 efflux was more stable (i.e. from morning to midday) in the agroforestry system (average 15% increase) compared to the full-sun system (average 49.1% increase). Soil CO2 efflux was regulated by labile carbon and total nitrogen variation in the agroforestry systems, and by soil temperature variation at a depth of 10 cm in the full-sun systems. A principal components analysis with data from all grouped systems showed that soil CO2 efflux was generally positively correlated with soil temperature at 5 and 10 cm depths, and negatively correlated with soil moisture. In conclusion, agroforestry systems promote microclimate stability and decrease soil CO2 efflux variability compared to full-sun systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Facilitating agroforestation of landscapes for sustainable benefits: Tradeoffs between carbon stocks and local development benefits in Indonesia according to the FALLOW model
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although Indonesia has no shortage of land area that lost its forest cover before 1990 and has become the global leader in land-use based greenhouse gas emissions, the widespread expectation that the afforestation/reforestation approach to Clean Development Mechanisms (A/R CDM) could lead to sustainable development benefits has not so far materialized. The main challenges to implementation,of the current A/R CDM mechanisms are in ( I) the definition of forest and its institutional implications, (2) the projectization that is embedded in the definition of CDM, (3) non-linear baselines related to forest transitions that complicate attribution, (4) inherent lack of synergy with other development activities and (5) high transaction costs and temporary nature of credits. In possible new international regimes that aim to include all relevant changes in land-use based emissions, a more outcome-based programmatic approach may partially replace the project cycle assessments of CDM, However, there will still be a need to assess the combination of factors and policies that can be expected to enhance terrestrial carbon storage through voluntary land-use decisions, by a combination of reduced emissions and enhanced storage. Tradeoffs usually exist between local livelihoods and carbon storage, but assessment of the opportunity costs of C sequestration requires analysis at the landscape and community scale at scenario level, including local adjustment and optimization, We explored such scenarios for a number of cases in Indonesia that range from a forest margin to a degraded lands setting. FALLOW model applications were set up for 4 landscapes in Indonesia (15-98% forest cover, 1-55% grassland, 17-51 persons km(-2)) to test the internal consistency of the hypothesis that farmer-led development of tree-based land-use systems in response to accessible markets, legal tenure arrangements, availability of reliable technical information and local investment can convert degraded forest lands at low public cost and form an attractive alternative to project-based interventions with detailed prescriptions and planning. The calculated (non-linear) baselines for carbon stocks varied from an average trend of -0.26 to +0.23 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) over a 25 year period of assessment, equivalent to a net sequestration of -0.95 to 0.84 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) The highest value for predicted additional carbon storage in the wider landscape did not coincide with the best results for local livelihoods, but in each of the case studies the results for a 'programmatic' removal of constraints to profitable smallholder tree-based production systems was more attractive than a 'prescribed' tree planting in designated project areas. These results Support the design of international modalities for an outcome-based approach to enhancing carbon storage with local flexibility in implementation. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A Chronicle of Indonesia's Forest Management: A Long Step towards Environmental Sustainability and Community Welfare
T2  - LAND
M3  - Review
AB  - Indonesia is the largest archipelagic country in the world, with 17,000 islands of varying sizes and elevations, from lowlands to very high mountains, stretching more than 5000 km eastward from Sabang in Aceh to Merauke in Papua. Although occupying only 1.3% of the world's land area, Indonesia possesses the third-largest rainforest and the second-highest level of biodiversity, with very high species diversity and endemism. However, during the last two decades, Indonesia has been known as a country with a high level of deforestation, a producer of smoke from burning forests and land, and a producer of carbon emissions. The aim of this paper is to review the environmental history and the long process of Indonesian forest management towards achieving environmental sustainability and community welfare. To do this, we analyze the milestones of Indonesian forest management history, present and future challenges, and provide strategic recommendations toward a viable Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) system. Our review showed that the history of forestry management in Indonesia has evolved through a long process, especially related to contestation over the control of natural resources and supporting policies and regulations. During the process, many efforts have been applied to reduce the deforestation rate, such as a moratorium on permitting primary natural forest and peat land, land rehabilitation and soil conservation, environmental protection, and other significant regulations. Therefore, these efforts should be maintained and improved continuously in the future due to their significant positive impacts on a variety of forest areas toward the achievement of viable SFM. Finally, we conclude that the Indonesian government has struggled to formulate sustainable forest management policies that balance economic, ecological, and social needs, among others, through developing and implementing social forestry instruments, developing and implementing human resource capacity, increasing community literacy, strengthening forest governance by eliminating ambiguity and overlapping regulations, simplification of bureaucracy, revitalization of traditional wisdom, and fair law enforcement.

TI  - Fire in Savannas and its Impact on Avifauna: Considerations for a Better Environmental Conservation.
T2  - Sociedade & Natureza
M3  - Article
AB  - Savannas are a pyrophytic biome, a biodiversity hotspot, and have global importance, occupying 20% of the Earth's surface. It is a biome that requires burning to maintain its biodiversity and pyrodiversity. It has suffered from altered fire regimes due to the direct and indirect action of factors such as deforestation, agriculture, cattle ranching, and climate change, resulting in habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation. This fact can impact the avifauna, changing population dynamics and distribution in the landscape. Thus, through a literature search, this study evaluated the influences of fire on avifauna populations in savannas. It was found that fire impacts avifauna directly or indirectly and acts positively or negatively, according to the niche of the species evaluated and its intrinsic characteristics. The observed effect will depend on the fire detection ability, locomotion capacity, species, habit, functional guild, demographic parameters, resource availability, post-disturbance successional evolution, dispersal ability, and the geographic scale of the area affected by the fire. The main impacts observed for this clade are indirect effects, and its most negatively impacted populations are the ratites and those with poor locomotion ability. Despite the many gaps in knowledge about the impact of fire on the population parameters of avifauna, studies that focus on community dynamics indicate that, in general, there are few changes in richness and abundance indices. Thus, a greater understanding of the consequences of fire on birds is necessary to support better the actions of the Integrated Fire Management Program and its expansion throughout the Brazilian territory in search of quality, dynamic, and integrated environmental management.

TI  - Assessing the sustainability of traditional agroforestry practices: a case of Mamar agroforestry in Kupang-Indonesia
T2  - FOREST AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - A traditional agroforestry of West Timor, namely Mamar, produces important ecosystem services to the people of this arid region, however, its management tends to change, thereby disrupting its sustainability. This study aims to assess the sustainability of Mamar agroforestry by analyzing the livelihood assests of the community, the biophysical land performance of the soil, and the value of ecosystem services. Furthermore, data, on perception and livelihood assets; the level of soil damage, the importance value index, and diversity index, the value of ecosystem services based on the opinion of experts and community leaders, as well as change in land use were collected in five villages in Kupang district using surveys with a qualitative and quantitative approach. The results showed a change of perspective in Mamar's management; the decrease in the important value index of cultural crops, the diversity index is classified as declining, there is soil damage in several parameters, and the value of ecosystem services does not focus on cultural services. Considering this result, there is a socio-ecological trade-off that reduces support for the sustainability of Mamar as traditional agroforestry that emphasizes socio-cultural functions.

M3  - Article
AB  - The validity of the modifications in the source code of EPIC for simulation of crop development in semiarid conditions, described in de Barros et al. [de Barros, I., Williams, J.R., Gaiser, T. Modeling soil nutrient limitations to crop production in semiarid NE of Brazil with a modified EPIC version. I - Changes in the source code of the model. Ecol. Modell., submitted for publication] was tested against the results of 3 years, field experiment with nutrient omission using intercropping between maize and cowpea. The plant biomass production, grain yield, N, P, and K uptake by both crops were measured during the period of 1998-2000 and compared with simulated values. Reasonably good agreement and accuracy was obtained between the measured and simulated values for all evaluated parameters.Slight overestimation of grain yield by the simulations was attributed to high rates of floral abortion caused by dry spells during the flowering periods of 1998 and 1999, since this factor is not considered in the model yet. Improvements of the accuracy of the model may also be obtained by more comprehensive understanding of soil resource use by component plants in mixed cropping systems. Therefore, it is necessary to generate more knowledge about the partitioning of the resources by the crops before being incorporated into modeling approaches.The model was sensitive to climate variations and changes in soil chemical properties due to the application of fertilizers and/or lime under the tropical semiarid conditions of the NE of Brazil. Once calibrated and validated for different crops and soil types of this region, the model will be appropriate as tool for regional planning. (C) 2004, Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A global analysis of strengths and weaknesses in our scientific knowledge of tropical forest restoration
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Tropical forest regions are home to ambitious large-scale restoration programs, such as Initiative 20 x 20 and AFR100. Concomitantly, much research has been done in these regions in recent decades. We performed a systematic review of scientific publications on tropical forest restoration worldwide, aiming to identify knowledge gaps and where research is concentrated. We compiled scientific articles on tropical forest restoration in English, available in Scopus, and analyzed them through time via citation counts, topic, biome, country, and authorship networks. We found 1476 articles with 38,038 citations, indicating that we have accumulated a great amount of scientific knowledge on tropical forest restoration so far, especially in the last 15 years (89% of all articles). However, publications are unequally distributed. Whereas articles were published in 71 of 120 tropical countries/territories, Brazil (376 articles), Mexico (163 articles), and Costa Rica (116 articles) accounted for 44% of publications. There was also a disparity in authorship; some countries have mostly lead authors belonging to national institutions while others have mostly foreign lead authors. Montane and dry forests were notably less studied than lowland and wet forests. The most studied topics were the technical, ecological, and biophysical aspects of restoration (83% of articles). Publication counts incompletely represent accumulated knowledge, but our results provide an indication of relative scholarship across biomes, topics, political units, and scientific leadership roles. From these, future research will be justified in moving forward in the areas of climate change, sociology, culture, and economics, and with local scientific leadership, particularly in Africa.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The Carbon and the Environmental Assets Markets are not regulated in Brazil. They are pointed out by experts and activists as sustainable alternatives of wealth generation and forest valuation. But will they be enough to make Amazonia able to experience once again a time of economic prosperity related to environmental preservation, just like in the Belle Epoque (the golden time of Amazonia, supported by the rubber extraction)? This paper intends to discuss several issues-currently ignored-about the subject, considering historical, legal, social, environmental, economic and political backgrounds. Besides those contexts, there is an assessment of the public policies, current studies on regulation, and legislative trends about the environmental issues, the Carbon and the Environmental Assets Markets. Several inconsistencies/weaknesses were found in the legal system and if they are not properly considered, they might threaten the success of those markets and/or even preclude the social and economic return for the local populations, especially from Amazonia, in a possible future regulation. Without due care, instead of becoming an alternative of environmental preservation with economic development and decrease in social and regional inequalities, they may become another example of financial conglomerates income concentration, at the expense of the region.

TI  - Remotely sensed evidence of tropical peatland conversion to oil palm
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Rising global demands for food and biofuels are driving forest clearance in the tropics. Oil-palm expansion contributes to biodiversity declines and carbon emissions in Southeast Asia. However, the magnitudes of these impacts remain largely unquantified until now. We produce a 250-m spatial resolution map of closed canopy oil-palm plantations in the lowlands of Peninsular Malaysia (2 million ha), Borneo (2.4 million ha), and Sumatra (3.9 million ha). We demonstrate that 6% (or approximate to 880,000 ha) of tropical peatlands in the region had been converted to oil-palm plantations by the early 2000s. Conversion of peatswamp forests to oil palm led to biodiversity declines of 1% in Borneo (equivalent to four species of forest-welling birds), 3.4% in Sumatra (16 species), and 12.1% in Peninsular Malaysia (46 species). This land-use change also contributed to the loss of approximate to 140 million g of aboveground biomass carbon, and annual emissions of approximate to 4.6 million Mg of belowground carbon from peat oxidation. Additionally, the loss of peatswamp forests implies the loss of carbon sequestration service through peat accumulation, which amounts to approximate to 660,000 Mg of carbon annually. By 2010, 2.3 million ha of peatswamp forests were clear-felled, and currently occur as degraded lands. Reforestation of these clearings could enhance biodiversity by up to approximate to 20%, whereas oil-palm establishment would exacerbate species losses by up to approximate to 12%. To safeguard the region's biodiversity and carbon stocks, conservation and reforestation efforts should target Central Kalimantan, Riau, and West Kalimantan, which retain three-quarters (3.9 million ha) of the remaining peatswamp forests in Southeast Asia.

TI  - Mapping peat thickness and carbon stock of a degraded peatland in West Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatlands store a large amount of carbon and act as carbon sinks, thus have crucial roles in regulating climate by preventing CO2 emission and enhancing carbon sequestration. However, the conversion of these peatlands for agricultural purposes, such as oil palm plantations, leads to carbon loss and increased CO2 emissions. To effectively protect and manage vulnerable areas, accurate mapping of peatland thickness and carbon stocks is essential, aligning with Indonesia's National Determined Contribution to climate action. This research article aims to assess the status of peatland in Agam-West Pasaman, Western Sumatra, which was cleared between 1990 and 2000 for oil palm cultivation. Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) approaches were employed to map peat thickness, carbon stock and estimate carbon loss resulting from land use change. The study area, spanning 54,000 hectares, was covered by peat-swamp forest in 1989. A grid of 2 km was used for a soil survey, resulting in 134 observation points of peat thickness, water level and subsidence. Various spatial prediction methods, including geostatistics, machine learning (ML) and their combination, were tested to map peat thickness, carbon stocks, subsidence rate and carbon loss. The covariates considered in the analysis were elevation, nearest distance from rivers and Sentinel 1a radar images. The results obtained through 10-fold cross-validations revealed that ordinary kriging exhibited the best performance, with an R-2 of 0.44 for peat thickness and 0.39 for carbon stocks. The superior performance of ordinary kriging can be attributed to the severe impact of human activities in the area, which disrupted the clear relationship between peat parameters and environmental covariates. The estimated carbon stock of the area was 107 Mt C (std. dev. 0.143 Mt), while the carbon loss since the establishment of oil palm plantations was estimated to be 19.50 Mt C (std. dev. 0.017 Mt C) based on subsidence data. These findings provide insights into the degradation of the peatland and the magnitude of carbon loss over the past three decades. This information supports informed decision-making and contributes to efforts aimed at preserving and restoring peatlands.

AB  - Over the past 20 years the combined effects of El Nino-induced droughts and land-use change have dramatically increased the frequency of fire in humid tropical forests. Despite the potential for rapid ecosystem alteration and the current prevalence of wildfire disturbance, the consequences of such fires for tropical forest biodiversity remain poorly understood. We provide a pan-tropical review of the current state of knowledge of these fires, and include data from a study in a seasonally dry terra firme forest of central Brazilian Amazonia. Overall, this study supports predictions that rates of tree mortality and changes in forest structure are strongly linked to burn severity. The potential consequences for biomass loss and carbon emissions are explored. Despite the paucity of data on faunal responses to tropical forest fires, some trends are becoming apparent; for example, large canopy frugivores and understorey insectivorous birds appear to be highly sensitive to changes in forest structure and composition during the first 3 years after fires. Finally, we appraise the management implications of fires and evaluate the viability of techniques and legislation that can be used to reduce forest flammability, prevent anthropogenic ignition sources from coming into contact with flammable forests and aid the post-fire recovery process.

TI  - Greenhouse gas concentrations in tropical wetlands of the Cross River estuary, Nigeria
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cross River estuary is a coastal wetland in the south-eastern part of the Niger Delta region of Nigeria with its hydrological cycle largely dependent on precipitation. The purpose of this study was to determine the greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in water from selected wetlands in the Cross River estuary. Water samples were collected from the Ikang, Anantigha and Adiabo wetlands and the major GHGs were analysed using a gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer. The mean concentration levels of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and sulphur oxide (SO2) were measured in the water samples for both seasons. There was a significant difference in concentrations of all the greenhouse gases in the water samples for both seasons. The exceptions were: SO2 in Adiabo, CO2 in Anantigha and N2O in Ikang, which showed insignificant differences for both seasons. The water CO2 concentrations from the Adiabo wetland recorded the largest contribution of greenhouse gas levels, ranging between 6.88 +/- 2.22 ppm and 11.02 +/- 2.52 ppm. These levels were in the range of those reported in the Congo basin. The variation in concentrations could be due to location, hydrological characteristics, nutrient load injection or the nitrification and denitrification processes of wetlands.

TI  - Hydrological suitability for mangrove species in restored mangroves in abandoned ponds
T2  - AQUATIC BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove restoration projects in Indonesia are widely conducted in abandoned aquaculture ponds, however the success of planting mangroves is limited as tidal flooding is often not considered. The hydrology of mangrove surrounding water is both complex and dynamic and creates tide-induced flow and mangrove vegetation interaction that influences hydrological suitability of mangrove species. In this study, we aimed to determine the hydrological suitability for specific mangrove species in mangrove restoration efforts in abandoned aquaculture ponds by measuring tidal inundation duration in mangrove waters. The study was undertaken in two restored mangroves sites in abandoned ponds in Perancak estuary, Bali and Lubuk Kertang, North Sumatra, which was combined with measurements of intact mangroves for comparison. Tidal flooding (inundation and current velocity) was recorded to obtain flooding period measurements (depth, duration and tidal velocity) in association with mangrove succession rates. We found that the variability of tidal flooding between study sites was found to determine dominant mangrove species, suggesting a mangrove species-specific tolerance to tidal flooding in establishing habitats. Among the species observed, Nypa fruticans was found to be the most resilient to prolonged tidal inundations. Rhizophora spp., Avicennia spp., Sonneratia alba, however, adapted to a wider range of inundation periods. The tidal inundation in restored mangrove ponds was characterized by low current velocities, which provides suitable conditions for mangrove recovery in restoration sites. This information on hydrological classification proves that the effectiveness of mangrove restoration projects can be improved by highlighting the necessity to account for localized tidal inundation regimes.

AB  - Forestry and peat land including land-based is one of the critical sectors in the inventory of CO2 emissions and mitigation efforts of climate change. The present study analyzed the land-use and land-cover changes between 2006 and 2012 in North Sumatra, Indonesia with emphasis to CO2 emissions. The land-use/land-cover consists of twenty-one classes. Redd Abacus software version 1.1.7 was used to measure carbon emission source as well as the predicted (2)carbon dioxide emissions from 2006-2024. Results showed that historical emission (2006-2012) in this province, significant increases in the intensive land use namely dry land agriculture (109.65%), paddy field (16.23%) and estate plantation (15.11%). On the other hand, land-cover for forest decreased significantly: secondary dry land forest (7.60%), secondary mangrove forest (9.03%), secondary swamp forest (33.98%), and the largest one in the mixed dry land agriculture (79.96%). The results indicated that North Sumatra province is still a CO2 emitter, and the most important driver of emissions mostly derived from agricultural lands that contributed (2)carbon dioxide emissions by 48.8%, changing from forest areas into degraded lands (classified as barren land and shrub) shared 30.6% and estate plantation of 22.4%. Mitigation actions to reduce carbon emissions was proposed such as strengthening the forest land, rehabilitation of degraded area, development and plantation forest, forest protection and forest fire control, and reforestation and conservation activity. These mitigation actions have been simulated to reduce 15% for forestry and 18% for peat land, respectively. This data is likely to contribute to the low emission development in North Sumatra.

TI  - The protective role of mangroves in safeguarding coastal populations through hazard risk reduction: A case study in northeast Brazil
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal and estuarine ecosystems such as mangroves provide coastal protection services, safeguarding coastal communities and economies. However, sea-level rise can affect mangroves' protective role by increasing expo-sure to coastal hazards and economic costs. To better understand the role of mangroves as coastal protective barriers against hazards and their importance for conservation planning in the face of sea-level rise, we first analyzed temporal changes in the coastal landscape by measuring the erosion/accretion rates on the shoreline. We assessed coastal exposure to hazards with the presence and absence of mangroves. Finally, we estimated the economic losses and costs from the long-term retreat in the shoreline and mangrove loss. This study was carried out along the western coast of the South Atlantic, in the northeast Brazilian region. Coastal exposure indices were estimated using the Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) software, and the multitemporal analysis of shoreline was developed using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) software. Finally, the economic losses produced by those shoreline changes and social costs were estimated by predicting economic losses in terms of private property and by calculating societal costs in mangrove restoration and rockfill building. The results show that nearly a third of the shoreline is experiencing erosion and the coast could lose an additional 118 ha by 2030. In terms of the value of property loss, this translates to US$38,800 and would in-crease to US$72,000 under the maximum erosion rate scenario. Based on our coastal vulnerability assessment, almost 50 km of the coastline (20%) would transition to intermediate-high exposure levels if the current dis-tribution of mangroves were to be lost. It is expected to cost about US$145 million in rockfill works and US$21 million in forest restoration to mitigate the impacts from human activities and sea-level rise on mangroves ecosystem services. At the national level, a total loss of mangroves in Brazil could mean mangrove forest restoration costs of nearly US$4000 million. More robust conservation policies are needed to conserve mangrove forests and safeguard the ecosystem-service co-benefits they provide. The latter is essential in low-and middle -income nations where the economic and welfare losses from coastal hazards are more challenging due to dependence on nature for livelihoods and well-being.

TI  - Short-term biochar effects on greenhouse gas emissions and phosphorus availability for maize
T2  - AGROSYSTEMS GEOSCIENCES & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to environmental issues, many methods of exploiting renewable natural resources are alternatives to reduce the dependence on non-renewable agricultural inputs. Phosphate fertilization on weathered tropical soil and waste reuse, for example, requires better management strategies. Thus, biochar from organic residues can be a strategy to reduce pressure on natural resources, in addition to having the potential to mitigate climate change. This study aimed to evaluate the availability of P in tropical soils from the interaction of biochar and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in the aboveground and root systems of the plant and its impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The results indicated that the addition of biochar was an alternative for C sequestration and GHG mitigation, causing no damage to the plant. The applied biochar amount had, for the most part, emission equal to or less than the control treatment (soil only). The sugarcane straw biochar (BCS) showed higher emissions, mainly in the presence of P and AMF. Biologically speaking, there was no significant effect in the presence of mycorrhizae. However, with regard to plant production, treatments where mycorrhizae were inoculated, longer and wider leaves were found. In the production of maize (Zea mays L.) plant material (aboveground and root), the upper and lower values were related to the poultry manure biochar (BPM) , and the presence of P, the values were lower, indicating that, for the good development of the plant, only the presence of the biochar is sufficient, without requiring the addition of phosphate fertilizer.

TI  - An Amazonian rainforest and its fragments as a laboratory of global change
T2  - BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - We synthesize findings from one of the world's largest and longest-running experimental investigations, the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP). Spanning an area of similar to 1000 km(2) in central Amazonia, the BDFFP was initially designed to evaluate the effects of fragment area on rainforest biodiversity and ecological processes. However, over its 38-year history to date the project has far transcended its original mission, and now focuses more broadly on landscape dynamics, forest regeneration, regional- and global-change phenomena, and their potential interactions and implications for Amazonian forest conservation. The project has yielded a wealth of insights into the ecological and environmental changes in fragmented forests. For instance, many rainforest species are naturally rare and hence are either missing entirely from many fragments or so sparsely represented as to have little chance of long-term survival. Additionally, edge effects are a prominent driver of fragment dynamics, strongly affecting forest microclimate, tree mortality, carbon storage and a diversity of fauna.Even within our controlled study area, the landscape has been highly dynamic: for example, the matrix of vegetation surrounding fragments has changed markedly over time, succeeding from large cattle pastures or forest clearcuts to secondary regrowth forest. This, in turn, has influenced the dynamics of plant and animal communities and their trajectories of change over time. In general, fauna and flora have responded differently to fragmentation: the most locally extinction-prone animal species are those that have both large area requirements and low tolerance of the modified habitats surrounding fragments, whereas the most vulnerable plants are those that respond poorly to edge effects or chronic forest disturbances, and that rely on vulnerable animals for seed dispersal or pollination.Relative to intact forests, most fragments are hyperdynamic, with unstable or fluctuating populations of species in response to a variety of external vicissitudes. Rare weather events such as droughts, windstorms and floods have had strong impacts on fragments and left lasting legacies of change. Both forest fragments and the intact forests in our study area appear to be influenced by larger-scale environmental drivers operating at regional or global scales. These drivers are apparently increasing forest productivity and have led to concerted, widespread increases in forest dynamics and plant growth, shifts in tree-community composition, and increases in liana (woody vine) abundance. Such large-scale drivers are likely to interact synergistically with habitat fragmentation, exacerbating its effects for some species and ecological phenomena. Hence, the impacts of fragmentation on Amazonian biodiversity and ecosystem processes appear to be a consequence not only of local site features but also of broader changes occurring at landscape, regional and even global scales.

TI  - Integrated water management practice in tropical peatland agriculture has low carbon emissions and subsidence rates
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological management in the use of peatland for agriculture is the backbone of its sustainability and a critical factor in climate change mitigation. This study evaluates the application of an integrated water management practice known as the "Water Management Trinity" (WMT), implemented since 1986 on a coconut plantation on the eastern coast of Sumatra, in relation to CO2 emissions and subsidence rates. The WMT integrates canals, dikes, and dams with water gates to regulate water levels for both coconut agronomy and the preservation of the peat soil. The WMT has successfully regulated and maintained an average yearly water table depth of -45 to -51 cm below the surface. The methodology involved a closed chamber method for measuring soil CO2 flux using a portable Infrared Gas Analyzer, conducted weekly over a six-month period to cover dry and rainy season at bi-modal climate condition. Subsidence measurements have been ongoing from 1986 to 2022. The results show bare peat soil has heterotrophic respiration CO2 emissions of 7.77 t C-CO2 ha- 1 yr- 1, while in coconut plantations 7.99 t C-CO2 ha- 1 yr- 1, similar to emissions in mineral soils. Autotrophic respiration leads to the overestimation of CO2 emissions on peatland and accounts for 212-424% of the total emissions. The cumulative subsidence from 1986 to 2022 is -56.3 cm, with a soil rise of +0.8 cm in 2022, indicating a flattening rate of subsidence. This is characterized by an increase in bulk density at the surface from 0.072 to 0.144 gr/cm3, with approximately 81% of the subsidence being due to compaction. The statistical analysis found no relationship between water table depth and CO2 emissions, indicating that water table depth cannot be used as a predictor for CO2 emissions. In summary, peatland agriculture has a promising future when managed sustainably using an integrated hydrological management system.

TI  - A Review of Southeast Asian Oil Palm and Its CO2Fluxes
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Palm oil production is a key industry in tropical regions, driven by the demand for affordable vegetable oil. Palm oil production has been increasing by 9% every year, mostly due to expanding biofuel markets. However, the oil palm industry has been associated with key environmental issues, such as deforestation, peatland exploitation and biomass burning that release carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, leading to climate change. This review therefore aims to discuss the characteristics of oil palm plantations and their impacts, especially CO(2)emissions in the Southeast Asian region. The tropical climate and soil in Southeast Asian countries, such as Malaysia and Indonesia, are very suitable for growing oil palm trees. However, due to the scarcity of available plantation areas deforestation occurs, especially in peat swamp areas. Total carbon losses from both biomass and peat due to the conversion of tropical virgin peat swamp forest into oil palm plantations are estimated to be around 427.2 +/- 90.7 t C ha(-1)and 17.1 +/- 3.6 t C ha(-1)year(-1), respectively. Even though measured CO(2)fluxes have shown that overall, oil palm plantation CO(2)emissions are about one to two times higher than other major crops, the ability of oil palms to absorb CO2(a net of 64 tons of CO(2)per hectare each year) and produce around 18 tons of oxygen per hectare per year is one of the main advantages of this crop. Since the oil palm industry plays a crucial role in the socio-economic development of Southeast Asian countries, sustainable and environmentally friendly practices would provide economic benefits while minimizing environmental impacts. A comprehensive review of all existing oil plantation procedures is needed to ensure that this high yielding crop has highly competitive environmental benefits.

TI  - Influence of Carbon Sequestration in an Optimal Set of Coppice Rotations for Eucalyptus Plantations
T2  - MANAGING FOREST ECOSYSTEMS: THE CHALLENGE OF CLIMATE CHANGE, 2ND EDITION
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The coppice regeneration method used to manage eucalypts leads to a simultaneous optimization problem: the manager has to simultaneously define the optimal age in each coppice rotation and the optimal number of coppice rotations for each plantation full cycle. The dynamic nature of the problem justifies the use of methods like dynamic programming in order to achieve optimal solutions. Expected land value and the duration of the optimal rotation may change significantly when payments for carbon sequestration are added as revenues in the cash flow analysis of the project. In this chapter, we analyze the effects of considering carbon sequestration as a subsidized complementary product when defining the optimal set of coppice rotations. A Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to model the inherent risk of some variables and parameters like pulpwood price, carbon price, and discount rate. The variation in the land expectation value and in the optimal rotation length is reported when these stochastic variables are computed. Two study cases are shown, one with Eucalyptus urophylla S.T. Blake in Brazil, and another with Eucalyptus globulus Labill in Galicia, Spain.

TI  - Relationships between soil organic matter pools and nitrous oxide emissions of agroecosystems in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Brazilian Cerrado, despite the increasing adoption of no-till systems, there are still extended areas under conventional soil management systems that reduce soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks and increase the emissions of greenhouse gases, such as nitrous oxide (N2O). Conservation agroecosystems, such as no-till, have been proposed as a strategy to mitigate agriculture-induced climatic changes through reductions in N2O emissions. However, the relationship between organic matter and N2O emissions from soils under different agroecosystems is not yet clear. This study hypothesized that agroecosystems under no-till promote an accumulation of labile and stable SOM fractions along with a reduction of N2O emissions. This study evaluated the effects of crop-rotation agroecosystems: i) on C and N pools and labile and stable SOM fractions; ii) on cumulative N2O emissions; and iii) on the relationships between SOM fractions and N2O emissions. The agricultural systems consisted of: (I) soybean followed by sorghum under no-tillage (NT1); (II) maize followed by pigeon pea under no-tillage (NT2); (III) soybean under conventional tillage followed by fallow soil (CT); (IV) and native Cerrado (CER). After CT for 18 years, following the replacement of CER, the soil C stock in the 0-20 cm layer was reduced by 0.64 t ha(-1) year(-1). The no-till systems were more efficient in accumulating labile and stable C fractions with values close to those observed under CER, and were directly related to lower soil N2O emissions. The cumulative pattern of N2O emissions was inverse to that of the following SOM fractions: microbial biomass carbon, permanganate-oxidizable carbon, particulate organic carbon, inert carbon, and humic substances. Based on principal component analysis, the CT was generally separated from the other land use systems. This separation was strongly influenced by the low C contents in the different SOM fractions and higher N2O emissions promoted by the CT. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Towards robust subsidence-based soil carbon emission factors for peat soils in south-east Asia, with special reference to oil palm plantations
T2  - MIRES AND PEAT
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil palm and Acacia pulpwood plantations are being established at a rapid rate on drained peatland in southeast Asia. Accurate measurements of associated carbon losses are still scarce, however, due mainly to difficulties of excluding autotrophic carbon fluxes from chamber-based flux measurements and uncertainties about the extent of waterborne losses. Here, we demonstrate a simple approach to determining total net carbon loss from subsidence records that is applicable to steady state conditions under continuous land use. We studied oil palm and Acacia plantations that had been drained for 5-19 years. Very similar subsidence rates and dry bulk density profiles were obtained, irrespective of crop type or age of the plantation, indicating that the peat profiles were in a steady state. These are conditions that allow for the deduction of net carbon loss by multiplying the rate of subsidence by the carbon density of the peat below the water table. With an average subsidence rate of 4.2 cm y(-1) and a carbon density of 0.043 g cm(-3), we arrive at a net carbon loss of similar to 18 t ha(-1) y(-1) (similar to 66 t CO2-eq ha(-1) y(-1)) for typical oil palm and Acacia plantations more than five years after drainage, without large differences between the plantation types. The proposed method enables calculation of regional or project-specific carbon loss rates to feed into mitigation schemes of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

TI  - Assessing the Sustainability of Southeast Asia's Energy Transition: A Comparative Analysis
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid economic growth in Southeast Asia has heightened concerns about its environmental sustainability, particularly in relation to CO2 emissions. Despite the growing focus on climate change mitigation, the region faces significant challenges in balancing economic development, energy transitions, and environmental conservation. Existing studies often overlook the complex interplay between these factors, leaving a critical gap in understanding how tailored strategies can address country-specific dynamics. To bridge this gap, this study introduces the "Sustainable Energy-Environment Nexus" (SEEN) framework, which integrates economic growth, energy transitions, and environmental conservation as interconnected elements necessary for achieving carbon neutrality in both the short and long run. Using data from eight Southeast Asian countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, China, South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Thailand, and Japan) over the period 1990-2023, this study employs the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach and the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) technique to analyze the relationships between CO2 emissions, GDP, financial development, forest areas, renewable energy, non-renewable energy consumption, and trade openness. The findings reveal that GDP and non-renewable energy consumption significantly drive CO2 emissions in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea. Conversely, forest areas, financial development, renewable energy, and trade openness are effective in reducing emissions in countries such as Vietnam and China. This study highlights the critical role of renewable energy adoption while addressing challenges such as inadequate infrastructure and limited technology transfer. It also identifies opportunities for regional cooperation in innovation and policy harmonization. To support sustainable energy development, tailored policy recommendations include incentivizing investments in renewable energy, enhancing technology transfer, expanding forest conservation efforts, and aligning regional renewable energy targets across ASEAN. The SEEN framework provides a robust foundation for advancing research and policy design aimed at reducing CO2 emissions and promoting environmental sustainability across Southeast Asia.

TI  - Millennial-scale variability of water supply, vegetation and fire activity on a tropical wetland in central Brazil
T2  - PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pandeiros wetland is a tropical wetland located in the ecotone between the Cerrado and the Caatinga, in central Brazil. It has a key ecological importance for vegetation biodiversity, hydrological cycles, fauna repro-duction and feeding, and for local human populations. Here, we investigate millennial-scale variability of water supply, vegetation structure and fire activity in the Pandeiros wetland during the Late Holocene and discuss forcing mechanisms that affected flooding, vegetation cover and fire regime within this fragile ecosystem. Our study is based on the previously studied pollen record of the Pandeiros palm swamp and on new charcoal an-alyses of two sediment cores that cover the last 4500 cal years, and their comparison to modern pollen and to available paleoclimatic data. Our results show that both local rainfall at the Pandeiros River basin and southern rainfall at the upper Sa & SIM;o Francisco River were important in maintaining water supply for the Pandeiros wetland during the last millennia. Our data also suggest that during Late Holocene the arboreal cover declined in the Cerrado of the Pandeiros Basin, an opposite trend to that observed in the wetter Cerrado-Atlantic Forest ecotone. We propose that increasing summer insolation in Southern Hemisphere was an important factor in maintaining low arboreal cover and open savanna vegetation on the drier areas around the Pandeiros wetland. Regarding fire activity, we suggest that until around 2600 cal yr BP, climate conditions were the most important driver of fire activity, in which drier conditions favored the intensification of fire, whereas subsequently, anthropic activities appear to have become an important fire inducer. Our findings highlight the multiple environmental aspects that have influenced the Pandeiros wetland history during the last four thousand years, including monsoon vari-ability, insolation variation and human occupation.

TI  - Adaptation to sea level rise: Learning from present examples of land subsidence
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Current climate change discourses have expressed fear that many coastal communities would be forced to relocate in the face of rising water levels. However, despite the frequency and intensity with which such messages are being broadcasted throughout the world's media, there is little actual evidence of any relocation actually taking place, even though there are a number of past examples of relative sea level rise due to earthquake induced subsidence or groundwater extraction. Thus, in order to better understand the consequences of future sea level rise the authors analysed four instances of land subsidence that have taken place in the 20th and early 21st centuries (namely, adaptation strategies around Tokyo and Jakarta, and the experience of islands on the Danajon bank in the Philippines, and Kepulauan Seribu close to Jakarta). In all cases the inhabitants of densely populated coastal areas remain in place, despite the challenge of living with higher water levels. Adaptation was done through a five-phase process, starting with the construction of rather weak seawalls, which is then followed by the placement of pumps to drain water. Eventually, as the economic and technical capacities of coastal settlements improved, better seawalls were built, which then led to the reclamation of new areas, the elevation of entire districts or the construction of super levees. Thus, while it is clear that sea level rise will pose an additional financial strain on urbanised coastal areas, the authors found no evidence that any major coastal settlements will surrender a significant portion of its land area to the sea, given the range of adaptation options available. Rather, the opposite is true, and evidence indicates that new lines of defence will be built further into the water, effectively meaning that humans will encroach on the sea.

TI  - Landscape approaches; what are the pre-conditions for success?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape approaches are widely applied in attempts to reconcile tradeoffs amongst different actors with conflicting demands on land and water resources. Key principles for landscape approaches have been endorsed by inter-governmental processes dealing with climate change mitigation and adaptation and biodiversity conservation.We review experiences from seven landscapes located in the Congo Basin, Eastern Indonesia and Northern Australia. Landscape initiatives were applied in situations where large-scale extractive industries, local peoples' livelihoods and global biodiversity objectives were in conflict. We found that common published principles for landscape approaches are not applied systematically in the areas studied. Practitioners draw upon landscape approach principles selectively and adapt them to deal with local conditions. We consider that landscape approaches do not provide silver bullet solutions to these situations nor do they provide an operational framework for large-scale land management. Landscape approaches do, however, provide an organising framework for disentangling the complexity of the landscape and facilitating the investigation of impacts of different courses of action. They enable alternative scenarios for what future landscapes might look like to be investigated and they create the space for multi-stakeholder negotiations. Outcomes from landscape scale approaches are determined by the power differentials amongst stakeholders and the existence, or otherwise, of functional institutions to take decisions and enforce agreements. Landscape approaches cannot overcome disparities in power or entrenched interests nor can they substitute for institutions with authority to establish and legitimise property and resource rights. They can, however, provide a mechanism around which civil society can be mobilised to achieve better land use outcomes. Landscape approaches are successful when they have strong leadership, sustained long-term and facilitated processes, good governance, adequate budgets and adequate metrics for assessing progress. Private sector engagement is necessary and all parties must have sufficient shared interest in outcomes to motivate their participation.

TI  - Prolonged tropical forest degradation due to compounding disturbances: Implications for CO2 and H2O fluxes
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought, fire, and windstorms can interact to degrade tropical forests and the ecosystem services they provide, but how these forests recover after catastrophic disturbance events remains relatively unknown. Here, we analyze multi-year measurements of vegetation dynamics and function (fluxes of CO2 and H2O) in forests recovering from 7 years of controlled burns, followed by wind disturbance. Located in southeast Amazonia, the experimental forest consists of three 50-ha plots burned annually, triennially, or not at all from 2004 to 2010. During the subsequent 6-year recovery period, postfire tree survivorship and biomass sharply declined, with aboveground C stocks decreasing by 70%-94% along forest edges (0-200 m into the forest) and 36%-40% in the forest interior. Vegetation regrowth in the forest understory triggered partial canopy closure (70%-80%) from 2010 to 2015. The composition and spatial distribution of grasses invading degraded forest evolved rapidly, likely because of the delayed mortality. Four years after the experimental fires ended (2014), the burned plots assimilated 36% less carbon than the Control, but net CO2 exchange and evapotranspiration (ET) had fully recovered 7 years after the experimental fires ended (2017). Carbon uptake recovery occurred largely in response to increased light-use efficiency and reduced postfire respiration, whereas increased water use associated with postfire growth of new recruits and remaining trees explained the recovery in ET. Although the effects of interacting disturbances (e.g., fires, forest fragmentation, and blowdown events) on mortality and biomass persist over many years, the rapid recovery of carbon and water fluxes can help stabilize local climate.

AB  - Carbon (C) sequestration following land restoration is an efficient measure of climate change mitigation. However, most studies including the international "4 per 1000 '' Initiative focus on topsoil C only. Here, we studied the response of deep soil C to different land restoration approaches. Samples were taken from rural sites in the Atlantic Forest Biome (Brazil), using a paired site design with triplicates of different 16-to-19-year-old restoration approaches of former arable land: reforestation, natural regeneration, and agroforestry sites. Adjacent arable land and a > 25-year-old secondary forest served as references. We determined aboveground and belowground C pools, including deep soil until 3 m depth. We did not find statistical differences among the three restoration methods for the C sequestration in the whole ecosystem. However, the C stock in the aboveground living biomass in the reforestation site was 85 +/- 15 Mg ha (-1), significantly exceeding the respective aboveground C in natural regeneration (40 +/- 13 Mg ha(-1)) and agroforestry system (25 +/- 5 Mg ha(-1)), respectively. This order, however, was reversed in soil, where reforestation caused a loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) by 27 Mg ha(- 1) below 40 cm depth, whereas SOC stocks in the agroforestry system and natural regeneration site increased by 41 and 25 Mg C/ha, respectively, compared to arable land. We thus conclude that deep soil carbon losses can negate aboveground carbon accrual after land restoration, which emphasizes the importance of including this pool in C sequestration studies.

TI  - Time bomb or gold mine? Policy, sustainability and media representations of tropical peatlands in Malaysia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatlands represent an acute site of contested development on the front line of global climate change and action. Media analysis reveals how and why these ecosystems are understood in the context of local and national discourse, and the implications of these representations for peatland policy-making. In this study, we provide an instructive account of media representations of tropical peatlands in Malaysia - a country home to 6% of the world's tropical peat by area and 12% by magnitude of the peat carbon pool. Set against an examination of the policy context for peatland media representations, we analyse how this critical ecosystem is framed in Malaysian media, and explore how these representations cast light on current sustainability-related policy and management debates. Drawing on media framing methodology, we analysed three English language newspapers (News Straits Times, The Star and Borneo Post) and one popular news website (Malaysiakini) from 1995 to 2018. From a sample of 1359 news articles, we found four dominant frames: development, conservation/protection, sustainable development and fire/haze. Within these frames, a number of key themes emerged including ecological benefits, community livelihoods, threats to peatland, integrated management approaches, and the value of peatland research. Our findings also reveal a polarising representation present across the study period - peatlands portrayed as a 'time-bomb' of ecological destruction and as a 'gold mine' in terms of their opportunities for development. We argue that contrasting interpretations of the sustainable development of peatlands may serve to obfuscate rather than facilitate current peatland policy discourses. Finally, we conclude that the fate of Malaysian peatlands hinges on recognising the localised challenges faced by peatland communities. We urge policy makers to consider food systems transformation approaches to move beyond a vision that relies entirely on drainage-based development.

TI  - Accounting for indirect land-use change in the life cycle assessment of biofuel supply chains
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE
M3  - Review
AB  - The expansion of land used for crop production causes variable direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, and other economic, social and environmental effects. We analyse the use of life cycle analysis (LCA) for estimating the carbon intensity of biofuel production from indirect land-use change (ILUC). Two approaches are critiqued: direct, attributional life cycle analysis and consequential life cycle analysis (CLCA). A proposed hybrid 'combined model' of the two approaches for ILUC analysis relies on first defining the system boundary of the resulting full LCA. Choices are then made as to the modelling methodology (economic equilibrium or cause-effect), data inputs, land area analysis, carbon stock accounting and uncertainty analysis to be included. We conclude that CLCA is applicable for estimating the historic emissions from ILUC, although improvements to the hybrid approach proposed, coupled with regular updating, are required, and uncertainly values must be adequately represented; however, the scope and the depth of the expansion of the system boundaries required for CLCA remain controversial. In addition, robust prediction, monitoring and accounting frameworks for the dynamic and highly uncertain nature of future crop yields and the effectiveness of policies to reduce deforestation and encourage afforestation remain elusive. Finally, establishing compatible and comparable accounting frameworks for ILUC between the USA, the European Union, South East Asia, Africa, Brazil and other major biofuel trading blocs is urgently needed if substantial distortions between these markets, which would reduce its application in policy outcomes, are to be avoided.

TI  - Open digital mapping as a cost-effective method for mapping peat thickness and assessing the carbon stock of tropical peatlands
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatland holds a large amount of carbon in the terrestrial ecosystem. Indonesia, responding to the global climate issues, has legislation on the protection and management of the peat ecosystem. However, this effort is hampered by the lack of fine-scale, accurate maps of peat distribution and its thickness. This paper presents an open digital mapping methodology, which utilises open data in an open-source computing environment, as a cost-effective method for mapping peat thickness and estimating carbon stock in Indonesian peatlands. The digital mapping methodology combines field observations with factors that are known to influence peat thickness distribution. These factors are represented by multi-source remotely-sensed data derived from open and freely available raster data: digital elevation models (DEM) from SRTM, geographical information, and radar images (Sentinel and ALOS PALSAR). Utilising machine-learning models from an open-source software, we derived spatial prediction functions and mapped peat thickness and its uncertainty at a grid resolution of 30 m. Peat volume can be calculated from the thickness map, and based on measurements of bulk density and carbon content, carbon stock for the area was estimated. The uncertainty of the estimates was calculated using error propagation rules. We demonstrated this approach in the eastern part of Bengkalis Island in Riau Province, covering an area around 50,000 ha. Results showed that digital mapping method can accurately predict the thickness of peat, explaining up to 98% of the variation of the data with a median relative error of 5% or an average error of 0.3 m. The accuracy of this method depends on the number of field observations. We provided an estimate of the cost and time required for map production, i.e. 2 to 4 months with a cost between $0.3 and $0.5/ha for an area of 50,000 ha. Obviously, there is a tradeoff between cost and accuracy. The advantages and limitations of the method were further discussed. The methodology provides a blueprint for a national-scale peat mapping.

TI  - Changes in organic carbon stocks upon land use conversion in the Brazilian Cerrado: A review
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper reviews current knowledge on changes in carbon stocks upon land use conversion in the Brazilian Cerrado. First, we briefly characterize the savanna ecosystem and summarize the main published data on C stocks under natural conditions. The effects of increased land use pressure in the Cerrado and current uncertainties of estimations of changes in land cover and land use are reviewed next. Thereafter, we focus on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics due to changes in land use, particularly conversion to pastures and soybean-based cropping systems, and effects of management practices such as soil fertilization, crop rotations and tillage practices. Most studies considered here suggest that more intensive agriculture, which include no-till practices and the implementation of best or recommended management practices (RMP), reduces SOC losses after land use conversion from conventional tillage-based, monocropping systems; however, these studies focussed on the first 0.3 m of soil, or less, and seldom considered full carbon accounting. To better estimate possible global warming mitigation with agriculture in the Cerrado more comprehensive studies are needed that analyse fluxes of the biogenic greenhouse gases (GHG: CO2, N2O and CH4) to determine the net global warming potential (GWP). Follow up studies should include the application of an integrated modelling system, comprised of a Geographic Information System (GIS) linked to dynamic modelling tools, to analyse SOC dynamics and make projections for possible changes in net C flows in the Cerrado region upon defined changes in soil use and management.

TI  - Soil gaseous N2O and CH4 emissions and carbon pool due to integrated crop-livestock in a subtropical Ferralsol
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We assessed the impact of integrated crop-livestock (CL), with silage maize (Zea mays L.) in summer and grazed annual-ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) in winter, and continuous crop (CC), with annualryegrass used only as cover-crop, on net greenhouse gas emission from soil (NetGHG-S) in a subtropical Ferralsol of a 3.5-year-old experiment in Brazil. Emissions from animal excreta in CL were estimated. Soil N2O fluxes after N application to maize were higher in CL (max. 181 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)) than in CC (max. 132 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)). The cumulative annual N2O emission from soil in CL surpassed that in CC by more than three-times (4.26 vs. 1.26 kg N2O-N ha(-1), p < 0.01), possibly because of supplementary N application to grazed ryegrass in CL (N was not applied in cover-crop ryegrass of CC) and a certain degree of soil compaction visually observed in the first few centimetres after grazing. The estimated annual N2O emission from excreta in CL was 2.35 kg N2O-N ha(-1). Cumulative annual CH4 emission was not affected significantly (1.65 in CL vs. 1.08 kg CH4-C ha(-1) in CC, p = 0.27). Soil organic carbon (OC) stocks were not affected by soil use systems, neither in 0-20-cm (67.88 in CL vs. 67.20 Mg ha(-1) in CC, p = 0.62) or 0-100-cm (234.74 in CL vs. 234.61 Mg ha(-1) in CC, p = 0.97). The NetGHG-S was 0.652 Mg CO2-C-eq ha(-1) year(-1) higher in CL than in CC. Crop-livestock emitted more N2O than CC and no soil OC sequestration occurred to offset that emission. Management of fertiliser- and excreta-N must be focused as a strategy to mitigate N2O fluxes in CL. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The performance of the CROPGRO model for bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) yield simulation
T2  - ACTA SCIENTIARUM-AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the CROPGRO-Dry bean model for simulating dry bean yield. The model's genetic coefficients were calibrated based on the cultivars 'Perola', 'Our Negro' and 'Our Vermelho' in Vicosa, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The coefficients were adjusted based on two experiments that were performed in 2003 with irrigated and nonirrigated water regimes. An additional experiment with irrigation was conducted in 2004. After calibration, the model simulated the bean yield for the period from 1975 through 2006. The simulations were based on daily data on maximum and minimum air temperatures, total precipitation and global solar radiation. The physical and hydric characteristics of the soil and crop management practices were also included. The results show that the crop model can correctly reproduce the observed yield. This finding may indicate that the model is a useful tool to evaluate the crop response to variability and changing climate.

TI  - Imaging tree root systems using ground penetrating radar (GPR) data in Brazil
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Trees sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, storing it in branches, stems, and roots, where the belowground carbon fraction, approximately 1/4 of the total amount, exhibits significant interspecies root biomass variability. Estimating the amount of carbon stored in tree roots of different species is key to understanding an important aspect of climate change and exploring how natural forests, urban tree planting policies, and reforestation projects might help to address it. In this context, one of the most prominent Non-Destructive Testing methods capable of estimating the diameter and length of roots at different depths is ground penetrating radar (GPR). It has been widely used for geological, archaeological, and geotechnical studies due to its accuracy in locating buried material in different contexts, although standards for the correct management of datasets related to belowground root systems are still been developed. This paper reports a GPR signal processing flow to estimate the root diameter of three species of tropical forest trees, and to demonstrate the method's viability, a dataset was collected in a study area with a 900 MHz shielded antenna. A multi-stage data processing flow is then presented, including raw data, file format conversion, zero-time adjustment, background removal, signal gain, Stolt FK migration, and time-to-depth conversion with hyperbolic adjustment velocity. The resulting data were converted from true amplitude data to a trace envelope. High amplitudes on the envelope section, with lateral continuity in parallel sections, were interpreted as roots. However, the interpretation of outcomes encounters notable complexities, primarily attributable to the intricate nature of subsurface root architectures, the soil matrix characterized by significant clay content, and the co-occurrence of buried materials proximate to the arboreal subjects. Consequently, amplitudes discerned within ground penetrating radar (GPR) 2D sections necessitate cautious interpretation, as they are not immediately indicative of subsurface roots. To overcome this difficulty, this study used direct measurements of the roots in the field, to confirm the GPR data. Despite these complexities, the study demonstrates GPR's efficacy, particularly in the uppermost soil layer-a pivotal carbon reservoir with a 96% correlation (R 2) between GPR-derived coarse-root diameter estimates and field measurements.

TI  - Carbon dioxide emissions through oxidative peat decomposition on a burnt tropical peatland
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In Southeast Asia, a huge amount of peat has accumulated under swamp forests over millennia. Fires have been widely used for land clearing after timber extraction, thus land conversion and land management with logging and drainage are strongly associated with fire activity. During recent El Nino years, tropical peatlands have been severely fire-affected and peatland fires enlarged. To investigate the impact of peat fires on the regional and global carbon balances, it is crucial to assess not only direct carbon emissions through peat combustion but also oxidative peat decomposition after fires. However, there is little information on the carbon dynamics of tropical peat damaged by fires. Therefore, we continuously measured soil CO2 efflux [peat respiration (RP)] through oxidative peat decomposition using six automated chambers on a burnt peat area, from which about 0.7m of the upper peat had been lost during two fires, in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. The RP showed a clear seasonal variation with higher values in the dry season. The RP increased logarithmically as groundwater level (GWL) lowered. Temperature sensitivity or Q(10) of RP decreased as GWL lowered, mainly because the vertical distribution of RP would shift downward with the expansion of an unsaturated soil zone. Although soil temperature at the burnt open area was higher than that in a near peat swamp forest, model simulation suggests that the effect of temperature rise on RP is small. Annual gap-filled RP was 382 +/- 82 (the mean +/- 1 SD of six chambers) and 362 +/- 74gCm(-2)yr(-1) during 2004-2005 and during 2005-2006years, respectively. Simulated RP showed a significant negative relationship with GWL on an annual basis, which suggests that every GWL lowering by 0.1m causes additional RP of 89gCm(-2)yr(-1). The RP accounted for 21-24% of ecosystem respiration on an annual basis.

TI  - Regeneration of riparian forests of the Brazilian Pantanal under flood and fire influence
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood and fire are considered ecological filters and can shape the structure of plant communities in tropical wetlands and floodable savannas, especially on regeneration. However, in systems exposed to recurrent flood and fire, there is little information on the vegetation effects and implications for management. To test the effects of fire on flood-prone riparian forests of the Brazilian Pantanal, we analyzed how natural flood and fire can interact and influence species composition, abundance, and richness of the woody regeneration. This neotropical savanna wetland is subjected to annual and predictable flood pulses and to occasional wildfires. We established 106 plots (2 x 5 m) within the riparian forest of the Paraguay River in burned (recurrent) and unburned areas from 2001 to 2011 (verified on satellite images). We compared the plot topography with historic data of river levels from Ladario gauge in the same period. We sampled all trees, shrubs, and lianas from 0.3 to 2.5 m high. Flood in plots varied from 38 (higher areas) to 98 (lower areas) days year(-1). Our results show that variation in flood duration and occurrence of fire interact in a synergistic manner to reduce stem numbers on regeneration and modify species composition and distribution. Species richness differed in relation to flood duration, but not to fire. All growth forms had low number of exclusive species in both unburned and burned sites. Our results have implications for wetland management. The natural flooding regime is responsible for the diversity of habitats and species. Changes of the hydrology due to land management or climatic changes may result in changes of fire regime with consequences for the analyzed vegetation patterns and ecosystem functions. This neotropical savanna wetland system is stable and resilient as long as its natural patterns and periodicities of flooding and wildfires are maintained. Our results point to the necessity to analyze the interacting effects of selective environmental forces in order to be able to preserve the form and functions of the huge wetlands of the Pantanal.

AB  - The equatorial peatlands of the Kutai lowland of eastern Kalimantan are generally 4-10 m in thickness but some sections exceed 16 m in depth. The deposition of peat commenced about 8000 yrs ago after shallow flooding of the basin by the Mahakam River. The earliest vegetation is a Pandanus swamp which grades upwards to swamp forest dominated by dipterocarps. The peatland has expanded laterally and rivers have maintained narrow levee-channel tracks through the swamp, which has grown vertically in balance with river accretion. Historical fires are associated with extreme El Nino yrs of drought, but human agency is important. The fires of 1982-1983 and 1997-1998 burnt up to 85% of the vegetation on the peatland. Although charcoal analyses show that fire has occurred throughout the history of the peatland, it is rare in forests remote from rivers until the last 3000 yrs and only common within the last millennium. Fires are earlier and more frequent in sites accessible from waterways, and floodplains have been widely burnt down to water table or below, forming extensive lakes.

TI  - Tropical Deforestation and Carbon Emissions from Protected Area Downgrading, Downsizing, and Degazettement (PADDD)
T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected area downgrading, downsizing and degazettement (PADDD) is a global phenomenon that has not received formal attention in Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) policies designed to reduce forest carbon emissions and conserve biodiversity. Here, we examine how PADDD affects deforestation and forest carbon emissions. We documented 174 enacted and 8 proposed PADDD events affecting more than 48,000 km(2) in three REDD+ priority countries: Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malaysia, and Peru. Where sufficient data were available, we estimated deforestation rates and the quantity and economic value of forest carbon already lost and at risk in three land tenure classes: PADDDed, protected, and never-protected. PADDDed forests experienced deforestation and forest carbon emissions greatly exceeding rates in protected areas and slightly exceeding rates in never-protected forests. PADDD represents business-as-usual for protected areas, posing substantial risk to forests and forest carbon stocks. REDD+ policies have substantive implications for protected area biodiversity and forest carbon emissions; the Warsaw Framework for REDD+ provides new, but insufficient, guidance for nations to address these issues.

TI  - Brazilian assessment on biodiversity and ecosystem services: summary for policy makers
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity and ecosystems are important elements for addressing national and global socioeconomic and environmental crises, since they provide new development opportunities, for example, as source of job and income creation, and reduction in poverty and socioeconomic inequity. Brazilian biological diversity is also expressed in its immense cultural diversity, with a great variety of knowledge holders. These peoples possess vast knowledge on agrobiodiversity, fishing, fire management, natural medicine, among others of commercial, cultural and spiritual value. The main conclusions of this Summary for Police Makers is that land use changes and climate changes have been - and will continue to be throughout this century - the main drivers that result in the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services in the country. Political interventions at different levels (from local to national, from public to private) and the enforcement of existing laws (regulatory mechanisms and incentives) are required to cope with the mitigation of the negative impacts of biodiversity and ecosystem services loss. Brazil has already a wide variety of policy instruments and socioenvironmental governance options, as well as global commitments (ODS, Aich Targets, Paris Agreement) related to the objective of a sustainable future. However, inefficient management control or lack of incentive to comply with the rules pose risks to consolidating the path to this future. The country has strong and capable institutions, but infrastructural problems, slow processes, inefficient measurements and judicial, social and ecological conflicts obstruct a proficient performance. There is a lack of communication between science and society which needs to be improved by establishing an effective flow that makes communication inclusive and representative, reaching public and private decision makers. Permanent efforts to integrate Science and policy knowledges are desirable to build confidence between policy makers and researchers.

TI  - Developing a nationally appropriate mitigation measure from the greenhouse gas GHG abatement potential from livestock production in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil is one of the first major developing countries to commit to a national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions target that requires a reduction of between 36.1% and 38.9% relative to baseline emissions by 2020. The country intends to submit agricultural emissions reductions as part of this target, with livestock production identified as offering significant abatement potential. Focusing on the Cerrado core (central Brazilian savannah), this paper investigates the cost-effectiveness of this potential, Which involves some consideration of both the private and social costs and benefits (e.g. including avoided deforestation) arising from specific mitigation measures that may form part of Brazil's definition of Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Measures (NAMAs). The analysis used an optimisation model to define abatement costs. A baseline projection suggests that beef production in the region will emit 2.6 Gt CO(2)e (CO2 equivalent) from 2010 to 2030, corresponding to 9% of national emissions (including energy, transport, waste, livestock and agriculture). By implementing negative-cost measures identified in a marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) by 2030, the 2.6 Gt CO(2)e could be reduced by around 24%. Pasture restoration, involving avoided deforestation, offers the largest contribution to these results. As the Brazilian Cerrado is seen as a model for transforming other global savannahs, the results offer a significant contribution by identifying alternatives for increasing productivity while minimizing national and global external costs.

TI  - Methane and nitrous oxide fluxes from clonal eucalyptus forests in different spacing arrangements
T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although Eucalyptus is the most commonly cultivated genus in Brazil, more information is needed on how these forests can act as a sink for greenhouse gases. This study assessed the potential greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation of eucalyptus forests by quantifying both the seasonal rates of exchange of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases at the soil-atmosphere interface and their relationships with soil variables (moisture, temperature and physicochemical attributes). Soil organic carbon sequestration rate was used together with soil GHG emission to estimate net global warming potential. This study was conducted at an experimental forestry station in the south-central region of the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. No differences were found between treatments in the seasonal fluxes of N2O and CH4, which may have resulted from similar soil properties, particularly bulk density and nitrate (NO3-) contents. CH4 flux dynamics were mainly controlled by the concentrations of ammonium (NH4+) in the soil. In all treatments, the soil acted as a continuous sink for CH4, absorbing it at an average rate of -65 mu g C m(-2) h(-1), which was higher than the results of other studies conducted in native areas of the Cerrado biome and planted forests. However, although CH4 removal helped offset greenhouse gas emissions, net emissions were seen in most treatments due to N2O emissions in greater magnitude and soil carbon losses.

TI  - Phenological dynamics of four populations of Handroanthus spongiosus in seasonally dry tropical forest in Brazil
T2  - FLORA
M3  - Article
AB  - The scarcity of phenological studies based on different populations of tropical forest trees limits seed management and collection for reforestation efforts. Precipitation is the primary factor driving tropical plant phenology in seasonal environments, although other environmental variables and plant traits may be associated. We examined the seasonality, synchrony, and intensities of the vegetative and reproductive phenophases of four populations of Handroanthus spongiosus, an endangered species, under similar climate regimes in a seasonally dry tropical forest, in northeastern Brazil. We expected to observe some divergence in the phenologies of the populations related to distinct functional traits selected for by differences in rainfall and soil properties. Mature trees (n = 87) were monitored during a three-year period. Seasonality was examined using circular statistics, and the influences of environmental variables on phenophases were investigated using generalized additive models. Variations in intensities and activity indices were identified among the different populations. Vegetative phenophases were seasonal, driven by precipitation and photoperiod, with leaf longevity of up to 7 months; budding peaked in February-March, while leaf fall peaked in April and October. The reproductive phenophases were found to be seasonal, during the rainy season (November to April), influenced by temperature and photoperiod. The slight divergences noted among the phenological behaviors of the populations were related to distinct functional traits (e.g., tree height, stem diameter) selected for by differences in certain environmental variables (rainfall volumes and soil properties). Given ongoing global climate changes, increases in leaf fall and reductions of flowering intensity, as verified here, will likely be observed.

TI  - Shade and sapling size influence restoration of Araucaria angustifolia
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Toward improving reforestation of Brazilian pine (Araucaria angustifolia), two contrasting sapling sizes in either full sun or in the shade of a mixed plantation and the effect of opening the canopy were evaluated for survival, growth, gas exchange, photosynthetic pigments, and leaf anatomy 18 months after being planted. At 23 months after planting, a partial opening was made in the canopy in the mixed plantation, then the saplings were evaluated again after 2 months for the same morphophysiological traits. After 18 months, saplings planted in the full sun had higher survival, growth, pigments, and photosynthesis compared to the shaded saplings. Large saplings had higher survival and growth compared to the small ones. Shaded leaves were thinner and little differentiation of palisade parenchyma and hypodermis. After opening of the canopy, photosynthetically active radiation was 10 times higher, and the saplings quickly grew in height due to increased photosynthesis. Thus, although the species can tolerate shade, growth in the shade is limited. We recommend that for reforestation purposes of Brazilian pine, large saplings should be selected and planted in the open for better development.

TI  - Shifting Cultivation and Fire Policy: Insights from the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - HUMAN ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires in humid tropical forests are increasingly frequent due to severe dry seasons, forest degradation and agricultural expansion. One agent implicated in current discourse surrounding tropical forest fires is the small-scale farming peasantry who rely on fire in swidden (shifting cultivation, slash-and-burn) agriculture. The environmental degradation associated with fire has led to government responses at multiple scales (international, national, state, regional) via policies aimed mainly at managing ignition sources. However, continued increase in forest fires suggests that these policies may be having limited impact and a fresh evaluation of current policy approaches to fire management is needed. We review fire policy measures with insights of caboclo farming practices and perspectives from Eastern Amazonia and examine the congruence between policy and practice. We demonstrate a significant disparity between policy requirements such as firebreaks and actual fire management practices, in which measures rarely meet requirements outlined in legislation. We explore the origins and the impacts of these disparities, focussing on smallholder farm-level management measures and local capacity. Incomplete knowledge coupled with marginal awareness of legal requirements served to propagate widespread erroneous beliefs in what these are. This analysis at multiple scales (international, national, state, regional) will contribute to developing greater congruence between fire policies and smallholder farming practices.

TI  - Effect of restoration methods on natural regeneration in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and ecosystem degradation have achieved unprecedented levels nowadays. In this context, assessing restoration projects to recover native vegetation and ecosystem services is fundamental to understanding the success of these initiatives. This study evaluated the effects of different restoration techniques on the basal area, diversity, and composition of regenerating and planted species in a restoration area in the Atlantic Forest, Southeast Brazil. The experiment consisted of three treatments: row planting (ROW, 2 x 2 m spacing); nucleation (NUC, 13 individuals/nucleus, 5 x 5 m spacing); and control with passive restoration (PAS). The active restoration techniques had different planting densities at project implementation (NUC: 5,200 seedlings ha-1; ROW: 2,177 seedlings ha-1). A floristic survey was carried out within 8 sampling units (15 x 15 m) per treatment 10 years after implementation of the project, including all planted and regenerating individuals with a diameter at ground level > 2.5 cm. The abundance, basal area, and species richness of the planted and regenerated communities were estimated. The active restoration techniques (ROW and NUC) resulted in higher values of basal area, abundance and species richness compared to passive restoration (PAS). A higher abundance of natural regeneration was observed in ROW than in NUC. Additionally, the rarefaction curves suggested a trend toward higher diversity indices in ROW. Regarding the successional trajectory, greater variation in species composition was observed in ROW after 10 years of planting. The species composition was similar in ROW and NUC and differed from the composition in PAS. The species identified as indicator species in each treatment were Annona glabra L. in ROW, Trema micranthum (L.) Blume in NUC, and Vernonanthura polyanthes (Sprengel) Vega & Dematteis in PAS. Our study revealed that active restoration techniques, such as seedling planting in rows and nuclei, were more effective in restoring ecological indicators than passive restoration. These results emphasize the importance of restoration techniques in enhancing plant community diversity and structure in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.

TI  - Assessing fire risk and safeguarding Brazil's biomes: a Multifactorial Approach
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests in Brazil play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance and the environment, but this has been threatened by deforestation, forest fires, and the effects of climate change. Among these, forest fire has happened frequently in areas where there have been changes in land use for activities of agriculture and livestock farming, that motivate the destruction of forests particularly in biomes like the Amazon and Cerrado. In those biomes, the forest fires initiated to clear land for pasture are the most worrying because promote ecological and socioeconomic consequences, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and impacts the regional flora and biogeochemical cycles. As a strategy to understand and identify areas at risk of forest fires, this study aimed to develop a risk zoning framework for fire hotspots in the biomes of Brazilians. This framework combines multiple variables, incorporating factors like physical terrain, land use, and climatic data, to assess the potential fire risk. The areas with greater fire risk are located in the Caatinga, Cerrado, and Pantanal biomes, in which the physical and climate variables influence directly in incidence and propagation of fire. In the Amazon biome there is a fire risk, some possibly intentional, but can be regulated by elevated precipitation in the region. The identification of areas at high fire risk allows the implementation of proactive strategies for fire prevention for safeguarding Brazil's biomes and ecosystems, which are integral to the environment and biodiversity.

TI  - Terrestrial and Aquatic Carbon Dynamics in Tropical Peatlands under Different Land Use Types: A Systematic Review Protocol
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Peatlands are both responding to and influencing climate change. While numerous studies on peatland carbon dynamics have been published in boreal and temperate regions for decades, a much smaller yet growing body of scientific articles related to tropical peatlands has recently been published, including from previously overlooked regions such as the Amazonian and Congo basins. The recent recognition of tropical peatlands as valuable ecosystems because of the organic carbon they accumulate in their water-saturated soils has occurred after most of them have been drained and degraded in Southeast Asia. Under disturbed conditions, their natural carbon storage function is shifted to an additional carbon source to the atmosphere. Understanding the effect of land-use change and management practices on peatlands can shed light on the driving variables that influence carbon emissions and can model the magnitude of emissions in future degraded peatlands. This is of primary importance as other peatland-covered regions in the tropics are at risk of land-use and land-cover changes. A systematic review that synthesizes the general understanding of tropical peatland carbon dynamics based on the published literature is much needed to guide future research directions on this topic. Moreover, previous studies of biogeochemical cycling in tropical peatlands have largely focused on terrestrial stocks and fluxes with little attention given to document lateral and downstream aquatic export through natural and artificial drainage channels. Here, we present a systematic review protocol to describe terrestrial and aquatic carbon dynamics in tropical peatlands and identify the influence of land-use change on carbon exchange. We described a set of literature search and screening steps that lay the groundwork for a future synthesis on tropical peatlands carbon cycling. Such an evidence-based synthesis using a systematic review approach will help provide the research community and policymakers with consistent science-based guidelines to set and monitor emissions reduction targets as part of the forestry and land-use sector.

TI  - Soil nitrous oxide emissions in long-term cover crops-based rotations under subtropical climate
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been shown that cover crops can enhance soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, but the magnitude of increase depends on the quantity and quality of the crop residues. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of long-term (19 and 21 years) no-till maize crop rotations including grass [black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb)] and legume cover crops [vetch (Vigna sativa L), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L. Millsp.) and lablab (Dolichos lablab)] on annual soil N2O emissions in a subtropical Acrisol in Southern Brazil. Greater soil N2O emissions were observed in the first 45 days after the cover crop residue management in all crop rotations, varying from -20.2 +/- 1.9 to 163.9 +/- 24.3 mu g N m(-2) h(-1). Legume-based crop rotations had the largest cumulative emissions in this period, which were directly related to the quantity of N (r(2) = 0.60, p = 0.13)and inversely related to the lignin:N ratio(r(2) = 0.89,p = 0.01) of the cover crop residues. After this period, the mean fluxes were smaller and were closely related to the total soil N stocks (r(2) = 0.96, p = 0.002). The annual soil N2O emission represented 0.39-0.75% of the total N added by the legume cover crops. Management-control led soil variables such as mineral N (NO3- and NH4+) and dissolved organic C influenced more the N2O fluxes than environmental-related variables as water-filled pore space and air and soil temperature. Consequently, the synchronization between N mineralization and N uptake by plants seems to be the main challenge to reduce N2O emissions while maintaining the environmental and agronomic services provided by legume cover crops in agricultural systems.

TI  - Carbon sequestration in two Brazilian Cerrado soils under no-till
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A considerable proportion of the 200 million hectares of the Brazilian Cerrado is suitable for annual crops but little is known about the effects of tillage on the C dynamics of Cerrado soils. We evaluated the role of two representative Cerrado Oxisols (350 and 650 g clay kg(-1)) as sources or sinks of atmospheric C when managed under three tillage systems (conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT), and no-till (NT)) in 8- and 5-year long-term experiments. A literature review was also carried out and the mean C sequestration rates in no-till soils of tropical and subtropical regions of Brazil were calculated and compared with values for soils from temperate regions of the world. The original C stocks in 0-20 cm layer of soils under native Cerrado were higher in the clayey (54.0 Mg ha(-1)) than in the sandy clay loam soil (35.4 Mg ha(-1)), suggesting a higher physical stability of organic matter associated with variable clay minerals in the clayey Oxisol. The original C stocks of the native Cerrado soils appear not to have decreased after 23 years of conventional tillage in the sandy clay loam Oxisol, except when the soil had been subjected to erosion (15% loss of C), or after 25 years in the clayey Oxisol. Compared to conventionally tilled soil, the C stocks in no-till sandy clay loam Oxisol increased by 2.4 Mg ha(-1) (C sequestration rate = 0.30 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) and in the clayey Oxisol by 3.0 Mg ha(-1) (C sequestration rate = 0.60 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)). The mean rate of C sequestration in the no-till Brazilian tropical soils was estimated to be 0.35 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), similar to the 0.34 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) reported for soils from temperate regions but lower than the 0.48 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) estimated for southern Brazilian subtropical soils. Considering the large area (about 70 million hectares) of the Cerrado which is currently used and potentially available for cropland, the adoption of no-till systems could turn the Cerrado soils into a significant sink for atmospheric C and contribute to the mitigation of global climate change.

TI  - Could cattle ranching and soybean cultivation be sustainable? A systematic review and a meta-analysis for the Amazon
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Tropical forests are being destroyed to make space for agricultural activities with the assumption that they are required to feed the growing global population. Consequently, more sustainable practices are needed to guarantee food security and environmental protection of highly threatened natural biodiversity hotspots like the Amazon rainforest. Cattle ranching and soybean cultivation are by far the greater drivers of land use change and deforestation in the Amazon region. We performed a systematic review of papers related to these two main drivers and a meta-analysis on the effects of sustainable practices on different ecosystem services. The results of the review highlight a large concern about the negative impacts of cattle ranching and soybean crops on the ecosystem dynamics and functionality of the Amazon biome, in addition to the clear relationship with deforestation. Another relevant finding is the large gap in empirical research concerning the effects of sustainable practices on different ecosystem services. Such a gap is evident since only 13 studies from the initial database met the requirements for a meta-analysis. Of the 171 comparisons between the ecosystem services provided in conventional land-uses and those adopting sustainable practices, the overall model indicated a non-significant effect, although the results were heterogeneous. Crop yield and herbage biomass were negatively affected, while livestock productivity, soil organic carbon, soil fertility and woody biomass were positively affected. Also, the six sustainable practices evaluated showed different outcomes, from a predominance of positive effects in silvopastoral systems, to a predominance of negative effects on agrosilvicultural systems. Our systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that cattle ranching and soybean cultivation can indeed be conducted in a more sustainable way, enhancing the provision of ecosystem services while avoiding deforestation. In turn, our results also highlight the lack of empirical data and the need to standardize the methodologies used to deeply assess the effects of such practices. In conclusion, we suggest a way to advance research into the real effects of sustainable practices aimed at reducing the negative impacts of cattle ranching and soybean crops in the Amazon.

TI  - Property size and forest cover were key determinants of forest restoration in Southern Bahia in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest restoration has gained traction as a solution to mitigate climate change, contribute to biodiversity conservation, and support forest livelihoods. Yet there is limited evidence on the spatial locations where restoration is most likely to occur. In landscapes that primarily contain private properties, assessing the likelihood of restoration can be informed by understanding the enabling and limiting factors that have influenced propertylevel restoration in the past. In this paper, we tested the relationships between restoration, property size, and forest cover, for 8451 properties between 1985 and 2019 in Southern Bahia, Atlantic Forest, Brazil. We found that spatial property-level variables were strongly associated with restoration. First, we found that property size was positively correlated with the amount of restoration per property. Medium-sized properties (between 40 and 127 ha) accounted for the most restoration in aggregate. Second, we found that properties with less forest cover were associated with higher amounts of restoration. In addition, for properties larger than 20 ha, those with intermediate amounts of forest cover had high amounts of restoration. Third, we found that restoration was a spatial process that occurred in hotspots rather than randomly across the study landscape, indicating that restoration often occurred near to other restored properties. Understanding these relationships may assist restoration planners in making more informed estimates of the conditions that might enable future restoration. Given that restoration is a complex process that may require different approaches in different socioenvironmental contexts, decision-makers may consider identifying and prioritizing properties of different sizes and with different amounts of forest cover depending on their specific priorities, landscape-level conditions, and restoration context. Our spatial analysis techniques assist in improving broader understanding of possible ways in which land use policy could prioritize for restoration at the property level and could later be applied to other socio-environmental tropical forest systems.

TI  - Analysis of results of biomass forest inventory in northeastern Amazon for development of REDD plus carbon project
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - In Brazil, a significant reduction in deforestation rates occurred during the last decade. In spite of that fact, the average annual rates are still too high, approximately 400.000 ha/year (INPE/Prodes). The projects of emissions reduction through avoided deforestation (REED+) are an important tool to reduce deforestation rates in Brazil. Understanding the amazon forest structure, in terms of biomass stock is key to design avoided deforestation strategies. In this work, we analyze data results from aboveground biomass of 1,019.346,27 hectares in the state of Para. It was collected data from 16,722 trees in 83 random independent plots. It was tested 4 allometric equations, for DBH > 10cm: Brown et al. (1989), Brown and Lugo (1999), Chambers et al. (2000), Higuchi et al. (1998). It revealed that the biggest carbon stock of above ground biomass is stocked on the interval at DBH between 30cm and 80cm. This biomass compartment stocks 75.70% of total biomass in Higuchi et al. (1998) equation, 75.56% of total biomass in Brown et al. (1989) equation, 78.83% of total biomass in Chambers et al. (2000) equation, and 73.22% in Brown and Lugo (1999) equation.

TI  - Characterizing Watersheds to Support Land-use Planning in Indonesia: A Case Study of Brantas Tropical Watershed
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This work addresses the challenge of classifying watersheds to support land use policymaking in rapidly developing, wet tropical regions, using a case study of the Brantas River Basin, Java, Indonesia. Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components of the watershed descriptors resulted in three optimal clusters. Differentiation among these three clusters is mainly related to climatic regimes, topographic features, and land uses. Stepwise regression was used to identify the watershed descriptors that explain the spatial variability of four flow indices (95% non-exceedance percentile Q95; 5% non-exceedance percentile Q5; the slope of the flow duration curve SFDC; and the runoff coefficient RC). This gave, for these four indices in turn, R2 values of 0.77, 0.76, 0.84 and 0.45. The results show that built-up areas and dryland forest are primary land-use controls on flow indices. Clustering results suggest that existing regional development trends will have major hydrological impacts, especially related to runoff generation and groundwater. The results support the view that failure to implement land-use policy - failure that is expected to increase builtup areas across the watershed and increase forest loss in the upper watershed - will jeopardize watershed hydrological functions. The findings of this research support the need for frequent and updated land-use monitoring to control urban development and conserve dryland forest, as well as land-use policies that control increases in built-up areas and that minimize forest loss.(c) 2023 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from a subtropical Ultisol by using long-term no-tillage in combination with legume cover crops
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be partially mitigated with conservation agriculture. In this study, we assessed the effects of conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT), as well as five NT cover crop-based cropping systems, on yield-scaled GHG emissions in two long-term experiments (18 and 19 years) on a subtropical Paleudult. Air samples collected in static closed chambers were used to measure nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes. The annual rate of change in soil organic C from the beginning of the experiments was used as proxy for net CO2 flux. Cumulative annual emissions of the three GHG and the CO2 costs of agricultural inputs and operations were taken in full account when estimating the global warming potential (GWP). Under legume cover crops, NT soil exhibited increased N2O emissions relative to CT soil (531 vs 217 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1) yr(-1)); however, emissions of this gas from NT soil were fully offset by CO2 retention in soil organic matter (-2063 to -3940 kg CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1)). Soil CH4 fluxes were very low with all management systems (-1.5 to 30.5 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1) yr(-1)). NT soil under legume cover crops behaved as a net sink for GHG (GWP ranged from -971 to -2818 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1) yr(-1)); by contrast, CT soil and NT soil with a low biomass input were net sources of GHG (GWP ranged from 857 to 2133 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1) yr(-1)). The legume cover crops increased maize yield and further reduced yield-scaled GHG emissions. This result suggests that conservation management practices involving no-till in combination with legume cover crops provide an effective approach to sustainable low-C footprint food production in subtropical regions.

TI  - Airborne Remote Sensing of Wildland Fires
T2  - WILDLAND FIRES AND AIR POLLUTION
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - In wildland fire management, reliable fire intelligence is needed to direct suppression resources, maintain firefighter safety, predict fire behavior, mitigate fire effects in the environment, and justify and evaluate the effectiveness of fuel management. Fire intelligence needs to be synoptic, quantitative, consistent, and timely. Airborne remote sensing with specialized infrared radiometers is now providing an unprecedented level of information on fire behavior and effects. The temperature, radiant intensity, carbon and sensible heat fluxes, and fuel consumption associated with the flaming front of a wildland fire have been estimated by remotely measuring its radiance at short- and mid-wave infrared wavelengths. Measurements of upwelling long-wave or thermal-infrared radiation provide estimates primarily of ground-surface temperatures, even beneath flaming fronts, that reflect a local time course of energy release and fuel consumption. Characteristics of flames and hot ground can be discriminated from radiances measured at wavelengths near 1.6, 3.9, and 11.9 mu m. Fire radiance at 3.9 mm appears to be a good estimator of radiant-flux density, which integrates across wavelengths. There are strong temperature gradients along and within flaming fronts, and although their temperatures are high-commonly exceeding 1000 degrees C along the line of a savanna fire, for instance-flames may not be bright when compared with a blackbody radiator. The combination of that low bulk emissivity and uncertainty as to the composition and radiance of nonfire background within the sensor's instantaneous field of view dictates that fire properties are best estimated from measurements of high spatial resolution in comparison with the scale of a fire front. The USDA Forest Service is now applying a FireMapper (TM) thermal-imaging radiometer for fire research and support of incident command teams over high-priority wildland fires, especially those threatening cities and communities in southern California. Resulting data are providing insight into fire behavior in complex and changing fuels, fire interactions with the atmosphere and a changing climate, and large-scale fire processes.

TI  - Assessing four decades of fire behavior dynamics in the Cerrado biome (1985 to 2022)
T2  - FIRE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundFire significantly transforms ecology and landscapes worldwide, impacting carbon cycling, species interactions, and ecosystem functions. In the Brazilian Cerrado, a fire-dependent savanna, the interaction between fire, society, and the environment is evident. Given that wildfires significantly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, our study aimed to analyze four decades of burned area data to understand changes in fire dynamics, using Collection 2 of annual MapBiomas Fire maps (1985 to 2022). Our study examined spatiotemporal patterns, fire recurrence, fire distribution across land uses, temporal changes in fire scar size, burned area variations across ecoregions, and their correlation with farming areas.ResultsFrom 1985 to 2022, fire impacted 40% (792,204 km2) of the Cerrado biome, with 63% burning more than once. Natural vegetation was the most affected, primarily due to human-driven ignition during the dry season. A noticeable trend of later peaks in fire activity, concentrated towards the end of the dry season, along with an increase in patch size over time, characterized a clear shift in the Cerrado fire regime. Recently, the MATOPIBA region and the northern biome exhibited significant fire clusters, with burned areas rising alongside farming expansion. The ecoregion-based analysis identified fire hotspots, with the "Bananal" ecoregion, the largest wetland area in the biome, exhibiting increased fire recurrence and larger patch size over time.ConclusionsOur four-decade analysis of fire dynamics in the Cerrado revealed human-induced changes in the fire regime, originally shifting from July to September to a new fire season from August to October. This shift poses several environmental threats given their overlap with the driest months of the year. This study improved our understanding of changes in fire patterns and their impacts on each ecoregion and land use. Wetlands experienced the highest relative burned area, highlighting their ecological importance and increased vulnerability. In the southern Cerrado, where farming is established and natural vegetation more fragmented, fire events tend to decrease; while in the north, with recent farming expansion, fire susceptibility rises. Conservation-oriented strategies, like the Brazilian Integrated Fire Management (MIF), are crucial for mitigating impacts while enhancing the Cerrado's resilience to climate change.AntecedentesLos fuegos de vegetaci & oacute;n transforman significativamente la ecolog & iacute;a y los paisajes en todo el mundo, impactando en el ciclo del carbono, en las interacciones entre especies, y en el funcionamiento de los ecosistemas.

Nuestro estudio examin & oacute; los patrones espacio-temporales, la recurrencia del fuego, la distribuci & oacute;n de los incendios a trav & eacute;s de los diferentes usos de la tierra, los cambios temporales en el tama & ntilde;o e las cicatrices de fuego, y su correlaci & oacute;n con & aacute;reas agr & iacute;colas.ResultadosDesde 1985 y hasta 2022, los incendios impactaron el 40% (792.204 km2) del bioma del Cerrado, con el 63% de su & aacute;rea quem & aacute;ndose m & aacute;s de una vez. La vegetaci & oacute;n natural fue la m & aacute;s afectada, debido primariamente a las igniciones humanas durante la estaci & oacute;n seca. Una tendencia destacable en los & uacute;ltimos picos de actividad del fuego, concentrada hacia el final de la estaci & oacute;n seca, junto con un incremento con el tiempo en el tama & ntilde;o de los parches de vegetaci & oacute;n afectada, caracteriz & oacute; un claro cambio en el r & eacute;gimen de fuego del Cerrado. Recientemente, la regi & oacute;n de MATOPIBA y el bioma norte exhibieron cl & uacute;steres de fuego significativos, con un aumento de las & aacute;reas quemadas en los alrededores de las zonas en las que se estaban expandiendo los campos agr & iacute;colas. El an & aacute;lisis basado en la ecorregi & oacute;n identific & oacute; tambi & eacute;n puntos calientes, con la ecorregi & oacute;n llamada "Bananal", el & aacute;rea de humedales m & aacute;s grande de la regi & oacute;n, exhibiendo con el tiempo incrementos en la recurrencia del fuego y parches quemados cada vez m & aacute;s grandes.ConclusionesNuestro an & aacute;lisis de cuatro d & eacute;cadas sobre la din & aacute;mica del fuego en el Cerrado revel & oacute; cambios inducidos por la actividad humana sobre el r & eacute;gimen de los incendios modific & aacute;ndose desde julio a septiembre a una nueva estaci & oacute;n de fuegos desde agosto y hasta octubre. Esta modificaci & oacute;n implica algunas amenazas ambientales dado que se superpone con los meses m & aacute;s secos del a & ntilde;o. Este estudio mejora nuestro entendimiento sobre los cambios en los patrones de incendios y sus impactos en cada ecorregi & oacute;n y en el uso de la tierra. Los humedales fueron los que experimentaron una mayor & aacute;rea quemada relativa, subrayando su importancia ecol & oacute;gica y el incremento en su vulnerabilidad. En el Cerrado del sur, donde las actividades agr & iacute;colas se han establecido y la vegetaci & oacute;n natural est & aacute; m & aacute;s fragmentada, los eventos de fuego tienden a disminuir; mientras que en el norte, con una expansi & oacute;n agr & iacute;cola reciente, la susceptibilidad a los incendios aumenta.

TI  - Subsidence and carbon dioxide emissions in a smallholder peatland mosaic in Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Most attention in quantifying carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from tropical peatlands has been on large-scale plantations (industrial timber, oil palm (Elaeis guinensis)), differing in drainage and land-use practices from those of smallholder farms. We measured subsidence and changes in bulk density and carbon organic content to calculate CO2 emissions over 2.5years in a remnant logged-over forest and four dominant smallholder land-use types in Tanjung Jabung Barat District, Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia: (1) simple rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) agroforest (>30years), (2) mixed coconut (Cocos nucifera) and coffee gardens (Coffea liberica) (>40years), (3) mixed betel nut (Areca catechu) and coffee gardens (>20years), and (4) oil palm plantation (1year). We quantified changes in microtopography for each site for greater accuracy of subsidence estimates and tested the effects of nitrogen and phosphorus application. All sites had a fibric type of peat with depths of 50 to >100cm. A recently established oil palm had the highest rate of peat subsidence and emission (4.7cmyear(-1) or 121MgCO(2)ha(-1)year(-1)) while the remnant forest had the lowest (1.8cmyear(-1) or 40Mg CO(2)ha(-1)year(-1)). Other land-use types subsided by 2-3cmyear(-1), emitting 70-85MgCO(2)ha(-1)year(-1). Fertilizer application did not have a consistent effect on inferred emissions. Additional emissions in the first years after drainage, despite groundwater tables of 40cm, were of the order of belowground biomass of peat forest. Despite maintaining higher water tables, smallholder landscapes have CO2 emissions close to, but above, current IPCC defaults.

TI  - The role of government in operationalising markets for REDD plus in Indonesia
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The global climate initiative Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD +) initially included carbon markets as one potential policy mechanism to finance a range of forestry projects in developing countries. Indonesia was an early leader on REDD +, and set up the regulatory frameworks and monitoring systems to support demonstration projects that could trade credits in voluntary carbon markets. This article applies a neoliberal govemmentality framework to evaluate the development of REDD + market institutions in Indonesia during the Readiness period between 2008 and 2013. It critiques the role of the state in this process, and how the authority of public agencies shapes the actions of private subjects. The case of Indonesia indicates a pivotal role for government agencies at multiple levels in integrating the operation of FtEDD + market activities within a supportive regime of forest and land management. Critical to this process was legislation to trade in forest carbon and obtain project licenses, devolved land-use planning and forest management that could support conunercial activities, and robust MRV surveillance systems to oversee on-ground activities. Despite these efforts, projects were often subject to an uncertain and highly contested forest management regime, undermining attempts to demonstrate the viability of operationalising market mechanisms at the local scale.

TI  - Scenario analysis of the Jakarta Coastal Defence Strategy: sustainable indicators impact assessment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta suffers rising pressure on land availability due to its rapid economic and population growth. To sustain its growth, The Indonesian government planned a giant sea-wall land reclamation project as a primary solution in the North of Jakarta, named Jakarta Coastal Defense Strategy (JCDS) or also known at the national level as the National Capital Integrated Coastal Development (NCICD). The project mainly intended to provide new territory for residential and commercial area as well as protection against rising sea level. This paper aims to analyse the impact of the JCDS development in terms of Jakarta's economic, social and environmental indicators. The research employed system dynamics model to overview several plausible policy scenarios. The result shows trade-offs on different sustainable indicators based on corresponding scenarios which are beneficial for policy discussion.

TI  - Evaluation of change in the peat soil properties affected by different fire severities
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The tropical peatland ecosystems of Indonesia provide direct economic benefits to local communities and act to maintain local weather patterns. The impact of burning tropical peat swamp forests of land clearing for palm oil plantations can have significant consequences on the change in the characteristics of peat soil. The aim of this study was to determine the physical, chemical, and biological properties of peat soils by field and laboratory testing and analysis to understand changes in the nature and characteristics of peatlands at four locations in the Pelalawan Regency of Riau Province. The results showed that the effect of burning peat swamp forests can lead to a change in the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the peat soils. Soil permeability and the soil microbial population can significantly decrease with increasing fire severity. The effect of different fire severities on the characteristics of peat soil is verified to contribute to advanced management of the tropical peatland in the future.

TI  - Comparison of tree water use characteristics in reforestation and agroforestry stands across the tropics
T2  - TROPICAL RAINFORESTS AND AGROFORESTS UNDER GLOBAL CHANGE: ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC VALUATIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - In the tropics, reforestations and agroforestry become increasingly important and may help mitigate climate change. However, high water use by trees may deplete water resources for associated crops or other purposes. Choice of tree species might reduce water use rates to acceptable levels, but available information on species-specific water use characteristics is scarce. We addressed the following questions: 1) do species differ in xylem sap flux response to fluctuating environmental conditions, 2) are there species-specific differences in quantities of water used, and specifically 3) do universal rules relating tree size to water use apply? This chapter combines data on tree sap flux and water use gathered in Indonesia, Panama and the Philippines. These studies applied the same methods and were conducted in recently established stands (5-12 years old when studied) characterised by small diameter trees and relatively simple stand structure. We analyse data from more than 100 trees belonging to 17 species using a simple sap flux model. Model application suggested species-specific differences in parameters such as maximal sap flux velocity and responses to radiation and vapour pressure deficit. With respect to the quantity of water used per tree, we observed a strong correlation between tree diameter and tree water use, which confirms earlier publications. However, e.g. in the stands in the Philippines where tree diameter explained 65% of observed variation; some species clearly followed distinct trajectories. For a given diameter, up to twofold differences in tree water use among species were observed. Our findings thus support the idea that species selection can be used to control tree water use of future reforestations and within agroforestry systems. This will be especially relevant in areas where water resources are limited already or where climate scenarios predict decreasing precipitation.

TI  - Dynamics of soil carbon following destruction of tropical rainforest and the subsequent establishment of Imperata grassland in Indonesian Borneo using stable carbon isotopes
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Southeast Asia has the highest rate of tropical rainforest deforestation worldwide, and large deforested areas have been replaced ultimately by the highly invasive grass Imperata cylindrica. However, information on the carbon (C) budget with such land transition is very scarce. This study presents the dynamics of soil C following rainforest destruction and the subsequent establishment of Imperata grassland in the lowland humid tropics of Indonesian Borneo using stable C isotopes. To evaluate the relative contribution of organic matter originating from primary forest (C3) and grasslands (C4), we compared soil C stock and natural 13C abundance from six sites to a depth of 100 similar to cm using samples with a wide range of soil textures. Twelve years after the first soil sampling in the grasslands, we re-sampled to examine temporal changes in soil organic matter. The grassland topsoil (05 similar to cm) is an active layer with rapid decomposition and incorporation of fresh C (mean residence time: 7.5 similar to year) and a substantial proportion of the stable C pool (37%). The decline in forest-derived C was slight, even at 510 similar to cm depths, and subsoil (20100 similar to cm depth) forest-derived C did not change along the forest-to-grassland chronosequence. Grassland-derived C stock increased significantly in the subsurface and subsoils (5100 similar to cm). Simulation indicated that total soil C stock (0100 similar to cm) increased by 18.6 similar to Mg similar to ha-1 from initial primary forest (58.0 similar to Mg similar to ha-1) to a new equilibrium state of the grassland (76.6 similar to Mg similar to ha-1) after 3050 similar to years of grassland establishment. This research indicates that the soil did not function as a CO2 source when the deforested area was replaced by Imperata grassland on the Ultisols of the Asian humid tropics. Instead, increased soil C stocks offset CO2 emissions, with the C offset accounting for 6.67.4% of the loss of biomass C stock.

TI  - The effectiveness of a biopesticide in the reduction of coffee berry borers in coffee plants
T2  - CROP PROTECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: Crop pest outbreaks are expected to become more frequent and unpredictable due to climate change, posing risks to ecosystem health and farmers' livelihoods. At the same time, there is growing evidence that chemical pesticides can persist in the landscape and contribute to land degradation. The use of natural pesticides in place of chemical pesticides is hoped to manage pest outbreaks while also restoring pollinator populations and improving the quality of arable land. During the 1970s, many countries committed to promoting and legislating Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies (encouraging natural and holistic approaches to pest management), often including using natural pesticides, known as biopesticides.Objective: We assessed the effectiveness of a biopesticide on coffee berry borer (CBB; Hypothenemus hampei) presence in 57 small-holder coffee home gardens in West Java, Indonesia across three years.Methods: Prior to the application of the biopesticide, we randomly chose ten coffee plants from each field and recorded the proportion of healthy berries per plant (berries without pest infestation) as a control. In April 2020, we distributed the biopesticide in each of the 57 coffee home gardens and repeated the above experiment. The biopesticide was redistributed in October 2020 and April 2021. We repeated the experiment for the last time in April 2021.Results and conclusions: We found that CBB presence significantly decreased, with an inverse relationship between distance to natural forest and CBB presence and a positive relationship between shade cover and CBB presence. We also interviewed farmers in April 2021 to investigate their perception of the effectiveness of the biopesticide and 87% of farmers thought it was more effective than conventional pesticides.Significance: We contribute to the growing literature on the effectiveness of natural pesticides through assessing farmers' perceptions of these methods and providing empirical evidence for their effectiveness in remedying CBB infestation. We hope that this study will empower farmers to make conscious land-use choices and provide government authorities with evidence to support increased accessibility to biopesticides.

TI  - Drivers, Barriers, and Strategies in the Community-Based Supply of Bamboo for Industrial-Scale Bamboo Utilization in Ngada Regency, East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bamboo has been part of the history and the socio-cultural and economic or livelihood aspects of Indonesia. Bamboo has been recommended as a potential species that could be utilized for community-based development in the rural part of the country as well as for utilization in various products, from traditional to modern and contemporary processes. However, there is a lack of integrated research on the community's bamboo for industrial-scale products. This study aimed to determine and assess drivers-barriers to enable the formulation of strategic recommendations aimed at promoting the success of community-based supply of the commodity for the modern bamboo industry in Ngada Regency in Indonesia. The methods were applied by collecting quantitative and qualitative data using literature reviews, questionnaires, interviews, focus group discussions, and direct field observations. Collected data were analyzed by descriptive analysis and assessing both for internal and external factors of drivers-barriers. Research findings showed that the community proceeds from a traditional mindset with regard bamboo resources and utilization but that the community actually already owned social capital to strengthen and drive modern bamboo utilization. However, there is still a lack of capacity building for bamboo management. This study also provides policymakers with strategic recommendations to develop integrated programs and regulations, support community-based bamboo utilization, improve livelihood, and support rural inclusive economic growth.

TI  - Biomarker signature in tropical wetland: lignin phenol vegetation index (LPVI) and its implications for reconstructing the paleoenvironment
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Organic matter of a peat core (3.60 m, 7428 years BP) collected from Rawa Danau, west Java, Indonesia, was analyzed to evaluate the early diagenetic fates of lignin in a tropical wetland and to reconstruct past vegetation and climate changes. Vertical profiles of (Ad/A1)v, (Ad/A1)s, and lambda(8) show that the lignin composition is well preserved in a sub-aqueous environment under reducing conditions. The sedimentary terrigenous plant material at Rawa Danau is comprised predominantly of angiosperm wood. For this kind of tropical, diverse, and dynamic ecosystem, a new vegetation change index called lignin phenol vegetation index (LPVI): LPVI is defined using the lignin phenol composition. This index can sensitively detect terrestrial vegetation changes as well as environmental conditions forcing such changes. The LPVI of the Rawa Danau peat core provides better resolution than other lignin parameters used previously, and reveals four major vegetation change events since the mid-late Holocene. In comparison to other geochemical data (i.e. elemental carbon, isotopes, and hydrocarbons), the LPVI is more sensitive and is able to trace even minor vegetation and climate changes and thus could improve biogeochemical interpretations of peat records.

TI  - An improved drought-fire assessment for managing fire risks in tropical peatlands
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands transformation in Indonesia has caused immense ecological and environmental degradation. Land use conversion has changed this natural carbon sink to a drought- and fire-prone ecosystem. Public awareness to tackle the drought and fire risk in peatlands has led to the development of drought-fire index. Current knowledge states that both climate and hydrology have a strong influence on drought-induced fire in tropical peatlands, yet the role of soil hydraulic properties in controlling the drying of peats remains unclear. This study develops an improved drought-fire index for tropical peatlands, called the Peat Fire Vulnerability Index, by incorporating groundwater and soil water retention information. We tested the new index on two peatland regions in Kubu Raya and Batanghari, Indonesia, to assess fire danger. We monitored daily rainfall, groundwater tables, and soil moisture from 2018 to 2019 on eight stations in the peatlands. Our model was calibrated against the observed drought index of two stations, and the results were verified with actual fire events through daily fire hotspots and fire burned areas in the other six stations. Results showed that soil-hydrological properties influenced the moistening and drying of peats through capillarity. Our model showed good performance in assessing fire danger during the calibration period, as indicated by three employed statistical metrics: the RMSE-standard deviation ratio (RSR = 0.57), Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE = 0.81), and percent bias (PBIAS = 1%). For verification, all observed fire events fell in high and extreme fire danger classes predicted by PFVI. Further, our findings revealed the importance of the groundwater table as a threshold of fire events. The high fire danger class was mostly found when groundwater table dropped below 40 cm, and burned areas only occurred when the groundwater table was below 60 cm. These findings suggest that our drought-fire index can be used as a peat fire risk management tool, and its application may minimize fire risks in tropical peatlands.

TI  - Designing multifunctional landscapes for forest conservation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A multifunctional landscape approach to forest protection has been advocated for tropical countries. Designing such landscapes necessitates that the role of different land uses in protecting forest be evaluated, along with the spatial interactions between land uses. However, such evaluations have been hindered by a lack of suitable analysis methodologies and data with fine spatial resolution over long time periods. We demonstrate the utility of a matching method with multiple categories to evaluate the role of alternative land uses in protecting forest. We also assessed the impact of land use change trajectories on the rate of deforestation. We employed data from Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) at three different time periods during 2000-2012 to illustrate our approach. Four single land uses (protected areas (PA), natural forest logging concessions (LC), timber plantation concessions (TC) and oil-palm plantation concessions (OC)) and two mixed land uses (mixed concessions and the overlap between concessions and PA) were assessed. The rate of deforestation was found to be lowest for PA, followed by LC. Deforestation rates for all land uses tended to be highest for locations that share the characteristics of areas in which TC or OC are located (e.g. degraded areas), suggesting that these areas are inherently more susceptible to deforestation due to foregone opportunities. Our approach provides important insights into how multifunctional landscapes can be designed to enhance the protection of biodiversity.

AB  - Mangrove forest plays a critical role in the context of climate change in tropical and subtropical regions. The present study analyzed the deforestation and reforestation from land-use and land-cover changes from 1990, 2000, 2009 and 2015 in North Sumatran mangrove forest, Indonesia. The land-use/land-cover consists of thirteen classes namely, primary mangrove forest, secondary mangrove forest, shrub, swamp shrub, swamp, settlement, paddy field, oil palm plantation, aquaculture, dry land farming, mixed dry land farming, mining, and barren land. Results showed that primary mangrove forests significantly decreased 61.21% from 1990 to 2015, mostly deforestation was derived from 1990 to 2000 to be secondary mangrove forest and swamp shrub. During 25 years observed, no reforestation was noted in the primary mangrove forest. Similarly, secondary mangrove forest had been degraded from 56,128.75 ha in 1990 to only 35,768.48 ha in 2015. Drivers of deforestation found in secondary mangrove forests were aquaculture (43.32%), barren land (32.56%), swamp shrub (10.88%), and oil palm plantation (5.17%). On the other hand, reforested activity was occurred only 701.83 ha from 1990 to 2015, while the nonforest use has been increased. These data are likely to contribute towards coastal management planning, conservation, and rehabilitation of degraded mangrove forests.

TI  - Allometric equations for estimating tree biomass in restored mixed-species Atlantic Forest stands
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoration of Atlantic Forests is receiving increasing attention because of its role in both biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration for global climate change mitigation. This study was carried out in an Atlantic Forest restoration project in the south-central region of Sao Paulo State - Brazil to develop allometric equations to estimate tree biomass of indigenous tree species in mixed plantations. Above and below-ground biomass (AGB and BGB, respectively), stem diameter (DBH: diameter at 1.3 m height), tree height (H: total height) and specific wood density (WD) were measured for 60 trees of 19 species. Different biomass equations (linear and nonlinear-transformed) were adjusted to estimate AGB and BGB as a function of DBH, H and WD. For estimating AGB and BGB, the linear biomass equation models were the least accurate. The transformed nonlinear biomass equation that used log DBH2, log H and log WD as predictor variables were the most accurate for AGB and the transformed nonlinear biomass equations that used log DBH2*WD as predictor variables were the most accurate for BGB. It is concluded that these adjusted equations can be used to estimate the AGB and BGB in areas of the studied project. The adjusted equations can be recommended for use elsewhere in the region for forest stands of similar age, tree size ranges, species composition and site characteristics.

TI  - Optimal temperature and energy efficiency in the germination of Moringa oleifera Lam.: Implications for use in ecological restoration programs in degraded areas
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Moringa oleifera Lam. is a species with significant potential for use in restoration programs in degraded areas. The species is used in folk medicine, water purification, as forage, as a condiment, among other ends, and has the ability to create an environment conducive to the establishment of other species. However, low seed germination rates and limited vegetative propagation are important challenges. Temperature stands out among the variables that have a strong impact on the germination of seeds of this species. Therefore, this study evaluated the impact of temperature on the germination of M. oleifera seeds in order to determine the ideal thermal range and calculate the net energy (enthalpy) change of activation of germination, in addition to the thermal implications for the establishment of this plant in degraded areas under ecological restoration. To this end, an experiment was conducted using six seed batches collected in an Atlantic Forest environment in Northeastern Brazil from the 2020 and 2021 harvests. The seeds were subjected to constant temperatures of 5 to 40 degrees C. Analyses were performed to evaluate seed germination parameters. Regression analyses were performed to explore the relationships between variables, the net energy variation to understand the energy availability during germination, and a Principal Component Analysis was performed to identify patterns and reduce data dimensionality. The seeds of M. oleifera germinated between 10 and 40 degrees C, and the optimal temperature was 26 degrees C. The highest germination speed index (GSI) values were observed between 30 and 35 degrees C, with the optimal temperature of 28 degrees C for this variable, which promoted rapid and uniform germination. The energy change (Delta H61/4) was 11.29 Kcal/mol at 25 degrees C, 9.65 Kcal/mol at 30 degrees C, and 10.78 Kcal/mol at 35 degrees C. Therefore, optimal temperatures for germination (from 25 to 35 degrees C) favor rapid and uniform germination, essential for the success use of the species in environmental restoration programs.

TI  - Deterministic modelling of seed dispersal based on observed behaviours of an endemic primate in Brazil
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant species models are among the available tools to predict the future of ecosystems threatened by climate change, habitat loss, and degradation. However, they suffer from low to no inclusion of plant dispersal, which is necessary to predict ecosystem evolution. A variety of seed dispersal models have been conceived for anemochorous and zoochorous plant species, but the coupling between vegetation models and seed dispersal processes remains rare. The main challenge in modelling zoochoric dispersal is simulating animal movements in their complex habitat. Recent developments allow straightforward applications of hidden Markov modelling (HMM) to animal movements, which could ease generalizations when modelling zoochoric seed dispersal. We tested the use of HMM to model seed dispersal by an endangered primate in the Brazilian Atlantic forest, to demonstrate its potential simplicity to simulate seed dispersal processes. We also discuss how to adapt it to other species. We collected information on movement, fruit consumption, deposition, and habitat use of Leontopithecus chrysomelas. We analysed daily trajectories using HMM and built a deterministic Model Of Seed Transfer (MOST), which replicated, with good approximation, the primate's movement and seed deposition patterns as observed in the field. Our results suggest that the dispersal behaviour and short daily-trajectories of L. chrysomelas restrict the species' role in large-scale forest regeneration, but contribute to the prevalence of resource tree species locally, and potentially maintaining tree diversity by preventing local extinction. However, it may be possible to accurately simulate dispersal in an area, without necessarily quantifying variables that influence movement, if the movement can be broken down to step-length and turning angles, and parametrised along with the distribution of gut-transit times. For future objectives, coupling MOST with a DVM could be used to test hypotheses on tree species survival in various scenarios, simulating regeneration and growth at regional scales by including data on main dispersal agents over the area of interest, distribution of tree species, and land use data. The principal advantage of the MOST model is its functionality with data available from the literature as the variables are easy to parametrise. We suggest using the coupled model to perform experiments using only available information, but varying the numbers and species of seed dispersers, or modifying land cover or configuration to test for possible thresholds preventing the extinction of selected tree species.

TI  - Spatial identification of lost-and-found carbon hotspots at Javanese rice systems, Indonesia
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - CONTEXT: Agricultural landscapes play a crucial role in global carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. The presence of trees outside forests has been recognized as a significant carbon pool, but it is crucial to acknowledge that these trees serve purposes beyond being a carbon sink. This study focuses on integrating border trees and home gardens as distinct land use classes in Indonesian Javanese agricultural land to assess their impact on carbon stock potential and biodiversity connections.OBJECTIVE: The objective is to classify and quantify the tree composition of these classes, estimate their carbon stock potential, analyze plant species diversity, and identify the ecological connections between home gardens and field borders.METHODS: To achieve this, high-resolution multispectral and Synthetic Aperture Radar images were used from four sampling areas covering 100 km2 each in Lamongan and Malang districts, East Java, Indonesia, for land cover/land use mapping. The land use function method was used to identify border trees and home gardens as separate land use classes. Carbon stock potential was estimated based on tree cover composition, while plant species diversity was analyzed through field surveys and farmer focus group discussions.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Crops with border trees cover approximately 28% to 48% of the cropland area in the study sites, while home gardens represent about 74% to 85% of the settlement area. This suggests a potential to double tree presence in these sites by adopting border trees and home gardens practices across the entire area. The median tree cover ratio was around 27% for border trees and 33% for home gardens. This stratification approach identified 31% to 50% more carbon stock compared to calculations using standard classes. Furthermore, home gardens and border trees show a positive correlation with species richness, indicating their role as keepers of biodiversity. Therefore, home gardens and border trees could serve as a sustainability indicator for agricultural land in the Javanese farm system.SIGNIFICANCE: This research contributes to sustainable agricultural practices and climate change mitigation. The stratification approach of identifying border trees and home gardens offers a cost-effective approach for the better computation of carbon stock and can lead to effective land use policies and conservation measures that promote ecological resilience. The study provides valuable insights for similar agricultural contexts worldwide, guiding efforts toward a more sustainable agricultural future.

TI  - Land use change and carbon fluxes in East Africa quantified using earth observation data and field measurements
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon-based forest conservation requires the establishment of 'reference emission levels' against which to measure a country or region's progress in reducing their carbon emissions. In East Africa, landscape-scale estimates of carbon fluxes are uncertain and factors such as deforestation poorly resolved due to a lack of data. In this study, trends in vegetation cover and carbon for East Africa were quantified using moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover grids from 2002 to 2008 (500-m spatial resolution), in combination with a regional carbon look-up table. The inclusion of data on rainfall and the distribution of protected areas helped to gauge impacts on vegetation burning (assessed using 1-km spatial resolution MODIS active fire data) and biome trends. Between 2002 and 2008, the spatial extents of forests, woodlands and scrublands decreased considerably and East Africa experienced a net carbon loss of 494 megatonnes (Mt). Most countries in the area were sources of carbon emissions, except for Tanzania and Malawi, where the areal increase of savannah and woodlands counterbalanced carbon emissions from deforestation. Both Malawi and Tanzania contain large areas of planted forest. Vegetation burning was correlated with rainfall (forest only) and differed depending on land management. Freely available global earth observation products have provided ways to achieve rapid assessment and monitoring of carbon change hotspots at the landscape scale.

TI  - A paradigm shift to CO2 sequestration to manage global warming - With the emphasis on developing countries
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Global land use changes that tend to satisfy the food needs of augmenting population is provoking agricultural soils to act as a carbon (C) source rather than sink. Agricultural management practices are crucial to offset the anthropogenic C emission; hence, Carbon sequestration (CS) in agriculture is a viable option for reversing this cycle, but it is based on hypotheses that must be questioned in order to contribute to the development of new agricultural techniques. This review summarizes a global perspective focusing on 5 developing countries (DC) (Bangladesh, Brazil, Argentina, Nigeria and Mexico) because of their importance on global C budget and on the agricultural sector as well as the impact produced by several global practices such as tillage, agroforestry systems, silvopasture, 4p1000 on CO2 sequestration. We also discussed about global policies regarding CS and tools available to measure CS. We found that among all practices agroforestry deemed to be the most promising approach and conversion from pasture to agroforestry will be favorable to both farmers and in changing climate, (e.g., agroforestry systems can generate 725 Euroeq C credit in EU) while some strategies (e.g. no-tillage) supposed to be less promising and over-hyped. In terms of conservative tillage (no-, reduced-, and minimal tillage systems), global and DCs land use increased. However, the impact of no-tillage is ambiguous since the beneficial impact is only limited to top soil (0-10 cm) as opposed to conventional mechanisms. Grasses, cereals and cover crops have higher potential of CS in their soils. While the 4p1000 initiative appears to be successful in certain areas, further research is needed to validate this possible mode of CS. Furthermore, for effective policy design and implementation to obtain more SOC stock, we strongly emphasize to include farmers globally as they are the one and only sustainable driver, hence, government and associated authorities should take initiatives (e.g., stimulus incentives, C credits) to form C market and promote C plantings. Otherwise, policy failure may occur. Moreover, to determine the true effect of these activities or regulations on CS, we must concurrently analyze SOC stock adjustments using models or direct measurements. Above all, SOC is the founding block of sustainable agriculture and inextricably linked with food security. Climate-smart managing of agriculture is very crucial for a massive SOC stock globally especially in DCs. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Traditional Subsistence Farming of Smallholder Agroforestry Systems in Indonesia: A Review
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Agroforestry has been practiced for decades and is undoubtedly an important source of income for Indonesian households living near forests. However, there are still many cases of poverty among farmers due to a lack of ability to adopt advanced technology. This literature review aims to identify the characteristics and factors causing the occurrence of agricultural subsistence and analyze its implications for the level of farmer welfare and the regional forestry industry. The literature analysis conducted reveals that small land tenure, low literacy rates, and lack of forest maintenance are the main causes of the subsistence of small agroforestry farmers. Another reason is that subsistence-oriented agroforestry practices are considered a strong form of smallholder resilience. All of these limitations have implications for low land productivity and high-sawn timber waste from community forests. To reduce the subsistence level of farmers, government intervention is needed, especially in providing managerial assistance packages, capital assistance, and the marketing of forest products. Various agroforestry technologies are available but have not been implemented consistently by farmers. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an integrated collaboration between researchers, farmers, and regionally owned enterprises (BUMD) to increase access to technology and markets. Although it is still difficult to realize, forest services, such as upstream-downstream compensation and carbon capture, have the potential to increase farmer income.

TI  - Environmental performance of cocoa production from monoculture and agroforestry systems in Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia is seeking to expand its cocoa production to meet the increased international demand. However, this effort faces economies of scale and ecological challenges. This research aims at evaluating environmental performance of cocoa production from cocoa monoculture and cocoa-agroforestry by life cycle assessment based on ISO 14040 and 14044, with adaptation for local impact indicators. This study defined cocoa-agroforestry as raw and sequential of cocoa-coconut and cocoa-rubber agroforestry, combined with shading trees Leucaena sp. and Gliricidia sepium. The analysis considered cocoa production at farm level, from cradle to on-farm gate boundary for 1 metric tonne of cocoa pod. The results showed that cocoa-coconut agroforestry had the least contribution to global impact categories of global warming, acidification and eutrophication, accounting for 3.67E+01 kgCO(2)-eq, 4.31E-02 kgSO(2)-eq, and 2.25E-05 kgPO(4)-eq respectively. Cocoa-coconut agroforestry also had the highest organic carbon and soil organic matter, conditions supporting the growth and activity of beneficial soil microbeds (Pseudomonas sp. and Trichoderma sp.). In addition, total land equivalent ratio of cocoa-coconut agroforestry had the highest value at 1.36, indicating a highest yield advantage was gained. Therefore, cocoa-coconut agroforestry could be a wise option to promote environmental sustainability of cocoa cultivation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Carbon Footprint Analysis of Cocoa Product Indonesia Using Life Cycle Assessment Methods
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The production of cocoa beans in Indonesia into chocolate and other cocoa-derived products produces emissions that pollute the environment. This research aimed to calculate the carbon footprint of the cocoa agroindustry using the Life Cycle Assessment approach in Lampung, Indonesia. The LCA under study is within the scope of Cradle to Grave, starting from nurseries_cocoa plantations_dry cocoa beans_chocolate production_retail, and consum-ers with emission function units per 1 kg of product. The method refers to the ISO 14040:2006 life cycle assess-ment standard, with the stages of determining objectives and scope, inventory analysis, impact assessment, and interpretation of recommendations. Primary data was analyzed using Simapro 9.4.0.2 Software. Secondary data was collected through a literature study. Data analysis shows the highest environmental impact after normaliza-tion resulting from four activities: packaging, transportation from industry to marketing office, and transportation from marketing office to retail. The highest environmental impact is generated by industrial activities, with a total emission of 2.57E-10 per kg of dark chocolate. In this study, GWP 100a emissions from cocoa agroforestry and agroindustry activities within the scope of the Cradle to Grave study were 7.31E+01kg CO2-eq per kg dark chocolate. In addition, selecting the type of packaging is an indicator that must be considered. Using a combination of alumi-num foil, paper, and cardboard as packaging causes the second highest emission in the packaging sub-process after transportation from industry to marketing office in industrial activities. It is the 4th highest of all activities. One of the reasons for the high emissions produced in the final product or cocoa consumed by consumers is no longer in doubt. On the basis of normalization activities, the highest environmental impacts were generated by industrial activities, with a total emission of 2.57E-10. The use of packaging in packaging and fuel activities in transportation from industry to marketing office activities, industrial activities also use quite a large amount of electrical energy, namely 421.91 kWh.Recommendations for improvement can be identified to reduce the GHG impact and increase energy efficiency. Energy-saving sustainablemethods constitute a challenge for the cocoa agroindustry because they positively impact the reduction of the global warming potential.

TI  - Soil carbon dynamics in integrated agricultural systems in Minas Gerais state, Brazil: A meta-analysis
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, has one of the highest rates of carbon dioxide emission in the country with a large part of these emissions attributed to extensive livestock on degraded pastures. Integrated agricultural production systems are considered a promising strategy to alleviate the negative impacts on soil caused by agriculture (e.g., soil carbon losses via CO2 emissions) while keeping food production. However, the extent to which integrated systems [i.e., integrated crop -livestock (ICL) and integrated crop -livestock -forestry (ICLF)] can contribute to counterbalance soil organic carbon (SOC) losses is limited. Here, through a meta -analysis, we provide a regional -scale assessment of changes in SOC stocks associated with the adoption of ICL and ICLF systems in Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Additionally, we further investigated how SOC dynamics in these systems are affected by distinct soil (e.g., texture, depth) and climatic (e.g., temperature, precipitation) variables. Our results indicate that both ICL and ICLF systems resulted in SOC accrual after their implementation, at average rates of 1.09 and 1.21 Mg ha  1 yr  1, respectivelly. The age of the system affected SOC stocks only in the ICLF system, particularly between 4 and 8 years, in which SOC stocks increased at an average rate of 1.3 Mg ha  1 yr  1. While SOC stocks decreased in clay -sandy soils under ICLF systems, they increased in clay loam soils (1.06 Mg ha  1 yr  1). No clear trend was observed for ICL systems regarding soil texture. Positive effects of precipitation on SOC stocks in ICLF and ICL systems were observed only between 880 and 1000 and 1500-1700 mm, respectively. Clear effects of temperature on SOC stocks were observed only between 22 and 25 degrees C in ICLF systems. Soil depth had no significant effect on the rate of SOC stock change in the systems evaluated. Although the observed results help to better understand how integrated agricultural systems can affect SOC dynamics, the lack of detailed information in the studies used in our meta -analysis limits statically comparisons. However, our results indicate clear trends that ICLF and ICL systems can contribute to increasing SOC sequestration, and which climate and soil characteristics might be considered to maximize the efficiency of these systems in increasing SOC across Minas Gerais state, Brazil.

TI  - Hydrology and carbon dynamics of tropical peatlands from Southeast Brazil
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands are important natural carbon reservoirs and regulators of water flow and of its dynamic in many natural areas. The structural integrity of these systems has been recognizably threatened by anthropic interventions but has also been significantly influenced by the global climate changes. This study aimed to characterize the water and carbon dynamics in watersheds of two peats independently supplying the Aracuai River basin in the northeastern Minas Gerais state, Brazil. The peats, which were found to be in different states of natural conservation, were investigated for their physical and chemical characteristics, both of the peats and of their stored water. The C-14 isotopic analyses of the peat and measurements of the water and organic carbon storage capacity of these peats were performed. The geneses of the corresponding profiles were found to have initiated between the early Holocene (7664 years BP) and the late Pleistocene (11,129 years BP) periods with a vertical growing rate between 0.10 and 0.61 mm y(-1). The difference in the degree of natural conservation on the dynamic of water and carbon between these peats was checked by the water and soil attributes. Large quantities of water (mean value for these two peats, approximately 10,108 m(3) ha(-1)) and organic carbon (200 ton C ha(-1)) were presumably stored during its pedogenetic history. The more anthropically altered peat presented a negative carbon balance and lower water flow in the dry season. The influence of human activities on their carbon and water dynamics reinforces the importance of protecting and conserving these native areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Minimum age for clear-cutting native species with energetic potential in the Brazilian semi-arid region
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - What is the minimum age for clear-cutting native species with energetic potential in the Brazilian semi-arid region? This was the central question of this study, which aimed at estimating the minimum cutting cycle for native woody species from an area covered by a sustainable forest management plan. Individuals (n = 240) of 12 species native to the semi-arid region were measured, and wood discs were taken from them to collect data relative to (i) volume, by an industrial 3D scanner, (ii) density, using a high-frequency densitometer, (iii) age, by a growth ring measuring device, and (iv) the lower heating value, by an oxygen bomb calorimeter and an elemental analyzer. Data were fitted to mathematical models by regression analysis to determine the relationship and significance between the variables analyzed. The estimated minimum age for the harvesting of native woody species was 47 years, determined by the age at which there was stabilization of volume growth curves over time and an increase in density and heating power (wood retraction).

TI  - Assessing the INDCs' land use, land use change, and forest emission projections
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In preparation for the 2015 international climate negotiations in Paris, Parties submitted Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) expressing each countries' respective post-2020 climate actions. In this paper we assess individual Parties' expected reduction of emissions/removals from land use, land use change, and forest (LULUCF) sector for reaching their INDC target, and the aggregate global effect on the INDCs on the future development of emission and removals from the LULUCF sector. This has been done through analysis Parties' official information concerning the role of LULUCF mitigation efforts for reaching INDC targets as presented in National Communications, Biennial Update Reports, and Additional file 1.Results: On the aggregate global level, the Parties themselves perceive that net LULUCF emissions will increase over time. Overall, the net LULUCF emissions are estimated to increase by 0.6 Gt CO(2)e year(-1) (range: 0.1-1.1) in 2020 and 1.3 Gt CO(2)e year(-1) (range: 0.7-2.1) in 2030, both compared to 2010 levels. On the other hand, the full implementation of the INDCs is estimated to lead to a reduction of net LULUCF emissions in 2030 compared to 2010 levels. It is estimated that if all conditional and unconditional INDCs are implemented, net LULUCF emissions would decrease by 0.5 Gt CO(2)e year(-1) (range: 0.2-0.8) by 2020 and 0.9 Gt CO(2)e year(-1) (range: 0.5-1.3) by 2030, both compared to 2010 levels. The largest absolute reductions of net LULUCF emissions (compared to 2010 levels) are expected from Indonesia and Brazil, followed by China and Ethiopia.Conclusions: The results highlights that countries are expecting a significant contribution from the LULUCF sector to meet their INDC mitigation targets. At the global level, the LULUCF sector is expected to contribute to as much as 20% of the full mitigation potential of all the conditional and unconditional INDC targets. However, large uncertainties still surround how Parties estimate, project and account for emissions and removals from the LULUCF sector. While INDCs represent a new source of land-use information, further information and updates of the INDCs will be required to reduce uncertainty of the LULUCF projections.

TI  - Phenology of Guarea macrophylla Vahl (Meliaceae) in subtropical riparian forest in southern Brazil
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate is one of the main factors that affect plant behavior. The phenology of Guarea macrophylla Vahl, which is a small tree used for reforestation of degraded areas, was monitored for 18 months in a riparian forest at the Schmidt Stream, Campo Bom, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. Vegetative (leaf fall and leaf flushing) and reproductive events were observed, with the latter divided into flowering (flower buds and anthesis) and fruiting (unripe, ripening and ripe fruit). Phonological events were related to temperature, photoperiod and precipitation and their seasonality was verified by circular statistical analysis. Vegetative phenophases were continuous: they were not related to climate factors and presented low intensity, emphasizing the perennial aspect of the species. Flowering occurred during spring and summer. Both flower buds and anthesis were related to temperature and photoperiod. Fruiting was constant and went through all stages of development. Unripe fruits developed during the months with the lowest photoperiod and ripen more intensely in winter, on colder days. Ripe fruit became available for dispersal in spring, in times of longer photoperiod and higher temperatures. Except for leaf fall, all other phenological events showed seasonality in their manifestation. The one-month difference between the onsets of the flowering phases observed in this study indicated that local climate changes induced the early occurrence of this phenophase.

TI  - Assessing the carbon capture potential of a reforestation project
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The number of reforestation projects worldwide is increasing. In many cases funding is obtained through the claimed carbon capture of the trees, presented as immediate and durable, whereas reforested plots need time and maintenance to realise their carbon capture potential. Further, claims usually overlook the environmental costs of natural or anthropogenic disturbances during the forest's lifetime, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the reforestation are not allowed for. This study uses life cycle assessment to quantify the carbon footprint of setting up a reforestation plot in the Peruvian Amazon. In parallel, we combine a soil carbon model with an above- and below-ground plant carbon model to predict the increase in carbon stocks after planting. We compare our results with the carbon capture claims made by a reforestation platform. Our results show major errors in carbon accounting in reforestation projects if they (1) ignore the time needed for trees to reach their carbon capture potential; (2) ignore the GHG emissions involved in setting up a plot; (3) report the carbon capture potential per tree planted, thereby ignoring limitations at the forest ecosystem level; or (4) under-estimate tree losses due to inevitable human and climatic disturbances. Further, we show that applications of biochar during reforestation can partially compensate for project emissions.

TI  - Spatiotemporal density patterns of the pest predator Rhynchium haemorrhoidale (F.) along a land-use gradient in cacao agroforestry systems
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical insect species show year-round breeding activity due to favourable climatic conditions. However, most species also display seasonal reproductive peaks, but little is known about underlying causes of temporal density changes. We investigated population dynamics of the pest predator Rhynchium haemorrhoidale (F.) (Hymenoptera: Eumenidae) and its natural enemies in relation to season, climate and varying shade tree composition in cacao agroforestry systems in Central Sulawesi (Indonesia). Nesting of R. haemorrhoidale showed clear seasonality with highest densities in the wet season and lowest in the dry season, which was not related to changes in temperature. Wasp densities increased with land-use intensity, presumably because less-shaded areas offer more favourable climatic conditions and higher densities of the major prey, the cacao pest Agathodes caliginosalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). Pupal body size was higher in June than in November indicating increasing intraspecific competition due to high wasp densities and food shortage at the beginning of the wet season. Body size between habitat types was similar, thus season appeared to be more important than habitat in terms of food supply. High wasp densities in the wet season were associated with high diversity of the altogether seven parasitoid species. In conclusion, we found a pronounced seasonality of the wasp R. haemorrhoidale and a preference for little shaded agroforestry, which may be due to enhanced temperature and density of its prey. Our data indicate a high potential for biological control of a major cacao pest by management of nesting sites of R. haemorrhoidale.

TI  - Machine Learning Model Reveals Land Use and Climate's Role in Caatinga Wildfires: Present and Future Scenarios
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires significantly impact ecosystems, economies, and biodiversity, particularly in fire-prone regions like the Caatinga biome in Northeastern Brazil. This study integrates machine learning with climate and land use data to model current and future fire dynamics in the Caatinga. Using MaxEnt, fire probability maps were generated based on historical fire scars from Landsat imagery and environmental predictors, including bioclimatic variables and human influences. Future projections under SSP1-2.6 (low-emission) and SSP5-8.5 (high-emission) scenarios were also analyzed. The baseline model achieved an AUC of 0.825, indicating a strong predictive performance. Key drivers of fire risk included the mean temperature of the driest quarter (with an importance of 14.1%) and isothermality (12.5%). Temperature-related factors were more influential than precipitation, which played a secondary role in shaping fire dynamics. Anthropogenic factors, such as proximity to farming and urban areas, also contributed to fire susceptibility. Under the optimistic scenario, low-fire-probability areas expanded to 29.129 Mha, suggesting a reduced fire risk with climate mitigation. However, high-risk zones persisted in the Western Caatinga. The pessimistic scenario projected an alarming expansion of very-high-risk areas to 12.448 Mha, emphasizing the vulnerability of the region under severe climate conditions. These findings underline the importance of temperature dynamics and human activities in shaping fire regimes. Future research should incorporate additional variables, such as vegetation recovery and socio-economic factors, to refine predictions. This study provides critical insights for targeted fire management and land use planning, promoting the sustainable conservation of the Caatinga under changing climatic conditions.

TI  - Emerging challenges for sustainable development and forest conservation in Sarawak, Borneo
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The forests of Borneo-the third largest island on the planet-sustain some of the highest biodiversity and carbon storage in the world. The forests also provide vital ecosystem services and livelihood support for millions of people in the region, including many indigenous communities. The Pan-Borneo Highway and several hydroelectric dams are planned or already under construction in Sarawak, a Malaysian state comprising part of the Borneo. This development seeks to enhance economic growth and regional connectivity, support community access to services, and promote industrial development. However, the implications of the development of highway and dams for forest integrity, biodiversity and ecosystem services remained largely unreported. We assessed these development projects using fine-scale biophysical and environmental data and found several environmental and socioeconomic risks associated with the projects. The highway and hydroelectric dam projects will impact 32 protected areas including numerous key habitats of threatened species such as the proboscis monkey (Nasalis larvatus), Sarawak surili (Presbytis chrysomelas), Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) and tufted ground squirrel (Rheithrosciurus macrotis). Under its slated development trajectory, the local and trans-national forest connectivity between Malaysian Borneo and Indonesian Borneo would also be substantially diminished. Nearly similar to 161 km of the Pan-Borneo Highway in Sarawak will traverse forested landscapes and similar to 55 km will traverse carbon-rich peatlands. The 13 hydroelectric dam projects will collectively impact similar to 1.7 million ha of forest in Sarawak. The consequences of planned highway and hydroelectric dams construction will increase the carbon footprint of development in the region. Moreover, many new road segments and hydroelectric dams would be built on steep slopes in high-rainfall zones and forested areas, increasing both construction and ongoing maintenance costs. The projects would also alter livelihood activities of downstream communities, risking their long-term sustainability. Overall, our findings identify major economic, social and environmental risks for several planned road segments in Sarawak-such as those between Telok Melano and Kuching; Sibu and Bintulu; and in the Lambir, Limbang and Lawas regions-and dam projects-such as Tutoh, Limbang, Lawas, Baram, Linau, Ulu Air and Baleh dams. Such projects need to be reviewed to ensure they reflect Borneo's unique environmental and forest ecosystem values, the aspirations of local communities and long-term sustainability of the projects rather than being assessed solely on their short-term economic returns.

TI  - A Spatial Structure of Key Tree Species Metrodorea nigra St. Hill. (Rutaceae) Is Associated with Historical Disturbance and Isolation in Southeastern Brazil
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The semi-deciduous Brazilian Atlantic Forest has faced intense fragmentation, impacting Metrodorea nigra St. Hill., a fly-pollinated and autochorous tree. We investigated population structure, inbreeding, and spatial genetic structure (SGS) across adult (Adu) and juvenile (Juv) generations in three fragmented populations of M. nigra in Ribeir & atilde;o Preto, S & atilde;o Paulo, Brazil. We tested whether the magnitude of these effects could result from its mating system, seed dispersal, anthropogenic disturbances, matrix, and fragment size. Populations affected by selective logging, fire, and trail openings include M13-Rib (84 ha) and FAC-Crav (8 ha), both surrounded by sugar cane and BSQ-Rib (3 ha) in an urban matrix. We evaluated phenological events and germination rates in the BSQ-Rib fragment. We sampled leaves and amplified their DNA using ISSR (UBC 1, 2, 820, 834, 851, 858, 860, 886) and SSR (Mtn 1, 3, 13, 16, 19, 87, 95) molecular markers. Fst, PCoA, and AMOVA values suggest a lack of generational isolation, with most variance within generations. Inbreeding values were significant in all populations (Fis and Fit, p = 0.001), probably intensified by natural seed dispersal and pollinator behavior favoring geitonogamy. However, fragmentation, anthropogenic disturbances, and the surrounding matrix influenced SGS. The urban BSQ-Rib fragment recorded the highest SGS values (26 m Juv, 24 m Adu [ISSR]; 7 m Juv, 9 m Adu [SSR]), which may result in low fruit and seed production and germination rates. Despite being the largest fragment, M13-Rib shows SGS in the first distance class (19 m Juv, 24 m Adu [ISSR]; 0 m Juv, and 10 m Adu [SSR]), possibly due to selective logging and fire. FAC-Crav, a more conserved fragment, showed no SGS in adults but punctual SGS in juveniles (27 m [ISSR] and 8 m [SSR]), pointing to it as a promising source for seed collections for reforestation purposes. In summary, inbreeding in M. nigra, influenced by pollinator behavior and seed dispersal, along with fragmentation, anthropogenic disturbances, and the surrounding matrix, are critical in shaping SGS. These factors potentially impact the reproductive success of M. nigra and their long-term survival in the face of climate change.

TI  - Salt-affected soils on elevated landforms of an alluvial megafan, northern Pantanal, Brazil
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt-affected soils play an important role in the Pantanal wetlands ecosystem, in Brazil, but their occurrence on higher landforms is not well understood. In order to investigate the major processes involved in salt-affected soil formation, a trench was opened in a representative transition between the floodplain and a paleochannel-paleolevee complex not currently reached by floodwater. The trench was 6 meter long and 2 meter deep, and 121 soil samples were collected in a 0.25 x 0.25 m regular grid and submitted for soil (particle-size, pH, exchangeable cations) and solution extract (major cation and anions) analyses. Analytical results were subjected to geostatistical and principal components analyses (PCA). For selected horizons, an undisturbed sample was collected to perform thin sections and micromorphology description. The presence of degraded carbonates in the soils indicated an ancient formation. The regional environmental settings of the alluvial fan and particle size variation along the soil profiles suggested that the sediments of the study site were deposited during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene, in a river channel-levee complex and an abandoned channel by avulsion processes. The depressed topography of the abandoned channel, accompanied by moderately drier climates during early Holocene, likely favored low leaching of salts and higher evapotranspiration, enabling the development of salt affected soils. Later erosion of the region, which is expected in older lobes of alluvial fans, triggered a relief inversion in the area, preserving the more clayey areas as a slightly higher landform with remaining salt-affected soils. Currently, the seasonal flooding mainly reaches the footslope of this landform, triggering redoximorphic processes, expressed as redox concentrations and depletions, and solodization processes, expressed by lower values of pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), base saturation and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) than at the summit. Thus, the occurrence of salt-affected soils on higher landforms is the reflection of a complex sedimentological history. In this way, the genesis of salt-affected soils on higher landforms, which seems to be poorly understood in many situations worldwide, should be carefully investigated in order to address formation mechanisms, especially in extremely dynamic environments of tropical wetlands.

TI  - Future perspectives of Brazilian beef production: what is the role of Silvopastoral systems?
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Against the backdrop of changing production conditions and market requirements, it seems time has come to rethink Brazil's beef production systems. We analyse the economic and environmental performance of three beef production systems: classic beef production system (CB), and two types of silvopastoral systems: the integrated crop-livestock-forestry system (ICLFS) and the natural regeneration system (NR) in a comparative case study analysis. We find that, though costs of production are the lowest for CB, only the ICLFS and NR case studies are generating long-term profits. While greenhouse gas emissions per kg live weight added are lowest in ICLFS, followed by NR and CB, per hectare (ha) emissions are highest in NR, followed by ICLFS and CB. Considering the system's carbon removal, NR and potentially ICLFS are sequestering more than releasing. Additionally, the land required to produce beef is lowest in NR, followed by ICLFS and CB. Considering the additional outputs produced by ICLFS and NR, they showcase the potential of multifunctional production systems for future scenarios, where land scarcity puts land-demanding production systems, such as beef, under pressure. The three production systems perform differently depending on the indicators analysed. How they will reply to future challenges depends on the location and the specific environment. Yet, from the analysed systems, CB is the least sustainable, economically and environmentally.

TI  - Effects of environmental protection policies on fragile areas of a watershed occupied by agriculture in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil has become an antagonist in natural resource conservation policies in recent years. The Brazilian Cerrado is one of the biomes most affected by this setback due to the occupation of areas of economic interest in agriculture. Interestingly, there are projects throughout the biome that aim to encourage the preservation of natural resources, but there is uncertainty about whether these incentives have provided conservation. That is the case of the Feio River hydrographic basin, located in the Cerrado, near the city of Patrocinio, state of Minas Gerais. Indeed, the Feio River watershed has projects incentivizing the Cerrado's conservation. Thus, in this article, we aimed to explain how the advance of agriculture in fragile areas of the Feio river watershed occurs, their causes and whether protection strategies have produced satisfactory results. We used an old Environmental Fragility proposal methodwith our contributions to estimate the variations regarding nature conservation in the basin. Our findings show considerable heterogeneity in the potential fragility of the Feio's river basin. We observe that less fragile sites are used for coffee cultivation (74 and 72% of the two places), while more fragile sites are occupied by reserves (around 50% of the area) and high-impact activities such as traditional monoculture and cattle ranching (25 and 44% for the two sites). Temporally, we observed little change in use and occupation, with a slight increase in no-till farming to replace coffee and conventional cultivation. The permanent preservation areas in the basin have improved vegetation quality, while the reserve areas composed of fields show a degradation process. Considering the importance of the Feio's river basin, different incentives and inspection strategies are needed to guarantee the site's preservation and environmental restoration.

TI  - A comparative framework of the Erythrina velutina tree species in reforested land and native populations
T2  - GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Erythrina velutina Willd. (Fabaceae: Papillionoideae) is a pioneer species found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world that has medicinal properties and that is used in reforestation projects. This species is rare in some areas of northeastern Brazil. This study aimed to characterize and compare genetic structures of natural and restored populations of E. velutina, with a focus on the selection of tree seeds. A total of 108 individuals from five natural populations and one restored population were analyzed using ISSR markers, resulting in 407 polymorphic fragments. A high rate of polymorphism was observed in the restored population. The highest genetic variability was identified within populations (82%). Genetic bottleneck tests were significant for the Carmopolis/Rosario do Catete and Laranjeiras natural populations along with the Laranjeiras restored population. Genetic distances significantly correlated with spatial distance. Only the restored population retained unique alleles. Similarly, increased genetic distance was observed in individuals of the restored populations compared to the other populations. Observed genetic variation in both natural and restored populations of E. velutina was moderate, thus enabling selection of divergent trees from those trees supplying seeds. Environmental protection and management of these areas is necessary for the maintenance of these individuals and subsequent reproduction. We recommend suggestions for E. velutina conservation, since the restoration model adopted in this study did not promote the development of the specimens until the reproductive stage in a fashion that aims to augment the soil seed bank supply, as is suggested for pioneer species.

TI  - Diffusion GHG fluxes at tropical peatland drainage canal water surfaces
T2  - Suo (Helsinki)
M3  - Article
AB  - Data on greenhouse gas (GHG) exchange between water surfaces and the atmosphere above tropical peatland drainage canals are lacking in the literature. We quantified diffusion fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N(2)o between the water surface and the atmosphere for two typical reclaimed peatland sites. One site was an industrial pulp wood plantation in the Kampar Peninsula (Sumatra) and the other was an abandoned peatland area in Kalimantan (Borneo). Drainage canal fluxes were measured by using floating closed chambers during both the wet and dry seasons. Fluxes at the sites were determined across a range of conditions that were created by varying land use histories, and also by canal biotic environment and hydrological features. Gas fluxes in the canal systems were influenced by their respective surrounding peatland areas, the season, and canal management. Fluxes of all three gases were higher at the more recently reclaimed settled (undisturbed) canals of the Kampar site in comparison to the Kalimantan site. In general, the mean flux from the canals ranged from 9-16, 0.1-1.1 and 0-0.003 g M-2 D-1 for CO2, CH4 and N2O, respectively. A cumulative equivalent annual emission of these three GHGs from canals was nearly three times higher at the Kampar site (13.8 kg CO2e m(-2) y(-1)) than that at the Kalimantan site (4.8 kg CO2e m(-2) y(-1)). Mean fluxes of the three gases and the cumulative annual emission at the Kampar site were higher in the settled canals in comparison to the disturbed canals when both dry and wet season fluxes were calculated. The fluxes of CH4 and N2O especially decreased when canals had been recently cleaned (i.e. were in disturbed condition). In terms of their relative global warming potentials (GWP), CO2 was the most important of the three GHG's both at the Kalimantan site settled canal (69% of the fluxes were attributed to CO2) and at the disturbed canals at the Kampar (82%) site, whereas CH4 dominated in settled canals at the Kampar site at 61% contribution to the total annual emission. CH4 contributed 31% to the total cumulative equivalent annual emission at the Kalimantan settled canal. N2O had only a minor role (0-2% of the cumulative fluxes) at the sites. On a unit area basis, GHG emissions from the drainage canals formed were generally higher emission sources in comparison to the surrounding peatland, and proportional contributions from the three GHG species to the total were more diverse in canals than on land.

TI  - Flower Visitation Time and Number of Visitor Species Are Reduced by the Use of Agrochemicals in Coffee Home Gardens
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Pollination services, from both wild and managed populations of insect pollinators, have degraded as a result of agricultural intensification. Whilst 75% of economically important crops depend on insect pollinators for cultivation, 40% of insect pollinator species are threatened with extinction. Pollination services must be preserved if there is to be enough food for a global population whose demand is expected to double, if not triple, by 2050. Pollinator diversity and pollinator efficiency have been found to increase as a result of wildlife-friendly farming practices (i.e., natural chemicals and fertilizers and agroforestry). We evaluated the presence of insect pollinators in 42 coffee home gardens in West Java, Indonesia. Via generalized linear mixed models, we found that number of visitor species (beta = 0.418 +/- SE 0.194, p = 0.031) and visitation time (beta = 0.845 +/- SE 0.308, p = 0.006) decreased as farms were more intensely managed, (i.e., used chemical pesticides), compared to fields using organic practices. As knowledge of pollination services is widespread amongst smallholder farmers in Indonesia and beyond due to the long-held tradition of beekeeping, these results will add to their existing knowledge and empower farmers to enhance resources for pollinator species through agroforestry and natural pest management. Although we found significant differences in pollination services provided in intensely managed and wildlife-friendly farms, chemical use can affect farms far beyond a particular area of production. Therefore, pollinator conservation must be applied at a landscape level and involve all stakeholders, including farmers, when making effective policies.

AB  - This work evaluated the response of two scenarios (4.5 and 8.5) of the Eta Model on the quality (sediment - TSS, nitrate - NO3- and phosphate - PO43-) and quantity (flow - Q) of the Concordia Catchment in the Atlantic forest biome. The importance of the work lies in the comparison of both scenarios until 2099, using current agricultural practices (2016). The SWAT model normally used for hydrological purposes has been applied to evaluate water quality from the monitoring programme database (2010-2014). Q showed a non-accentuated, upward trend. Modifications in Q were transmitted to TSS and PO43-. There was no significant difference between the tested scenarios.

TI  - Soil greenhouse gas emissions from inorganic fertilizers and recycled oil palm waste products from Indonesian oil palm plantations
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A continuous rise in the global demand for palm oil has resulted in the large-scale expansion of oil palm plantations and generated environmental controversy. Efforts to increase the sustainability of oil palm cultivation include the recycling of oil mill and pruning residues in the field, but this may increase soil methane (CH4) emissions. This study reports the results of yearlong field-based measurements of soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and CH4 emissions from commercial plantations in North Sumatra, Indonesia. One experiment investigated the effects of soil-water saturation on N2O and CH4 emissions from inorganic fertilizers and organic amendments by simulating 25 mm rainfall per day for 21 days. Three additional experiments focused on emissions from (a) inorganic fertilizer (urea), (b) combination of enriched mulch with urea and (c) organic amendments (empty fruit bunches, enriched mulch and pruned oil palm fronds) applied in different doses and spatial layouts (placed in inter-row zones, piles, patches or bands) for a full year. The higher dose of urea led to a significantly higher N2O emissions with the emission factors ranging from 2.4% to 2.7% in the long-term experiment, which is considerably higher than the IPCC standard of 1%. Organic amendments were a significant source of both N2O and CH(4 )emissions, but N2O emissions from organic amendments were 66%-86% lower than those from inorganic fertilizers. Organic amendments applied in piles emitted 63% and 71% more N2O and CH4, respectively, than when spread out. With twice the dose of organic amendments, cumulative emissions were up to three times greater. The (simulated) rainwater experiment showed that the increase in precipitation led to a significant increase in N2O emissions significantly, suggesting that the time of fertilization is a critical management option for reducing emissions. The results from this study could therefore help guide residue and nutrient management practices to reduce emissions while ensuring better nutrient recycling for sustainable oil palm production systems.

T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation management systems can improve soil organic matter stocks and contribute to atmospheric C mitigation. This study was carried out in a 18-year long-term experiment conducted on a subtropical Acrisol in Southern Brazil to assess the potential of tillage systems [conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT)], cropping systems [oat/maize (O/M), vetch/maize (V/M) and oat + vetch/maize + cowpea (OV/MC)] and N fertilization [0 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) (0 N) and 180 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) (180 N)] for mitigating atmospheric C. For that, the soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation and the C equivalent (CE) costs of the investigated management systems were taken into account in comparison to the CT O/M 0 N used as reference system. No-till is known to produce a less oxidative environment than CT and resulted in SOC accumulation, mainly in the 0-5 cm soil layer, at rates related to the addition of crop residues, which were increased by legume cover crops and N fertilization. Considering the reference treatment, the SOC accumulation rates in the 0-20 cm layer varied from 0.09 to 0.34 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) in CT and from 0.19 to 0.65 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) in NT. However, the SOC accumulation rates peaked during the first years (5th to 9th) after the adoption of the management practices and decreased exponentially over time, indicating that conservation soil management was a short-term strategy for atmospheric C mitigation. On the other hand, when the CE costs of tillage operations were taken into account, the benefits of NT to C mitigation compared to CT were enhanced. When CE costs related to N-based fertilizers were taken into account, the increases in SOC accumulation due to N did not necessarily improve atmospheric C mitigation, although this does not diminish the agricultural and economic importance of inorganic N fertilization.

TI  - Selecting plant species for practical restoration of degraded lands using a multiple-trait approach
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration is essential in rehabilitating degraded areas and safeguarding biodiversity, ecosystem services and human welfare. Using functional traits to plan restoration strategies has been suggested as they are the main ecological attributes that underlie ecosystem processes and services. However, few studies have translated ecological theory into actual restoration practices that can be easily used by different stakeholders. In this article, we applied a multiple-trait approach to select plant species for the restoration of degraded lands inside the Brazilian Amazon Forests. We selected 10 traits encompassing ease of management, geographical distribution and interactions with animals and other ecosystem services and scored these traits using 118 native species. Then, we ranked all species according to the total number of traits that they exhibited to obtain a list of 53 highly ranked species. In addition, we employed non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to assess the variation in these traits across the entire group of species. Based on the results, we selected a subset of species that maximizes functional diversity (high variability). We performed a sparse linear discriminant analysis (SLDA) to highlight a minimum set of traits to effectively discriminate botanical families. The final list of species and their traits highlight the importance of preserving not only the historical reference of a focused ecosystem but also its functional diversity to restore the interaction with local fauna, enrich the food chain and guarantee ecosystem services for local communities.

TI  - Life cycle assessment of soybean-based biodiesel in Argentina for export
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional specificities are a key factor when analyzing the environmental impact of a biofuel pathway through a life cycle assessment (LCA). Due to different energy mixes, transport distances, agricultural practices and land use changes, results can significantly vary from one country to another. The Republic of Argentina is the first exporter of soybean oil and meal and the third largest soybean producer in the world, and therefore, soybean-based biodiesel production is expected to significantly increase in the near future, mostly for exportation. Moreover, Argentinean biodiesel producers will need to evaluate the environmental performances of their product in order to comply with sustainability criteria being developed. However, because of regional specificities, the environmental performances of this biofuel pathway can be expected to be different from those obtained for other countries and feedstocks previously studied. This work aims at analyzing the environmental impact of soybean-based biodiesel production in Argentina for export. The relevant impact categories account for the primary non-renewable energy consumption (CED), the global warming potential (GWP), the eutrophication potential (EP), the acidification potential (AP), the terrestrial ecotoxicity (TE), the aquatic ecotoxicity (AE), the human toxicity (HT) and land use competition (LU). The paper tackles the feedstock and country specificities in biodiesel production by comparing the results of soybean-based biodiesel in Argentina with other reference cases. Emphasis is put on explaining the factors that contribute most to the final results and the regional specificities that lead to different results for each biodiesel pathway.The Argentinean (AR) biodiesel pathway was modelled through an LCA and was compared with reference cases available in the ecoinventA (R) 2.01 database, namely, soybean-based biodiesel production in Brazil (BR) and the United States (US), rapeseed-based biodiesel production in the European Union (EU) and Switzerland (CH) and palm-oil-based biodiesel production in Malaysia (MY). In all cases, the systems were modelled from feedstock production to biodiesel use as B100 in a 28 t truck in CH. Furthermore, biodiesel pathways were compared with fossil low-sulphur diesel produced and used in CH. The LCA was performed according to the ISO standards. The life cycle inventory and the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) were performed in Excel spreadsheets using the ecoinventA (R) 2.01 database. The cumulative energy demand (CED) and the GWP were estimated through the CED for fossil and nuclear energy and the IPCC 2001 (climate change) LCIA methods, respectively. Other impact categories were assessed according to CML 2001, as implemented in ecoinvent. As the product is a fuel for transportation (service), the system was defined for one vehicle kilometre (functional unit) and was divided into seven unit processes, namely, agricultural phase, soybean oil extraction and refining, transesterification, transport to port, transport to the destination country border, distribution and utilisation.The Argentinean pathway results in the highest GWP, CED, AE and HT compared with the reference biofuel pathways. Compared with the fossil reference, all impact categories are higher for the AR case, except for the CED. The most significant factor that contributes to the environmental impact in the Argentinean case varies depending on the evaluated category. Land provision through deforestation for soybean cultivation is the most impacting factor of the AR biodiesel pathway for the GWP, the CED and the HT categories. Whilst nitrogen oxide emissions during the fuel use are the main cause of acidification, nitrate leaching during soybean cultivation is the main factor of eutrophication. LU is almost totally affected by arable land occupation for soybean cultivation. Cypermethrin used as pesticide in feedstock production accounts for almost the total impact on TE and AE.The sensitivity analysis shows that an increase of 10% in the soybean yield, whilst keeping the same inputs, will reduce the total impact of the system. Avoiding deforestation is the main challenge to improve the environmental performances of soybean-based biodiesel production in AR. If the soybean expansion can be done on marginal and set-aside agricultural land, the negative impact of the system will be significantly reduced. Further implementation of crops' successions, soybean inoculation, reduced tillage and less toxic pesticides will also improve the environmental performances. Using ethanol as alcohol in the transesterification process could significantly improve the energy balance of the Argentinean pathway.The main explaining factors depend on regional specificities of the system that lead to different results from those obtained in the reference cases. Significantly different results can be obtained depending on the level of detail of the input data, the use of punctual or average data and the assumptions made to build up the LCA inventory. Further improvement of the AR biodiesel pathways should be done in order to comply with international sustainability criteria on biofuel production.Due to the influence of land use changes in the final results, more efforts should be made to account for land use changes others than deforestation. More data are needed to determine the part of deforestation attributable to soybean cultivation. More efforts should be done to improve modelling of interaction between variables and previous crops in the agricultural phase, future transesterification technologies and market prices evolution. In order to assess more accurately the environmental impact of soybean-based biodiesel production in Argentina, further considerations should be made to account for indirect land use changes, domestic biodiesel consumption and exportation to other regions, production scale and regional georeferenced differentiation of production systems.

TI  - Strong climate mitigation potential of rewetting oil palm plantations on tropical peatlands
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - For decades, tropical peatlands in Indonesia have been deforested and converted to other land uses, mainly oil palm plantations which now cover one-fourth of the degraded peatland area. Given that the capacity for peatland ecosystems to store carbon depends largely on hydrology, there is a growing interest in rewetting degraded peatlands to shift them back to a carbon sink. Recent estimates suggest that peatland rewetting may contribute up to 13 % of Indonesia's total mitigation potential from natural climate solutions. In this study, we measured CO2 2 and CH4 4 fluxes, soil temperature, and water table level (WTL) for drained oil palm plantations, rewetted oil palm plantations, and secondary forests located in the Mempawah and Kubu Raya Regencies of West Kalimantan, Indonesia. We found that peatland rewetting significantly reduced peat CO2 2 emissions, though CH4 4 uptake was not significantly different in rewetted peatland compared to drained peatland. Rewetting drained peatlands on oil palm plantations reduced heterotrophic respiration by 34 % and total respiration by 20 %. Our results suggest that rewetting drained oil palm plantations will not achieve low CO2 2 emissions as observed in secondary forests due to differences in vegetation or land management. However, extrapolating our results to the areas of degraded oil palm plantations in West Kalimantan suggests that successful peatland rewetting could still reduce emissions by 3.9 MtCO2 2 yr-- 1 . This result confirms that rewetting oil palm plantations in tropical peatlands is an effective natural climate solution for achieving national emission reduction targets.

TI  - Can elevated CO2 combined with high temperature ameliorate the effect of terminal drought in wheat?
T2  - FUNCTIONAL PLANT BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production may be affected by the future climate, but the impact of the combined increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration, temperature and incidence of drought that are predicted has not been evaluated. The combined effect of elevated CO2, high temperature and terminal drought on biomass accumulation and grain yield was evaluated in vigorous (38-19) and nonvigorous (Janz) wheat genotypes grown under elevated CO2 (700 mu L L-1) combined with temperatures 2 degrees C, 4 degrees C and 6 degrees C above the current ambient temperature. Terminal drought was induced in all combinations at anthesis in a split-plot design to test whether the effect of elevated CO2 combined with high temperature ameliorates the negative effects of terminal drought on biomass accumulation and grain yield. Biomass and grain yield were enhanced under elevated CO2 with 2 degrees C above the ambient temperature, regardless of the watering regimen. The combinations of elevated CO2 plus 4 degrees C or 6 degrees C above the ambient temperature did not enhance biomass and grain yield, but tended to decrease them. The reductions in biomass and grain yield (45-50%) caused by terminal drought were less severe (21-28%) under elevated CO2 with 2 degrees C above the ambient temperature. The amelioration resulted from a 63% increase in the rate of leaf net photosynthesis in 38-19 and a 39% increase in tillering and leaf area in Janz. The contrasting responses and phenological development of these two genotypes to the combination of elevated CO2, temperature and terminal drought, and the possible influences on their source-sink relationships are discussed.

TI  - Long-term effect of selective logging on floristic composition: A 25 year experiment in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Selective logging is one of the most prominent land uses in tropical forests and although it involves harvesting a limited number of trees, the impact on forest structure, composition and aboveground biomass can be significant. Although these impacts are well documented, what is little known is the extent to which selective logging affects tree floristic composition and its recovery process. Understanding how floristic composition is affected by logging activities is essential for determining subsequent cutting cycles, for the maintenance of carbon stocks and for biodiversity conservation. This research investigates the effect of logging on long-term trends on the recovery of species composition in a tropical forest using a unique logging experiment where measurements have been taken annually over a period of 25 years. Changes in 12 long-term 1-hectare (ha) permanent plots were assessed where different selective logging intensities occurred. In the first years after logging, floristic composition differed widely between intact and selectively logged forests, with exploited areas deviating from pre-logged composition. Over time, exploited areas shifted towards the original composition, with more pronounced changes in this trend after similar to 13 years. Shifts in floristic composition were caused mainly by a significant increase in light-demanding fast-growing pioneer species and their subsequent continuous high mortality rates after 13 years of the recovery process. In contrast, the control plots showed similar shifts in composition over time, suggesting external factors such as long-term climate changes may be driving these shifts. The results suggest that 25 years after an experimental selective logging has taken place, floristic composition tends to recover closer to the pre-logged status. Thus, in the absence of further human disturbances, experimental selectively logged forests in low to moderate intensities are compatible with biodiversity conservation, at least during the first cycle of exploitation. Reconciling conservation strategies with the recovery of stocks of commercial timber species would be greatly improved by using these results and lead towards more sustainable forest management plans.

TI  - Forests expand as livestock pressure declines in subtropical South America
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests, savannas, and grasslands are prevalent across the landscapes of South America. Land uses associated with these ecosystems have influenced economies from household to country scales, shaping social-ecological organization across the region since pre-Hispanic societies. Recent studies suggest that tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and forests represent alternative ecosystem states. Transitions between these ecosystem states can be promoted by changes in disturbance regimes and by land uses determined by the organization of societies and their activities. We analyzed how changes in agriculture, fire, and livestock management influenced forest cover over a 45-year span (1966-2011) in the Campos region, an extensive subtropical ecotone between rain forests and grasslands of South America. We found that forests contracted in areas with high crop agriculture, whereas forests increased in those grasslands where livestock densities had been reduced. These patterns were strongly associated with soil and topographic conditions because they broadly determine the potential land productivity and use. Our results show that current land use and disturbance regimes explain the large extent of grasslands across the South American Campos and suggest that changes in land use and disturbance regimes could facilitate or prevent transitions between subtropical forests, savannas, and grasslands altering the provision of ecosystem services linked to them.

TI  - Activity modulation and selection for forests help giant anteaters to cope with temperature changes
T2  - ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
M3  - Article
AB  - Mammals use thermoregulatory behavioural strategies to reduce the cost of physiological thermoreg-ulation. Environmental temperatures should, therefore, impact their decisions. We investigated the effect of environmental temperature on the movement decisions of a large mammal with low capacity for physiological thermoregulation: the giant anteater, Myrmecophaga tridactyla. We GPS-tracked 14 giant anteaters in the Brazilian Pantanal wetland over 5 years. We used hidden Markov models to identify two behavioural states (encamping, as a proxy of resting, and moving, as a proxy of being active) across individuals' trajectories. Then, we estimated the effect of environmental temperature on the probability of moving across the hours of the day in open and forested habitats. We also used integrated step se-lection analysis to understand how environmental temperature drives giant anteater's habitat selection across the day. Giant anteaters showed three important behavioural thermoregulatory strategies in response to environmental temperature changes: they modulated activity duration, completely shifted activity period on a scale of days and selected forests as thermal shelters. With increasing environmental temperature, giant anteaters increased activity duration, nocturnality and diurnal selection for forests, increasing energy intake while avoiding heat gain by solar radiation. With decreasing environmental temperature, they decreased activity duration, increased diurnality and increased nocturnal selection for forests, thus gaining heat from solar radiation when active and taking shelter in milder microclimates when resting. Besides their high short-term behavioural plasticity regarding activity, giant anteaters also used forests to thermoregulate. These results provide insights into how other mammals could respond to climate change. In particular, we highlight the importance of forests as thermal shelters, offering milder temperatures than adjacent open areas during both hot and cold weather spells. Thermal shelters will become more and more indispensable to animal thermoregulation as the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events increase.& COPY; 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI  - Agroforestry transitions: The good, the bad and the ugly
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article canvasses the current definitions and framings of ?agroforestry? in different academic literature and policies. Three key framings of ?agroforestry? are identified in the scholarship and explored for their differences. The findings suggest that the distinct schools of research on ?agroforestry? focus on distinct points of departure, and these baseline situations from which transitions to what is called ?agroforestry? occur vary in distinct ways from monoculture plantations to primary forests. Political-economic analysis is used to scrutinize three key ?agroforestry? transition categories: agroecological, agribusiness, and forest degradation, which the article identifies as agroecoforestry (the good), agrobizforestry (the bad), and agrodeforestry (the ugly) transitions, respectively. Examples of each type are provided based on field research in Brazil, and the results are put into a global perspective. The categories are helpful in identifying the ?agroforestry? transitions that are currently marketed as good solutions but might also have negative impacts and in highlighting the agroecological agroforestry transitions that would help simultaneously increase global food production, adapt to and mitigate the climate crisis, and achieve equity and social justice.

TI  - Assessment of Water Reclamation and Reuse Potential in Bali Province, Indonesia
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Bali Province, Indonesia, experiences serious water shortages and groundwater over-abstraction due to rapidly increasing water demand. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the potential for water reclamation and reuse in Bali Province, focusing on the operational performance of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Although the Suwung WWTP could increase its treatment capacity to produce reclaimed water for irrigation and landscape, there are multiple management issues to be addressed, including fluctuating water demand, limited customer base beyond hotels, concerns about water quality and safety, and cultural perceptions of reclaimed water. In addition, despite the organic loading rates being lower than the design value, the treatment performance of the Suwung WWTP was found to be significantly lower than that of the ITDC WWTP, which achieved high BOD, COD, and TSS removal rates by performing good maintenance of aerators and post-treatment based on dissolved air flotation (DAF). Causal loop analysis indicates that aerator malfunctioning causes multiple problems, such as low dissolved oxygen, poor BOD removal, sludge carryover, and low sludge concentrations. Therefore, regular maintenance of aerators, as well as the development of aerators robust against malfunctioning, are fundamental to producing effluents from stabilization ponds that meet the requirements for irrigation and landscape reuse.

TI  - The effect of contrasting soil textures on the efficiency of alternate wetting-drying to reduce water use and global warming potential
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Alternate wetting-drying (AWD) is known to reduced water use and at the same time also reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from rice fields. The research aimed at comparing AWD on contrast soil textures. Field experiments were conducted at two sites representing coarse-texture soil (silt loam) and finer-texture soil (silty clay) to study the efficiency of AWD on water use, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission, grain yield, global warming potential (GWP), and GHG intensity (GHGI). The experiments were conducted during the 2020 dry season in Central Java province, Indonesia, evaluating continuous flooding (CF) and AWD as the main plot, and biochar-compost (BC) mixture at a rate of 0, 5, and 10 t ha-1as the sub-plot. The results unveiled that AWD on silty clay and silt loam soil reduced water use by 12% and 18%, respectively. The implementation of AWD on silt loam soil significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the total GWP by 39.6% without yield loss and GHGI by 38.4% compared to CF. Conversely, on silty clay soil, the GWP and GHGI reduction was marginal (only about 4%). Biochar-compost addition was significantly reduced water use in both soil textures. We found that the imple-mentation of AWD on coarse texture is more efficient in reducing water use and GWP. Expanding studies on several rice growing season on multiple location can reduce the limitation of our study and further assist in environmental decision making for the rice system in terms of GHG mitigation action and saving irrigation water.

TI  - SOLAR-ENERGY BUDGETS IN CENTRAL AMAZONIAN ECOSYSTEMS - A COMPARISON BETWEEN NATURAL FOREST AND BARE SOIL AREAS
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to estimate the deforestation consequences on the actual solar energy budget of the Central Amazon Region, two ecosystems of different characteristics were compared.The present conditions of the region were represented by a typical 'terra firme' forest cover located at INPA's Ducke Forest Reserve, where the measurements necessary to evaluate its solar energy balance were carried out.The second ecosystem, simulating a deforested area, was represented by an area about 1.0 ha without natural vegetation and situated in the same Reserve. In this area lysimeters were placed, two of them filled with yellow latosol and two others with quartzose sand soil. Both soils are representative soils in the region. Their water balances were taken into account as well as the other parameters necessary to compute the solar energy balances.The results showed that water loss by evaporation was about 41.8% of the total precipitation in the yellow latosol lysimeters and about 26.4% for the quartzose sand ones. For the forest cover it was estimated an evapotranspiration of 67.9% of the rainfall amount.In relation to solar energy balance calculated for the forest cover, it was found that 83.1% of the total energy incoming to this ecosystem was used by the evapotranspiration process, while the remaining of 16.9% can be taken as sensible heat. For bare soils, 55.1% and 31.8% of the total energy were used as latent heat by yellow latosol and quartzose sand soils, respectively. So, the remaining amounts of 44.9% and 68.2% were related to sensible heat and available to atmospheric air heating of these ecosystems.Such results suggest that a large deforestation of the Amazon Region would have direct consequences on their water and solar radiation balances, with an expected change on the actual climatic conditions of the region.

TI  - Microclimate and thermal comfort indices in silvopastoral systems under different planting directions and seasons
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The orientation of tree-rows in a silvopastoral system associated with different seasons of the year allows more or less sunlight penetration, resulting in deliberate modification of the microclimate composition and thermal conditions provided to animals. In this sense, the aims of this study were to evaluate microclimatic variables and thermal comfort indices for east-west and north-south oriented silvopastoral systems, compared to unshaded systems during summer and winter. The study was conducted at the Modelo II Farm (21 degrees 08' S 53 degrees 17' W) at an altitude of 354 m. A randomized block design in scheme of split-split plots with five repetitions was adopted. Two planting directions and a control treatment (unshaded) were evaluated in the plots. Collection times were evaluated in sub-plots, and the distance from eucalyptus trees was evaluated in sub-sub-plots. Changes in the east-west and north-south planting directions did not promote changes in climate variables, nor did they change the thermal comfort indices during summer. There were differences, however, in temperature and relative humidity of the air, black globe temperature, and radiant heat load during winter. Silvopastoral systems provide improvements in the environment and, concomitantly, to the thermal comfort of animals, when compared to unshaded systems. However, thermal stress situations occur despite the presence of trees, depending on the time of the day and the distance from the rows of eucalyptus trees.

TI  - Impacts of Land Use Changes on Soil Functions and Water Security: Insights from a Three-Year-Long Study in the Cantareira System, Southeast of Brazil
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Maintaining soil functions is crucial for human well-being, but there is a lack of integration between soil, water security, ecosystem services, and climate change. To bridge this knowledge gap and address erosion-induced soil and water losses and considering intrinsic impacts of soil structure, a three-year-long study was conducted focused on three dominant soil types (Typic Hapludult, Typic Dystrudept, and Typic Usthortent) combined with different land uses (native forest, eucalyptus plantation, rotational grazing, and extensive grazing) in a critical water supply region for the S & atilde;o Paulo metropolitan area in Southeastern Brazil. Surface runoff, evaluated for erosion resistance, was measured using the Cornell infiltrometer, and soil electrical resistivity tomography estimated soil water content to a depth of 1.5 m for groundwater recharge analysis. Soil hydraulic properties were also measured. The results revealed that native forest soils had higher hydraulic conductivity, particularly in the surface layer, compared to eucalyptus and pastures. Native forests in Typic Hapludult showed a higher runoff rate (200 to 250 mm h(-1)) due to a naturally dense subsoil layer that negatively impacted water infiltration and recharge with a high erosion potential, therefore reducing the amount of water stored. Typic Usthortent maintained a higher soil water content in pastures than in other land uses and also showed a low rate of water infiltration, resulting in perched water in the surface layer. In Typic Dystrudept, the native forest presented higher hydraulic conductivity (0-5 cm: 115.9 cm h(-1)) than eucalyptus (0-5 cm: 36.4 cm h(-1)), rotational grazing (0-5 cm: 19.4 cm h(-1)), and extensive grazing (0-5 cm: 2.6 cm h(-1)), but there were no significant differences in soil water content among land uses. This work illustrates the crucial role of native forests in affecting deep water recharge, reducing the soil surface erosion, mainly in soils without naturally subsoil layer, maintaining recharge potential. For Ultisols, pastures preserved soil structure and are therefore less impacted by soil management. With these results, a contribution is made to soil and water conservation, providing support for sustainable management practices in erosion-prone areas.

TI  - Effects of disturbances on the carbon balance of tropical peat swamp forests
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatlands have accumulated huge soil carbon over millennia. However, the carbon pool is presently disturbed on a large scale by land development and management, and consequently has become vulnerable. Peat degradation occurs most rapidly and massively in Indonesia, because of fires, drainage, and deforestation of swamp forests coexisting with tropical peat. Peat burning releases carbon dioxide (CO2) intensively but occasionally, whereas drainage increases CO2 emission steadily through the acceleration of aerobic peat decomposition. Therefore, tropical peatlands present the threat of switching from a carbon sink to a carbon source to the atmosphere. However, the ecosystem-scale carbon exchange is still not known in tropical peatlands. A long-term field experiment in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia showed that tropical peat ecosystems, including a relatively intact peat swamp forest with little drainage (UF), a drained swamp forest (DF), and a drained burnt swamp forest (DB), functioned as net carbon sources. Mean annual net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) (+/- a standard deviation) for 4 similar to years from July 2004 to July 2008 was 174 +/- 203, 328 +/- 204 and 499 +/- 72 similar to gC similar to m-2 similar to yr-1, respectively, for the UF, DF, and DB sites. The carbon emissions increased according to disturbance degrees. We found that the carbon balance of each ecosystem was chiefly controlled by groundwater level (GWL). The NEE showed a linear relationship with GWL on an annual basis. The relationships suggest that annual CO2 emissions increase by 79-238 C-g m(-2) every 0.1m of GWL lowering probably because of the enhancement of oxidative peat decomposition. In addition, CO2 uptake by vegetation photosynthesis was reduced by shading due to dense smoke from peat fires ignited accidentally or for agricultural practices. Our results may indicate that tropical peatland ecosystems are no longer a carbon sink under the pressure of human activities.

TI  - Drivers of fire occurrence in a mountainous Brazilian cerrado savanna: Tracking long-term fire regimes using remote sensing
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is a natural disturbance in savannas, and defines vegetation physiognomy and structure, often influencing species diversity. Fire activity is determined by a wide range of factors, including long and short term climatic conditions, climate seasonality, wind speed and direction, topography, and fuel biomass. In Brazil, fire shapes the structure and composition of cerrado savannas, and the impact of fire on vegetation dynamics is well explored, but the drivers of variation in fire disturbance across landscapes and over time are still poorly understood. We reconstructed 31 years of fire occurrence history in the Serra do Cipo region, a highly-diverse cerrado landscape, located in the southern portion of the Espinhaco mountain range, state of Minas Gerais, Southeastern Brazil. We mapped burn scars using a time series of Landsat satellite images from 1984 to 2014. Our questions were 1) How does fire occurrence vary in time and space across the Serra do Cipo cerrado landscape? 2) Which climatic drivers may explain the spatial and inter-annual variation in fire occurrence on this landscape? 3) Is fire occurrence in this cerrado landscape moisture-limited or fuel-limited? We evaluated the inter-annual variation and distribution of burned areas, and used linear models to explain this variation in terms of rainfall amount (determinant of fuel load production), seasonal rainfall distribution (determinant of dry fuel availability), abnormality of precipitation (Standardized Precipitation Index - SPI), and vegetation type (Enhanced Vegetation Index - EVI). Contrary to our expectations, annual rainfall volume was weakly and negatively correlated with burned area, and the strongest predictor of burned area was drought during the ignition season. The length of the dry season and the distribution of rain along the season determined ignition probability, increasing fire occurrence during the driest periods. We conclude that the mountain cerrado vegetation at Serra do Cipo has a moisture-dependent fire regime, in contrast to the fuel-dependent fire regimes described for African savannas. These findings imply that savannas at different continents may have different recovery and resilience capabilities when subjected to changes in the fire regime, caused by direct anthropogenic activities or indirectly through climatic changes. The possible effects of these changes on cerrado landscapes are still unknown, and future studies should investigate if currently observed fire regimes have positive or negative impacts on vegetation diversity, recovery, resilience and phenology, thus helping managers to include fire management as conservation measure.

TI  - Pollutant gas and particulate material emissions in ethanol production in Brazil: social and environmental impacts
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The replacement of fossil-based fuels by renewable fuels (biofuels) was proposed in the IPCC report, as an alternative to reduce greenhouse gas emission and reach out to a low-carbon economy. On this perspective, the Brazilian government had implemented a renewable energy program based on the use of ethanol in the transport sector. This work evaluates the scenario of pollutant gas emissions and particulate material that comes from the biomass burning process involved in ethanol production cycle, in the city of Campos dos Goytacazes, Brazil. The gases and particulate material emitted by sugarcane and bagasse burning processes-the last one in energy co-generation mills-were analyzed. A laboratory-controlled burning of both samples was realized in an oven with temperature ramp from 250 to 400 degrees C, at a regular rate of 50 degrees C. The gas samples were collected directly from the oven's exhaust pipe. The particulates obtained were the residual material taken out of the burned samples: a powder with the aspect of soot. A photoacoustic spectroscopy system coupled with quantum cascade laser and electrochemical analyzers was used to measure the emission of polluting gases such as N2O, CO2, CO, NOx (NO, NO2), and SO2 in ppmv range. Fluorescent X-ray spectrometry was applied to evaluate the chemical composition of particulate material, enabling the identification of elements such as Si, Al, Ca, K, Fe, S, P, Ti, Mn, Cu, Zn, Sc, V, Cu, and Sr.

TI  - Spatial variability of tree species diversity in a mixed tropical forest in Southern Brazil
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Floristic surveys and diversity indices are often applied to measure tree species diversity in mixed tropical forest remnants. However, these analyses are frequently limited to the overall results and do not allow to evaluate the spatial variability distributions of tree diversity, leading to develop additional tools. This study aimed to estimate the spatial variability of tree diversity and map their spatial patterns in a Brazilian mixed tropical forest conservation area. We used indices to measure the tree species diversity (dbh >= 10 cm) in 400 sampling units (25 m x 25 m) from a continuous forest inventory. Semivariograms were fitted to estimate spatial dependences and punctual kriging was applied to compose maps. Mean diversity values were constant in the continuous inventories, indicating a forest remnant in an advanced stage of ecological succession. On the other hand, tree diversity presented spatial patterns identified by geostatistics, in which the dynamics were composed of heterogeneous mosaics spatially influenced by tree species with different ecological features and densities, gap dynamics, advancement of forest succession, mortality, and Araucaria angustilofia's cohorts.

TI  - Seed germination and seedling recruitment of Dimorphandra mollis Benth. in a Neotropical savanna subjected to prescribed fires
T2  - FOLIA GEOBOTANICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Recruitment in savanna environments represents a high-risk step in a plant's life cycle. Dimorphandra mollis Benth (Fabaceae) is a savanna tree species which produces dry fruits holding coat-imposed dormant seeds dispersed late in the dry season. We investigated fire effects on fruit dehiscence, seed dormancy breaking and seed viability, and also monitored seedling recruitment and survival for 44 months in a savanna area subjected to biennial controlled fires in central Brazil. Fruits were laid aboveground, and seeds were buried before and after an experimental fire set in August 1999. Fruits started to open after the experimental fire up to the following rainy season. Around one fourth of the seeds removed from these fruits were viable but required scarification to imbibe, indicating that fruits do not totally insulate seeds, and fire does not break seed dormancy. No seedling emerged from buried seeds during the first rainy season after the fire, but fourteen seedlings emerged during the second rainy season. Half of the seedlings died and the other half resprouted after a second experimental fire set during the third dry season. In the third rainy season, thirteen new seedlings emerged, but two died in the fourth dry season. We found that fire was a more determinant constraint to seedling survival than the dry season itself. After 44 months we recovered 27 viable seeds from those initially buried, suggesting that seeds of D. mollis have the potential to establish a persistent seed bank. As expected for savanna trees, we found that D. mollis seeds and seedlings may persist in environments periodically disturbed by fires.

TI  - From eco-catastrophe to zero deforestation? Interdisciplinarities, politics, environmentalisms and reduced clearing in Amazonia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil's rate of deforestation has declined by more than 70% since 2004, a dynamic unimaginable even a decade ago. Even the worst drought in more than 100 years (2010) produced a flat clearing profile from 2009-2010, an unexpected result, since dry periods usually have clearing spikes. While deforestation continues throughout the tropics (and Amazonia), and the recent change in Brazil's Forest Code has produced a modest increase in deforestation, there are significant processes that are slowing clearing and fostering woodland recovery. This paper outlines the multiplicities and interdisciplinarities of political ecologies, policies, politics scientific approaches and technologies that have moderated forest conversion and shaped Amazonia's unusual, and unusually effective development and conservation conjunctures in Brazil's post-authoritarian period. New institutional framings, ideologies, political decentralization, globalizations and an expanded arena for new social movements and civil society provided the context for this transformation. Changing environmental institutions, discourses and the relatively redistributive social pact that underpinned President Ignacio (Lula) da Silva's administration had a significant role in promoting more resilient land uses, monitoring, compliance and new markets, while regional social movements and national and international commodity boycotts affected more damaging ones. Finally, other forms of payment for environmental services, such as REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) and REDD+ are changing the value of standing forests. This paper describes how complex interdisciplinarities shaped the politics, policies and practices that slowed forest clearing. However, Amazonia's politics are extremely dynamic: destabilizing processes, violence and indifferent national leadership could still reverse this remarkable turnaround.

TI  - Blue Restoration - Building Confidence and Overcoming Barriers
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Marine coastal (or "blue") ecosystems provide valuable services to humanity and the environment, but global loss and degradation of blue ecosystems necessitates ecological restoration. However, blue restoration is an emerging field and is still relatively experimental and small-scale. Identification of the key barriers to scaling-up blue restoration will enable targeted problem solving and increase the likelihood of success. Here we describe the environmental, technical, social, economic, and political barriers to restoration of blue ecosystems, including saltmarsh, mangroves, seagrass, shellfish reefs, coral reefs, and kelp forests. We provide managers, practitioners, and decision-makers with solutions to construct barrier-informed blue restoration plans and illustrate these solutions through the use of case studies where barriers were overcome. We offer a way forward to build confidence in blue restoration for society, government, and restoration practitioners at larger and more ambitious scales.

TI  - Tropical Peat Accumulation in Central Amazonia
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazonia has been recently included in discussions on the role of tropical peatlands in the global carbon cycle owing to extensive peatlands up to 7.5 m thick, reported from Western Amazonia (Peru). The aim of this study was to explore peat accumulation in Central Amazonia (Brazil). Of seven field sites, six located in the Negro River basin and one close to the junction of the Negro River with the Amazon, four had a peat deposit from 0.10 to 2.10 m thick. Another two sites had other organic soil type which could not be called peat. Only one site did not have any organic deposit. The loss-on-ignition (LOI), carbon content and dry bulk density, measured for the four peatland sites, varied from 17.7 to 97.4 %, 11 to 59 %, and 0.0002 to 0.572 g cm(-3), respectively. All sites were classified as minerotrophic based on pH and peat thickness. The study confirms that Amazonian peatlands are not limited to Western Amazonia but also exist in Central Amazonia. We could not find as thick and extensive peats as in Western Amazonia, which we suggest is due to differences in rainfall and hydrology, tectonic conditions, topography, subsoil type and frequency of fires.

TI  - Effect of plant-mediated oxygen supply and drainage on greenhouse gas emission from a tropical peatland in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
M3  - Article
AB  - To evaluate the hypothesis that plant-mediated oxygen supplies decrease methane (CH4) production and total global warming potential (GWP) in a tropical peatland, the authors compared the fluxes and dissolved concentrations of greenhouse gases [GHGs; CH4, carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O)] and dissolved oxygen (DO) at multiple peatland ecosystems in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Study ecosystems included tropical peat swamp forest and degraded peatland areas that were burned and/or drained during the rainy season. CH4 fluxes were significantly influenced by land use and drainage, which were highest in the flooded burnt sites (5.75 +/- 6.66 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) followed by the flooded forest sites (1.37 +/- 2.03 mg C m(-2) h(-1)), the drained burnt site (0.220 +/- 0.143 mg C m(-2) h(-1)), and the drained forest site (0.0084 +/- 0.0321 mg C m(-2) h(-1)). Dissolved CH4 concentrations were also significantly affected by land use and drainage, which were highest in the flooded burnt sites (124 +/- 84 mu mol L-1) followed by the drained burnt site (45.2 +/- 29.8 mu mol L-1), the flooded forest sites (1.15 +/- 1.38 mu mol L-1) and the drained forest site (0.860 +/- 0.819 mu mol L-1). DO concentrations were influenced by land use only, which were significantly higher in the forest sites (6.9 +/- 5.6 mu mol L-1) compared to the burnt sites (4.0 +/- 2.9 mu mol L-1). These results suggest that CH4 produced in the peat might be oxidized by plant-mediated oxygen supply in the forest sites. CO2 fluxes were significantly higher in the drained forest site (340 +/- 250 mg C m(-2) h(-1) with a water table level of -20 to -60 cm) than in the drained burnt site (108 +/- 115 mg C m(-2) h(-1) with a water table level of -15 to +10 cm). Dissolved CO2 concentrations were 0.6-3.5 mmol L-1, also highest in the drained forest site. These results suggested enhanced CO2 emission by aerobic peat decomposition and plant respiration in the drained forest site. N2O fluxes ranged from -2.4 to -8.7 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) in the flooded sites and from 3.4 to 8.1 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) in the drained sites. The negative N2O fluxes might be caused by N2O consumption by denitrification under flooded conditions. Dissolved N2O concentrations were 0.005-0.22 mu mol L-1 but occurred at < 0.01 mu mol L-1 in most cases. GWP was mainly determined by CO2 flux, with the highest levels in the drained forest site. Despite having almost the same CO2 flux, GWP in the flooded burnt sites was 20% higher than that in the flooded forest sites due to the large CH4 emission (not significant). N2O fluxes made little contribution to GWP.

TI  - Modelling fire probability in the Brazilian Amazon using the maximum entropy method
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires are both a cause and consequence of important changes in the Amazon region. The development and implementation of better fire management practices and firefighting strategies are important steps to reduce the Amazon ecosystems' degradation and carbon emissions from land-use change in the region. We extended the application of the maximum entropy method (MaxEnt) to model fire occurrence probability in the Brazilian Amazon on a monthly basis during the 2008 and 2010 fire seasons using fire detection data derived from satellite images. Predictor variables included climatic variables, inhabited and uninhabited protected areas and land-use change maps. Model fit was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) value (threshold-independent analysis), binomial tests and model sensitivity and specificity (threshold-dependent analysis). Both threshold-independent (AUC = 0.919 +/- 0.004) and threshold-dependent evaluation indicate satisfactory model performance. Pasture, annual deforestation and secondary vegetation are the most effective variables for predicting the distribution of the occurrence data. Our results show that MaxEnt may become an important tool to guide on-the-ground decisions on fire prevention actions and firefighting planning more effectively and thus to minimise forest degradation and carbon loss from forest fires in Amazonian ecosystems.

TI  - From science to practice: The AGSUS protocol for monitoring and certification of sustainable soil management and carbon sequestration
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable soil management is indispensable for achieving the UN Sustainable Development goals and soil carbon sequestration for climate change mitigation has gained importance in recent years, yet there are few examples of projects carried out to this purpose, and protocols that facilitate this task. Here we present a monitoring system that relies on sampling soils in the field, as opposed to a modeling approach. The high spatial variability of SOC was addressed by requiring that the participating farms divide their land according to management zones, based on soil type, slope position and land use history, and the sampling density was established as one sampling point per one hundred hectares, while for environments smaller than 500 ha minimum of five points must be used. These points are georeferenced and will be revisited for annual monitoring of sustainable soil management, and every five years for soil sampling for SOC, texture, bulk density, pH, electric conductivity (if indicated), and available phosphorus determinations. The monitoring of sustainable soil management will be carried out through a visual evaluation of 12 soil quality parameters, as described in the handbook published by the AGSUS group. The data obtained from the visual evaluation and the soil analyses (bulk density, particle size fractions, C content, and pH) in the baseline monitoring of Argentinean and Brazilian farms during 2022 were analyzed for the relation between visual evaluation score and the means of these soil parameters. The organic matter indicator (OMI)was calculated by the formula OMI = OM/clay plus silt*100. The data base contained visual soil evaluation scores at 80 georeferenced sampling points, representing 12 farms located in different agroecological zones of the Argentinean Pampas, and 47 sampling points on two farms in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Our results showed a relationship between the VE (Visual Evaluation) score and SOC contents of the soils, especially when these were expressed in relation to their fine mineral particles as with the OMI for the soils of the Argentinean Pampa and the Brazilian Mato Grosso. The OMI showed differences between the three VE scores ranging from 4.7 to 6.7 and from 3.1 to 5.1 in the 0-0.1 m and 0.1-0.2 m depths, respectively. Relationships between the VE score and SOC, OMI, Sand, Silt and Clay plus Silt were only found for the 39 cases of VE "moderate" score in Pampas soils, whereas for the 39 cases of "good" scores no significant relations were encountered. These soils had high SOC and OMI, indicating that they are healthy soils, near saturation level, with low C sequestration potential.

TI  - Developing and Testing a Portable Soil Nutrient Detector in Irrigated and Rainfed Paddy Soils from Java, Indonesia
T2  - COMPUTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Data on the soil nutrient content are required to calculate fertilizer rate recommendations. The soil laboratory determines these soil properties, yet the measurement is time-consuming and costly. Meanwhile, portable devices to assess the soil nutrient content in real-time are limited. However, a proprietary and low-cost NPK sensor is available and commonly used in IoT for agriculture. This study aimed to assemble and test a portable, NPK sensor-based device in irrigated and rainfed paddy soils from Java, Indonesia. The device development followed a prototyping approach. The device building included market surveys and opted for an inexpensive, light, and compact soil sensor, power storage, monitor, and wire connectors. Arduino programming language was used to write scripts for data display and sub-device communication. The result is a real-time, portable soil nutrient detector that measures the soil temperature, moisture, pH, electrical conductivity, and N, P, and K contents. Field tests show that the device is sensitive to soil properties and location. The portable soil nutrient detector may be an alternative tool for the real-time measurement of soil nutrients in paddy fields in Indonesia.

TI  - Spatiotemporal monitoring of subtropical urban forests in mitigating air pollution: Policy implications for nature-based solutions
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution remains a major global challenge in addressing environmental and health issues requiring continuous and immediate action. Nevertheless, the extensive adverse effects from atmospheric pollution are mainly experienced by communities and people in lower-and middle-income countries, such as the medium-and large-sized cities in Latin America including the coastal city of Guaruja in Brazil. Urban forests, as integral parts of the city landscape, play a crucial role in mitigating air pollution and should therefore be considered in environmental policies. This study aimed to evaluate the spatiotemporal concentrations of air pollutants using the biological monitoring method with Tillandsia usneoides L. to highlight the capacity of urban forests to act as nature-based solutions (NbS) in improving air quality and providing other ecosystem services. Based on the quantification of chemical indicators of vehicle emissions, scientifically recognized as traffic-related elements (TREs) such as cadmium (Cd), Copper (Cu) and lead (Pb) in the biomonitoring samples, the results showed spatiotemporal variations in their concentrations. This finding demonstrates that urban fragments in the low-income settlement of the city exhibited higher values for TREs during the wet season. Cu values were the highest during the wet season in all study areas, underscoring the intensity of the light vehicle fleet. Forest fragments attenuated air pollution, highlighting their importance as features of environmental planning. The identification of atmospheric pollution hotspots in the territory guided the strategic implementation of NbS through tree planting, thus promoting a healthier environment with greater mitigation potential. This study is the first in Brazil to explore the spatiotemporal relationship between air pollution and urban forests in highly dense and low-income settlements providing quantitative indicators toward the benefits of NbS.

TI  - CO2 emission from soil after reforestation and application of sewage sludge
T2  - BRAGANTIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to quantify the carbon dioxide emissions from an Oxisol under degraded pasture located in Sorocaba, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The treatments were: sewage sludge (LE), sewage sludge compost (CLE), mineral fertilizer (AM) and no fertilization (T0). The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized block design with analysis of the effect of the four treatments (CLE, LE, and AM T0) with four replications. The application of sewage sludge, sewage sludge compost, mineral fertilizer and no fertilizer was statistically significant for the variables of height increase and stem height of Guanandi seedlings (Calophyllum brasiliense Cambessedes - Calophyllaceae). Treatments showed significant differences in terms of CO2 emissions from soil. The CLE exhibited the highest CO2 fluxes, reaching a peak of 9.33 +/- 0.96 g C m(-2) day(-1) (p<0.0001), as well as the LE with a maximum CO2 flux of 6.35 +/- 1.17 C m(-2) day(-1) (p<0.005). The AM treatment (4.96 +/- 1.61 g C m(-2) day(-1)) had the same statistical effect as T0 (5.33 +/- 0.49 g C m(-2) day(-1)). CO2 fluxes were correlated with soil temperature in all treatments. However, considering the period of 172 days of evaluation, the total loss of C as CO2 was 2.7% for sewage sludge and 0.7% for the sewage sludge compost of the total C added with the application on soil.

TI  - Population trends and conservation of the Mangrove Rail
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ORNITOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mangrove Rail occupies only mangrove areas in South America. Though present in one of the most endangered forests in the world, there is little data available on the Mangrove Rail. In this paper, I present local population trends and the latest population density estimates for the Mangrove Rail in an urban mangrove area based on two years of fieldwork conducted on the Island of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil. I have also revised the global conservation status of the Mangrove Rail based on literature and specimen records. Surveys were conducted monthly at 10 stations along a 4 km-transect. The maximum number of individuals detected was 17 (2012). Total density was around 2 rails/ha, although a significant increase in population occurred when the surveyed area developed from 8.7 ha to 43 ha. A strong relationship between the presence of rails records and mangrove extension was observed and already expected. Altogether, the Mangrove Rail occurs in an extent of 19,615 km(2) and an area of 12,455 km(2) in South America, strictly associated with mangrove forests under severe pressure by deforestation, therefore qualifying as Vulnerable at a global level according to IUCN criteria. The results presented herein reinforce the importance of preserved wetlands for the conservation of the Mangrove Rail as well as of mangrove restoration initiatives since even areas of human intervention can be a good alternative to future adaptive management strategies and the conservation of this endangered species.

TI  - Economic and environmental impacts of integrated systems adoption in Brazilian agriculture-forest frontier
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The adoption of sustainable agricultural systems in the Brazilian Cerrado and Amazon is globally relevant, on the one hand due to the amount of commodities produced in these regions, and on the other by the critically important ecosystem services provided by these biomes. We assessed the economic performance of an integrated crop-livestock and an integrated crop-livestock-forest system at farm level comparing their results with the most representative agricultural production systems used in the Cerrado and Amazon, as follows: (i) continuous large-scale crop rotation (soybean-corn), (ii) extensive livestock. Also, we analyzed economic and environmental impacts of integrated systems widespread adoption estimating the results for production volume, gross production value, balance of trade, land-sparing effect and CO2eq sequestration using scenario analysis. The results highlighted the great influence of commodity prices on large-scale crop system and on extensive livestock economic results, particularly, gross profit. In contrast, the integrated systems showed better economic long-term results (i.e. similar payback, even with major investment, and higher profitability index). Also, integrated systems showed lower sensitiveness from commodity prices fluctuation, illustrating their capacity for market risk reduction, and their remarkable potential to increase economy results at regional level. Environmental results demonstrated the integrated systems huge potential for reduce deforestation as well as mitigate CO2eq emissions from agricultural sector, crucial issues for meeting climate commitments and global sustainable development goals. These results are useful for policy-makers and decision-takers to compare alternative farming systems performance in a global hotspot for agricultural commodities production and pressure on natural forest, and can contribute to increase adoption of sustainable agricultural systems in the Brazilian agriculture-forest frontier.

TI  - Capital formation and production of carbon emissions in low-carbon development
T2  - GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study aims to examine the endogenous variable, low -carbon development, and valuate its influencing factors, given its pivotal role in environmental protection amid climate change concerns and economic growth. Low carbon development is a new platform to maintain economic growth through reducing carbon emissions and reducing the use of natural resources, because it was predicted that reducing emissions will increase economic growth while preventing forest loss, improving air quality and living standards, and reducing mortality rates. METHODS: Utilizing a quantitative method, this study integrates a novel viewpoint by combining low-carbon development with related emission factors. The study utilizes secondary data, specifically time series data spanning 31 years from 1991 to 2021, which were analyzed using regression study methods. The factors being examined include capital formation, deforestation, land transportation, agricultural land, and industrialization.FINDINGS: Findings reveal that low-carbon development in North Sumatra is influenced significantly by capital formation, deforestation, agricultural land, and industrialization, with land transportation showing no substantial impact. Capital formation has a favorable impact on low-carbon development. But, deforestation, land transportation, agricultural land and industrialization have a negative impact on low-carbon development. Together, these determinants account for 77.55 percent of the variance. Capital formation contributes 19.8 percent, deforestation 15.6 percent, agricultural land 19.0 percent, and industrialization 18.9 percent to low-carbon development.CONCLUSION: The hypothesis established in this study is accepted. To foster low-carbon development in North Sumatra, specific attention is required from local governments. Capital formation is vital. Measures include controlling interest rates, supporting businesses, fostering an investment-friendly climate, ensuring security, and integrating environmental sustainability considerations into project implementation to curb carbon emissions. Prevention of deforestation involves tightening land clearance licenses and enhancing institutional quality through environmental protection and property rights legislation. The government must strive for promoting eco-friendly agricultural practices with mitigated through outreach programs involving experts who educate farmers on minimizing emissions, reducing carbon emissions from pesticide with using biochar sourced from empty palm fruit bunches and also rice straw which is very easy to obtain at a low cost and is environmentally friendly, and emphasizing environmental preservation policies in the industrial sector like industrial transformation efforts with an effective approach to reducing carbon emissions such as restructuring various aspects of industrial activities, including investment, final demand, intensity and production methods. The implementation of tax emissions and strategic interventions increases the likelihood of realizing low-carbon development in North Sumatra, aligning with sustainable development goals.

TI  - Importance of yam in the role of agrobiodiversity in Mayombe and Batéké Plateau ecozones in Democratic Republic of Congo
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mayombe and Bat & eacute;k & eacute; Plateau ecozones of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are experiencing differentiated deforestation and forest degradation, together with a trend toward homogenization of their agricultural diversity. These may undermine efforts to sustainably reverse household food, nutrition, and livelihood insecurity. In this context, this study seeks to assess the importance of yam in the role of agrobiodiversity among populations in the two contrasting ecozones. A sample of 351 households was surveyed. A dataset of about 202 testimonies from six focus groups and observations in 86 peasant agroforestry fields was also analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlation and regression, and calculations of different indices of crop importance. Overall, plant, animal, and fish species represent respectively 60.9%, 26.7% and 12.4% of genetic resources. About 50 of 72 species of these resources are found in both study areas. Regarding the overall use of species, the five top-ranked species that were utilized as food included Manihot esculenta, followed by Arachis hypogaea, Zea mays, Dioscorea alata, and Musa acuminata. Living in the Mayombe ecozone increases the household's preference for growing yams by up to 5.7 times. Population density was correlated with agricultural diversity. Villages with a high population density showed greater crop diversity than those with a low population density. In short, yam remains an important but under-represented crop, the contribution of which could be increased to secure sustainable livelihoods through biodiversity-rich peasant agroforestry systems.

TI  - Deforestation and the environmental Kuznets curve: A cross-national investigation of intervening mechanisms
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. We draw on ecological modernization theory and international political economy arguments to examine the sources of an environmental Kuznets curve (or EKC) that produces an inverted U-shaped rate of deforestation relative to economic development. Method. We use ordinary least squares regression with White's ( 1978) correction Cor possible heteroskedasticity to examine the rate of deforestation (1980-1995) in less developed countries. Results. Net of controls for initial forest stock and the quality of deforestation estimates, we find strong evidence for an EKC driven by (1) agglomeration effects linked to the level of urbanization, (2) rural-to-urban migration that partially offsets rural population pressure, (3) the growth of services-dominated urban economies, and (4) strong democratic states. We Find little evidence that foreign debt or export dependence influence the deforestation rate. Conclusions. Although deforestation continues to pose pressing and potentially irreversible environmental risks, there is evidence of self-corrective ecological and modernization processes inherent in development that act to mitigate these risks.Deforestation is a pressing environmental problem involving permanent loss of species, soil degradation, impact on global climate change, and long-term resource depletion. Of the approximately 3.4 billion hectares of forest land that existed around the globe in 1980, approximately 5 percent had been cleared by 1995 (FAO, 1997). Although some decline in the rate of deforestation has been detected in the 1990s (with rapid deforestation in some regions being offset by uneven decreases in Brazil and reforestation in some developed nations), there is no guarantee of abatement in the near future (World Resources Institute, 2000). Given the inextricable links between forest cover and biodiversity, soil quality, and atmospheric replenish-ment, understanding the causes and consequences of deforestation must be central to both natural and social environmental science.Of the various forms of environmental degradation, deforestation holds a special appeal because (1) the felling of trees is spatially fixed and therefore more amenable to study, (2) deforestation is unambiguously due to human activities, and (3) the loss of forest cover is uniquely intertwined with nearly all other forms of environmental degradation. This article extends and improves on prior cross-national analyses of deforestation. Whereas most past studies have been empirical and descriptive, more recent investigations have been more theoretical, emphasizing modernization processes, demographic pressures, and dependency/world systems constraints (e.g., Rock, 1996; Rudel and Roper, 1997; Ehrhardt-Martinez, 1998, 1999). As a part of this theorizing, the existence and implications of an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) have garnered increasing attention. Given that the actual meaning of this curvilinear relationship between development and deforestation depends heavily on the intervening mechanisms linking the two, the purpose of this investigation is first to establish the existence of an EKC for deforestation and then to examine various competing explanations for this pattern.

TI  - Combined role of no-tillage and cropping systems in soil carbon stocks and stabilization
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Increases in carbon (C) input and stabilization are key processes to turn soils into sinks of atmospheric CO2-C and help mitigating global warming. We hypothesized (i) that C sequestration in no-tillage soil is further enhanced by high input cropping systems and (ii) that the sequestered C is stored mainly in the mineral associated fraction. The objective of this study was to assess, in 2003, the C sequestration and stabilization in a subtropical Acrisol (Eldorado do Sul, Brazil) subjected to 18-year conventional tillage [CT] and no-tillage [NT] combined with two cropping systems: black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb) as winter cover crop - maize (Zea mays L.) as summer grain crop [Ot/M]; and black oat plus vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) as winter cover crops - maize in summer intercropped with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp) cover crop [Ot+V/M+C]. Soil C stock in the 0-20 cm layer was higher in NT than in CT, either in Ot/M (31.1 vs. 27.8 Mg ha(-1), P < 0.05) or Ot+V/M+C (37.3 vs. 32.8 Mg ha(-1), P < 0.05). Annual C sequestration rate in NT relative to CT was 0.25 Mg ha(-1) in Ot+V/M+C and 0.18 Mg ha(-1) in Ot/M, in agreement to the higher biomass-C addition and legume cover crops inclusion in Ot+V/M+C (7.6 vs 4.0 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) and to our first hypothesis. Increase in the proportion of large macroaggregates (9.51-4.76 mm) and of mean weight diameter occurred in NT soil up to 10 cm depth, both in Ot/M and Ot+V/M+C. In NT, most of the C accumulation relative to CT occurred in the mineral-associated fraction, showing the importance of organo-mineral interaction in C stabilization and supporting our second hypothesis. However, the physical protection by aggregates played equally important role by stabilizing the occluded particulate organic matter (occluded-POM) before it was further stabilized by organo-mineral interaction. No-tillage is recommended as a sustainable soil management, but to increase soil C accumulation, the potential of cropping systems such those based on legume cover crops must be concurrently explored.

TI  - Life cycle greenhouse gas emissions from rice production systems in Brazil: A comparison between minimal tillage and organic farming
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge on the environmental impact caused by rice cultivation, the most consumed cereal in the world, is essential to assess agricultural impact on total global anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. Using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), we compared the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of white and brown rice from two different cultivation systems, minimal tillage and organic, under the practices and climate conditions prevailing in the south of Brazil, the most important rice-producer region in Latin America. The "Cradle to Gate" approach was used, including the stages of cultivation, grain drying, and processing, considering the functional unit of 1 kg of protein produced. The results were characterized using the IPCC 2013 method. The highest value of GWP 100 was observed for the organic white rice, equivalent to 35.53 kg CO2-eq/kg of protein, followed by the organic brown rice, equivalent to 26.50 kg CO2-eq/kg of protein, whereas the lowest GWP 100, equivalent to 15.80 kg CO2-eq/kg of protein, was observed for the minimal white rice. The minimal tillage brown rice, released 20.91 kg CO2-eq/kg of protein. Results clearly show that the cultivation stage is the hotspot for environmental impacts, caused by field emissions, which represented 91% in the organic farming and 61% in the minimal tillage system. The use of mineral fertilizers, in the case of the minimal tillage system, represented 34% of the emissions. This research might help in the elaboration of rice production inventories, as well as in trying to provide reliable information to stakeholders in order to choose sustainable products and processes.

TI  - Mitigation of greenhouse gases emission affected by no-tillage and winter cover crops in a subtropical paddy rice ecosystem
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Paddy rice production based on traditional soil management emits large amounts of methane (CH4) into the atmosphere. This study assessed the potential of no-tillage (NT) and winter cover crops (WCC) to mitigate net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in a subtropical paddy rice ecosystem. A long-term (20-yrs) experiment was evaluated regarding the effect of NT combined with winter fallow or three WCC (ryegrass, white oat, and birdsfoot trefoil) on seasonal CH4-C and nitrous oxide (N2O-N) emissions and on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in comparison to conventional tillage (CT) under winter fallow in a Gleysol of Southern Brazil. The changes in SOC were used as a proxy for annual net carbon dioxide (CO2) exchanges in the soil-atmosphere, taking the CT treatment as a reference. The GHG balance (summation of CH4, N2O and CO2 emissions multiplied by their global warming potential of 34, 298, and 1, respectively) and emissions intensity of GHG emissions were calculated. Across winter managements, NT decreased 25 % of GHG emissions in comparison to CT system. This effect was mainly related to the decrease of seasonal CH4-C emissions (31-113 kg ha-1) and by promoting SOC accumulation (0.45-0.65 Mg ha-1 yr-1) in comparison to CT system, since soil N2O-N emission was not affected by management practices. Increased soil CH4-C emissions offset the positive effect of WCC on SOC accumulation compared with winter fallow. Based on our findings, NT mitigates net GHG emissions in subtropical paddy rice ecosystems, but no additional effect is observed combining NT with WCC.

TI  - Nitrous oxide emissions and forage accumulation in the Brazilian Amazon forage-livestock systems submitted to N input strategies
T2  - GRASSLAND SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Brazilian Amazon, nitrogen input strategies are required to maintain forage-livestock systems productivity. However, greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions mitigation from tropical soils is also a global demand. This research aims to assess productivity and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from Oxisol cultivated with Marandu palisade grass (Brachiaria brizantha [Hochst. Ex A.Rich.] Stapf) submitted to nitrogen (N) input strategies (N fertilization and biological N fixation) in the Brazilian Amazon. The treatments were the following: control (unfertilized); U40 (fertilized with 40 kg N/ha as urea); U80 (fertilized with 80 kg N/ha as urea); AS40 (fertilized with 40 kg N/ha as ammonium sulfate); AS80 (fertilized with 80 kg N/ha as ammonium sulfate); and IAB (inoculated with Azospirillum brasilense). From January to March 2016, soil N2O emission, forage accumulation (FA) and relative emission (RE) were assessed during two 28-day cycles. The FA was greater in the U80 and AS80 than in control and IAB. The highest peaks of soil N2O flux occurred from 4 to 7 days after N fertilization, primarily in the highest N rates treatments. Overall, 40 kg N/ha resulted in higher N2O flux than control and IAB, which were lower than 80 kg N/ha regardless of the N source. The lowest fluxes occurred in the control and IAB (below 20 mu g N-N2O m(-2) hr(-1)). All of the emission factors (EF) calculated for both fertilizers and rates were lower than 0.35%, which is below the 1% established by the IPCC. Our results indicate the need for discussion of the EF in the pasture intensification to contribute to avoid deforestation and mitigating emissions. The inputs of 40 kg N/ha per application with urea or ammonium sulfate, due to the low EF and RE, are recommended as a pasture N input strategy in the Brazilian Amazon.

TI  - Forest recovery prognostics in conservation units of the Atlantic rainforest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest growth models can provide valuable support tools for forest recovery assessment and forestry management, whether in the form of diagnostic or prognostic. Furthremore, they can be applied to characterize each phytophysiognomy in terms of vegetation growth parameters that and can be applied to gauge the spatiotemporal progress of recovery processes. Up to date, such parameters remain mostly unknown. In this paper, we explore a modelling framework aimed at providing computer-aided prognostics of forest recovery based on the diffusive-logistic growth (DLG) model and present case studies for a number of four preservation areas located in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest biome. The modelling framework involves the application of vegetation indices derived from satellite images and a computational implementation of the DLG model. The objective of the study is to illustrate how forest restoration and recovery projects could gain from the proposed methodology, due to the fact that the likely outcomes of management practices could be assessed in advance. Additionally, it aims to determine the characteristic parameters of forest growth for a portion of the Atlantic rainforest biome. The diffusion and growth rate parameters from the DLG model were calibrated and they show the evolution of forest density over the years. The results show that the forest recovery process can take several decades to stabilize in the absence of negative interventions in the forest growth. The model and the implementation presented in this work are freely available and they can be an important tool for decision and policy making in what concerns forest recovery.

TI  - Distinguishing forest types in restored tropical landscapes with UAV-borne LIDAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest landscape restoration is a global priority to mitigate negative effects of climate change, conserve biodiversity, and ensure future sustainability of forests, with international pledges concentrated in tropical forest regions. To hold restoration efforts accountable and monitor their outcomes, traditional strategies for monitoring tree cover increase by field surveys are falling short, because they are labor-intensive and costly. Meanwhile remote sensing approaches have not been able to distinguish different forest types that result from utilizing different restoration approaches (conservation versus production focus). Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAV) with light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors can observe forests` vertical and horizontal structural variation, which has the potential to distinguish forest types. In this study, we explored this potential of UAV-borne LiDAR to distinguish forest types in landscapes under restoration in southeastern Brazil by using a supervised classification method. The study area encompassed 150 forest plots with six forest types divided in two forest groups: conservation (remnant forests, natural regrowth, and active restoration plantings) and production (monoculture, mixed, and abandoned plantations) forests. UAV-borne LiDAR data was used to extract several Canopy Height Model (CHM), voxel, and point cloud statistic based metrics at a high resolution for analysis. Using a random forest classification model we could successfully classify conservation and production forests (90% accuracy). Classification of the entire set of six types was less accurate (62%) and the confusion matrix showed a divide between conservation and production types. Understory Leaf Area Index (LAI) and the variation in vegetation density in the upper half of the canopy were the most important classification metrics. In particular, LAI understory showed the most variation, and may help advance ecological understanding in restoration. The difference in classification success underlines the difficulty of distinguishing individual forest types that are very similar in management, regeneration dynamics, and structure. In a restoration context, we showed the ability of UAV-borne LiDAR to identify complex forest structures at a plot scale and identify groups and types widely distributed across different restored landscapes with medium to high accuracy. Future research may explore a fusion of UAV-borne LiDAR with optical sensors , include successional stages in the analyses to further characterize , distinguish forest types and their contributions to landscape restoration.

TI  - Straw management effects on global warming potential and yield-scaled greenhouse gas emissions in a subtropical rice ecosystem
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming potential (GWP) of rice paddies depends on straw management. This study evaluated methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and soil C stocks to determine GWP and yield-scaled GWP under different strategies and intensities of rice straw management in a subtropical climate. We hypothesized that decreasing soil management intensity and straw incorporation in the soil would reduce GWP. Methane fluxes were substantially higher during the rice growing season than in the off-season, while the opposite was observed for N2O fluxes. The cumulative emissions of CH4 during the growing season among the straw management strategies evaluated ranged from 165.8 to 586.0 kg ha-1. Annual CH4 emissions were lower when soil and straw received some type of management compared to no-tillage. Daily N2O fluxes ranged from-2.8 to 201.7 g ha-1 day-1; cumulative N2O emissions during the off-season ranged from 455.2 to 2816.5 g ha-1. During the off-season, strategies to reduce N2O emissions include post-harvest straw incorporation using a disc harrow, winter straw removal, and ryegrass cropping. Soil organic C stocks ranged from 35.96 to 38.36 Mg ha-1. Straw management using a disc harrow reduced soil organic C stocks, with more adverse effects than straw removal. Soil and rice straw management did not affect rice grain yield, with an average of 10.4 Mg ha-1. Methane emissions were the main component of GWP in all straw management systems. The contribution of N2O emissions to GWP was small and mostly (>85 %) determined by off-season emissions. Yield-scaled GWP ranged from 0.64 to 1.06 Mg CO2eq Mg-1 yield and was lower when soil and straw management systems occurred shortly after the rice harvest. Our results indicate that soil and straw management immediately after rice harvest reduces CH4 emissions, GWP, and yield-scaled GWP.

TI  - Managing grazing intensity to reduce the global warming potential in integrated crop-livestock systems under no-till agriculture
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural intensification has been associated with increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Using integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLs) under no-till agriculture can increase soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation, thereby helping mitigate such emissions. The aim of this study was to assess the net global warming potential (net GWP) of no-till ICLs at variable grazing intensities of winter black oat pasture in a subtropical ecosystem. A 3.5-year field experiment involving three different grazing intensities (i.e., intensive, moderate and light as defined by a pasture height of 10, 20 and 30 cm, respectively) and grazing exclusion in winter and no-till soybean cropping in summer was conducted on a Ferralsol in southern Brazil. Net GWP, in Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) year(-1), was assessed in terms of SOC sequestration relative to intensive grazing as a reference, including methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and energy costs of farming operations and inputs. Moderate grazing reduced net GWP relative to intensive grazing (from 0.09 to 4.92 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) year(-1)), the latter leading to the highest GWP levels. The decrease in net GWP was mainly the result of SOC accumulation, which offset 34-98% of all GHG emissions. Light grazing and grazing exclusion proved to be less efficient than moderate grazing in decreasing net GWP (1.84 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) year(-1) on average), mainly as a result of decreased SOC accumulation. Based on our findings, moderate grazing (20 cm high pasture) of winter black oat pasture is an effective strategy to reduce the C-footprint of ICLs in subtropical no-till agriculture. HighlightsOn-farm assessment of net GWP in subtropical no-till ICLs Conversion from intensive to moderate grazing reduced net GWP SOC accumulation is the main driver of net GWP reduction under no-till ICLs.

TI  - Long-term trajectory and temporal dynamics of tropical peat subsidence in relation to plantation management and climate
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Disentangling land-use and climatic influences on peat subsidence, and establishing the long-term trajectory of subsidence, are necessary to determine the future economic and environmental sustainability of managed peatland landscapes. While many peatlands in temperate regions such as Europe have been drained for centuries, those of Southeast Asia have mostly been drained for agriculture and forestry practices within the last 30 years. These areas are subsiding rapidly, but few long-term subsidence records exist, and it is unclear whether currently high subsidence rates will be maintained in future. Furthermore, large-scale climate fluctuations associated with the El Nin similar to o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) exert a strong year-to-year influence on rainfall rates, affecting water table depth dynamics in both managed and intact peatlands. In this study, we analysed data collected over more than a decade of subsidence measurements from over 400 plantation and forest plots in Sumatra, Indonesia, including a unique set of 62 sites that have been continuously monitored since 2007. We show that spatial and temporal variations in subsidence rates are primarily determined by water table depth. We also find evidence of declining subsidence rates as a function of time since initial drainage, consistent with previous instrumental records from high-latitude peatlands and recent satellite data from tropical peatlands. Subsidence rates over the study period were strongly affected by the large ENSO/IOD-linked drought event in 2015-16, which caused an acceleration of subsidence across all sites. In plantation areas, we estimate that this climate perturbation caused around 14 % of subsidence observed over a twelve year period. At interior forest sites this rose to 32 %, and we found little evidence of ecosystem recovery to the end of 2018. This raises the possibility that repeated extreme droughts in the region could lead to long-term degradation of peat swamp forest ecosystems.

TI  - Decadal Fire Effects on the Structure, Composition, Diversity, and Aboveground Carbon Stocks of a Neotropical Savanna
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is a common disturbance in the Brazilian savanna (the cerrado), wherein high-frequency fires drive the vegetation structure, composition, function, and dynamics of savanna ecosystems. Under climate change pressure, further understanding of fire-vegetation relationships and interactions can provide new approaches for establishing integrated fire management strategies and can promote post-fire savanna vegetation recovery. To understand how 15 years of annually manipulated burning has affected vertical and horizontal structures of the vegetation, species composition and diversity metrics (species richness, Shannon's diversity, and Pielou's evenness), and aboveground carbon stocks, we surveyed all woody plant species with a diameter greater than three centimeters, in 15 plots of a typical Brazilian savanna (cerrado stricto sensu) at an experimental research station in central Brazil (the cerrado biome). The 15 plots (five plots per treatment) had been differently affected by fire events over a decade, and comprised three treatments: (i) annual fire, (ii) legacy fire (>15 years since the last fire event), and (iii) control (not burned in the past 30 years). A non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis indicated that fire had a significant effect on the species composition among the treatments; some species benefited from fire, such as Erythroxylum suberosum, whereas other species propagated better without fire, such as Roupala montana and Dalbergia miscolobium. Over a decade of annual fire events have led to decreases in Shannon's diversity, species richness, and stem density, which were significantly lower in the annual fire treatment than in the control and legacy fire treatments. Stem density by diameter and height size classes (except for the 1-2 m class and above 8 m class) was higher in the control than that in the annual fire treatment, but the number of dead trees did not differ between the control and the annual fire treatment. Our results also showed that fire was a factor in changes in the evaluated parameters, such as in the annual fire treatment, where fire reduced the amount of biomass, and therefore the carbon stocks. This study suggests that, if burned yearly, typical Brazilian savannas can become less biodiverse in terms of woody plant species which negatively affects their fire resilience. Therefore, fire management practices should focus on determining the frequency of fire disturbances from which these ecosystems may benefit the most.

TI  - Human amplification of secondary earthquake hazards through environmental modifications
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Anthropogenic climate change and modification of landscapes - such as deforestation, sediment movement, irrigation and sea-level rise - can destabilize natural systems and amplify hazards from earthquake-triggered landslides, liquefaction, tsunami and coastal flooding. In this Perspective, we examine the connections and feedbacks between human environmental modifications and secondary earthquake hazards to identify steps for hazard mitigation. Destabilization of slopes by vegetation removal, agricultural activities, steepening, loading and drainage disruption can amplify landslide hazards. For example, landslides were mainly triggered on deforested slopes after the 2010 and 2021 Haiti earthquakes. Liquefaction hazards are intensified by extensive irrigation and land reclamation, as exemplified by liquefaction causing >15 m of ground displacement in irrigated areas after the 2018 Palu earthquake. Degradation or removal of primary coastal vegetation and coral reefs, destruction of sand dunes, subsidence from groundwater withdrawal, and sea-level rise can increase tsunami inland reach. Restoration of natural coastal habitats could help decrease the maximum inland reach of tsunami, but their effectiveness depends on tsunami size. Sustainable farming practices, such as mixed crop cultivation and drip irrigation, can successfully reduce the saturation of soils and the liquefaction hazard in some situations. Future research should explore the potential of such sustainable practices and nature-based solutions in reducing earthquake-related hazards, in addition to their climate and ecosystem benefits.

TI  - The responses of leaf litter ant communities to wildfires in the Brazilian Amazon: a multi-region assessment
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is frequently used as tool for land management in the Amazon, but often escapes into surrounding forests, with potentially severe impacts for forest biodiversity. We investigated the effects of single wildfires on ant communities in four geographically distinct regions of the Brazilian Amazon (Roraima, Para, Acre and Mato Grosso) where forests had burned between 8 months and 10 years before our sampling. We established 7-12 transects, 500 m each, in burned and unburned forests in each region to investigate the effects of fire on forest structure and leaf litter ant communities, which were sampled using Winkler sacks. Fire effects on forest structure were more drastic in the most recently burned forests in Acre and Mato Grosso, while the impacts of older burns in Roraima and Para were more subtle. Ant species richness was not different between burnt and unburned areas, but community composition differed between burned and control forests in all regions except Mato Grosso. At the species level, indicator species analysis showed that a limited number of species were significant indicators of unburned control forests in all regions, except Acre. Forests structure variables and leaf litter volume were all important in shaping ant communities, but their relative importance varied between regions. Our results indicate that burned forest have different ant species communities from unburned forests, and those differences are still apparent 10 years after the disturbance, highlighting the importance of effective policies for fire management in Amazon.

TI  - INDONESIA'S FOREST MANAGEMENT PROGRESS: EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL KUZNETS CURVE
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS-INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC E-JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. High dependence on land resources is often the main cause of large-scale land conversion and deforestation in Indonesia. However, as a country vulnerable to climate change, Indonesia continues to increase its efforts to improve forest management and reduce deforestation. This is also in line with Indonesia's commitment to reduce emission levels to achieve Net-Zero Emissions by 2060, where the forestry sector will be the base of this achievement. This study aims to measure Indonesia's progress during 1970-2018, especially in reducing deforestation. With this study, we can see trends in forest management in developing countries, especially Indonesia. In addition, based on available data, we can see which factors are most closely related to Indonesia's deforestation rate.Methodology / approach. This study uses a time-series data analysis with Error Correction Method (ECM). This ECM is used to detect the existence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC), which describes the relationship between environmental degradation and economic variables. In this study, EKC is used to assess further relationship pattern between the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and deforestation. The relation pattern between this GDP and deforestation is tested using quadratic and cubic models.Results. Under the quadratic model, a classic inverted U-shape EKC is detected in this study. It means that with economic growth and technological improvement, deforestation can be reduced. In other words, Indonesia has improved its forest management. However, as the N-shape relation was also detected in further cubic model simulation, it is also an indication that, at some point, Indonesia is also prone to increase its deforestation again. Another finding from the model is that the palm oil plantation area strongly relates to the deforested area. At the same time, the simulation detects a negative relationship between the horticulture cropland and the deforested area. The result may capture an insight into the forest transition period in Indonesia. In this transition, the government has started to slow down the speed at which forests are exploited in various ways. Originality / scientific novelty. Although the forestry sector is an important economic sector for Indonesia, there is still limited research on this topic, especially at the national level. This study uses more updated statistical information to better describe the Indonesian forestry condition. Moreover, the analysis is aligned with the Indonesian land policy by introducing additional variables from palm oil and crop areas. Moreover, the previous EKC assessments in Indonesia usually only use the quadratic model, which has some limitations in detecting other turning points and seeing the existence of N-shaped or inverted N-shaped EKC. This study also tries to add a bit on cubic model assessment to detect this N-shaped EKC in Indonesia.Practical value / implications. This study gives broader information based on the available data and statistics on the country's deforestation situation and how the economic situation affects it. Policymakers can use the materials from this study to develop an effective forest management system throughout Indonesia.

CP  - 18th World Congress of Soil Science
CL  - Philadelphia, PA
AB  - Interrelationships between peat and water were studied using a hydropedological modelling approach for adjacent relatively intact and degraded peatland in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. The easy to observe degree of peat humification provided good guidance for the assignment of more difficult to measure saturated hydraulic conductivities to the acrotelm-catotelm hydrological system. Ideally, to prevent subsidence and fire, groundwater levels should be maintained between 40 cm below and 100 cm above the peat surface. Calculated groundwater levels for different years and for different months within a single year showed that these levels can drop deeper than the critical threshold of 40 cm below the peat surface whilst flooding of more than 100 cm above the surface was also observed. In July 1997, a dry El Nino year, areas for which deep groundwater levels were calculated coincided with areas that were on fire as detected from radar images. The relatively intact peatland showed resilience towards disturbance of its hydrological integrity whereas the degraded peatland was susceptible to fire. Hydropedological modelling identified areas with good restoration potential based on predicted flooding depth and duration. Groundwater level prediction maps can be used in fire hazard warning systems as well as in land utilization and restoration planning. These maps are also attractive tools to move from the dominant uni-sectoral approach in peatland resource management toward a much more promising multi-sectoral approach involving various forestry, agriculture and environment agencies. It is demonstrated that the combination of hydrology and pedology is essential for wise use of valuable but threatened tropical peatland ecosystems. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Limnogeology in Brazil's "forgotten wilderness": a synthesis from the large floodplain lakes of the Pantanal
T2  - JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment records from floodplain lakes have a large and commonly untapped potential for inferring wetland response to global change. The Brazilian Pantanal is a vast, seasonally inundated savanna floodplain system controlled by the flood pulse of the Upper Paraguay River. Little is known, however, about how floodplain lakes within the Pantanal act as sedimentary basins, or what influence hydroclimatic variables exert on limnogeological processes. This knowledge gap was addressed through an actualistic analysis of three large, shallow (< 5 m) floodplain lakes in the western Pantanal: Lagoa Gaiva, Lagoa Mandior, and Baia Vermelha. The lakes are dilute (CO3 (2-) > Si4+ > Ca2+), mildly alkaline, freshwater systems, the chemistries and morphometrics of which evolve with seasonal flooding. Lake sills are bathymetric shoals marked by siliciclastic fans and marsh vegetation. Flows at the sills likely undergo seasonal reversals with the changing stage of the Upper Paraguay River. Deposition in deeper waters, typically encountered in proximity to margin-coincident topography, is dominated by reduced silty-clays with abundant siliceous microfossils and organic matter. Stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, plus hydrogen index measured on bulk organic matter, suggest that contributions from algae (including cyanobacteria) and other C-3-vegetation dominate in these environments. The presence of lotic sponge spicules, together with patterns of terrigenous sand deposition and geochemical indicators of productivity, points to the importance of the flood pulse for sediment and nutrient delivery to the lakes. Flood-pulse plumes, waves and bioturbation likewise affect the continuity of sedimentation. Short-lived radioisotopes indicate rates of 0.11-0.24 cm year(-1) at sites of uninterrupted deposition. A conceptual facies model, developed from insights gained from modern seasonal processes, can be used to predict limnogeological change when the lakes become isolated on the floodplain or during intervals associated with a strengthened flood pulse. Amplification of the seasonal cycle over longer time scales suggests carbonate, sandy lowstand fan and terrestrial organic matter deposition during arid periods, whereas deposition of lotic sponges, mixed aquatic organic matter, and highstand deltas characterizes wet intervals. The results hold substantial value for interpreting paleolimnological records from floodplain lakes linked to large tropical rivers with annual flooding cycles.

TI  - Stress-tolerant trees for resilient cities: Tree-ring analysis reveals species suitable for a future climate
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities are vulnerable to droughts and heatwaves due to the decline in permeable green spaces and the emergence of heat islands. To tackle these environmental challenges, many cities adopted ambitious tree-planting initiatives. However, tree tolerance to climate extremes is overlooked even though physiological and growth limitations jeopardize ecosystem services provision. We assessed the responses of Tipuana tipu to the 2013/2014 summer drought in Sao Paulo, Brazil. We sampled trees in a park and streets and assessed how tree-ring delta 13C and growth responses to drought differ. The Regression Tree shows that microhabitats exert the strongest control on treering delta 13C seconded by drought. delta 13C is on average 1.0%o higher in streets where growth rate is 60% higher than in the park. Similarly, delta 13C increased by up to 0.9%o during the drought when growth increased by up to 45% in both sites. This positive association between delta 13C and growth rate (R2 = 0.78) indicates that growth is limited by assimilation rate. Assimilation is up to 15% higher in streets and increased by up to 10% during the drought because of higher incident sunlight and air temperature. Thus, T. tipu is a drought-tolerant species with potential to contribute to (sub)tropical cities, thriving in a warming climate.

TI  - Mega-development trends in the Amazon: Implications for global change
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes four global-change phenomena that are having major impacts on Amazonian forests. The first is accelerating deforestation and logging. Despite recent government initiatives to slow forest loss, deforestation rates in Brazilian Amazonia have increased from 1.1 million ha yr(-1) in the early 1990s, to nearly 1.5 million ha yr(-1) from 1992-1994, and to more than 1.9 million ha yr(-1) from 1995-1998. Deforestation is also occurring rapidly in some other parts of the Amazon Basin, such as in Bolivia and Ecuador, while industrialized logging is increasing dramatically in the Guianas and central Amazonia.The second phenomenon is that patterns of forest loss and fragmentation are rapidly changing. In recent decades, large-scale deforestation has mainly occurred in the southern and eastern portions of the Amazon - in the Brazilian states of Para, Maranhao, Rondonia, Acre, and Mate Grosso, and in northern Bolivia. While rates of forest loss remain very high in these areas, the development of major new highways is providing direct conduits into the heart of the Amazon. If future trends follow past patterns, land-hungry settlers and loggers may largely bisect the forests of the Amazon Basin.The third phenomenon is that climatic variability is interacting with human land uses, creating additional impacts on forest ecosystems. The 1997/98 Fl Nino drought, for example, led to a major increase in forest burning, with wildfires raging out of control in the northern Amazonian state of Roraima and other locations. Logging operations, which create labyrinths of roads and tracks in forests, are increasing fuel loads, desiccation and ignition sources in forest interiors. Forest fragmentation also increases fire susceptibility by creating dry, fire-prone forest edges.Finally, recent evidence suggests that intact Amazonian forests are a globally significant carbon sink, quite possibly caused by higher forest growth rates in response to increasing atmospheric CO2 fertilization. Evidence for a carbon sink comes from long-term forest mensuration plots, from whole-forest studies of carbon flux and from investigations of atmospheric CO2 and oxygen isotopes. Unfortunately, intact Amazonian forests are rapidly diminishing. Hence, not only is the destruction of these forests a major source of greenhouse gases, but it is reducing their intrinsic capacity to help buffer the rapid anthropogenic rise in CO2.

TI  - Carbon accumulation rates recorded in the last 150 years in tropical high mountain peatlands of the Atlantic Rainforest, SE - Brazil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands are environmental matrices that store large amounts of organic carbon (TOC) and work as records of environmental changes. Recent record of organic carbon accumulated were assessed in two Forest National Parks, Itatiaia and Serra dos Orgaos in the Southeastern of Brazil. Based on organic and inorganic characterization, the cores from peatlands presented a predominance of organic material in an advanced stage of decomposition and those soils were classified as typical Haplosaprists Histosols. The combination of favorable topographic and climatic conditions led to rapid C accumulation across coastal mountain in the tropical peatlands studied, presenting an average accumulation rate of C, in the last century, of 194 g C m(-2) yr(-1) about 7 higher times than the rate found in boreal and subarctic peatlands, those higher values may be related to changes in the hydrological cycle occurred since 1950s.

TI  - Fire regime in the Brazilian Savanna: Recent changes, policy and management
T2  - FLORA
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2019 Brazil recorded the highest wildland fire occurrence South America has seen for the last 15 years. Added to the Amazon, the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) faces changes in fire regimes. Climatic changes and the recent weakening of environmental law enforcement are factors, but historic and large-scale trends and drivers of fire regimes must be analyzed. We discuss ecological and policy drivers of recent changes in fire regimes in the Cerrado, in order to highlight management strategies. The Cerrado has evolved with natural fires and anthropogenic fires are also common for millennia. In the past 50 years, wildfires tend to be concentrated in the late dry season and to occur every two / three years, causing serious damage in fire-sensitive vegetation. Apart from climatic variations, the drivers of wildfires are deforestation and fire suppression policies. Nearly half of the original vegetation of the Cerrado biome has disappeared largely due to agribusiness expansion. Fire is associated with deforestation in two ways: vegetation conversion to monocultures, and lack of fire management in the remaining native vegetation. Indeed, the attempts to exclude fires from this fire-prone ecosystem disrupted traditional fire management. Fire suppression policies lead to increased wildfire risks due to fuel load and the multiplication of sources of ignition (conflicts, roads). The recent advances in Integrated Fire Management in protected areas in the Cerrado are evident. However, the recent budget cuts by the Brazilian government in environmental management and research undermine the chances of decreasing occurrences of wildfires in this biodiversity hotspot.

TI  - Modern Smallholders: Creating Diversified Livelihoods and Landscapes in Indonesia
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Encouraging smallholders to diversify their livelihoods has been a long-held policy objective of many governments to create resilient rural communities that can cope with seasonal variations in food production and price fluctuations in commercial markets. Due to the dynamic nature of smallholders' livelihoods, the relative contribution of different sources to household income often remains unclear. Recent research in Indonesia used a household survey of a stratified sample of smallholders (n = 240) in eight villages (five districts) to obtain data of smallholders' income and the relative importance of agroforestry. The research analysed income data from the same households (80%) collected in 2013, 2017 and 2020, providing longitudinal data of livelihoods and household income. Results revealed important information about the nature of Indonesia's rural economy, whereby many smallholders received most of their income from off-farm sources (56% of income). While most smallholders still reported farming as their primary occupation, their families' livelihoods are diverse and mainly supported by non-farm enterprises. Even the mix of farming enterprises is evolving, with agroforestry a prominent land-use and source of household income in Indonesia (29% of income), indicating that smallholders are intentionally diversifying their land-use and livelihoods. Our research found that conventional agricultural enterprises generated just 14% of household income, yet remains vital for household food security. The high proportion of off-farm income for smallholders has important implications for land management and rural development across Indonesia, as smallholders forgo intensification of their farming systems and instead opt for diversification-and at scale, creating resilient landscapes and livelihoods.

TI  - Modeling Current and Future Climates using WorldClim and DIVA Software: Case Studies from Timor Leste and India
T2  - JOURNAL OF CROP IMPROVEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To learn about spatial climate variations across a topographically nonuniform area, quantitative predictions built on top of high-resolution baseline climate models are necessary. The WorldClim program performs this task, allowing monthly rainfall and temperature baseline predictions (current conditions based on 1950-2000 averages) at a 5 km x 5 km pixel resolution to be visualized anywhere on the Earth through the DIVA mapping software. HADLEY CSIRO CCCMA and CCM3 climate predictions for the years 2020, 2050, and 2080 can be overlaid on the baseline climate. The resulting visualizations allow easy understanding of predicted rainfall and minimum and maximum temperatures across the globe, an important tool for anyone trying to understand climate-crop interactions across a nonuniform area. Indian baseline climate and projection visualizations for some years and locations are discussed. In a country as topographically variable as Timor Leste, where huge variation occurs in both rainfall and temperature across small spatial areas, this tool is especially useful. Known crop preferences for minimum and maximum temperature and rainfall thresholds can be inputted with these data to identify suitable areas for current species and cultivars, as well as suitable species and cultivar characteristics that should be focused on for future climate scenarios in specific locations. This type of information is important for research institutions, governments, and development agencies, and is also important for identifying agronomic interventions and directions for assisting local farmers to increase yields and reduce food insecurity. Timor Leste's climate and agriculture interactions have been studied using this tool and are summarized. Results revealed that, on average, the climate in Timor Leste (East Timor) is predicted to become about 1.5 degrees C warmer and about 10% wetter by 2050. Improved cultivars of maize, rice, cassava, sweet potato, and peanuts with increased yields have been introduced, but these will need to be augmented with better adapted cultivars and new crops and management practices specific to the changing climatic niches across the country. The hottest, low-lying areas are likely to become too hot for some species, and there will be a general upward movement of crop ranges toward the cooler, higher elevations. Coffee, the main agricultural export of the country, will likely have to shift upwards, implying massive social complications caused by land disputes and huge managerial challenges with respect to shade tree planting and ownership of the coffee plants. Temperate species currently grown at higher elevations are likely to become less common and may be phased out because of low productivity. Maize will likely be less productive at lower, hotter elevations but will respond well to higher temperatures and reduced chances of drought at middle to higher elevations. Rice yields may be affected by heat stress damage. Interventions, such as identifying and disseminating cultivars that are adapted to the predicted future conditions, are discussed. Other interventions, such as the requirements for fertilizers to boost yields; legumes to increase protein availability; and terracing and/or contour hedgerows to prevent soil erosion of steeply sloping terrain, are also identified and discussed.

TI  - Biochar addition reduces N2O emissions in fertilized soils under energy cane cultivation
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - N2O emissions resulting from the application of nitrogen (N) fertilizers and vinasse represent the main sources of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions in sugar-energy sector. Conversely, the application of biochar in soils has been worldwide recognized as an strategy to mitigate N2O emissions, although little is known about their effects on soils under energy cane production. The study aimed to evaluate the effects of biochar addition as a strategy to mitigate soil N2O emissions in soil under energy cane cultivation, as well as to quantify the abundance of N2O-producing and N2O-reducing microbial guilds. A greenhouse experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design, with five treatments and four replications. The treatments were: i) no N fertilization (control); ii) N fertilization; iii) N fertilization plus vinasse; iv) N fertilization plus biochar; v) N fertilization plus vinasse plus biochar. All treatments (except control) were balanced to receive the same amount of nutrients. Biochar was added at a rate of 5 g kg � 1 of soil. Soil N2O emissions were quantified by static chambers for 78 days, and soil sampling were performed to determine chemical and microbiological attributes, including functional genes of the nitrogen cycle (AOA, AOB, nirK, nirS, nosZI and nosZII) by real-time PCR. Results indicated that vinasse addition increased N2O emissions. Conversely, the application of biochar reduced N2O emissions associated with the application of N fertilizer (56 %) and N fertilizer + vinasse (41 %). The high N2O emissions observed in vinasse treatment were directly correlated with nitrifier microorganisms (AOB and AOA), indicating that nitrification should be the main pathway of N2O emissions in this treatment. The production of energy cane biomass was similar between N fertilizer treatments. High N2O emission intensities (mg N2O g biomass -1) were obtained in treatments with vinasse application. This study concluded that biochar is an effficient strategy to mitigate N2O emissions, providing the first insights into how biochar affects the microbial community associated with N2O emissions from soil under energy cane cultivation.

TI  - Rotations with Crotalaria spp. do not suppress populations of Meloidogyne incognita in cotton
T2  - NEMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Field studies were conducted in Mato Grosso, Brazil and Georgia, USA to evaluate the efficacy of Crotalaria spp. as a rotational cover crop for managing Meloidogyne incognita in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum). The two studies differed in how Crotalaria spp. were incorporated into the cotton production system to reflect differences in climate (tropical vs subtropical) and production systems typical for the two regions. In Mato Grosso, Crotalaria juncea and C. spectabilis were planted after soybean in late summer, grown for approximately 300 days, and incorporated into the soil 6-15 days prior to cotton planting. In Georgia, C. juncea and a nematode-resistant cowpea, Vigna ungiculata, were planted after maize in the late summer, grown until killed by frost in the early winter, and cotton was planted in the next season. Soil population densities of M. incognita and root galling in cotton were similar in cotton following either fallow, resistant cowpea, or Crotalaria spp. However, Crotalaria spp. significantly increased cotton plant height at the time of harvest relative to the other treatments. Except for one of the experiments in Brazil, incorporation of Crotalaria spp. in the rotational scheme did not increase cotton yield. Results indicate that a cover crop of Crotalaria spp. does not suppress M. incognita in cotton production system more than a fallow period or planting a resistant cover crop.

TI  - The primary sources of carbon loss during the crop-establishment period in a subtropical Oxisol under contrasting tillage systems
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The physical protection of mineralizable carbon (C) in aggregates has been identified as the primary mechanism of soil C stabilization. Therefore, it is possible to hypothesize that the disruption of aggregate by soil tillage is a key process driving C losses during the crop-establishment period. However, these findings are based on studies performed in temperate soils. Limited information is available for studies performed in subtropical and tropical soils, especially in Oxisols, which are rich in oxides that provides chemical C stabilization. This study was performed in southern Brazil in a long-term soil-management experiment carried out in a clay Typic Haplorthox in Cruz Alta (RS). During the 22nd year of the experiment, carbon dioxide (CO2-C) emissions, temperature, and soil moisture were intensively evaluated over a 21-day summer crop-establishment period using a closed infrared CO2-flux chamber. The cropping system investigated was an intensive crop rotation following the soil input of winter-cover crops (black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb) + common vetch (Vicia sativa L) under two contrasting tillage systems, conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT). The apparent contributions to CO2-C losses by resident soil C associated with aggregate disruption and recent crop-residue C input were assessed in treatments with crop-residue input (+R) and with crop-residue removed (-R). An exponential-decay model was used to fit the differences in CO2-C flux between CT - R and NT - R (apparent aggregate-disruption effect) and between CT + R and CT - R (apparent recent crop-residue C input effect). As expected, the CT + R showed an increase of 72% in CO2-C losses relative to NT + R. During the three-week crop-establishment period, crop-residue C input was the primary source of CO2-C emissions under CT. The CO2-C losses under CT were equivalent to 65% of the aboveground C input by winter cover crops, whereas this value decreased to 35% in NT. Exponential-decay modeling of the data for the first week showed that approximately 20% of the CO2-C losses under CT were related to the exposure of mineralizable resident soil C due by tillage operations. The analysis showed that this value decreased to only 2% for the three-week period. The CO2-C emissions exhibited a positive linear relationship with soil temperature and soil water-filled porosity under NT, but a similar relationship was found only with soil temperature under CT. For this Oxisol during the crop-establishment period, the physical aggregate disruption induced by long-term CT played a secondary role in CO2-C losses relative to the recent crop-residue C input from tillage operations.

TI  - Emission of nitrous oxide in flooded rice cultivation in tropical area of Brazil
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of nitrogen fertilizers on the N dynamics and grain yield in flooded rice (Oryza saliva) cultivation in Brazilian tropical wetland. The experiment was carried out in a randomized complete block design with six treatments, as follows: common and protected urea; topdressing application of N doses (30, 70, and 150 kg ha(-1)): and one control treatment, without N fertilization. Emissions of N2O-N, global warming potential (pGWP), emission factors (EF) for mineral fertilizers, grain yield, emission intensity, nitrate, ammonium, pH, and potential redox were quantified. Gas sampling was carried out in two crop seasons of rice cultivation and in one off-season. During the flooded period of the two crop seasons, N2O fluxes did not exceed 862.41 mu g m(-2) h(-1) N2O-N; in the off-season, the fluxes varied from -52.95 to 274.34 mu g m(-2) h(-1) N2O-N. Consistent emission peaks were observed in soil draining before harvest, when the highest rate of both N sources was used, and also in the control treatment in the off-season. Protected urea does not reduce N2O emissions or EF. Nitrogen increases the grain yield. Protected urea does not have any effect on the pGWP. The concentrations of NO3- and NH4+ in the soil are not related to N2O fluxes.

TI  - Modelled land use and land cover change emissions - a spatio-temporal comparison of different approaches
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the net carbon flux from land use and land cover changes (f(LULCC)) is critical for understanding the global carbon cycle and, hence, to support climate change mitigation. However, large-scale f(LULCC) is not directly measurable and has to be inferred from models instead, such as semi-empirical bookkeeping models and process-based dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). By definition, f(LULCC) estimates are not directly comparable between these two different model types. As an important example, DGVM-based f(LULCC) in the annual global carbon budgets is estimated under transient environmental forcing and includes the so-called loss of additional sink capacity (LASC). The LASC results from the impact of environmental changes on land carbon storage potential of managed land compared to potential vegetation and accumulates over time, which is not captured in bookkeeping models. The f(LULCC) from transient DGVM simulations, thus, strongly depends on the timing of land use and land cover changes mainly because LASC accumulation is cut off at the end of the simulated period. To estimate the LASC, the f(LULCC) from pre-industrial DGVM simulations, which is independent of changing environmental conditions, can be used. Additionally, DGVMs using constant present-day environmental forcing enable an approximation of bookkeeping estimates. Here, we analyse these three DGVM-derived f(LULCC) estimations (under transient, pre-industrial, and present-day forcing) for 12 models within 18 regions and quantify their differences as well as climate- and CO2-induced components and compare them to bookkeeping estimates. Averaged across the models, we find a global f(LULCC) (under transient conditions) of 2.0 +/- 0.6 PgC yr(-1) for 2009-2018, of which similar to 40% are attributable to the LASC (0.8 +/- 0.3 PgC yr(-1)). From 1850 onward, the f(LULCC) accumulated to 189 +/- 56 PgC with 40 +/- 15 PgC from the LASC. Around 1960, the accumulating nature of the LASC causes global transient f(LULCC) estimates to exceed estimates under present-day conditions, despite generally increased carbon stocks in the latter. Regional hotspots of high cumulative and annual LASC values are found in the USA, China, Brazil, equatorial Africa, and Southeast Asia, mainly due to deforestation for cropland. Distinct negative LASC estimates in Europe (early reforestation) and from 2000 onward in the Ukraine (recultivation of post-Soviet abandoned agricultural land), indicate that f(LULCC) estimates in these regions are lower in transient DGVM compared to bookkeeping approaches. Our study unravels the strong dependence of f(LULCC) estimates on the time a certain land use and land cover change event happened to occur and on the chosen time period for the forcing of environmental conditions in the underlying simulations. We argue for an approach that provides an accounting of the f(LULCC) that is more robust against these choices, for example by estimating a mean DGVM ensemble f(LULCC) and LASC for a defined reference period and homogeneous environmental changes (CO2 only).

TI  - Changes in organic carbon and microbiology community structure due to long-term irrigated agriculture on Luvisols in the Brazilian semi-arid region
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the global water cycle affect irrigation requirements and soil processes as well as the structure of soil microbial communities and function and the carbon (C) balance. The microbial structure and C sequestration under land use changing scenarios are rarely studied in the semi-arid region of Brazil. Here, we assessed the effects of land-use changes (irrigation and cultivation) on C storage in the soil and the structure of total bacteria (16S rRNA gene profile) and fungus (18S rRNA gene profile) at soil depth. We evaluated two soil profiles in the semi-arid region in northeastern Brazil. Profile P1 in an area with long-term irrigation (1,500 mm of water per year) and cultivation (small-scale farming systems, mainly with subsistence crops, which is a frequent land use system in the region of irrigated soil) for about 26 years. Profile P2 under natural conditions with 400 mm of water per year of rainfall (rain-fed hyperxerophilic Caatinga). Land-use changes showed a small influence on C storage; however, the changes strongly affected the soil organic matter (SOM) quality as well as the bacterial and fungal community structure, indicated by higher contents of labile-C and microbial biomass along with lower C-CO2 emission. The relatively large amounts of aliphatic groups in the soil surface and subsurface in the cropped system (P1) suggested enrichment of methylene structures and probable increase of microbial-derived compounds. Methoxylic and aromatic groups tend to increase at depth (Bt horizon) indicating that the subsoil C responds to soil management changes. The structures of the bacterial community are distinct at depth in P1 and more similar at depth in P2. On the other hand, the structures of the fungal communities are more similar at depth in P1 than in P2. Furthermore, the irrigated agriculture also presented a carbon management index greater than 140% in most horizons, indicating that the soil management system did not cause soil degradation.

TI  - CROP RESIDUES ON SHORT-TERM CO2 EMISSIONS IN SUGARCANE PRODUCTION AREAS
T2  - ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - The proper management of agricultural crop residues could produce benefits in a warmer, more drought-prone world. Field experiments were conducted in sugarcane production areas in the Southern Brazil to assess the influence of crop residues on the soil surface in short-term CO2 emissions. The study was carried out over a period of 50 days after establishing 6 plots with and without crop residues applied to the soil surface. The effects of sugarcane residues on CO2 emissions were immediate; the emissions from residue-covered plots with equivalent densities of 3 (D50) and 6 (D100) t ha(-1) (dry mass) were less than those from non-covered plots (D0). Additionally, the covered fields had lower soil temperatures and higher soil moisture for most of the studied days, especially during the periods of drought. Total emissions were as high as 553.62 +/- 47.20 g CO2 m(-2), and as low as 384.69 +/- 31.69 g CO2 m(-2) in non-covered (D0) and covered plot with an equivalent density of 3 t ha(-1) (D50), respectively. Our results indicate a significant reduction in CO2 emissions, indicating conservation of soil carbon over the short-term period following the application of sugarcane residues to the soil surface.

TI  - Assessment of drought effects on survival and growth dynamics in eucalypt commercial forestry using remote sensing photogrammetry. A showcase in Mato Grosso, Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The plantation of fast-growing tree species plays a crucial role in supplying forest products to growing economies while relieving pressure on native forests reducing the overexploitation of native ecosystems. Grown in more than 90 countries, Eucalyptus spp. are fast-growing tree species driving economic production comprising pulp, wood, or thermal energy. Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of extreme drought episodes: the 2019 drought in Mato Grosso, Brazil, was the second driest episode ever recorded. Forest inventory data comprising thousands of individual tree measurements collected in consecutive surveys - years 2019, 2020, 2021 - were modelled with mixed-effects models to identify significant factors influencing tree mortality after drought. Time-series of growth dynamics of the four eucalypt commercial clones were tested. For the landscape assessment, surveys using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) supported a high-resolution image mosaicking to derive digital surface models and the vegetation indexes driving segmentation and classification methods using ground plot-level observations as training data. The impact of drought was measured in terms of mortality, growth dynamics and the financial losses computed when valuing the 1400-ha plantation along the 3-year series. The modelling results showed high-stocking plantations suffered more from extreme water-stress conditions. The interaction between stocking and clone was analysed. On average, the 2019 drought triggered an estimate loss of $3500 per hectare. The estimation of live and dead conditions using UAV-based outcomes reached an overall accuracy of 89% and 0.7 in the Cohen's kappa used to map forest health wall-to-wall. Our findings advocate for a reduction of tree planting density and enhanced clone selection to turn eucalypt plantations more resilient to extreme water-stress. Combining UAV-based remote sensing technology, ground truth data and management expertise in eucalypt management eases the operationalization of data-driven solutions towards more resilient silvicultural guidelines and increased efficiency of forest plantations.

TI  - Enhanced-efficiency nitrogen fertilizers reduce winter losses of nitrous oxide, but not of ammonia, from no-till soil in a subtropical agroecosystem
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen (N) gas losses can be reduced by using enhanced-efficiency N (EEN) fertilizers such as urease inhibitors and coating technologies. In this work, we assessed the potential ofEENfertilizers to reduce winter losses of nitrous oxide (N2O-N) and ammonia (NH3-N) from a subtropical field experiment on a clayey Inceptisol under no-till in Southern Brazil. TheEENsources used included urea containingN-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (UR+NBPT), polymer-coated urea (P-CU) and copper-and-boron-coated urea (CuB-CU) in addition to common urea (UR) and a control treatment without N fertilizer application. N2O-N andNH(3)-N losses were assessed by using the static chamber method and semi-open static collectors, respectively. Both N2O-N andNH(3)-N exhibited two large peaks with an intervening period of low soil moisture and air temperature. Although the short-term effect was limited to the first few days after application,UR +NBPTurea decreased soil N2O-N emissions by 38% relative toUR. In contrast, urease inhibitor technology had no effect onNH(3)-N volatilization. Both coating technologies (CuB-CUand P-CU) were ineffective in reducing N losses via N2O production orNH(3)volatilization. The N2O emission factor (% N applied released as N2O) was unaffected by all N sources and amounted to only 0.48% of N applied-roughly one-half the default factor ofIPCCTier 1 (1%). Based on our findings, usingNBPT-treated urea in the cold winter season in subtropical agroecosystems provides environmental benefits in the form of reduced soil N2O emissions; however, fertilizer coating technologies provide no agronomic (NH3) or environmental (N2O) advantages.

TI  - Flipped reducetarianism: A vegan fish subordinated to carnivory by suppression of the flooded forest in the Amazon
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of dams closure and floodplain forest removal on diet and body condition of a frugivorous migratory fish from the Amazon were evaluated herein. Fish were captured with gillnets in two different environmental conditions: before and after the construction of the Santo Antonio reservoir in Madeira River, preceded by clearing of floodplain forest to mitigate the effects of eutrophication into the run-of-river dam. A total of 493 Mylossoma duriventre specimens were accessed and showed a strong shift in diet while body condition did not change after reservoir formation. The vegan diet based on fruits and seed was associated to Mylossoma duriventre prior to damming, and replaced by a carnivorous one, mainly based on insects. Our results suggest that dietary plasticity has guaranteed its body condition, at least in the first two years after damming. Cutting off floodplain forest to avoid eutrophication has immediate and direct impacts upon the supply of fruits and seeds for Mylossoma duriventre. Still, substitution with insectivorous diet over a frugivorous one, as observed for Mylossoma duriventre, may conceal an underlying problem of decreasing the local ichthyochory and floodplain forest maintenance or restoration of varzea areas over the time.

TI  - Carbon storage and physical and chemical properties of a medium-textured soil in agricultural systems in Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DE AGRICULTURA NEOTROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the physical and chemical properties and carbon storage in different agricultural production systems in medium-texture soils in the subtropical region of Brazil. Soil samples were collected in three management systems: Pasture (PP), no-till (NT), and no-till + Urochloa (NT+U), in addition to a native forest area (NF), in four soil layers up to 0.40 m. Chemical and physical soil analyses were performed. Bulk density and penetration resistance results did not indicate soil compaction in the areas managed after 24 years. The PP area had higher total porosity and microporosity values than the NT and NT+U areas. The PP area had the highest values of the sum of bases and CEC. NT+U and PP areas had the highest TOC contents and carbon storage potential up to the 0-0.40 m layer. The PP area in the 0-0.40 m profile had 52.89%, 72.21%, 79.79%, and 97.08% Mg ha(-1) more stocks than the NF area in the four soil layers evaluated. In the 0.20-0.40 m stratum, the NT+U area had StockC values of 11.21 Mg ha(-1), which was 17.62% more than the NT area. These results show the potential of grasslands for carbon storage in medium-texture soils under subtropical climates, mainly due to the characteristics of grasslands that can produce significant amounts of biomass constantly deposited in the soil.

TI  - Burning of secondary forest in Amazonia:: Biomass, burning efficiency and charcoal formation during land preparation for agriculture in Apiau, Roraima, Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In a burn of 5-year-old secondary forest cleared for agriculture in Roraima, Brazil, carbon partitioning was measured for above-ground portions of both secondary forest (regrowth) and the remains of original forest, felled and burned six years previously. Above-ground dry weight biomass averaged 43.0 +/- 6.5 Mg (megagrams=metric tons) per hectare (Mg ha(-1)) for secondary forest and 105.8 +/- 23.7 Mg ha(-1) for original forest remains. Pre- and post-burn above-ground biomass loadings were estimated by cutting and weighing six 60-m(2) plots and by line-intersect sampling (LIS) done along the axis of each post-burn plot (three transects), plus two supplementary LIS transects. High variability of initial biomass made LIS more reliable for assessing change in material >10 cm in diameter; quantities for diameter classes <10 cm relied on direct weighing. Above-ground carbon pools were reduced by 67.8% in secondary forest and 32.0% in original forest remains. Burning released 28.8 Mg C ha(-1) (original forest remains plus secondary forest biomass), or 41.6% of the pre-burn total carbon stock in biomass. The remainder of the carbon either remained as residual biomass (39.2 Mg C ha(-1) or 56.5% of pre-burn C) or as charcoal and ashes (1.4 Mg C ha(-1) or 2.0%). Carbon stock in charcoal increased from 0.50 Mg C ha(-1) to 1.07 Mg C ha(-1), a net gain of 0.57 Mg C ha(-1), or 0.8% of the pre-burn above-ground carbon stock. The net gain of charcoal carbon was composed of 0.21 Mg C ha(-1) from secondary forest biomass and 0.36 Mg C ha(-1) from original forest remains; 1.1% of the above-ground secondary forest carbon was converted to charcoal, while the corresponding percentage for original forest remains was 0.7%. Ashes contained an additional 0.29 Mg C ha(-1), of which 0.11 Mg C ha(-1) can be attributed to secondary forest biomass and 0.18 Mg C ha(-1) to original forest remains. If the carbon in ashes is assumed to be finely powdered charcoal, this stock adds 0.21% to the charcoal formation percentage for secondary forest and 0.36% to that for original forest remains. The overall charcoal-formation percentage was 1.6%, or 2.0% if ashes are included. Charcoal-formation percentages in this study are lower than those sometimes assumed in global carbon models; nevertheless, charcoal can represent an important sink of atmospheric carbon over long time scales.

TI  - How the Adequate Choice of Plant Species Favors the Restoration Process in Areas Susceptible to Extreme Frost Events
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This work aimed to evaluate the impacts caused by extreme frost events in an ecological restoration area. We grouped the species in three ways: (1) type of trichome coverage; (2) shape of the seedling crown; and (3) functional groups according to the degree of damage caused by frost. The variables of the restored area and species characteristics were selected to be subjected to linear generalization analysis models (GLMs). A total of 104 individuals from seven species were sampled. The most affected species were Guazuma ulmifolia Lam. (98% of leaves affected), followed by Cecropia pachystachia Tr & eacute;cul and Hymenea courbaril L. (both 97%), Inga vera Willd. (84%), and Senegalia polyphylla (DC.) Britton & Rose with 75%. Tapirira guianensis Aubl. was considered an intermediate species, with 62% of the crown affected. Only Solanum granulosoleprosum Dunal was classified as slightly affected, with only 1.5% of leaves affected. With the GLM analysis, it was verified that the interaction between the variables of leaf thickness (Chi(2) = 37.1, df = 1, p < 0.001), trichome coverage (Chi(2) = 650.5, df = 2, p < 0.001), and leaf structure culture (Chi(2) = 54.0, df = 2, p < 0.001) resulted in a model with high predictive power (AIC = 927,244, BIC = 940,735, Chi(2) = 6947, R-2 = 0.74, p < 0.001). Frost-affected crown cover was best explained by the interaction between the three functional attributes (74%). We found that there is a tendency for thicker leaves completely covered in trichomes to be less affected by the impact of frost and that the coverage of the affected crown was greatly influenced by the coverage of trichomes. Seedlings with leaves completely covered in trichomes, thicker leaves, and a funneled or more open crown structure are those that are most likely to resist frost events. The success of ecological restoration in areas susceptible to extreme events such as frost can be predicted based on the functional attributes of the chosen species. This can contribute to a better selection of species to be used to restore degraded areas.

TI  - Collaborative Governance of Nasalis larvatus (Wurmb, 1787) Conservation in Barito Kuala Regency, Indonesia.
T2  - Ecological Questions
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural resources and social conflict have a strong relationship. The current natural resource management problems have caused deforestation, resulting in unstable environmental ecosystems. Consequently, a movement towards mitigating natural resource management emerged because of the threat to the "Bekantan" Proboscis Monkey habitat and population in South Kalimantan Province. Indonesian Proboscis Monkey Friends (SBI) Foundation is a non-profit organization aiming to protect Proboscis monkeys on Curiak Island. SBI adopts collaborative resource governance in building stakeholder capacity with shared motivation and principles for collective action. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the collaborative governance process conducted on Proboscis Monkey conservation in Curiak Island. The results showed that anyone, including non- government organizations, could initiate collaboration in the several programs such as conservation, buy back the land and rambai mangrove restoration. Various parties collaborations are proven to successfully increase the support for environmental conservation efforts, especially the habitat and endemic proboscis monkeys.

TI  - Economic losses to sustainable timber production by fire in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Although still the largest expanse of tropical rainforests in the world, the Amazon is suffering a declining capacity to deliver ecosystem services, to which the widespread use of fire is one of the main contributing factors. Even if fires directly affect the timber sector, most current logging practices often tend to increase rather than mitigate the problem. We argue that in order to involve the timber sector in fire mitigation policies in the Amazon it is crucial to assess the economic impact of fire on the sector. This paper describes EcoFire (Economic Cost of Fire), a spatially explicit model for valuing the economic losses to sustainable timber harvest operations in the Brazilian Amazon as a result of fire. To conduct this analysis, we have integrated a set of models that simulate the synergy between logging and fire spread and intensity. Our results show that fire affects roughly 2% of the timber production areas that would be harvested between 2012 and 2041. In burnt areas, fire causes losses on average of US$39 +/- 2 ha/year (equivalent annual annuity), which represents a loss of 0.8% of expected rents. Yet losses can reach up to US$183 +/- 30 ha/year in areas hit by recurrent fires that are near milling centres. The results indicate that some of the municipalities that are likely to accumulate most economic losses due to fire do not yet have local-level fire mitigation programmes. We therefore conclude that spatially explicit valuations of the economic impact of fire can pinpoint priorities to better target fire action plans as well as to engage local actors in integrated fire management practices.

TI  - Assessment of land use changes in the Verde River basin using two hydrological models
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use changes can affect hydrological cycle dynamics, mainly groundwater recharge and infiltration-runoff relationships. The objective of this study was to evaluate the application of the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) and Lavras Simulation of Hydrology (LASH) hydrological models and analyse the impacts of land use changes on the hydrological regime in the Verde River basin of southeastern Brazil. The land use change scenarios were developed considering demographic, agricultural and economic indicators as follows: 20% (S1) and 50% (S2) conversion of pasture into eucalyptus; 20% (S3) and 50% (S4) conversion of native forest into pasture; and 20% conversion of pasture into forest (S5). The CNS (Nash-Sutcliffe) values varied from 0.77 to 0.88 for daily and monthly fit during calibration (1993-1999) and validation (2000-2005) periods. The LASH model showed a better capacity to reproduce the regular streamflow regime than the VIC model. The reforestation scenarios (S1, S2, and S5) showed a decrease in total runoff, mainly due to the increase in evapotranspiration and canopy interception, while the deforestation scenarios (S3 and S4) showed the opposite effects. Differences in the structure and representation of hydrological processes in hydrological models must be considered to predict the impacts of land use changes on the hydrology of tropical and subtropical basins.

TI  - Macrozoobenthic community assemblage as key indicator for mangrove restoration success in North Sumatra and Aceh, Indonesia
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The recognition of the high value of mangrove forests and the wide array of ecosystem services they provide has motivated investment in worldwide restoration efforts. However, current metrics of functional restoration (other than seedling survival rates and plant community composition) are often not readily available for local community managers, highlighting an urgency to identify easy-to-measure indicators to assess the functionality of restored mangroves. The macrozoobenthic community could be such practical indicator, as macrozoobenthic communities are sensitive to changes in their environment, and can be easily surveyed within local managing programs. Focusing on three main mangrove management conditions (natural, planted, and naturally regenerated) in North Sumatra and the province of Aceh, Indonesia, we compared vegetation and macrozoobenthic community diversity indices and identified environmental variables that best describe the forest management conditions and their associated macrozoobenthic community assemblage. Results showed that community assemblage, rather than macrozoobenthic diversity index, was associated with management conditions. The highest dissimilarity in macrozoobenthic community assemblages occurred between planted versus natural mangroves, with nonsignificant dissimilarity between natural and naturally regenerated mangroves. The Lined Nerite gastropod (Nerita balteata) was identified as an indicator of natural mangroves, and the invasive Giant African snail (Achatina fulica) was abundant in mangrove plantations, but also in natural mangroves bordering harbors, oil palm plantations, and aquaculture ponds, suggesting associated anthropogenic pressures. This study showed that the macrozoobenthic community can be used as restoration indicator and could serve as a baseline to empower monitoring activities and community-based adaptive management practices to improve the outcomes of restoration efforts.

TI  - How diversity of crop residues in long-term no-tillage systems affect chemical and microbiological soil properties
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrated systems of agriculture lead to better food and environmental quality, but these systems are complex and should be evaluated in long-term experiments. The objective of this study is to evaluate long-term NT systems with different histories, management and different quantity and quality of plant residues on chemical and microbiological soil properties. The NT systems are located in three experimental fields of Embrapa Cerrados, in the Cerrado region, with 26, 21 and 12 years of establishment. The NT systems were characterized for soil chemical and microbiological properties and for quantity and quality of crop residues. Soil properties studied were basal respiration (BR), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and microbial quotient (qMIC) in three depths from 0-30 cm layer. The systems with annual succession of soybean with maize intercropped with U. brizantha grazed or not in the off-season increased the quantity of crop residues (around 10.70 ton ha(-1)) and contributed more to the quality of the vegetal residues, in addition to increasing MBC (up to 716 mg kg(-1) soil), TN (between 4 and 5 g kg(-1) soil), TOC (35 to 40 g kg(-1) soil) and qMIC (up to 1.83%), which indicates that this system promoted improvement in the quality of chemical and biological soil properties and contributed to carbon accumulation in the soil over a period of 26 years.

TI  - Vertical patterns of soil water uptake by plants in a primary forest and an abandoned pasture in the eastern Amazon: an isotopic approach
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated the water uptake patterns of a primary forest and of the savanna-like vegetation of an abandoned pasture in an eastern Amazon site. We used natural stable isotope abundance in the soil profile, as well as plots irrigated with deuterated water to determine time and depth of soil water uptake by plants in different functional groups. Natural isotopic abundance was not suitable for identification of depth of water uptake by plants, but experiments using labeled water were. We found that the label percolation rate in the soil profile of the forest was lower than that observed in the pasture. Fourteen months after application, the label peak was located at 1.8 m depth in the forest and at 3 m depth in the pasture. Isotopic analysis of sap water from trees and lianas in the forest during the dry season showed that trees acquired labeled water at a deeper level in the soil profile compared to that acquired by lianas. Depth of water uptake by lianas seems to vary on a seasonal basis. In the pasture the 'colonizer' shrub (Solanum crinitum Lamb.) took up labeled water only from the surface layer of the soil profile (similar to 20%), whereas the most abundant coexisting grass (Panicum maximum Jacq.) acquired it from the top meter. None of the pasture plants were able to acquire labeled water after one rainy season when the label pulse was deep in the soil (> 1 m deep). These results have implications for studies of forest water cycle in which the soil volume used as source of water for plant transpiration is still unknown, and for an understanding of plant succession in the forest regeneration process of abandoned pastures in the eastern Amazon.

TI  - No evidence of local deforestation leakage from protected areas establishment in Brazil's Amazon and Atlantic Forest
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Establishing Protected areas (PAs) could displace or cause 'leakage' of deforestation into adjacent areas. Such leakage would potentially offset PAs' conservation effort by jeopardizing forest conservation goals and impeding financial mechanisms such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation -REDD+. Here we investigate forest loss inside PAs' borders and whether leakage occurred following the establishment of new PAs (n = 425) within the Amazon and the Atlantic forests in Brazil between 2004 and 2017. We applied a Before -After-Control-Intervention statistical design with a matching approach to evaluate deforestation leakage from PAs' establishment using a spatial (inside and outside PAs)- temporal (before and after PA establishment) measure of deforestation rates. We also used "Random Forest " to investigate the drivers of the effect of PAs' establishment on their surrounding areas. We found that when PAs' establishment led to reducing deforestation inside their boundaries, their surrounding also experienced a reduction in deforestation ( "blockage "). Similarly, when PAs' establishment could not reduce deforestation inside their boundaries, their surroundings also experienced increased deforestation. Such a pattern was most common for Indigenous territories, especially in the deforestation arch in the Amazon. However, we did not find significant evidence for leakage as PAs' surroundings with a significant increase in deforestation were associated with PAs unable to significantly reduce deforestation within their boundaries. Therefore, "leakage " should not limit the establishment of new PAs. Instead, greater investments into reinforcement are needed for existing PAs, with high priority given to Indigenous Territories.

TI  - Evolution and Conservation of Central African Biodiversity: Priorities for Future Research and Education in the Congo Basin and Gulf of Guinea
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Review
AB  - The tropical forests of the Congo Basin and Gulf of Guinea harbor some of the greatest terrestrial and aquatic biological diversity in the world. However, our knowledge of the rich biological diversity of this region and the evolutionary processes that have shaped it remains limited, as is our understanding of the capacity for species to adapt or otherwise respond to current and projected environmental change. In this regard, research efforts are needed to increase current scientific knowledge of this region's biodiversity, identify the drivers of past diversification, evaluate the potential for species to adapt to environmental change and identify key populations for future conservation. Moreover, when evolutionary research is combined with ongoing environmental monitoring efforts, it can also provide an important set of tools for assessing and mitigating the impacts of development activities. Building on a set of recommendations developed at an international workshop held in Gabon in 2011, we highlight major areas for future evolutionary research that could be directly tied to conservation priorities for the region. These research priorities are centered around five disciplinary themes: (1) documenting and discovering biodiversity; (2) identifying drivers of evolutionary diversification; (3) monitoring environmental change; (4) understanding community and ecosystem level processes; (5) investigating the ecology and epidemiology of disease from an evolutionary perspective (evolutionary epidemiology). Furthermore, we also provide an overview of the needs and priorities for biodiversity education and training in Central Africa.Resume Les forets tropicales du bassin du Congo et du Golfe de Guinee abritent une grande partie de la diversite terrestre et aquatique dans le monde. Pourtant, notre connaissance de la riche diversite biologique de cette region et les processus evolutifs qui l'ont faconnee demeurent encore peu compris, tout comme notre comprehension de la capacite des especes a s'adapter ou a repondre aux changements environnementaux actuels et a venir. De ce fait, des efforts de recherche sont necessaires pour ameliorer les connaissances scientifiques actuelles sur la biodiversite de cette region, determiner les causes des processus de diversifications passees, evaluer le potentiel des especes a repondre aux changements environnementaux et identifier les populations cles pour la conservation dans le futur. Par ailleurs, lorsque la recherche dans le domaine de l'evolution est combinee aux efforts de suivi continu de l'environnement, elle peut aussi fournir un ensemble d'outils importants pour l'evaluation et l'attenuation des impacts des activites de developpement. S'appuyant sur une serie de recommandations elaborees lors de l'atelier international qui s'est tenu au Gabon en 2011, nous soulignons les axes majeurs pour la recherche future dans le domaine de l'evolution qui pourraient etre lies directement aux priorites de la conservation dans la region. Ces priorites de recherche s'articulent autour de cinq thematiques: (1) l'inventaire et la decouverte de la biodiversite; (2) l'identification des causes de la diversification; (3) le suivi des changements environnementaux; (4) la comprehension des processus au niveau des communautes et des ecosystemes; (5) l'etude ecologique et epidemiologique des maladies d'un point de vue evolutif (epidemiologie evolutive). Toutefois, nous donnons egalement un apercu des besoins et des priorites en matiere d'education et de formation dans le domaine de la biodiversite en Afrique centrale.

TI  - Sundaland Peat Carbon Dynamics and Its Contribution to the Holocene Atmospheric CO2 Concentration
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sunda Shelf is a large submerged extension of the continental shelf of mainland Asia, joining the islands of Borneo, Java, and Sumatra and forming the shallow seabed of the South China Sea. Recent studies identified present-day peatlands in Southeast Asia as a globally important carbon reservoir. However, little is known about Sundaland paleopeatlands and their role in the global carbon cycle since the Last Glacial Maximum. Using a topography-based, sea level-driven model, we estimate the potential spatial extent of peatlands during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene across the low-lying Sundaland plains. We then use the estimated peatland area together with data on carbon accumulation rates to calculate the total peat carbon pool on the Sunda Shelf. Finally, using a global biogeochemical model, we analyze the relative influence of the predicted Sundaland peat dynamics and other carbon change mechanisms, specifically high-latitude forest growth and peat formation, shallow sea carbonate deposition, ocean warming, and combinations of them, on the global carbon cycle of the Holocene. We identify a feedback mechanism between sea level and peatland carbon sequestration in Sundaland that reduced atmospheric CO2 concentration by about 4-5 ppm and increased C-13 by 0.05 during the Holocene. We also show that a concurrence of mechanisms that includes Sundaland peat dynamics produces model results that are consistent with proxy records, especially with respect to C-13.

TI  - Variability and correlation of physical attributes of soils cultivated with cacao trees in two climate zones in Southern Bahia, Brazil
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cacao (Theobroma cacao) is a very important crop in Southern Bahia, Brazil, which needs good climate and soil conditions and management for great productivity. In this region, cacao is grown on a large number of soil types, and soil properties have great effects on its sustainability and production potentials. The aim of this study was to evaluate the variability of physical attributes of soils cultivated with cacao in two climate zones in Southern Bahia, Brazil, as well as to evaluate the correlation between these physical attributes. Eighty soil samples were evaluated from 20 cacao farms with cacao agroforestry systems, from the 0-0.1 and 0.1-0.3m soil layers. The soil analyses comprised granulometry, soil bulk density, particle density, porosity (total, macro, and micro), gravimetric moisture, and soil resistance to penetration. The data were submitted to descriptive statistical analysis and correlation between variables. Most variables had normal distribution (p>0.05) and high variability. In general, these soils had good physical conditions for the production of cacao, except for the high resistance to root penetration which can be limiting factor. The greatest differences in physical attributes of the soils were: gravimetric moisture, resistance to penetration, macroporosity, and sand content. The correlations between physical attributes of the soils varied according to the sampled layer and the climate zone. The resistance to penetration was not correlated with any of the determined physical attribute.

TI  - Enforcement and compliance with the no-burning policy on villagers in Indonesia
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires, including on carbon-rich peatlands, continue to haunt Indonesia every dry season. They have disas-trous health, economic, environmental, and climate consequences. As a key measure to manage wildfires, laws strictly prohibit the burning of land and forests, targeting corporate and individual fire users. The literature suggests that weak law enforcement contributes to Indonesia's persistent wildfires but it lacks systematic analysis. Centred on villagers, this research examines 1) how enforcement of the burning prohibition plays out in practice, by analysing each step along the enforcement chain, and 2) how enforcement has shaped villagers' compliance with the fire rules, and implications for them. We interviewed villagers and enforcement agents and analysed court documents of the year 2019 fire cases. We focused on two fire-prone provinces with extensive peatlands, South Sumatra and Central Kalimantan. We found that some villagers have complied and ceased burning, while others have continued to use fire to maintain their livelihoods. Enforcement contributed to fire prevention, but may have also increased fire risks thus limiting the prevention effect. A multitude of challenges, including physical obstacles, resource constraints, and governance reduced enforcement effectiveness. Key to enforcement is legitimacy of the rule being enforced from the perspective of both enforcement agents and target actors. Investments are required to support viable alternative no-burning cropping methods. At the same time, public awareness raising and long-term education are essential for accidental fire prevention and the reduction of overall enforcement costs.

TI  - Simulation of stream flow and hydrological response to land-cover changes in a tropical river basin
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover of river basins has undergone multiple modifications and conversions as a result of various pressures on ecosystems. This study calibrates and validates the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model for determining the hydrological response to land-cover changes in the Lower-Middle Sao Francisco River sub-basin (LMSFR), Brazil. The SWAT model was calibrated with 1993-1994 data from hydrological station at Juazeiro, while data from the 1995-2004 period were used for validation. We analyzed three scenarios of land cover which were compared to current landscape (pasture land): scenario I (pasture land is replaced by natural vegetation), scenario II (pasture land is replaced by maize crop cultivation), and scenario III (pasture land is replaced by bare soil). Calibration of the SWAT model in the LMSFR produced good results, as all evaluation indices reached satisfactory values in both calibration and validation periods for Juazeiro and validation period at Floresta. However, the calibrated model, when applied to Abreus, did not accurately simulate monthly stream flow (where r(2) = 0.51 and NE = 0.26). Scenario III had the greatest impact and influence on the sediment yield, which corresponded to an increase of 93.7% in comparison to the current land cover. This study identified regions where reforestation should be urgently carried out in the north part and extreme south of the sub-basin due to the overall level of land degradation.

TI  - Land Use Impact on Microbial and Biochemical Indicators in Agroecosystems of the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Microbial and biochemical properties are of great importance in soil quality evaluation. In Brazil, and especially in the cerrado (Brazilian savanna), benchmarking studies are needed to assess the impacts of land use on microbial and biochemical indicators. This study aimed to compare the impacts of land use on the microbial, chemical, and biochemical properties of the soil under Cerrado (CE), 32-yr-old pine forest (PO and 11-yr-old no-till (NT). Soil samples were collected at a depth of 0 to 10 cm in January, June, and December of 2008 and were evaluated based on chemical properties, basal respiration, soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and enzymes (beta-glucosidase, dehydrogenase and acid, neutral, and alkaline phosphatases). Comparative analysis of respiratory activity and MBC showed that the NT system had a positive effect and PF a negative one relative to the reference CE. NT soil management practices improve quality mainly by benefiting chemical characteristics (C and N), increasing MBC, and increasing microbial activity relative to CE and PF. Soil enzymatic activity (dehydrogenase, beta-glucosidase and phosphatase) was lower in PF and higher in NT than in CE. Principal component analysis showed that indicator variability, regarding soil sampling period, was higher in NT than in either PF or CE. In conclusion, we recommend 3-glucosidase and MBC as indicators of the impacts of land use practices.

TI  - Herbivorous fish rise as a destructive fishing practice falls in an Indonesian marine national park
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Securing ecosystem functions is challenging, yet common priority in conservation efforts. While marine parks aim to meet this challenge by regulating fishing through zoning plans, their effectiveness hinges on compliance levels and may respond to changes in fishing practices. Here we use a speciose assemblage of nominally herbivorous reef fish in Karimunjawa National Park (zoned since 1989) to investigate whether areas subject to a restrictive management regime sustained higher biomass over seven years compared to areas where moderate and permissive regulations apply. Using a trait-based approach we characterize the functional space of the entire species pool and ask whether changes in biomass translate into changes in functional structure. We track changes in predator biomass, benthic community structure, and fishing practices that could influence herbivore trajectories. Overall herbivore biomass doubled in 2012 compared to 2006-2009 and remained high in 2013 across all management regimes. We found no evidence that this biomass build-up resulted from predator depletion or increased food availability but suggest it emerged in response to a park-wide cessation of fishing with large drive nets known as muroami. The biomass increase was accompanied by a modest increase in taxonomic richness and a slight decrease in community-scale rarity that did not alter functional redundancy levels. Subtle changes in both functional specialization and identity of assemblages emerged as generalist species with low intrinsic vulnerability to fishing recovered sooner than more vulnerable specialists. While this implies a recovery of mechanisms responsible for the grazing of algal turfs and detritus, restoring other facets of herbivory (e.g., macroalgal consumption) may require more time. An increase in the cost-benefit ratio per journey of muroami fishing facilitated a ban on muroami nets that met minimal resistance. Similar windows of opportunity may emerge elsewhere in which gear-based regulations can supplement zoning plans, especially when compliance is low. This does not advocate for implementing such regulations once a fishery has become unprofitable. Rather, it underlines their importance for breaking the cycle of resource depletion and low compliance to zoning, thus alleviating the resulting threats to food security and ecosystem integrity.

TI  - HYDROPHILIC POLYMER CHANGES THE WATER DEMAND IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A DWARF CASHEW ORCHARD
T2  - ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Important losses of dwarf cashew seedlings during the establishment of orchards in the Brazilian semiarid are related to the relatively short rainy season. This study aimed to evaluate biochar and hydrophilic polymer as soil amendments to increase water retention and reduce plant death in the first year. An experiment was conducted at the Curu Station, Paraipaba, CE, Brazil, using the clone BRS 226. The experimental design consisted of randomized blocks, with amounts of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 kg of cashew wood biochar and 20, 40, 60, 80 g of hydrophilic polymer applied per pit, as well as a control treatment (no soil amendment). Seedlings were submitted to an irrigation regime to avoid water stress (5 L water seedling' when the tensiometer installed at a depth of 0.15 m reached 60 kPa). The variables of plant development number of leaves, plant height, stem diameter, and canopy diameter were evaluated up to 374 days after transplanting to the field. The analysis of variance showed no treatment effect on plant development. However, minimum water consumption was observed when 29.56 g of hydrophilic polymer was applied per pit, providing 100.0% seedling survival.

TI  - Tropical riparian forests in danger from large savanna wildfires
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical savannas are known for the fire-prone ecosystems, yet, riparian evergreen forests are another important landscape feature. These forests usually remain safe from wildfires in the wet riparian zones. With global changes, large wildfires are now more frequent in savanna landscapes, exposing riparian forests to unprecedented impact.In 2017, a large wildfire spread across the Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park, an iconic UNESCO site in central Brazil, raising concerns about its impact on the fire-sensitive ecosystems. By combining remote sensing analysis of Google Earth images (2003-2019) with detailed field information from 36 sites, we assessed wildfire impacts on riparian forests. For this, we measured the structure of trees, saplings and herbaceous plants, as well as topsoil variables.Since 2003, all riparian forests had canopy cover above 90%, but after 2017, canopy cover dropped to 20% in some forests, indicating large variation in wildfire damage. A closer look in the field revealed that, on average, the wildfire killed 52% of adult trees and 87% of tree saplings in flooded forests. In non-flooded forests, impacts on adult trees were negligible, but fire killed 75% of tree saplings. Opportunistic vines and the invasive grass Melinis minutiflora were already present in severely disturbed flooded forests. In all forests, impacts on many ecosystem variables were related to canopy damage, a variable measurable from satellite. Overall, seasonally flooded riparian forests were the most severely impacted, possibly due to the relatively thinner barks of their trees.Synthesis and applications. Our findings reveal how riparian forests embedded in tropical savanna landscapes are in danger from large wildfires. The destruction of some forests has opened space for new plant species that may propel a shift to an alternative ecosystem state. Riparian forests are habitat of large savanna animals and their loss could affect entire trophic networks. Managing wildfires and invasive grasses locally is probably the best strategy to maintain riparian forests resilient. As wildfire regimes intensify in tropical savanna landscapes, our findings stress the need for an integrated management that considers riparian forests as a vulnerable element of the system.

TI  - Sensitivity analysis of indicator weights for the construction of flood vulnerability indexes: A participatory approach
T2  - FRONTIERS IN WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of flood vulnerability is a complex task that involves numerous uncertainties. Within this context, sensitivity analyses are crucial to better understand the variability of vulnerability index outcomes according to different input parameters. The present study sheds light on the importance of assessing the sensitivity of different criteria weights to construct flood vulnerability indexes using the Maquine basin (Brazil) as a case study. Specifically, we compared vulnerability scores based on weights derived from a participatory survey with 44 stakeholders to those based on an equal weighting scheme. Results helped us identify areas with low and high uncertainty and the variables contributing to this. Overall, the preference for indicator weights did not vary significantly among stakeholders with distinct socioeconomic characteristics. Furthermore, the choice of weights only had an impact on the spatial distribution of flood vulnerability in certain regions. Compared to equal weights, the flood vulnerability outcomes obtained by averaging the stakeholder scenarios were similar, indicating that the results were robust and not highly sensitive to the choice of weights. By adopting a participatory approach, we were able to consider multiple stakeholders' views, which helped to provide a more comprehensive perspective of flood vulnerability and potentially increased the acceptance of the results. Based on our findings, end-users can better understand the relative importance of each indicator and how they contribute to vulnerability. Furthermore, our results can help identify points where stakeholders disagree, which can be used to facilitate dialogue and consensus building. The methodology applied is straightforward and could be easily adapted to other multi-criteria decision-making problems.

TI  - Implications of converting native forest areas to agricultural systems on the dynamics of CO 2 emission and carbon stock in a Cerrado soil, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The conversion of native vegetation to agricultural areas leads to a natural process of carbon loss but these systems can stabilize in terms of carbon dynamics depending on the management and conversion time, presenting potential to both store and stabilize this carbon in the soil, resulting in lower soil respiration rates. In this context, this study aimed to investigate the effect of converting native Cerrado forest areas to agricultural systems with a forest planted with Eucalyptus camaldulensis and silvopastoral systems on the dynamics of CO 2 emission and carbon stock at different soil depths. The experimental sites are located in the Midwest of Brazil, in the coordinates 20 degrees 22 ' 31 '' S and 51 degrees 24 ' 12 '' W. Were evaluated soil CO 2 emission (FCO 2 ), soil organic carbon, the degree of humification of soil organic matter (HLIFS), soil temperature, soil moisture, and soil chemical and physical attributes. The soil of the area is classified as an Oxisol (Haplic Acrustox). Soil samples were collected at depths of 0.00-0.10, 0.10-0.20, 0.20-0.30, and 0.30-0.40 m. The lowest FCO 2 values were found in the silvopastoral system (1.05 mu mol m - 2 s - 1 ), followed by the native forest (1.65 mu mol m - 2 s - 1 ) and the eucalyptus system (1.96 mu mol m - 2 s - 1 ), indicating a 36% reduction in FCO 2 compared to the conversion of the native forest to the silvopastoral system and an increase of 19% when converting the native forest to the eucalyptus system. The soil chemical attributes (N, K + , Ca 2+ , H + +Al 3+ , CEC, and organic carbon) showed a decrease along the profile. The shallowest depths (0.00-0.10 and 0.10-0.20 m) presented no differences between systems but the subsequent depths (0.20-0.30 and 0.30-0.40 m) had a difference (95% confidence interval), relative to N, Ca 2+ , H + +Al 3 , CEC, and organic carbon stock (OCS), and the soil under silvopastoral system showed a higher concentration of these attributes than the native forest. The multivariate analysis showed that the eucalyptus and silvopastoral systems did not differ from the forest in the shallowest soil layer but differed from each other. This behavior changed from the second assessed depth (0.10-0.20 m), in which the silvopastoral system stands out, differing both from the eucalyptus system and from the native forest, and this behavior is maintained at the following depths (0.20-0.30 and 0.30-0.40 m). OCS, H + +Al 3 , CEC, and nitrogen are strongly related to land use change for silvopastoral system. Regarding the behavior/relationship of attributes as a function of depth, the silvopastoral system contributed to soil carbon accumulation and stability over consecutive years.

TI  - Productive sustainability of the installation of silvopastoral systems: A systematic review based on the reality of Peru and Colombia
T2  - REVISTA CORPOICA-CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA AGROPECUARIA

AB  - Saucedo-Uriarte, M. Linares & la silvopastoriles: la y e3048. https://doi.org/10.21930/rcta.vol24_nu m2_art:3048 Abstract: Most of the world's livestock is developed in open field or monoculture systems, which generates economic and environmental losses, such as soil erosion, loss of biodiversity of flora and fauna, low meat and milk production, and less monetary income. Faced with this situation, there are sustainable alternatives for livestock production, which are friendly to the environment, being silvopastoral systems. That is why, in this review, it is proposed to analyze the productive sustainability of the installation of silvopastoral systems, placing greater emphasis on the floristic composition of plots with silvopastoral systems in Peru and Colombia, as a case study. The information review was based on the PRISMA statement considering inclusion and exclusion criteria. Comparisons were made of pasture production and quality, productivity of dairy and fattening cattle, social and environmental opportunities, and the floristic composition of such silvopastoral systems. The installation of silvopastoral systems increases the productive yields of pastures (dry matter, digestibility and protein), of animals such as greater milk and meat production, and greater biodiversity of forage species. In both countries it is observed that the implementation of these systems has improved opportunities for producers dedicated to livestock due to the beneficial economic, environmental and social impacts that they provide. In this sense, it is a challenge for scientists, governments and entities involved in sustainable systems to continue looking for new viable alternatives and validate them for livestock production.

TI  - Protected areas within multifunctional landscapes: Squeezing out intermediate land use intensities in the tropics?
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - A protected area (PA) tends to be designated in an area where tracts of primary forest remain, often with poor accessibility due to terrain features and yet with some exposure to threats. Typically, a PA is at the start of a 'forest transition' gradient. The establishment of a PA influences the whole gradient. We analyzed the temporal patterns of land-use change inside and outside four PAs, with one located in each of Laos, Indonesia, Madagascar and Cameroon. In Laos, in the Viengkham landscape, the rates of conversion of natural forest increased after the designation of the PA and were higher than the spatial baseline predicted. In the three other landscapes, the policies associated with the implementation of PAs increased the conversion rate immediately outside the boundary of the PAs. In Indonesia, in the Bungo landscape, forms of land-use associated with multifunctional agroforestry activities involving rubber trees land-use became the target for conversion to oil palm and monoculture rubber tree crops when the rules on the protection of the remaining natural forest were tightened. We tested a new metric for the degree of integration of forest in multifunctional landscapes which recognizes the surrounding matrix, both as surrogate habitat and as a corridor for tree species. Two important findings were: (i) a 'leakage' zone of influence of at least 10 km around a PA needs to be included for quantification of the deforestation and degradation changes that may be due to forest protection inside the PA and (ii) agroforest and other mixed tree cover can maintain or increase the degree of integration of forest in the multifunctional landscape for biodiversity maintenance and conservation, while providing a source of livelihood for the local people.

TI  - Quantifying above- and belowground biomass carbon loss with forest conversion in tropical lowlands of Sumatra (Indonesia)
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural forests in South-East Asia have been extensively converted into other land-use systems in the past decades and still show high deforestation rates. Historically, lowland forests have been converted into rubber forests, but more recently, the dominant conversion is into oil palm plantations. While it is expected that the large-scale conversion has strong effects on the carbon cycle, detailed studies quantifying carbon pools and total net primary production (NPPtotal) in above- and belowground tree biomass in land-use systems replacing rainforest (incl. oil palm plantations) are rare so far. We measured above- and belowground carbon pools in tree biomass together with NPPtotal in natural old-growth forests, jungle rubber' agroforests under natural tree cover, and rubber and oil palm monocultures in Sumatra. In total, 32 stands (eight plot replicates per land-use system) were studied in two different regions. Total tree biomass in the natural forest (mean: 384Mgha(-1)) was more than two times higher than in jungle rubber stands (147Mgha(-1)) and >four times higher than in monoculture rubber and oil palm plantations (78 and 50Mgha(-1)). NPPtotal was higher in the natural forest (24Mgha(-1)yr(-1)) than in the rubber systems (20 and 15Mgha(-1)yr(-1)), but was highest in the oil palm system (33Mgha(-1)yr(-1)) due to very high fruit production (15-20Mgha(-1)yr(-1)). NPPtotal was dominated in all systems by aboveground production, but belowground productivity was significantly higher in the natural forest and jungle rubber than in plantations. We conclude that conversion of natural lowland forest into different agricultural systems leads to a strong reduction not only in the biomass carbon pool (up to 166MgCha(-1)) but also in carbon sequestration as carbon residence time (i.e. biomass-C:NPP-C) was 3-10 times higher in the natural forest than in rubber and oil palm plantations.

TI  - Geospatial characteristics of fire occurrences in southern hemispheric Africa and Madagascar during 2001-2020
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - For this study of long-term spatial patterns and trends of active fires in southern hemispheric Africa and on Madagascar from 2001 to 2020, active fire data from the MODIS FIRMS global fire data products were analyzed. The annual center of fire concentration tended to migrate toward the preserved rainforests and nature conservation areas in the Congo Basin and the mountain forests on the northeastern coast of Madagascar. Fire frequency varied seasonally at both study areas. We used geostatistical analysis techniques, such as measures of dispersion and emerging hot spot analysis, to reveal long-term trends in spatial patterns of fire events. In southern hemispheric Africa, the observed active fires tended to drift northward toward the Zambia-DRC border in the Congo basin. This northward migration progressed toward humid rainforests, which were better suited to sustaining repeated fire events. On Madagascar, the observed active fires tended to migrate toward the east coast in protected mountain forests. The spatial patterns of long-term trends showed a concentration of fires in the tropical regions of southern hemispheric Africa. Moreover, smaller clusters of new hot spots were located over eastern South Africa, overlapping with undifferentiated woodlands. On Madagascar, both hot and cold spots were identified and were separated by the highland region in the center of the island. Most of the eastern island was characterized by cold spots that received less precipitation than did the rest of the island. The presence of increasing hots spots in the densely vegetated areas highlights the urgent need for fire prevention and management in this region.

TI  - Highly differentiated population structure of a Mangrove species, Bruguiera gymnorhiza (Rhizophoraceae) revealed by one nuclear GapCp and one chloroplast intergenic spacer trnF-trnL
T2  - CONSERVATION GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - To evaluate the genetic diversity of a mangrove species and clarify the genetic structure of its populations, we studied nucleotide polymorphism in two DNA regions of Bruguiera gymnorhiza collected from the southern islands of Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Micronesia, and India. The two DNA sequences were the chloroplast (cp) intergenic spacer between trnL and trnF genes (ca. 300 bp), and a part (ca. 550 bp) of the nuclear gene coding for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GapCp). Little polymorphism was found within each of the three geographical regions, Pacific Ocean, Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea. Throughout the vast regions east of the Malay peninsula including Indonesia, Thailand, Micronesia and the southern islands of Japan (Pacific Ocean), essentially only one haplotype (apart from variation in number of a T repeat) was present. A second haplotype was present on the western coast of Malay Peninsula and the eastern coast of India (Bay of Bengal). On the southwest of Malay Peninsula both of these haplotypes were present. Finally a third haplotype was found only on the western coast of India (Arabian Sea). When taken over all geographic populations, total nucleotide variation within the species was large (mu = 0.006, average of the two genes). Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that this low genetic diversity within any local population and differentiation between the different oceans or regions are caused by very low gene flow between each of the different oceans coupled with frequent fluctuation of population sizes due to the change in sea level. The significance of these results is discussed from evolutionary point of the mangrove forests.

TI  - Is Direct Seeding a Biologically Viable Strategy for Restoring Forest Ecosystems? Evidences from a Meta-analysis
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration has become an important technique for mitigating the human impacts on natural vegetation. Planting seedlings is the most common approach to regain lost forest cover. However, these activities require a large economic investment. Direct seeding is considered a cheaper and easier alternative technique, in which tree seeds are introduced directly on the site rather than transplanting seedlings from nurseries. To evaluate the effectiveness of direct seeding, we conducted a comprehensive search of the literature using restoration', direct seeding' and sowing' as keywords, and we performed a meta-analysis using 30 papers and 89 species. We used two different measures of restoration success: seed germination probability and success probability (the chance that a seed germinates and survives until the end of the experiment). In general, restoration attempts using direct-seeding techniques were relatively unsuccessful. On average, seed germination and success probability were 0239 and 0114, respectively, and were not affected by climate, species successional group or the application of pre-germinative treatments. Germination and success probability increased with seed size, and the use of physical protections resulted in a nearly twofold increase in germination probability, but this effect faded by the end of the experiments. Because of the low rate of seedling success, we suggest the use of direct seeding as a complementary technique to reduce restoration costs, particularly for species with large seeds and known high germination rates, but our results do not support direct seeding as a substitute for seedling planting.

AB  - Swampland will be the foundation of future food security, because irrigated paddy fields are very vulnerable to the land transfer functions, as happened on the Island of Java. Swampland has considerable potential to develop into food-based agriculture land in support of national food security. Swampland is divided into two types, namely: 1) tidal swamp and 2) waterlogged swamp. Land reclamation from tidal swamps for rice field in Riau province, covering an area of 80,868 ha, with low productivity at around 3.5 to 4.5 t ha(-1) and average cropping index (CI) 100. This study aims to examine the application of technological innovation to improvement of rice cropping index. Referring to rice potential planting calendar of Riau Province, the planting season on rainy season 2019/2020 (October 2019 - March 2020) and the average rice cropping index of dry season 2020 were 171.49 percent. The application of Jarwo Super Planting Calendar of Rice crop productivity reached 5.73 t ha(-1).

TI  - Evaluation of forest growth and carbon stock in forestry projects by system dynamics
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil is one of the largest producers of eucalyptus that is used for manufacturing pulp and paper; this contributes directly to the issue of carbon emissions. Reforestation of eucalyptus appears as a viable alternative for mitigating these carbon emissions, leveraging their high productivity to that of other leading countries in the market, such as Finland and Sweden. This study aims to develop a model for monitoring and evaluating forest growth and quantifying wood stocks and sequestered carbon. System dynamics was used to simulate forest growth. Forest growth was modeled from eight regions with dissimilar edaphoclimatic characteristics, in the state of Minas Gerais, in Brazil. The model was sensitive enough to the characteristics of the regions, where the difference in forest stocks was 45.1% at the end of 30 years in a harvest cycle of 7 years. It was found that the typical harvest cycle in practice by leading companies did not always yield a higher sequestered CO2 accumulated stock. By shortening the harvest cycle, it was possible to obtain a gain of up to 21.0% in the sequestered CO2 stock. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Contrasting communications of sustainability science in the media coverage of palm oil agriculture on tropical peatlands in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyses the denialist narratives of the negative environmental impact of oil palm plantations on tropical peat by the media of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Specifically, we focus on media coverage of the 2016 International Peat Congress, where scientifically misleading claims that it is sustainable to develop oil palm plantations on tropical peatlands were made. We found that media reporting of the denialist narrative is more prevalent than that of the peer-reviewed science consensus-view that plantations on tropical peat could cause excessive greenhouse gas emissions and enhance the risk of fires. Four mutually complementary narratives were used by Indonesian and Malaysian media to construe denialism, which closely resemble the four climate denialist narratives identified by Elsasser And Dunlap (2!)13). These denialist narratives draw heavily upon information advocated by divergent knowledge communities (Gokkiein 2(16) and appeal to a nationalist sentiment of 'us' - palm oil-producing developing countries - and 'them' - western developed countries producing research critical of the industry. The Malaysian press has most extensively deployed this nationalistic sentiment, whereas the Singaporean media has not actively endorsed or rejected any of the denialist narratives. Our findings suggests that media representation of the issue is a reflection of an amalgamation of economic, diplomatic and nationalistic concerns, determined by political, socio-cultural nuances specific to each country. Importantly, our article alerts to the continuation of unsustainable practices as justified by the media to the public, and that the prevalence of these denialist narratives constitute a significant obstacle in resolving pressing issues such as transboundary haze, biodiversity loss, and land-use change related greenhouse gas emissions in Southeast Asia.

TI  - Comparison of carbon dioxide efflux in different land use typologies
T2  - REVISTA DE AGRICULTURA NEOTROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Management systems are crucial for soils functioning as a drain or source of greenhouse gas emissions. In this sense, among the alternatives for reducing the precursors of the greenhouse effect are integrated agricultural production systems, particularly Agroforestry Systems. These integrated systems maximize the use of biological cycles, soil, and animal waste, reducing agrochemicals and improving the condition of the rural populations involved. The present study aimed to evaluate the CO2 efflux in different land use types. The study was conducted in four agroecosystems: Forest (FO), Agroforestry Systems (AFS), Mandala (MD), and Degraded area (DA). To quantify the CO2 emanating from the soil, 10 mL of 0.5 N KOH aqueous solution is used and titrated using 0.1 N HCl, phenolphthalein, and 1% methyl orange as an indicator. The CO2 concentration from 5:00 am to 5:00 pm was lower. The lowest CO2 production occurred in FO (82.7 CO2 mg m-2 h-1), statistically differing from the other areas that obtained a CO2 rate higher than 140 mg m-2 h-1. As for kinetics, it was observed in all areas that the greatest release of CO2 during the day occurred at 7:00 am, and this release decreased as the soil temperature increased. The greatest release of CO2 and the highest temperatures occurred in DA, showing that these systems with anthropic modifications can be considered CO2 emitters however, systems closer to the natural ecosystem, such as the AFS, will store carbon in the soil, functioning as a carbon store. Therefore, to reduce CO2 emissions from agricultural activities, it is necessary to use systems that imitate natural ecosystems.

TI  - Diameter growth of eucalyptus trees in agroforestry systems and its relation to air temperature and precipitation
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In agroforestry systems, such as integrated crop-livestock-forest (iCLF), the agricultural, livestock and arboreal components are explored in the same field in rotation, succession or intercropping. Our objective was to investigate if the diameter growth of eucalyptus in agroforestry systems differs from those cultivated as a planted forest, as well as to assess whether there is a difference in its growth in face of the air temperature and precipitation. The study was held at Ponta Pora, Brazil, a region of humid subtropical climate with hot summers and soil classified as Oxisol, which is fertile, deep and clayey. Dendrometer bands measured the diameter growth of eucalyptus (Eucalyptus urograndis) cultivated as a forest and in iCLF, with eucalyptus rows distance of 12.5 x 12.5 m, 12.5 m one side x 25 m another side and 25 x 25 m. The study took place from four years and nine months after transplanting till six years and seven months (22 months monitoring). On iCLF, the inter-row was explored with grain crops (soybean or corn) and pasture. Climate data of air temperature and precipitation were used to investigate their influence or not on diameter growth. Eucalyptus diameter growth is higher when cultivated in agroforestry systems and this growth is as higher as larger is the distance between eucalyptus rows. Precipitation proved to strongly and positively influence the diameter growth, especially when cultivated in agroforestry systems. On the other hand, under the conditions of this study, air temperature showed little or no correlation with eucalyptus diameter growth.

TI  - Effect of Biochar on Dwarf Green Coconut Orchard Yield and Irrigation Water Productivity
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The high irrigation water demand of coconut trees in semiarid regions makes rational use crucial for crop sustainability. Additionally, it produces residues that could improve the soil water holding capacity. This research aimed to evaluate the application of coconut shell biochar to an irrigated dwarf green coconut palm orchard. The study was carried out from January 2019 to December 2021 at Campo Experimental do Curu, Paraipaba, Brazil, belonging to Embrapa Agroind & uacute;stria Tropical. The experiment consisted of a completely randomized design with five treatments and four replications and included the application of 0, 5, 10, 20, or 40 g of biochar per kg of soil, equivalent to 0.0 kg, 0.5 kg, 1.0 kg, 2.0 kg or 4.0 kg of biochar per plant, respectively. The following biometric variables were evaluated: number of leaves per plant (NL), plant height (PH), number of leaflets per leaf (LFT), canopy diameter (CD) and fruit production: number of bunches per plant (NB), number of fruits per plant (NF), volume of coconut water per fruit (CWF) and total soluble solids (TSS) (degrees Brix), as well as the daily soil moisture average. The results showed beneficial effects on the number of leaves per plant, fruits per plant, soil moisture and irrigation water productivity in terms of liters per fruit, liters per coconut water and fruits per cubic meter (m3) applied with ideal biochar doses estimated to be 1.40 kg, 1.72 kg, 1.79 kg, 1.56 kg, 1.48 and 1.68 kg of biochar per plant, respectively.

TI  - Estimating state-wide biomass carbon stocks for a REDD plan in Acre, Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As in many other developing countries, the state government of Acre, Brazil, is developing a program for compensating forest holders (such as communities of rubber tappers and indigenous peoples as well as small, medium and large private land holders) reducing their emission of atmospheric heat-trapping gases by not deforesting. We describe and then apply to Acre a method for estimating carbon stocks by land cover type. We then compare the results of our simple method, which is based on vegetation mapping and ground-based samples, with other more technically demanding methods based on remote sensing. We estimated total biomass carbon stocks by multiplying the measured above-ground biomass of trees >10 cm DBH in each of 18 forest types and published estimates for non-forest areas, as determined by measurement of 44 plots throughout the state (ranging from 1 to 10 ha each), by land-cover area estimated using a geographical information system. State-wide, we estimated average above-ground biomass in forested areas to be 246 +/- 90 Mg ha(-1); dense forest showed highest (322 +/- 20 Mg ha(-1)) and oligotrophic dwarf forest (campinarana) the lowest biomass (20 +/- 30 Mg ha(-1)). The two most widespread forest types in Acre, open canopy forests dominated by either palms and bamboo (for which ground-based data are scant), support an estimated 246 +/- 44 and 224 +/- 50 Mg ha(-1) of above-ground biomass, respectively. We calculate the total above-ground biomass of the 163,000 km(2) State of Acre to be 3.6 +/- 0.8 Pg (non-forest biomass included). This estimate is very similar to two others generated using much more technologically demanding methods, but all three methods, regardless of sophistication, suffer from lack of field data.

TI  - Crop-livestock-forestry systems as a strategy for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing the sustainability of forage-based livestock systems in the Amazon biome
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensification of livestock systems becomes essential to meet the food demand of the growing world population, but it is important to consider the environmental impact of these systems. To assess the potential of forage-based livestock systems to offset greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the net carbon (C) balance of four systems in the Brazilian Amazon Biome was estimated: livestock (L) with a monoculture of Marandu palisade grass [Brachiaria brizantha (Hochst. ex A. Rich.) R. D. Webster]; livestock-forestry (LF) with palisade grass intercropped with three rows of eucalyptus at 128 trees/ha; crop-livestock (CL) with soybeans and then corn + palisade grass, rotated with livestock every two years; and crop-livestock-forestry (CLF) with CL + one row of eucalyptus at 72 trees/ha. Over the four years studied, the systems with crops (CL and CLF) produced more human-edible protein than those without them (L and LF) (3010 vs. 755 kg/ha). Methane contributed the most to total GHG emissions: a mean of 85 % for L and LF and 67 % for CL and CLF. Consequently, L and LF had greater total GHG emissions (mean of 30 Mg CO2eq/ha/year). Over the four years, the system with the most negative net C balance (i.e., C storage) was LF when expressed per ha (-53.3 Mg CO2eq/ha), CLF when expressed per kg of carcass (-26 kg CO2eq/kg carcass), and LF when expressed per kg of human-edible protein (-72 kg CO2eq/kg human-edible protein). Even the L system can store C if well managed, leading to benefits such as increased meat as well as improved soil quality. Moreover, including crops and forestry in these livestock systems enhances these benefits, emphasizing the potential of integrated systems to offset GHG emissions.

TI  - Promising conilon coffee trees clones for agroforestry and intercropping systems
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aimed to select conilon coffee tree clones (Coffea canephora Pierre ex A. Froehner) for agroforestry and/or intercropping systems. The experiment was carried out at Bananal do Norte Experimental Farm (20o45' S and 41o17' W), Espirito Santo, Brazil. The clones were evaluated in an agroforestry system with "urograndis" hybrid eucalyptus trees (Eucalyptus grandis W.Hill x E. urophylla S.T.Blake) plus prata-type banana herbs (Musa spp.) and an intercropping with 'Folha Murcha' sweet orange trees (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck). An augmented block experiment design, with two plants per plot, four controls, in six blocks in the agroforestry system and four in the intercropping, was adopted. Thirteen morphophysiological characteristics were evaluated. Data analysis was performed using the restricted maximum likelihood method and best linear unbiased prediction and the significance of genetic effects by the likelihood ratio test. To select superior clones the Mulamba-Rank index was performed. Twenty clones were selected for the agroforestry and 20 for the intercropped system. The clones 16, 17, 35, 43, 48, 61, 64, 68 and T3 were the most promising for both systems. There is genetic variability to be explored among the clones, being possible the development of varieties, in the future, for agroforestry and intercropping systems.

TI  - Post-Tin-Mining Agricultural Soil Regeneration Using Local Resources, Reduces Drought Stress and Increases Crop Production on Bangka Island, Indonesia
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining severely affects ecosystems and threatens local food security. Remediation practices, however, are a viable way of reducing the negative impacts on post-mining lands. In this study we aim to improve crop yields and drought resistance on a post-tin-mining site located in Bangka Island, Indonesia, with locally available resources. Plots with five different soil amendments: (1) dolomite; (2) compost; (3) charcoal; combinations of (4) charcoal + compost; and (5) charcoal + sawdust; and a control were established. An intercropping system with cassava and centrosema was employed, and yields were determined. Drought resistance was evaluated by carbon isotope discrimination ( increment C-13) from crop parts of cassava and centrosema's shoot. Soil physicochemical properties were determined at harvesting time. Soil amendments significantly improved cassava and centrosema yields. In particular, the compost and combined (charcoal + compost) treatments enhanced centrosema yields (1.18 and 1.99 kg center dot plot(-1), respectively) and were related to higher nutrient availability. Similarly, compost, charcoal, and combined treatments showed positive effects on the cassava yield (0.15-0.16 kg center dot plant(-1)) and a higher drought resistance in the charcoal treatment ( increment C-13= 21.48 parts per thousand). Increased water-holding capacity (WHC) reduced the water deficiency and boosted yields of cassava and centrosema when the soil was treated with dual amendments (charcoal + compost). Charcoal, compost, and their combination turned out to be the most sustainable amendments in degraded post-mining tropical soils.

TI  - HIGH PREVALENCE AND Low INTENSITY OF INFECTION BY BATRACHOCHYTRIUM DENDROBATIDIS IN RAINFOREST BULLFROG POPULATIONS IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL
T2  - HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - American Bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus) arc considered important reservoirs and vectors of the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobalidis (Bd), which can cause the disease chytridiomycosis in many amphibian species. In this study, we assessed the potential of bullfrog farms as centers for Bd dispersion. Specifically, we compared the incidence of Bd in captive and wild populations of bullfrogs by sampling six frog farms and eight natural ponds located at different distances from frog farms in southern Brazil. All sampled frog farms and natural ponds had infected individuals, but frog farms had a higher prevalence of Bd than natural ponds. While prevalence was high, infection intensity was low. In contrast, infection intensity was similar across natural ponds and frog farms. The distance of natural ponds to frog farms had no influence on Bd infection prevalence or load among bullfrogs; however, considering the higher prevalence of Rd in frog farms, the data suggest that frog farms might act as a constant source of this pathogen to the natural environment via escape and releases of frogs and through the release of contaminated water. Therefore, we emphasize the need for additional studies to assess the effect of the different types of frog farm management on the incidence of Bd in natural environments and encourage efforts to monitor free-living populations in surrounding areas. We also highlight the need for urgent measures to tighten the control and regulation of frog farms throughout Brazil to reduce their impact on native amphibians.

TI  - Underutilized edible fruit species of the Indo-Gangetic Plains: A systematic review for food security and land degradation neutrality
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many underutilized edible fruit species (UEFS) are found in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), which support food security (FS) for both indigenous people and other dependent communities. Unfortunately, there is little study and fragmented information available about these naturally edible products. The UEFS of the IGP was the subject of a systematic review utilizing the PRISMA protocol, which produced implications for FS and land degradation neutrality (LDN). This review aims to survey, summarize, and annotate the published information about the angiosperms native and naturalized UEFS of IGP to identify and make use of this species, particularly for the sustainable development of this region. A systematic review confirmed that 371 species of UEFS, of which 62 species were threatened and near threatened (TNT)-UEFS. Among the TNT-UEFS, 41 species were threatened, while 21 species were NT. The threatened species were further categorized as per the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List in the IGP as vulnerable (21 species), endangered (16 species), and critically endangered (four species). This systematic review suggests integration of the native and naturalized UEFS in afforestation and reforestation programs to aid in various ecosystem services. Calamus inermis, Corypha taliera , Licuala peltata, and Saurauia punduana are examples of multipurpose species that require immediate sustainable conservation and cultivation initiatives to save them from extinction in the near future. Multipurpose species such as Aegle marmelos , Buchanania lanzan , Manilkara hexandra , Syzygium cuminii , Tamarindus indica are immensely constructive and climate-smart by surviving in harsh agroclimatic conditions and have great potential for establishment on marginal and wastelands throughout the IGP region. These resilient fruit species enhance biodiversity, ecosystems, and landscapes in addition to providing food for humans. It progressively advances Indi & aacute;s commitment to LDN, combating climate change, and achieving the UN-SDGs, which call for reducing hunger and raising FS by 2030. As a result, the study will offer baseline data for the next investigations and be helpful to policymakers in creating sustainable and scientific policies for the IGP.

TI  - Recent advancements in rainfall erosivity assessment in Brazil: A review
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Review
AB  - In this paper, we report the results of an in-depth review of scientific literature on the assessment of rainfall erosivity in Brazil and published in peer-reviewed journals over the last three decades. In total, 123 articles regarding this topic in Brazil were published. These studies were analyzed and filtered into categories regarding the bibliographic information, methodology scope, and main results. It was found that the EI30 has been the most employed erosivity index in the country, while the use of pluviographic rainfall data and regression equations are the main methods for obtaining erosivity values. The magnitudes of annual rainfall erosivity reported for the Brazilian territory range from 59 to 26,891 MJ mm ha(-1)h(-1) year(-1). The lowest values are found in the Northeast region and the highest in the North. Kriging is the most widespread technique for obtaining rainfall erosivity maps in Brazil. Furthermore, the Southeast region accounts for the largest number of erosivity studies, while the North has a major lack of erosivity information. The advancements over the last decade are characterized by the use of synthetic series of rainfall and remote sensing products to estimate erosivity, as well as the use of machine learning techniques for its interpolation. For the next years, an increase in the use of these methodologies is expected, as well as an intensification of the assessment of the future patterns of rainfall erosivity over the country. The present review updates the findings regarding the assessment of rainfall erosivity in Brazil and brings a wider overview of the erosivity studies in the country. The information here summarized contributes to the establishment of a conservationist planning of soil and water management on a national scale. Finally, the complete database with all information retrieved from the literature was made available.

TI  - Structure, survival, and species diversity in a tropical dry forest submitted to coppicing
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Caatinga is a tropical dry forest. Rational exploitation of Caatinga wood resources consists of sustainable forest management under coppice systems. Therefore, the recovery of the timber stock for the next cycle will depend on the regrowth and survival capacity of the exploited species, as well as on the future structure of the forest. The objective of this work was to characterize the survival, structure, and diversity of Caatinga submitted to coppicing under sustainable forest management comparing pre-and post-harvest conditions. Permanent plots were installed in a Caatinga in the municipality of Floresta-PE, Brazil, in 2013, and measured 2 years after clearcutting. Height and circumference at the base (CAB) of the stumps and shoots were obtained for two sit-uations: pre-cut (grouping by live and dead stumps) and (ii) post-cut (shoots on only live stumps). In addition, all individual shrub-tree species (CAB >= 4 cm) not included in the post-cut situation were identified, measured (CAB and height total) and tagged as persisting (6 cm < CAB) or growing (6 < CAB <= 4 cm) in 2015. The survival and mortality of the stumps were quantified, as well as changes in the horizontal structure and floristic diversity. There was a decrease in the number of species 2 years after cutting, mainly due to the loss of Croton rhamnifolius H. B. K. and Sapium glandulatum (Vell.) Pax and predominance of Cenostigma bracteosum (Tul.) E. Gagnon & G. P. Lewis, Aspidosperma pyrifolium Mart., and Cnidoscolus quercifolius Pohl., resulting in a greater number of in-dividuals of a few species. The outstanding regrowth capacity of these three species indicates that the forest remnant under study may eventually consist of populations with a predominance of species capable of coppicing.

TI  - Effect of conversion from sugarcane preharvest burning to residues green trashing on SOC stocks and soil fertility status: Results from different soil conditions in Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land management have a recognized impact on the cycle of elements such as carbon and nitrogen and are thus expected to play an important role in the mitigation against human-induced environmental changes such as global warming. Brazil is the world's largest producer of sugarcane and has in recent years, experienced a shift from traditional cane preharvest burning (B) to mechanized green-trashing (GT), whose consequences on soil organic carbon and nutrients are still uncertain. This study performed in the Sao-Paulo state, Southeast Brazil, investigated the impact of shifting from B to GT on soil organic carbon and nitrogen stocks, and chemical elements at three 4-year and one 12-year old trial sites. Soil samples were collected from four sites representing different soil types (clayey to sandy-clay Hapludox; Hapudult and sandy Quartzpsamment). Sampling was up to 0.4 m (0-0.05; 0.05-0.1; 0.1-0.2; 0.2-0.4 m) depths at six randomly selected pits from six plots (of 0.2 ha size each) per treatment arranged in randomized block design. The samples were analysed for carbon and nitrogen content and other soil properties such as texture, bulk density, aggregate stability, pH and chemical concentrations. Overall, conversion from B to GT increased fresh organic matter retained on soil surface by 12.8-13.0 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), and soil organic carbon and nitrogen stocks in the top 0.4 m soil layer by 1.06 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) and 0.11 Mg N ha(-1) y(-1), respectively. The highest carbon sequestration rate (108%o y(-1)) occurred in the most carbon depleted soils, which were sandy soils with lowest proportion of macroaggregates and chemical elements such as calcium, magnesium and potassium. All the chemical elements also showed a general increase in concentration, especially within the topmost soil layer, because increased soil organic matter had greater ability to tighten them together. Considering the average sequestration rate of 1.06 ton ha-1 y(-1), the resulting soil carbon sequestration rate for Brazil where 8.8 million hectares are under green-trashing of sugarcane residues would be 9.3 million ton C y(-1). However, intermittent tillage every 4-5 years for replanting poses limitations to carbon sequestration because a 12 year experiment which was sampled 1 year after replanting did not show any carbon sequestration, suggesting that all carbon stored between planting and replanting was lost at tillage. There is need for further research to quantify the dynamics of carbon stocks during and immediately after tillage and to fmd sugarcane replanting techniques which minimize soil disturbance and associated carbon losses.

TI  - Land use land cover changes and extreme precipitation events along Carajás Railroad in the eastern Brazilian Amazon
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance and vulnerability of municipalities in the eastern Amazon led to the evaluation of the distribution of seasonal precipitation and extreme events over protected and deforested sites along the Caraj & aacute;s Railroad (EFC) based on three datasets: Brazilian Daily Weather Gridded Data (BR-DWGD), European Reanalysis (ERA5-Land), and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS). The main purpose is the understanding of the relationship between local land use change and the occurrence of extreme climate events. Results suggested that large-scale deforestation has a regional impact occasionally outweighing local effect. Significant trends reveal a general pattern of drought that has been more intense in the north of the study area, regardless of land cover, whether preserved or deforested. Moreover, the dry season is getting drier, but the wet season is not getting wetter over the entire area, as Caraj & aacute;s National Forest and Curion & oacute;polis (southern sector) deliver positive and accentuated trends in the rainy season. Extreme events are becoming more frequent. The number of consecutive dry days has increased in the north revealing an extension of dry periods, whereas, the maximum one-day precipitation has soared in the south indicating the intensification of rainfall. CHIRPS provides stronger correlations with the standard dataset (BR-DWGD), as both furnish primary data based on rain gauges observations. It also outperforms ERA5-Land in annual and seasonal analyses, which does not invalidate the latter as a great alternative to use in data-poor locations. Ultimately, further research and technology implementation were recommended to improve reforestation efforts given the reported results.

TI  - Conversion of a tropical forest into agroforest alters the fine root-related carbon flux to the soil
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Large areas of remaining tropical forests are affected by anthropogenic disturbances of various intensities. These disturbances alter the structure of the forest ecosystem and consequently its carbon budget. We analysed the role of fine root dynamics in the soil carbon budget of tropical moist forests in Southeast Asia along a gradient of increasing disturbance intensity. Fine root production, fine root turnover, and the associated carbon fluxes from the fine root system to the soil were estimated with three different approaches in five stands ranging from an old growth forest with negligible anthropogenic disturbance to a cacao agroforestry system with planted shade trees. Annual fine root production and mortality in three natural forest sites with increasing canopy openness decreased continuously with increasing forest disturbance, with a reduction of more than 45% between the undisturbed forest and the forest with large timber extraction. Cacao agroforestry stands had higher fine root production and mortality rates than forest with large timber extraction but less than undisturbed forest. The amount of carbon annually transferred to the soil carbon pool through fine root mortality was highest in the undisturbed forest and generally decreased with increasing forest use intensity. However, root-related C flux was also relatively high in the plantation with planted shading trees. In contrast, the relative importance of C transfer from root death in the total above- and below-ground C input to the soil increased with increasing forest use intensity and was even similar to the C input via leaf litter fall in the more intensively managed agroforest. We conclude that moderate to heavy disturbance in South-east Asian tropical moist forests has a profound impact on fine root turnover and the related carbon transfer to the soil.

TI  - Structure and composition of altered riparian forests in an agricultural Amazonian landscape
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation and fragmentation influence the microclimate, vegetation structure, and composition of remaining patches of tropical forest. In the southern Amazon, at the frontier of cropland expansion, forests are converted and fragmented in a pattern that leaves standing riparian forests whose dimensions are mandated by the Brazilian National Forest Code. These altered riparian forests share many characteristics of well-studied upland forest fragments, but differ because they remain connected to larger areas of forest downstream, and because they may experience wetter soil conditions because reduction of forest cover in the surrounding watershed raises groundwater levels and increases stream runoff. We compared forest regeneration, structure, composition, and diversity in four areas of intact riparian forest and four areas each of narrow, medium, and wide altered riparian forests that have been surrounded by agriculture since the early 1980s. We found that seedling abundance was reduced by as much as 64% and sapling abundance was reduced by as much as 67% in altered compared to intact riparian forests. The most pronounced differences between altered and intact forest occurred near forest edges and within the narrowest sections of altered riparian forests. Woody plant species composition differed and diversity was reduced in altered forests compared to intact riparian forests. However, despite being fragmented for several decades, large woody plant biomass and carbon storage, the number of live or dead large woody plants, mortality rates, and the size distribution of woody plants did not differ significantly between altered and intact riparian forests. Thus, even in these relatively narrow forests with high edge : area ratios, we saw no evidence of the increases in mortality and declines in biomass that have been found in other tropical forest fragment studies. However, because of the changes in both species community and reduced regeneration, it is unclear how long this relative lack of change will be sustained. Additionally, Brazil recently passed a law in their National Forest Code allowing narrower riparian buffers than those studied here in restored areas, which could affect their long-term sustainability.

TI  - Carbon loss from a deforested and drained tropical peatland over four years as assessed from peat stratigraphy
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforested, drained, and converted tropical peat forest is common in Southeast Asia, and these areas have become a major source of carbon (C) emissions. In this study, measurements of peat properties, i.e., peat thickness, organic matter (OM), bulk density (BD), total organic C (TOC), and total nitrogen (TN), were taken four years apart (2012-2016) at 24 sites in a previously deforested and drained tropical peat in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. We calculated that the average peat subsides at a rate of 3.8 +/- 1.2 cm yr(-1). The estimated net change in C stock ranged from -8 to -41 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), with an average of -31 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). C loss varied by peat depth and land use. C loss was four times faster on shallow peat (50-100 cm) than deep (>300 cm) peat sites. Fallow sites (bush fern and secondary forest) subsided and lost C faster than oil palm plantations, likely due to land-clearing fires. Percent C and C/N ratio declined significantly in the upper 150 cm of peat, especially in the fallow sites, indicating oxidation within the peat profile. No change occurred in bulk density, showing little effect of compaction, though the density profile migrated downward with subsidence. The current peat topography, modeled from satellite LiDAR data, reflects past peat-loss patterns and confirms the coring results. C loss in this region continues at a high rate since its original deforestation in the early 1970s. This study concludes that C loss due to anthropogenic disturbances on tropical peat is larger than the 2013 Tier 1-IPCC CO2 emission factor for Acacia and oil palms on drained tropical peats, which are 20 and 11 Mg CO2-eq ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively.

TI  - Land use change scenarios and their effects on hydropower energy in the Amazon
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accelerated changes in land use in the regions of the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado in the last four decades have raised questions about the possible consequences for the regional hydrology. Our study area is the Tocantins-Araguaia River Basin (TAW), focusing on the Tucurui Hydropower Plant (THP), downstream of the TAW. In this study, we evaluated four scenarios of change in land use and cover for the TAW in which forest areas were replaced by pasture, then by agriculture, then by reforestation vegetation and, finally, by regenerated forest to investigate the impacts on the hydrological components of the basin and the hydropower potential of the THP according to these scenarios. For this evaluation, the SWAT model was used to simulate the streamflow of each scenario, so it was possible to predict the hydropower potential in the TAW under different environmental perspectives. Nonparametric statistics were used to identify the efficiency of turbines in converting the streamflow into energy at the 5% significance level. A reduction was observed in the annual evapotranspiration rate and increments were observed in the surface runoff and streamflow, but despite the increase in flow, there was no increase in the energy produced at the THP due to the inability of the turbines to convert excess water into energy, with losses in the energy production of up to 30% per month and 65% in the annual balance. Our results emphasize the importance of the sustainable management of hydrological basins located in tropical regions and aid in planning and decision-making to create public policies that better meet the demand for the exploitation of natural resources.

TI  - Post-fire plant regeneration across a closed forest-savanna vegetation transition
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is a major environmental factor influencing vegetation heterogeneity, with closed forest and savanna ecosystems having different management needs due to their different responses to fire disturbance. However, the differences in post-fire vegetation dynamics between these ecosystems have seldom been compared using a uniform set of parameters. Additionally, post-fire dynamics of forest-savanna ecotones is poorly characterized. With the hypothesis that closed forest, savannas and ecotones will exhibit different post-fire responses, we studied the vegetation diversity, structure and dynamics in an upland forest savanna vegetation mosaic in Minas Gerais, Brazil following a fire that occurred in September 2011. In January 2012, we identified, tagged, and measured the basal diameter of all regenerating juvenile tree stems within forty-six 4 m(2) plots in closed forest, savanna and ecotone vegetation, and conducted recensuses in 2013 and 2014. We modelled the relationship between short-term dynamics parameters (recruitment, mortality, basal area loss and gain, and the turnover and net changes in the number of individual stems and basal areas) and vegetation type. Species diversity was higher in closed forests and ecotones than in savanna. Across all vegetation types, stem density decreased and basal area increased. Parameters such as recruitment, net changes in the number of individuals, and the gain, loss and turnover in basal area did not differ across vegetation types. However, stem mortality was higher in closed forest and ecotones combined than in savannas, and the net change in the number of individuals was the lowest in the savanna. Overall, our results support that within a climatically-similar vegetation mosaic, closed forests exhibit different post-fire regeneration dynamics from savanna as expected. Ecotones exhibited post-fire responses and dynamics more similar to closed forests than to savanna, but more studies will be needed to establish if this pattern is applicable to other areas. Understanding the longer-term vegetation dynamics and plant regeneration patterns is a potential next step that will help inform fire management strategies for forest-savanna mosaics.

TI  - Microclimate and soil and water loss in shaded and unshaded agroforestry coffee systems
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The agroforestry systems are a potential pathway to improve soil quality and protect against extreme temperatures that negatively impact coffee growth. However, more studies about the effects of inclusion of tree elements in coffee systems soil and water loss dynamics are needed. This study aimed to understand how the inclusion of trees influences the microclimate and soil and water loss in shaded compared with unshaded coffee systems. Two pluviometers, one in shaded and the other in unshaded area, were installed to record hourly data from August 2009 to June 2010. Soil temperature and moisture were monitored by a system of sensors: air temperature, soil temperature at 10 cm depth, and soil moisture at 10, 30 and 100 cm depths, recording data at hourly intervals from August 2009 to June 2010. The surface water runoff and soil mass lost by laminar erosion were measured using collectors. Air temperature under shaded conditions had less variation than under unshaded conditions and lower maximum temperatures. Soil and water loss of both systems were small due to the high soil cover. Our results indicate that the water loss was higher in the unshaded area (338 L ha(-1)) during the study period compared with the shaded system (150 L ha(-1)). Soil temperature was lower under shaded conditions and there was water absorption complementarity between coffee and trees in shaded area. Soil moisture of shaded area was lower than unshaded area for all depths in all monitored period. Therefore, the shaded agroforestry coffee systems improve microclimate conditions and deep water drainage compared with unshaded coffee systems.

TI  - Soil carbon stocks in Indonesian (agro) forest transitions: Compaction conceals lower carbon concentrations in standard accounting
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil changes matter for the global carbon (C) balance although belowground response to land use change is slower and less obvious than that aboveground. Impacts of changes from natural forest to a range of intermediate tree-based land uses ('agroforestry') and non-tree agriculture remain contested. Standard C-stock accounting for a fixed sampling depth depends on changes in both C-org concentrations and bulk density, often with opposite effects. Confounding factors that, beyond current vegetation, influence C-org (soil texture, minerology, drainage, elevation and soil pH) may also influence bulk density. Because land use may not be random with respect to inherent soil properties, differences in soil C-stock between land uses can have multiple causes. We compiled and analysed data from six landscapes in Indonesia (volcanic and other mineral soils; Sumatra, Kalimantan; Java, Sulawesi) where chronosequences of forest, various agroforestry systems and open-field agriculture had been sampled. Our data analysis (617 samples within 0 - 30 cm depth; 8 land use types) showed that a pedotransfer function for effects on C-org of texture, elevation and soil pH reduced the relative standard error of means per land use type, reduced the range (Max-Min)/Avg and led to a more consistent pattern in apparent land use effects. Relative to natural forest reductions in C-org concentration in the 0-30 cm layer (corrected for confounding factors) averaged 8-20 % in degraded forest, complex agroforest, oil palm plantations and older forest plantation plots, and 25-30 % in simple agroforestry, monoculture tree crops and woodlots, or over 40 % in non-tree (mostly cropped) plots. However, calculated C-stock change was small due to an observed increase (up to 30 %) of bulk density relative to that of natural forest. This implies that up to 23 % additional C-org became included in the soil sampling, resulting in a non-negligible bias (underestimate) in estimated soil carbon loss based on internationally agreed C-stock accounting.

TI  - Techno-economic and greenhouse gas savings assessment of decentralized biomass gasification for electrifying the rural areas of Indonesia
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explored the feasibility of decentralized gasification of oil palm biomass in Indonesia to relieve its over-dependence on fossil fuel-based power generation and facilitate the electrification of its rural areas. The techno-feasibility of the gasification of oil palm biomass was first evaluated by reviewing existing literature. Subsequently, two scenarios (V1 and V2, and M1 and M2) were proposed regarding the use cases of the village and mill, respectiliely. The capacity of the gasification systems in the V1 and M1 scenarios are determined by the total amount of oil palm biomass available in the village and mill, respectively. The capacity of the gasification systems in the V2 and M2 scenarios is determined by the respective electricity demand of the village and mill. The global warming impact and economic feasibility (net present value (NPV) and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE)) of the proposed systems were compared with that of the current practices (diesel generator for the village use case and biomass boiler combustion for the mill use case) using life cycle assessment (LCA) and cost benefit analysis (CBA). Under the current daily demand per household (0.4 kWh), deploying the V2 system in 104 villages with 500 households each could save up to 17.9 thousand tons of CO2. paper year compared to the current diesel-based practice. If the electricity could be fed into the national grid, the Ml system with 100% capacity factor could provide yearly GHG emissions mitigation of 5.8 x 10(4) ton CO2-eq, relative to the current boiler combustion-based reference scenario. M1 had a positive mean NPV if the electricity could be fed into the national grid, while M2 had a positive mean NPV at the biochar price of 500 USD/ton. Under the current electricity tariff (ET) (0.11 kWh) and the biochar price of 2650 USD/ton, daily household demands of 2 and 1.8 kWh were required to reach the break-even point of the mean NPV for the V2 system for the cases of 300 and 500 households, respectively. The average LCOE of V2 is approximately one-fourth that of the reference scenario, while the average LCOE of V1 is larger than that of the reference scenario. The average LCOE of Ml decreased to around 0.06 USD/kWh for the case of a 100% capacity factor. Sensitivity analysis showed that the capital cost of gasification system and its overall electrical efficiency had the most significant effects on the NPV. Finally, practical system deployment was discussed, with consideration of policy formulation and fiscal incentives.

TI  - Empirical models to predict LAI and aboveground biomass of Coffea arabica under full sun and shaded plantation: a case study of South of Minas Gerais, Brazil
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) and above ground biomass (AGB) are two parameters that are difficult to measure but very useful. In this paper we investigated the relationship between coffee biophysical properties and LAI and AGB in two coffee production systems: full sun (FS) and shaded with macadamia nuts (SH). The paper proposes an empirical relationship for calculating coffee AGB and coffee LAI which avoids destructive methods, using simple field measurements and agrometeorological data. Here, we reported that LAI is related to canopy structure but subject to strong seasonal variations, which can be identified using water requirements satisfaction index (WRSI). Coffee LAI answers to the decreased WRSI with 1 month lag (WRSI-1) and LAI values decreases more for FS systems than for SH systems during dry periods. The best empirical model to predict LAI for FS coffee production system was based on canopy height (ch) and WRSI-1 value. For SH systems, the best model used ch, WRSI-1 and the height of the first pair of branches. Coffee AGB values were measured using destructive analyses and an empirical equation was developed. Both coffee production systems stocked carbon, whereas the SH system stocked an increased carbon amount provided by the macadamia trees that contributed with 15 % of the total carbon above ground. Both systems can be considered mitigation techniques since they are able to remove atmospheric carbon and stock it in the biomass, which has been largely proposed as a compensation mechanism for greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Soybean root growth and yield in rotation with cover crops under chiseling and no-till
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Compacted subsoil layers result in shallow root systems hindering the absorption of water and nutrients by plants. Disruption of soil compacted layers can be promoted by mechanical and/or biological methods, using plants with strong root systems. The immediate and medium term effects of mechanical chiseling and crop rotations on soybean root growth and yield were evaluated during four years in Brazil. Triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L) were grown in the autumn-winter (April-August). In the next spring (September-October/early November), designated plots were chiseled down to 0.25 m or planted to millet (Pennisetum glaucum L), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) and sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.), grown as cover crops, preceding soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill). Chiseling was done only in the first year, and these plots were left fallow during the spring (September-October/early November) for the rest of the experiment. Chiseling resulted in lower soil penetration resistance and higher soybean yields in the first year. However, in the following years soybean root growth in depth was increased under rotation with triticale and pearl millet due to the presence of biopores and a decrease in soil penetration resistance. Soybean yields tended to decrease over the years in plots that were chiseled when compared with plots under crop rotation. Chiseling can be replaced by crop rotations involving species with aggressive root systems in order to alleviate deleterious effects of soil compaction on soybean yields in tropical soils. This effect is gradual, thus crop rotation will be fully effective in remediating soil compaction in a 3- to 4-year term. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Original Assessment of soil salinity status under different land-use conditions in the semiarid region of Northeastern Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization and sodification, caused by inadequate land management, is one of the main threats to the semiarid agroecosystems. It is essential to investigate saline levels under different land-use conditions to maintain the sustainability of agricultural production. The main objective of this study was to diagnose the salinity status of the soil in different land-use conditions in the semiarid region of Northeast Brazil. Soil samples were collected in the surface layer (0-5 cm) of three different land-use conditions: areas of low salinity (native vegetation - Caatinga), areas of different saline levels (cultivated areas), and areas of very high salinity (desertified by salinity), and compared regarding the chemical attributes of the soils by descriptive and multi-variate analysis. The results showed that sodium and chloride were the predominant soluble ions in cultivated and desertified areas due to saline waters commonly used in the study region. Increases in electrical conductivity values of 1219 and 23207% were observed for cultivated and desertified areas, respectively, compared to areas of native vegetation. The principal component analysis contributed to identifying parameters responsible for the variation in soil salinity, and the second factor identified that percentage of exchangeable sodium, electrical conductivity, and exchangeable and soluble sodium plays an essential role in soil desertification. However, calcium, magnesium, sodium, and chloride ions correlated positively with variables that degrade soils -EC, ESP, and SAR. We also found that in desertified areas, in addition to chloride, sulfate is also present in expressive levels, and due to the strong associations with calcium, magnesium, and sodium, our study suggests that in addition to the free forms of these ions, the forms of chlorides and sulfates of calcium, magnesium, and sodium also effectively contribute to the degradation of the areas. The combination of multivariate analysis x geochemistry x laboratory techniques was a valuable tool to identify and monitor saline levels in converting uncultivated to cultivated areas and from cultivated areas to desertified areas.

TI  - Forest and Society: Initiating a Southeast Asia Journal for Theoretical, Empirical, and Regional Scholarship
T2  - FOREST AND SOCIETY
M3  - Review
AB  - Welcome to our first edition. We are excited to provide a new, and what we believe, timely avenue for presenting research findings and publications in Southeast Asia, for scholars interested in Southeast Asia. Although Southeast Asia as a region of study has provided tremendous contributions to theory and practice regarding forests and society across the social and natural sciences, avenues for cultivating a scholarship of the region remain limited. We seek to engage on a broad set of themes through the application of targeted research related to timely issues affecting the human-environment interface in a diverse region that we have much to learn from. We take a broad understanding of the forest - as a politico-administrative unit, a geographic area, and as an ecological unit. We do not limit the forest to its boundaries but rather seek to engage on the dynamics of change in social and ecological processes. Under such an umbrella, new approaches and methods become possible. 'Forest' can be analyzed as land use, ecological process, divided across watersheds, as landscapes, mountains, and more. The lens of 'society' allows for opportunities to understand change, whether it is the interaction between a resource to be preserved, exploited, forgotten, or erased. Forests, therefore, operate as the clues of what once was, has become, and what can be. Particularly in the age of climate change, riddled by increasingly complex challenges, a new dimension also emerges for the forest. Different perspectives at different scales - from the local to the global - provide equally important dimensions, and are those which we seek to provide avenues to learn from, and communicate through this journal. As the reader will find in this inaugural issue, we have compiled an initial set of studies across multiple methods and geographies that help to set the terms of future editions. We examine: historical political ecologies of land use around opium cultivation in the uplands of Thailand; emerging governance regimes of corporate social responsibility in Myanmar; the capacity of new state institutions to manage land conflict in forest estate lands in Indonesia; a close analysis of forest harvesting and management in a mangrove forest in Malaysia; and, an economic valuation of non-timber forest products in a national park in Indonesia. There is much to choose from and much more to delve into. We hope that this issue serves as an impetus to engage on these timely themes and further encourages new ideas for submissions.

M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Workshop on Biological Management of Soil Ecosystems
CL  - Londrina, BRAZIL
AB  - Agricultural ecosystems generally contain less soil organic carbon (SOC) pool than their potential capacity because of the low return and high rate of mineralization of biosolids, and severe losses due to accelerated erosion and leaching. Conversion of natural to agricultural ecosystems usually causes depletion of 50 to 75 percent of the antecedent SOC pool, thereby creating a potential sink capacity of as much as 35 to 40 Mg C/ha. The depletion of SOC pool leads to decline in soil quality and resilience with attendant reduction in biomass productivity, decreased capacity to degrade and filter pollutants, increased risks of soil degradation by erosion and other processes, and increase in emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs). The magnitude of depletion of SOC pool is greater for soils of the tropics than temperate regions, and for farms which are resource-based and managed with low-input than those managed with science-based and judicious off-farm inputs. The SOC sequestration, increasing SOC pool through conversion to an appropriate land use and adoption of recommended management practices (RMPs), can reverse soil degradation trends, improve soil quality and resilience, increase biomass production and decrease emission of GHGs. A strong link exists between the labile fraction of SOC pool and soil biodiversitythe activity and species diversity of soil fauna (micro, meso and macro) and micro-organisms. Soil biodiversity is usually higher under pastures and planted fallow systems than under crops, and is likely to increase with adoption of conservation tillage and mulch farming, integrated nutrient management and manuring, mixed farming systems and integrated pest management (IPM) techniques. The gross rates of SOC sequestration through adoption of RMPs range from 400 to 800 kg/ha/y for cool and humid regions and 100 to 200 kg/ha/y for dry and warm climates. The potential of soil C sequestration in Brazil is estimated at about 50 Tg C/y. In addition, 60 Tg C/y emitted by erosion-induced mineralization can also be avoided through effective erosion control measures.

TI  - Abundance and richness of invertebrates in shade-grown versus sun-exposed coffee home gardens in Indonesia
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Complex agroforestry systems are suggested as a possible solution to reduce the effects of deforestation in the tropics while enhancing the livelihoods of local human populations. Coffee (Coffea spp.) is one of the most important commodity crops in the world that can easily be cultivated in complex agroforestry systems. Coffee agroforestry systems usually sustain higher biodiversity levels than sun-exposed fields while keeping similar levels of productivity considering the several benefits of growing coffee under a complex system. We aim to explore the richness and abundance of invertebrates in coffee home gardens in West Java, Indonesia by comparing 14 sun-exposed and 14 shade-grown gardens. We collected data in March/April 2019 via pitfall traps, pan traps, and beating tray in each field. We ran generalised linear models to assess whether the number of species and the number of individuals of insects differed between sun-exposed vs. shade-grown coffee gardens, and tested associations between main taxa. Overall, there was no difference in the richness (sun-exposed: 19.86 +/- SE1.19; shade-grown: 19.71 +/- SE1.19; Z-value = 0.12, p value = 0.904) and abundance (sun-exposed: 141.93 +/- SE 3.18; shade-grown: 139.93 +/- SE3.16; Z-value = 0.35, p value = 0.706) of invertebrates in coffee gardens, although taxa specific differences were present. Sun-exposed fields had a higher abundance of invertebrates considered as pests (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae, Ectobiidae; Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae, Lycidae and Tenebrionidae; Diptera: Anisolabididae, Drosophilidae and Sarcophagidae). Camponotus spp. were the most dominant ants in shade-grown gardens while Dolichoderus spp. and Myrmicaria spp. were more abundant in sun-exposed gardens. Despite the fact that sun-exposed coffee fields registered higher abundance of invertebrate pests than shade-grown coffee fields, the richness of invertebrates did not substantially vary between sun-exposed and shade-grown coffee, suggesting that the matrix of gardens offers advanced ecosystem services. It is important to keep the complexity of agroforestry systems that provide key habitats for biodiversity.

TI  - A comprehensive assessment of greenhouse gas emissions research in the Cerrado region, Brazil
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing demand for food, fiber, and (bio)energy boosted by population growth has accentuated agricultural expansion, increasing global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This scenario is valid in Brazil, where agriculture accounts for the largest part of the nation's GHG emissions, primarily associated with the expansion of agriculture over areas of native vegetation, especially in the Cerrado region. However, despite the contribution of this sector to GHG emissions, there is a limited understanding of how different systems affect these emissions, as well as the current state of the art on this topic. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive literature review to synthesize the information about GHG emissions in the region, including cropping systems where GHG was measured, methodological procedures, and the main results achieved. Our review shows that the subject of "GHG" has been poorly investigated, with a huge discrepancy compared to other related topics such as soil organic matter. Most studies (31 % of 236) only mentioned GHG-related terms but did not measure them. The studies that measured GHG (n = 39) were conducted mainly in the south-central part of the region and were mostly limited to short-term experiments (< 5 years) or monitoring periods (< 1 year), using manual static chambers. The analysis of the available GHG data indicated that converting Cerrado into agriculture increases N2O emissions by 0.45 kg ha(-1) year(-1) while decreasing CH4 influx by 3 kg ha(-1) year(-1). Despite that, notillage combined with cover crops effectively reduces N2O emissions ( -0.3 kg ha(-1) year(-1)). Our findings reveal a significant gap in monitoring GHG fluxes in the Cerrado region, particularly in the northern part where Brazil's new agricultural frontier, the Matopiba region, is located. Efforts should prioritize generating comprehensive GHG data for Cerrado agriculture by employing more robust monitoring protocols. This would help guide producers, researchers, and policymakers to enhance agricultural management practices toward greater sustainability.

TI  - Compositional and functional response of bacterial communities and soil greenhouse gas fluxes in pastures after a strong precipitation-induced event
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as CO2, CH4, and N2O, can respond to changes in land use, particularly those associated with animal production. Soil microorganisms play a crucial role in both producing and oxidizing GHGs, and their activities are strongly influenced by soil properties and moisture levels. Despite this, the functional dynamics of changes in GHG fluxes resulting from alterations in the soil microbiome remain poorly understood. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate how changes in GHG emissions are related to soil moisture and how they impact the soil bacteriome and its transcriptional profile. A controlled simulated rain event was conducted in both a degraded area (exposed soil, with low carrying cattle capacity) and a nondegraded area (covered soil, with high carrying cattle capacity), and various soil attributes were evaluated over a 16 -day period. The data suggested that rain induced different responses in each area. In the days following the rain simulation, CH4 emissions gradually increased in the non -degraded area and decreased in the degraded area, while the N2O flux had a peak in the degraded area right after water addition. Transcript evaluation in nondegraded area revealed a substantial relationship between soil moisture levels and nosZ expression and a potential relationship between rain and the expression of nifH, nirS, mcrA, and pmoA. However, the response of these genes exhibited a delay. Analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA indicated similar alpha diversity before and after the experiment, while the structure of these communities underwent considerable alterations in response to pasture degradation. The obtained data suggest that soil microorganisms functionally respond to changes in precipitation by activating metabolic processes, leading to CH4 production. Nevertheless, this response may not be immediate and can be influenced by environmental conditions. Additionally, given that changes in soil properties in degraded soil affected the soil microbiome structure, the results underscore the importance of adopting management practices that preserve soil health and support soil carbon stocks.

TI  - Shade trees and agrochemical use affect butterfly assemblages in coffee home gardens
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems have been recognised as a possible refuge for biodiversity especially when bordering intact landscapes. The intensification of crop management to increase yields is usually associated with a reduction of shade trees and heavy use of chemicals, typically correlated with a decrease in biodiversity. The relationship between intensity of crop management and biodiversity, however, is not clear-cut and is dependent on environmental and geographical differences. We assessed the influence of different shade cover, shade tree richness, richness of other crops, distance from the forest, and use of chemicals on the diversity, richness and abundance of butterflies, a bioindicator in coffee home gardens. We collected data in 42 coffee home gardens in West Java, Indonesia, via Pollard transects, totalling 15.1 km (July-August 2019 and July-August 2020). We found 54 species of butterflies in the gardens. Via Generalised Additive Mixed Models, we found that the use of chemicals negatively influenced the abundance (p = 0.001) and richness (p = 0.039) of butterflies, while shade tree richness positively influenced the abundance (p < 0.001), diversity (p = 0.046) and richness (p < 0.001) of butterflies. The other predictors did not have a significant effect. The high diversity of butterflies in the study area suggests that the agroforestry environment is now resilient, but the relationship between butterfly abundance, diversity, and richness with shade tree richness indicates an urgency to maintain and improve current ecosystem complexity. The negative relationship between butterfly abundance and richness and the use of chemicals further indicates that organic farming should be promoted to preserve ecosystem services provided by pollinators. Coffee production in Indonesia has dramatically increased in the last 10 years and producers are keener to use more intensive farming techniques with a consequent reduction of ecosystem complexity. This process can break the resilience of agroforestry habitats if actions are not taken immediately.

TI  - Who is responsible for deforestation in the Amazon? A spatially explicit analysis along the Transamazon Highway in Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding actor-specific responsibility for deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is key in adjusting policy and resource allocation in the face of current forest destruction. However, previous research shows that there is great variability in such assessments. To contribute to the ongoing discussions on forest conservation and rural development policies in the Amazon, this paper studies actor-specific deforestation and its environmental effects in four municipalities situated along the Transamazon Highway. We used spatially explicit methods that integrate a database of 8281 georeferenced properties with a time series of remote-sensing data covering four periods between 1986 and 2007. We also included landscape ecology metrics as improved indicators of the complex environmental effects of forest fragmentation. The analysis demonstrates that smallholders (defined as colonists who own less than 100 ha of land) were responsible for 23% of total deforestation in the study region while accounting for 55% of the total properties. We also explored the relationship between property size and deforestation at the property level, finding that it closely follows a power distribution. Property deforestation increased with property size, while the percentage of property deforestation decreased. In spite of this, compliance with current legal requirements to maintain 50% of property forest cover was not statistically different between smallholders and largeholders. In comparison to municipalities dominated by medium- and large-scale ranchers, the smallholder-dominated municipality of Medicilandia showed better performance in all applied landscape metrics with well-established relationships with the provision of important environmental goods and services. Although all studied municipalities showed severe accumulated deforestation, Medicilandia experienced an abrupt decrease in municipal deforestation after 1999 to just 0.03% year(-1), while municipalities dominated by larger holders maintained or increased their previous deforestation rates to between 0.90% and 1.34% year(-1) in the same period. This indicates that the smallholders' productions schemes in our study area might present potential for agricultural frontier stabilization based on improved land-use efficiency. The policy implications of our findings are discussed, especially with regard to the role of smallholders in productive forest conservation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Beneficial Effect of Biochar on Irrigated Dwarf-Green Coconut Tree
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The coconut tree is considered one of the greatest consumers of irrigation water, ranging from 100 to 240 L day(-1). The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of biochar application on decreased irrigation water needs in a 2-year irrigated dwarf coconut palm orchard field experiment. Biochar was characterized chemically and by electron microscope images. Biochar morphology presented several micropores indicating water retention potential. Amounts of biochar were tested (0, 5, 10, 20, 40 g of biochar per kg of soil), representing 0.0; 0.5; 1.0; 2.0; and 4.0 kg per plant. Micro sprinkler irrigation started following the planting of the 90-day old hybrid dwarf coconut seedlings. The impacts of the application of the biochar on the chemical attributes of the soil, biometry of the coconut plants, water storage in the 0-0.3 m soil layer, and the volume of irrigation water required by treatment were evaluated. After two years (2017 and 2018), the application of the biochar resulted in no statistically significant differences in the chemical attributes of the soil and biometric variables of plants between different treatments. The volume of annual irrigation water per plant versus biochar quantity demonstrated a decreasing effect, due to the increase of soil water storage. The dose of 40 g of biochar per kg of soil presented the highest two-year average soil water retention (0-0.3 m layer) among treatments (34, 36, 34, 38, and 45 mm, respectively), resulting in lower 2-year irrigation water demand (28, 36, 29, 28 and 20 L plant(-1) day(-1), respectively).

TI  - Ecosystem carbon storage and partitioning in a tropical seasonal forest in Southwestern China
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests play an important role in the global carbon cycle. Despite an increasing number of studies have addressed carbon storage in tropical forests, the regional variation in such storage remains poorly understood. Uncertainty about how much carbon is stored in tropical forests is an important limitation for regional-scale estimates of carbon fluxes and improving these estimates requires extensive field studies of both above- and belowground stocks. In order to assess the carbon pools of a tropical seasonal forest in Asia, total ecosystem carbon storage was investigated in Xishuangbanna, SW China. Averaged across three 1 ha plots, the total carbon stock of the forest ecosystem was 303 t C ha(-1). Living tree carbon stocks (both above- and belowground) ranged from 163 to 258 t C ha(-1). The aboveground biomass C pool is comparable to the Dipterocarp forests in Sumatra but lower than those in Malaysia. The variation of C storage in the tree layer among different plots was mainly due to different densities of large trees (DBH > 70 cm). The contributions of the shrub layer, herb layer, woody lianas, and fine litter each accounted for 1-2 t C ha(-1) to the total carbon stock. The mineral soil C pools (top 100 cm) ranged from 84 to 102 t C ha(-1) and the C in woody debris from 5.6 to 12.5 t C ha(-1), representing the second and third largest C component in this ecosystem. Our results reveal that a high percentage (70%) of C is stored in biomass and less in soil in this tropical seasonal forest. This study provides an accurate estimate of the carbon pool and the partitioning of C among major components in tropical seasonal rain forest of northern tropical Asia. Results from this study will enhance our ability to evaluate the role of these forests in regional C cycles and have great implications for conservation planning. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Shading effect on physiological parameters and in vitro embryo production of tropical adapted Nellore heifers in integrated crop-livestock-forest systems
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of increased shadow supply in integrated crop-livestock-forest systems on in vitro embryonic development and physiological parameters related to stress response in Nellore heifers (Bos indicus). For the study, animals (n = 16) were randomly divided into two groups and kept in areas with different afforestation systems, the integrated crop-livestock-forest (ICLF) and the integrated crop-livestock (ICL) system. The microclimate of the ICLF system provided better comfort conditions than ICL. No differences of respiratory rate, rectal temperature, cortisol, T3, T4, oocyte quality, and cleavage rate between the systems were verified. A higher blastocyst rate was observed in the ICLF (p < 0.05). The results demonstrate that Nellore heifers managed in ICLF during summer in Midwest of Brazil showed higher production of in vitro embryos, without typical changes in its physiological parameters. The results observed in the present study indicate that zebu females are able to respond satisfactorily to the intense heat conditions; however, we believe that the long period to which these animals are exposed to these conditions interferes in the oocyte competence and embryo development.

TI  - A multicriteria evaluation approach to set forest restoration priorities based on water ecosystem services
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest plays an important role in keeping water ecosystem services, such as drinking water provision. Thus, payment for ecosystem services is an essential instrument to promote forest restoration in agricultural watersheds. However, funds are limited and must be well planned to ensure water resources conservation and water ecosystem services improvement. In this context, our study aimed to identify priority areas for forest restoration, based on water ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. For this, we have developed a decision-making support model for agricultural watersheds (in the Atlantic Forest region), based on mixed approaches, that were multicriteria evaluation (MCE) and Participatory Technique. The model will help decision-makers and stakeholders to set priorities for payment for ecosystem services programs implementation. So, we evaluate its application in watersheds with different forest cover patterns to check if it can be applied to different landscape patterns. The base of the model was the following criteria, that were produced with high-resolution data and ranking in the Participatory Technique context, considering their importance for the study: proximity to spring, slope, soil erodibility, topographic index, and land-use/land-cover (LULC). The criteria were aggregated by the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) method (an MCE method). The priorities maps showed areas classified as high priority near the rivers (at most 200 m far from rivers), on the greatest slopes (>40%), on soils associated with high potential of erosion, and predominantly in agriculture lands. However, this class presented more percentage of the area associated with native forest in the forested watershed (native forest covers 55% of its area) than in the watershed non-forested (native forest covers 25%). Another important point of the final maps was a high percentage of areas associated with the medium class, which is a characteristic of the WLC method. Thus, areas classified as high and medium priority was defined as targets for forest restoration in the watersheds. We can conclude that for small watersheds, the MCE method, with high-resolution data, supports an appropriate prioritization of areas for forest restoration, aiming at the improvement of water ecosystem services. This way, our model can be applied to various payments for ecosystem services schemes in agricultural landscapes worldwide.

TI  - The role of ex situ seed banks in the conservation of plant diversity and in ecological restoration in Latin America
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Over half of the world's primary forest and a quarter of the world's plant species are found in Latin America. As a result of the limited protected areas and significant degradation of terrestrial ecosystems, seed banks provide an efficient component of integrated plant conservation strategies, chiefly due to their relatively low cost and massive storage capacity for genetic resources.Aims: We analyse the role that ex situ seed banks play in the conservation and reintroduction of threatened species, and in supporting ecological restoration programmes in the region.Methods: An analysis of the second National Reports on the state of the World's Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture showed that most countries in the region had the capacity for seed conservation. Using three case studies from seed conservation programmes in Mexico, Brazilian Amazonia and Chile, together with the global Millennium Seed Bank Partnership, we review the status and potential of these initiatives for conservation of plant diversity.Conclusion: The collection, conservation and use of seeds from arid and semi-arid biomes is highly effective; however the higher frequency of recalcitrant seeds in humid tropical forests requires a greater investment in research to underpin large-scale seed banking. In order to safeguard native species and provide adequate diversity of seeds for habitat restoration programmes, we anticipate the need to strengthen the capacity of the region's seed banks for preservation, research and propagation of native species.

TI  - Productivity and beverage sensory quality of arabica coffee intercropped with timber species
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the productivity and beverage sensory quality of arabica coffee under the influence of tree species cultivated at different spacings. The experiment was set in 2012, in the municipality of Santo Antonio do Amparo, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. A randomized complete block design was carried out with four replicates and seven treatments, as follows: Catuai Vermelho IAC 99 Coffea arabica in monoculture (3.40x0.65 m); and this cultivar intercropped at two spacings (9.0x13.6 and 18.0x13.6 m) in the coffee row. either with African mahogany (Khaya ivorensis), teak (Tectona grandis), or pink cedar (Acrocarpus fraxinifolius). Three coffee rows were fixed between rows, totaling 13.6 m between the wooded rows. Productivity, sensory analysis (cup test), and content analysis of sensory attributes were evaluated in the 2017 and 2018 crop years. The treatments and years of harvest influenced productivity. The sensory analysis was positive for coffee intercropped with African mahogany and teak, in 2018. Sensory attributes and nuances are modified by the years of harvest. Arabica coffee plants intercropped with African mahogany show a superior productivity, regardless of the spacing between species, as well as a higher sensory quality in the 2018 harvest.

TI  - Monitoring sediment yield for soil and water conservation planning in rural catchments
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment yield in river catchments can cause siltation of reservoirs and channels, carries contaminants adhered to sediment particles, and represents water erosion at the catchment scale, leading to decreased agricultural productivity. Hydrological monitoring enables the understanding of overland flow and soil erosion dynamics. In this study, we analyzed whether the relationship between precipitation (P), water flow (Q), and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) during rainfall events shows the usefulness of hydrological and sedimentological monitoring in soil and water conservation projects to river catchments. We conducted a study in the Lajeado Ferreira catchment in southern Brazil. This catchment is characterized by high soil fragility and erosion rates because of relief and intense tobacco cultivation. The small size of the catchment (120 ha) allowed a better understanding of the processes that occurred between hillslope and watercourses. We analyzed 43 rainfall-runoff events (P-Q), and we selected characteristic variables of each event and related them to independent variables (climate, land use, and soil management) and their seasonality using regression techniques. We also conducted a hysteresis analysis to understand the behavior of SSC in relation to runoff. The results showed a high relation of sediment yield (SY) with maximum water flow of the event (Q(max)), and linear regression models showed the best performance between characteristic variables. In addition, the seasonal variability of the land coverage presented greater influence on the SY than the precipitation itself.

TI  - Impact of forest plantation on methane emissions from tropical peatland
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatlands are a known source of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere, but their contribution to atmospheric CH4 is poorly constrained. Since the 1980s, extensive areas of the peatlands in Southeast Asia have experienced land-cover change to smallholder agriculture and forest plantations. This land-cover change generally involves lowering of groundwater level (GWL), as well as modification of vegetation type, both of which potentially influence CH4 emissions. We measured CH4 exchanges at the landscape scale using eddy covariance towers over two land-cover types in tropical peatland in Sumatra, Indonesia: (a) a natural forest and (b) an Acacia crassicarpa plantation. Annual CH4 exchanges over the natural forest (9.1 +/- 0.9 g CH4 m(-2) year(-1)) were around twice as high as those of the Acacia plantation (4.7 +/- 1.5 g CH4 m(-2) year(-1)). Results highlight that tropical peatlands are significant CH4 sources, and probably have a greater impact on global atmospheric CH4 concentrations than previously thought. Observations showed a clear diurnal variation in CH4 exchange over the natural forest where the GWL was higher than 40 cm below the ground surface. The diurnal variation in CH4 exchanges was strongly correlated with associated changes in the canopy conductance to water vapor, photosynthetic photon flux density, vapor pressure deficit, and air temperature. The absence of a comparable diurnal pattern in CH4 exchange over the Acacia plantation may be the result of the GWL being consistently below the root zone. Our results, which are among the first eddy covariance CH4 exchange data reported for any tropical peatland, should help to reduce the uncertainty in the estimation of CH4 emissions from a globally important ecosystem, provide a more complete estimate of the impact of land-cover change on tropical peat, and develop science-based peatland management practices that help to minimize greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Contribution of pecan (Carya illinoinensis [Wangenh.| K. Koch) to Sustainable Development Goal 2 under the dual perspective of carbon storage and human nutrition
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - This work aims to contextualize and analyze the potential contribution of pecan to SDG2 under the dual perspective of carbon storage and human nutrition. Particularly, the study focuses on the pecan agroecosystems in the Americas, representing the most important pecan-producing countries (the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Peru). We observed that pecan is a reliable sink for storing atmospheric C and also for quality nuts with high nutritional density. The Americas, hold a population of ca. 23 M pecan trees, with the younger tree populations and the highest C-storing potential in South America. This pecan tree population has removed 51.3 Mt CO2eq immobilizing the OC in their aboveground biomass, but if the C sequestration for the whole system is considered, the value reaches nearly 80 Mt CO2eq. From a nutritional perspective, there are different dietary needs to cover according to the country, although the common analysis output is a low proportion of nuts in the diet, which is expected to improve, given the efforts of each country to promote domestic consumption. All the mentioned countries in this study have a low pecan consumption going from 8 to 293 g per capita yr(-1), which in the light of the Global Burden of Disease represents 0.08 to 3.2% of the recommended yearly dietary basis for nuts overall. The inclusion of pecan nuts in the daily diet is of utmost importance to offset the food nutrient dilution carbohydrates-based, linked to the excess of atmospheric CO2. Also, pecan orchards function as a platform to integrate sustainable systems. The global benefit of having pecan and alley crops has been proved in regions other than the Americas with interesting economic outputs leading to energizing the life of rural communities. Pecan orchards and pecan agroforestry may lead to sustainable agri-food systems, with global gains in SOC and nutritional richness and diversity. Therefore, more in-depth studies are needed not only to fully understand the functioning of the systems at a productive level but also to design and plan sustainable landscapes in rural land.

TI  - Understanding farms trajectories methods to build sustainable futures on pioneer fronts: Lessons from a systematic literature review and a framework proposal
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Review
AB  - Context: On pioneer fronts, the new spatial-temporal evolution of agriculture needs to be understood to help farmers find their way to conciliate food production and forest conservation. Analyzing farm trajectories is consequently critical for designing such futures and to assess their commitments with agroecology principles. Objective: Based on the analysis of the literature on farm trajectories and pathways we proposed a renewed analytical framework to analyze farm trajectories in pioneer fronts and support the identification of desirable strategies for the future. Methods: A systematic review adapted from the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology was used. From an initial record of 246 papers, 81 were selected as eligible for the review. The articles were classified in six categories according to three criteria: i) the retrospective or prospective analysis of farm trajectories, ii) the consideration or not of the territorial scale (drawing lessons at territorial scale), iii) the use or not of modeling tools. We also explored whether off-farm factors (such as existing infrastructure at territorial scale or access to credit) and intra-farm factors (such as the organization of family work and the role of women within this organization) were considered since these factors affect farms trajectories in pioneer fronts. Results and conclusions: Results indicate that the concept of trajectory is mainly associated with retrospective analyses while the concept of pathway is mostly associated with prospective studies generally using simulation tools for the design of future scenarios. The link between trajectories and agroecological principles also has been little explored in the literature. Both retrospective and prospective studies fail to pay sufficient attention to the roles of women and family organization. Lastly, most of the methodologies studied do not fully consider the effects of off-farm territorial factors and public policies on these trajectories. We propose an analytical framework that would address these limitations. Significance: This framework is currently used in Brazilian and Colombian Amazon and will help defining sustainable farm trajectories limiting deforestation. Such a framework is needed to support farm development on pioneer fronts and broadly in territories that must deal with highly critical environmental agendas.

TI  - The Use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index to Analyze the Influence of Vegetation Cover Changes on the Streamflow in the Manhuacu River Basin, Brazil
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The intensification of anthropogenic activities in river basins has significantly altered river streamflow. Thus, the aim of this work is to evaluate the influence of temporal and spatial changes in vegetation cover on the streamflow of the Manhuacu River, Brazil using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The NDVI values were obtained from Landsat images for 1986 to 2014 and processed on the Google Earth Engine (GEE). To characterize the hydrologic behavior of the basin, we used data from eight streamflow gauge stations and 18 rain gauge stations, and we conducted Mann-Kendall and Pettitt tests to evaluate the stationarity hypothesis. To verify the relationship between the vegetation cover changes and the streamflow, we used multiple regression models. In the analyzed period, we observed a slight increase in the vegetation cover and a reduction in pasture areas. In most cases, the annual low flow exhibited a decreasing tendency because of an increase in vegetation area. We obtained satisfactory adjustments of the multiple regression models by examining the correlations among the change in vegetation cover, rainfall and evapotranspiration data, which resulted in adjusted Ra2 values ranging from 0.59 to 0.96. The NDVI values were a good indicator of vegetation cover dynamics in the Manhuacu River basin, which influenced the nonstationary streamflow behavior.

TI  - Intensification and diversification of pasturelands in Brazil: Patterns and driving factors in the soil carbon stocks
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The extensive system of pasture management in Brazil can reduce soil C stocks and increase CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. However, the adoption of sustainable management systems can change these conditions and enact modern practices of natural resource management as defined by the concept of ecosystem services. A field study was therefore carried out to assess the effects of adopting more intensive and diversified systems of pasture management on the quality and stocks of soil C. Treatments included fertilized pasture (FP), integrated crop -livestock (ICL), and integrated livestock-forest (ILF) and were compared to conventional management systems (CS) under different soil and climate conditions (tropical humid, subtropical dry and subtropical humid). Soil carbon stocks and soil organic matter (SOM) fractions were determined in the top one-meter layer. With the SOM fractions, we calculated the C lability (LI), pool (CPI) and management (CMI) indices. The results showed that adopting ICL systems under the conditions of a tropical humid and subtropical humid climate produced increases in soil C stocks of 0.75 Mg ha-1 yr- 1 (P < 0.01) and 0.15 Mg ha-1 yr- 1 (P < 0.05), respectively, relative to the CS. Similarly, the conversion of a CS to FP (tropical humid climate) and ILF (subtropical dry climate) led to increases in soil C stocks of 2 and 0.55 Mg ha-1 yr- 1 (P < 0.05), respectively. In general, the adoption of more intensive and diversified systems of pasture management can also afford increases in the LI, CPI and CMI indices. These results can serve as a scientific basis for government initiatives that focus on recovering degraded pastures in Brazil through the use of more sustainable management systems and can also help to sequester more C in soils.

TI  - Analysis of Susceptibility to Degradation of Water Ecosystem Services as a Tool for Land Use Planning: a Case Study in a Small Brazilian Watershed
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping priority areas for environmental conservation and restoration is essential to informing policy formulation and decision-making. This study proposes a methodology based on multicriteria analysis and on-site assessment to develop environmental zoning that enhances the provision of water ecosystem services (WES) from Brazil's agua Quente River Basin. Integrated analysis of multiple criteria enabled identification of degrees of susceptibility to degradation, assessment of effects of land-use changes between 1990 and 2020, and validation of the study's methodology via field protocol. The results indicated that the spatial and temporal patterns of WES susceptibility to degradation varied little within the study area with the most critical levels occurring primarily in the Agua Quente's floodplain, where there are sandy textured soils and coverage with a low degree of soil protection. Zoning analysis designates 40% of the basin`s area as consolidated use, 28% for environmental conservation, 19% as anthropic use, and 13% for environmental restoration. Field analysis indicates that the occurrence of degraded areas and pollution by solid waste and urban effluents are relevant factors that affect the basin's water resources. Linear regression analysis indicated a good fit between the data modeled by the multicriteria analysis and those observed on-site (R-2 = 0.6 p < 0.05). The study's method is effective and its structure can be used in other river basins, as its approach is simple and flexible and can be readily adjusted to fit the characteristics of the study site.

TI  - Effect of groundwater level fluctuation on soil respiration rate of tropical peatland in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil respiration (SR) rate was measured at the burned land (BL), the cropland (CL), the forest land (FL) and the grassland (GL) of a tropical peatland in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia from 2002 to 2011 for the purpose of analysis with a relation to the drying and rewetting. The SR rate was fitted with groundwater level (GWL) to the equation of log(SR) = alpha -beta x GWL using hierarchical Bayesian analysis where alpha and beta were regression coefficients classified by GWL changing directions (drying, rewetting and fluctuating), water-filled pore space (WFPS) ranges in topsoil (low 0-0.54, intermediate 0.54-0.75 and high 0.75-1 m(3) m(-3)), and land uses (BL, CL, FL and GL). SR rate (Mean +/- SD, mg C m(-2) h(-1)) was the significantly largest in the CL (333 +/- 178) followed by GL (259 +/- 151), FL (127 +/- 69) and lastly BL (100 +/- 90). In the CL, the significantly larger SR rate was found in the rewetting period than in the drying period in the high WFPS range. Also, the significantly steeper slope (beta) in the rewetting period was obtained in the high WFPS range than in the drying period. These results suggested that the rewetting of peatland enhanced the SR rate rapidly in the CL, and that the further rise of GWL decreased the SR rate. In contrast, the SR rate in the rewetting period was significantly smaller than in the drying period in the BL in the high WFPS range, because the BL in the high WFPS range was flooded in most cases. The SR rate in the rewetting period was not significantly different from the drying period in the FL and GL. All of beta were significant in the high WFPS range in all land uses, but not in the low-intermediate WFPS ranges, suggesting that GWL was not controlling factor of the SR rate when the GWL was deep due to the disconnection of capillary force under dry conditions. According to the results of correlation analysis of the alpha and beta, the a was significantly correlated with relative humidity, soil temperature and soil pH, suggesting that the a was enhanced by dry condition, high soil temperature and neutralization of soil acidity, respectively. The beta was significantly correlated with exchangeable Na+ and Mg2+ in the soil, but the reason was not clear. In conclusion, SR rate was enhanced by rising GWL with rewetting in the CL in the high WFPS ranges as well as by deepening GWL.

TI  - Is mangrove planting insufficient for benthic macrofaunal recovery when environmental stress is persistent?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove restoration or rehabilitation is usually based on planting native or exotic species and these actions rarely result in a return to the natural variability of biological assemblage structures and functions that is self-sustaining. One of the major causes of this failure is not attempting to remove stressors that limit natural ecosystem processes (i.e., in mangroves, any act that disturbs the hydroperiod, input of resources, or constrains regulators) in the framework for restoration. Despite this scientific consensus, this has not been put into practice. Here, we analysed a field experiment carried out over 12 years ago, to compare three planted and three reference mangrove stands (natural and previously undisturbed), with no attempt to remove the various causes of disturbance. Forest structure and productivity, sediment features, pollutants, and benthic macrofauna, which are all equally adapted to the mangroves natural conditions and are sensitive to physical disturbances and pollution, were assessed. Values for all environmental variables and almost all species and trophic groups densities differed between planted and reference sites. The fauna in planted areas was qualitatively the same as that in the reference areas, but the assemblages reflected environmental stressors, mainly pollutants (trace metals and nutrients) in the sediment and also hydroperiod alterations (differences in elevation), but not forest structure or functioning. The results indicate that: (i) forest structure and productivity in planted areas were not as would be expected for a time frame of 12 years; (ii) even with constant potential recolonisation of species from surrounding reference areas, planting alone was not sufficient for ecosystem and benthic macro faunal recovery. We recommend that ecological engineering follows the best practice available to restore mangrove ecosystems by removing the environmental stressors, establishing natural topography, and assessing the long-term success of the projects.

TI  - Exploration of the importance of physical properties of Indonesian peatlands to assess critical groundwater table depths, associated drought and fire hazard
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Widespread degradation of Indonesian peatlands by deforestation and excessive drainage results into more frequent fires, particularly in El Nino years, which causes: (i) release of enormous amounts of peat soil carbon to the atmosphere, impacting climate, (ii) severe air pollution, affecting human health and air traffic, and (iii) decreased ecosystem services through loss of biodiversity. Groundwater table decline is the main driver of these negative processes and, therefore restoration of peatland hydrology is essential. Although groundwater table depth is critical to counteract peatland degradation, optimal depths are not generic for all peatlands, but depend on peat physical properties (i.e. water retention, unsaturated conductivity), which are related to the degree of peat humification (Fibric, Hemic, Sapric). Unfortunately only few of these peat physical properties are available while they are essential input data in hydrological models required to extend the usually short observed groundwater hydrographs. An experiment with the Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant model (SWAP) for two locations in Indonesian peatlands illustrates the impact of the degree of peat humification on physical properties and thereby on calculated groundwater table depth, hydrological drought and associated fires hazards. The Variable Threshold Method is applied to convert groundwater table depths into hydrological drought, and next the modified Keetch-Byram Drought Index (mKBDI) is used to assess wildfire hazard. Peat physical properties that reflect higher peat humification (Hemic and Sapric) result into lower water tables during dry periods, in particular during El Nino years, more severe hydrological drought, and an earlier and longer fire season. Using the limited available peat physical properties the importance is demonstrated of initiating a comprehensive programme to build a database of peat physical properties covering different environmental conditions in which tropical peatlands occur. Availability of such a database connected to a long-term monitoring programme, will support the ongoing rewetting, revegetation and revitalisation programme for Indonesian peatlands, which eventually will contribute to sustainable livelihoods for local people and reduce impact on the regional climate.

TI  - Testing the benefits of conservation set-asides for improved habitat connectivity in tropical agricultural landscapes
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat connectivity is important for tropical biodiversity conservation. Expansion of commodity crops, such as oil palm, fragments natural habitat areas, and strategies are needed to improve habitat connectivity in agricultural landscapes. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) voluntary certification system requires that growers identify and conserve forest patches identified as High Conservation Value Areas (HCVAs) before oil palm plantations can be certified as sustainable. We assessed the potential benefits of these conservation set-asides for forest connectivity. We mapped HCVAs and quantified their forest cover in 2015. To assess their contribution to forest connectivity, we modelled range expansion of forest-dependent populations with five dispersal abilities spanning those representative of poor dispersers (e.g. flightless insects) to more mobile species (e.g. large birds or bats) across 70 plantation landscapes in Borneo. Because only 21% of HCVA area was forested in 2015, these conservation set-asides currently provide few connectivity benefits. Compared to a scenario where HCVAs contain no forest (i.e. a no-RSPO scenario), current HCVAs improved connectivity by similar to 3% across all dispersal abilities. However, if HCVAs were fully reforested, then overall landscape connectivity could improve by similar to 16%. Reforestation of HCVAs had the greatest benefit for poor to intermediate dispersers (0.5-3 km per generation), generating landscapes that were up to 2.7 times better connected than landscapes without HCVAs. By contrast, connectivity benefits of HCVAs were low for highly mobile populations under current and reforestation scenarios, because range expansion of these populations was generally successful regardless of the amount of forest cover. Synthesis and applications. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) requires that High Conservation Value Areas (HCVAs) be set aside to conserve biodiversity, but HCVAs currently provide few connectivity benefits because they contain relatively little forest. However, reforested HCVAs have the potential to improve landscape connectivity for some forest species (e.g. winged insects), and we recommend active management by plantation companies to improve forest quality of degraded HCVAs (e.g. by enrichment planting). Future revisions to the RSPO's Principles and Criteria should also ensure that large (i.e. with a core area >2 km(2)) HCVAs are reconnected to continuous tracts of forest to maximize their connectivity benefits.

TI  - Can short-term pasture management increase C balance in the Atlantic Rainforest?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Few studies have shown the importance of different pasture management practices on C storage and the reduction of CO2-C emissions in tropical conditions. The objective of the present study was to determine short-term changes in C pools and C balance from different pasture management practices established in the Atlantic Rainforest. A field study was carried out in Alegre, ES, Brazil from September 2013 to August 2014 to investigate the first-year effect of pasture management practices on a Udult clayey soil. The different pasture management practices studied included the following: control (CON), chiseled (CHI), fertilized (FER), burned (BUR), integrated with crop-livestock (iCL) systems, and plowed and harrowed (PH). Monthly disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were taken at two different layers (0.00-0.05 and 0.05-0.20 m) for chemical, physical, and organic matter characterization. C inputs monitored in aboveground pools included plant aerial parts and litter, and belowground pools included roots and soil C stocks. C outputs monitored were CO2-C emissions, erosion water, and sediment. C balance was considered the difference between inputs and outputs in each treatment during four seasons. The spring and summer seasons had a strong influence on C inputs and outputs where there is significant difference between spring and summer, while the autumn and winter seasons had less influence. All pasture management practices exhibited positive C balance after 1 year. High values of C balance were verified in pastures fertilized (FER) (53.04 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). Intermediate C balance was found in the burned (BUR) (40.84 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)), traditional control (CON) (40.31 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)), and in the plowing and harrowing (PH) (40.02 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) management practices. The practices of chiseled (40.00 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) and integrated crop-livestock systems (iCL) (59.06 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) resulted in low C balance.

TI  - How can we advance the knowledge on the behavior and effects of fire in the Cerrado biome?
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The indiscriminate use of fire represents one of the most significant environmental threats to the Cerrado, the second largest biome in South America. However, the impacts of fire on ecological, cultural, and economic processes remain poorly understood, making it difficult to create effective action plans for fire prevention, control, or management.We extensively reviewed the literature on fire behavior and effects in the Cerrado biome to identify current knowledge gaps and ways to advance research on fire ecology to improve the efficacy of current policies for fire use in this biome.The knowledge gaps reflect the absence of a systemic and integrative approach linking fire behavior and its effects. To fill current knowledge gaps, there are three major challenges related to interactive effects and spatial and temporal scales of the analyses: (1) predictive scale (change from single to multiple drivers); (2) spatial scale (change from site to biome); and (3) time scale (change from short- to long-term dynamics).Considering the difficulty of studying all three scales in a single experiment, we propose the following priorities: (1) increasing the scientific effort, even if independently, to include at least one of the three proposed scale changes; (2) interdisciplinary proposals that integrate different study tools; (3) studies that assess which ecological processes are more sensitive or more resilient to fire and consequently have major impacts on ecosystem services.The continuation of existing long-term studies could be an opportunity to address these priorities in addition to new sites, which can represent different landscape configurations or environmental changes.

TI  - Current and future land fire risk mapping in the southern region of Sumatra, Indonesia, using CMIP6 data and GIS analysis
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land fires lead to a deterioration of environmental quality and have perilous social and economic aspects. One method for mitigating this hazard is to determine the range of fire risk areas. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the current and potential future fire risk in the Ogan Komering Ilir, southern Sumatra region of Indonesia, using CMIP6 data and geospatial technology. In order to analyze fire risk areas, the Landsat 8 satellite image from 2021 (as a baseline period) was used. Variables like the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the land surface temperature (LST) were extracted from the satellite image. Then, the standard precipitation index (SPI) was determined using rainfall data from meteorological stations. For future period prediction (periods 2021-2040 and 2041-2060), this study used future climate data from the CMIP6. By overlaying these variables, current and future fire risk zone maps were produced. The results obtained showed that in the current period, around 726.4 km(2) (4.2%) of the area was at high fire risk, then 5,621.3 km(2) (32.7%) and 10,835.3 km(2) (63.1%) were at moderate and low fire risk zones, respectively. Furthermore, for the future period, this study estimated there was an increase in high fire risk areas of about 14% during 2021-2040 and 30% during 2041-2060. This was recorded in the southern and northern parts of the study area. Fire risk areas were strongly associated with NDMI, NDVI, and LST. The study's findings may be useful for land fire management in fire-prone areas.

TI  - Bird Assemblages in Coffee Agroforestry Systems and Other Human Modified Habitats in Indonesia
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Given the high degree of deforestation in the tropics due to shifting agriculture, it is a priority for conservation to find sustainable agriculture systems. We assessed bird communities over 1228 plots from 21 sites in the highly populated island of Java, Indonesia. We found that commercial coffee polycultures (i.e., fields comprised of coffee plants, other crops and/or fruit trees, and diverse shade trees) could sustain similar levels of bird abundance, diversity, and richness than coffee systems under natural forests and community managed forests. Commercial coffee polyculture fields host higher bird abundance, diversity, and richness than sun-exposed coffee fields, fields with other crops or fruit trees, and tree farms. We provide evidence that complex commercial agroforestry systems can host similar levels of biodiversity to agroforestry systems under natural forest. Deforestation in the tropics is mainly driven by the need to expand agriculture and forestry land. Tropical cropland has also undergone a process of intensification, particularly evident in regions that are the main exporters of deforestation-driven commodities. Around 25 million people in the world depend on coffee production, which has a profound contribution to global biodiversity loss through agricultural extensification and intensification. Nevertheless, coffee agroforestry systems have been postulated to serve as an alternative refuge for biodiversity across different regions. We aim to compare bird abundance, diversity, and richness in commercial polyculture coffee systems (i.e., the highest degree of habitat complexity that can be achieved in coffee fields after deforestation) with other coffee agroforestry systems and human modified habitats in Java, Indonesia. We collected data in 21 sites (1228 points) on Java from February to August 2021 using the point sampling method. Via generalised additive models, we tested whether the abundance, diversity, and richness of birds were different between different human modified habitats including other potential predictors such as elevation, distance to protected areas, shade tree richness, and plant diversity. Using the non-metric multidimensional scaling, we tested whether there was a difference in terms of the composition of foraging guilds between habitats. Commercial polyculture coffee fields can sustain levels of bird abundance, diversity, and richness comparable to agroforestry systems under natural forest, and higher than sun coffee and shaded monoculture coffee, and of other human modified habitats such as crop/fruit fields and tree farms. Coffee agroforestry systems have a higher proportion of nectarivores, insectivores, and frugivores than other systems that can sustain high diversity and richness of birds such as paddy fields that mainly have granivores and carnivores. Complex polycultures can represent an avenue for the future of sustainable agriculture in conditions where deforestation rates are high and in crops such as coffee, which maintain high yield in the presence of diverse shade.

TI  - Delineation of management zones in agricultural fields using cover crop biomass estimates from PlanetScope data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Several methods have been proposed to delineate management zones in agricultural fields, which can guide interventions of the farmers to increase crop yield. In this study, we propose a new approach using remote sensing data to delineate management zones at three farm sites located in southern Brazil. The approach is based on the hypothesis that the measured aboveground biomass (AGB) of the cover crops is correlated with the measured cash-crop yield and can be estimated from surface reflectance and/or vegetation indices (VIs). Therefore, we used seven different statistical models to estimate AGB of three cover crops (forage turnip, white oats, and rye) in the season prior to cash-crop planting. Surface reflectance and VIs were used as predictors to test the performance of the models. They were obtained from high spatial and temporal resolution data of the PlanetScope (PS) constellation of satellites. From the time series of 30 images acquired in 2017, we used the PS data that matched the dates of the field campaigns to build the models. The results showed that the satellite AGB estimates of the cover crops at the date of maximum VI response at the beginning of the flowering stage were useful to delineate the management zones. The cover-crop AGB models that presented the highest coefficient of determination (R-2) and the lowest root mean square (RMSE) in the validation and test datasets were Support Vector Machine (SVM), Cubist (CUB) and Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB). For most models and cover crops, the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were the two most important AGB predictors. At the date of maximum VI at the beginning of the flowering stage, the correlation coefficients (r) between the cover-crop AGB and the cash-crop yield (soybean and maize) ranged from +0.70 for forage turnip to +0.78 for rye. The fuzzy unsupervised classification of the cover-crop AGB estimates delineated two management zones, which were spatially consistent with those obtained from cash-crop yield. The comparison between both maps produced overall accuracies that ranged from 61.20% to 68.25% with zone 2 having higher cover-crop AGB and cash-crop yield than zone 1 over the three sites. We conclude that satellite AGB estimates of cover crops can be used as a proxy for generating management zone maps in agricultural fields. These maps can be further refined in the field with any other type of method and data, whenever necessary.

TI  - Sedimentation rates by the <SUP>210</SUP>Pb chronological method in Itanhaem river watershed, southeast Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The historical variation of sedimentation rate was investigated in five cores collected from the Itanhaem watershed main rivers, the second largest coastal watershed of the Sao Paulo state, Brazil, using the lead-210 radioisotope as a geochronometer. The main characteristics of the rivers' waters and sediments were determined in order to support the geochronological analysis results and associate sediments with possible source areas. In this context, the fluvial waters' general classification indicated the facies sulfated or chlorinated sodium in the winter and summer seasons, except for the Branco river waters in summer, which were classified as calcium or magnesium bicarbonate. A longitudinal salinity gradient was found in the downstream river courses, under greater marine influence, with the ions Cl-, Na+, SO42+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and K+ being most common in the waters. Silica is the predominant constituent in the sediment cores and is inversely related to the organic matter (OM) presence. Inverse correlations were also found between silica and other constituents. The watershed sedimentation rates were determined in the range of 0.31 up to 3.97 g/cm(2)/year and 0.30 up to 3.40 cm/year, highlighting the core extracted from Branco river, which showed the highest sedimentation rate. The profiles corresponding to Preto and Aguapeu rivers presented discontinuities in the sedimentation rates. The discontinuities were dated and would probably be related to the anthropic activities, which intensified in the municipality of Itanhaem around the middle of the twentieth century.

TI  - Tropical deforestation causes large reductions in observed precipitation
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests play a critical role in the hydrological cycle and can influence local and regional precipitation1. Previous work has assessed the impacts of tropical deforestation on precipitation, but these efforts have been largely limited to case studies2. A wider analysis of interactions between deforestation and precipitation & mdash; and especially how any such interactions might vary across spatial scales & mdash;is lacking. Here we show reduced precipitation over deforested regions across the tropics. Our results arise from a pan-tropical assessment of the impacts of 2003-2017 forest loss on precipitation using satellite, station-based and reanalysis datasets. The effect of deforestation on precipitation increased at larger scales, with satellite datasets showing that forest loss caused robust reductions in precipitation at scales greater than 50 km. The greatest declines in precipitation occurred at 200 km, the largest scale we explored, for which 1 percentage point of forest loss reduced precipitation by 0.25 +/- 0.1 mm per month. Reanalysis and station-based products disagree on the direction of precipitation responses to forest loss, which we attribute to sparse in situ tropical measurements. We estimate that future deforestation in the Congo will reduce local precipitation by 8-10% in 2100. Our findings provide a compelling argument for tropical forest conservation to support regional climate resilience.

TI  - The effect of crop rotation and sheep grazing management on plant production and soil C and N stocks in a long-term integrated crop-livestock system in Southern Brazil
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLS) conducted under no-tillage have been shown to favour the accumulation of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in soil. In that systems, however, C and N accumulation in soil might depend on pasture management and the type of crop rotation used. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of two stocking methods (continuous and rotational) and two sheep grazing intensities (moderate and low) on winter pasture and the effect of summer crop rotation (soybean and/or maize) on crop yield and C and N stocks in an Acrisol after 14-yr under experimental conditions. The evaluated ICLS was set up for grain yield in the summer crop phase and for sheep meat production in the winter pasture phase. Pasture production, soybean and corn yield were evaluated throughout the experimental period. After 14-yr, the soil was sampled at the 0-5, 5-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm layers to evaluate the content and stock of C and N. Higher C and N contents in soil superficial layers (0-5 and 5-10 cm) were observed under low grazing intensity in winter and soybean mono-culture in summer. The C and N stocks in 0-30 cm soil layer ranged between 39 and 45 Mg C ha(-1) and 4 and 5 Mg N ha-1, respectively. C and N stocks in the soil were significantly related to N added through the residues of pasture and summer crop. This positive relationship is possibly explained by the higher efficiency of microbes in using crop residues enriched in N with posterior stabilization of microbial residues through organo-mineral association in the soil. The higher content and stocks of C and N associated with low intensity grazing favoured a higher maize yield (40%) compared to moderate grazing intensity in the 2015/2016 season. According to our results, the accumulation of C and N in the soil under ICLS involving low grazing intensity in the winter and soybean monoculture in the summer was related to the N added/recycled by the soybean and by the hibernal pasture.

TI  - Legacy Effects Following Fire on Surface Energy, Water and Carbon Fluxes in Mature Amazonian Forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The ongoing deforestation process in Amazonia has led to intensified forest fires in the region, particularly in Brazil, after more than a decade of effective forest conservation policy. This study aims to investigate the recovery of two mature sub-montane ombrophile Amazonian forests affected by fire in terms of energy, water and carbon fluxes utilizing remote sensing (MODIS) and climate reanalysis data (GLDAS). These two forest plots, mainly composed of Manilkara spp. (Macaranduba), Protium spp. (Breu) (similar to 30 m), Bertholletia excelsa (Castanheira) and Dinizia excelsa Ducke (Angelim-Pedra) (similar to 50 m), occupy areas of 100.5 and 122.1 km(2) and were subject to fire on the same day, on September 12, 2010. The fire significantly increased land surface temperature (0.8 degrees C) and air temperature (1.2 degrees C) in the forests over a 3 years interval. However, the forests showed an ability to recover their original states in terms of coupling between the carbon and water cycles comparing the 3-year periods before and after the fires. Results from a wavelet analysis showed an intensification in annual and seasonal fluctuations, and in some cases (e.g., daily net radiation and evapotrasnspiration) sub-annual fluctuation. We interpreted these changes to be consistent with overall intensification of the coupling of energy balance components and drivers imposed by climate and solar cycle seasonality, as well as faster time scale changes, consistent with a shift toward greater forest openness and consequent reduction in the interception of incoming solar radiation by the canopy.

TI  - Diseases and insect pests challenge to meet wood production demand of Tectona grandis (L.), a high-value tropical tree species
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Tectona grandis L. (teak) is one of the cherished heritage tropical hardwood species that belongs to the Lamiaceae family. It is a large deciduous tree native to India, Myanmar and Thailand. The natural populations of teak remain an important source from the economic, ecological and environmental perspectives. Teak timber is well known for its quality in terms of durability and market value. It is naturally resistant to various biotic stress components due to the presence of tectoquinone, lapachol and deoxy lapachol; however, it takes a minimum of 20-25 years for the production of marketable wood to fetch high returns. This long haul provides sufficient time for pests and diseases to feast upon teak at various growth stages starting from nursery to timber mills which leads to a downturn in timber production. To meet the rising demand from wood industries, it is essential to manage the health of the teak plantation outside forests. The reports of new pests and diseases on teak escalated since 2010, especially from countries like Brazil and Mexico where we witness recent rise in commercial teak forests, and this vulnerability emphasizes the deployment of protection measures right from the supply of quality planting material. The update on the biotic factors comprising insect pests, fungal and bacterial infections, which are currently limiting teak wood production, will supplement the efforts involved in quality planting material production. Identification of plus trees with genetic resistance, molecular characterization and monitoring of pests and diseases on teak harnessing the recent developments in plant protection, along with the research on development of the package of practices for teak nurseries and plantation management, will only sustain teak production in near future.

TI  - The conversion of grassland to acacia forest as an effective option for net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effect of forestation with leguminous Acacia mearnsii De Wild in native grasslands on the soil greenhouse (GHG) fluxes and their main driving factors. The experiment was conducted in the Brazilian Pampa over the period of one year in a six-year-old Acacia plantation, evaluating four treatments: Acacia (AM), Acacia with litter periodically removed (A-I), Acacia after harvest (AH) and native grassland (NG) (reference treatment). Air samples were obtained by the static chamber method, and gas concentrations were evaluated by gas chromatography. Soil and climate factors were monitored. The accumulated fluxes of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were statistically similar between the soils in the AM and NG treatments, which tended to oxidize CH4 (-1445 and -1752 g C-CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively) and had low emission of N2O (242 and 316 g N-N2O ha(-1) yr(-1)), most likely influenced by the low water-filled pore space and the low content of mineral N in the soil. However, the soil in the AH treatment presented higher emissions of both gases, totaling 1889 g C-CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1) and 1250 g N-N2O ha(-1) yr(-1). Afforestation neither significantly affected the total organic C stocks nor their lability, keeping the C management index for the forested area similar to that in the NG treatment. The conversion from grassland to Acacia forest represents an effective option for mitigating the net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, which is basically determined by C accumulation in biomass and wood products.

TI  - Simulating sugarcane yield response to ETc replacements and green cane trash blanket maintenance in Brazil
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining the proper crop water requirement associated with the optimum amount of green cane trash blanket (GCTB) on the soil is one of the most discussed issues for sugarcane growers. In this context, this research aimed to evaluate the effects of different amounts of GCTB and ETc replacement scenarios on sugarcane yields across key producing regions in Brazil using the agricultural production systems simulator (APSIM). The sugarcane APSIM (APSIM-Sugar) was parameterized and validated for sugarcane in Brazil, compared to both 100% GCTB cover and bare soil, both fully irrigated. After validation through field data, the APSIM-Sugar model was used to simulate 25 different scenarios with varying GCTB amounts and irrigation demands in 12 regions of Brazil for a 30-year period to estimate stalk yield. Overall, modeled and field data agreed very well regarding soil moisture and biometric and physiological variables, achieving strong modeling efficiency. For most producing regions of Brazil, interaction between the factors did not increase stalk yield significantly, and up to 50% of ETc replacement resulted in the highest increases in stalk yield, with the greatest improvement between 0-25%, producing an average increase of 30 Mg ha(-1) per year. The recommended amount of GCTB is at least 5.50 Mg ha(-1), taking into account soil health and the need for biofuel generation.

TI  - Maize-Brachiaria grass intercropping: A meta-analysis of major productivity drivers in Brazil
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Context or problem: Increasing crop intensification while enhancing soil conservation is an important aspect of global food security. Intercropping (syn. interseeding) between cash crops and tropical forages improves soil cover, prevents soil erosion, and enhances land use via crop and livestock integration. In Brazil, intercropping between maize (Zea mays L.) and Brachiaria grass (Urochloa spp.) is the most commonly adopted system, with opportunities for expansion across tropical and subtropical landscapes worldwide. Nonetheless, there is little consensus on the effects of intercropping on the performance of each individual crop species.Objective or research question: A meta-analysis was conducted to quantify the effect of intercropping on maize grain yield and Brachiaria grass biomass production and to understand the impact of environmental and management factors on intercropping performance.Methods: A literature search was conducted to retrieve peer-reviewed studies carried out on this intercropping system under field conditions. Manuscripts were scrutinized and included in this meta-analysis when they met the following criteria: i) data on maize grain yield and Brachiaria grass biomass under intercropping were reported, ii) inclusion of a control treatment (monocropping) for at least one species, and iii) field trials with at least three randomized replications. Our database included 429 data points extracted from 56 published manuscripts from all regions of Brazil.Results: Relative to monocropping, intercropping reduced maize grain yield (-5.6 %) and Brachiaria grass biomass production (-64 %) in all scenarios. The intercropped maize grain yield was less affected under the following conditions: i) in the subtropical climate zone (-3.6 %), ii) sowing the intercrop early in the season (-5.8 %), iii) applying monocot-selective postemergence herbicides (-4.4 %), iv) relay temporal arrangement (-2.8 %), and v) with N and P fertilization rates above 150 and 35 kg ha-1, respectively. In relative terms, Brachiaria grass performance was more affected by i) intercropping adoption, with a reduced biomass penalty under a tropical climate (-63.9 %), ii) late sowing time for the intercrop (-59.5 %), iii) application of N fertilizer at a rate above 50 kg ha-1 (-70.5 %), and iv) non-use of postemergence herbicides (-21.9 %).Conclusion: Maize-Brachiaria grass intercropping was an effective alternative to produce residue (no-till system adoption) or forage (crop-livestock integrated system adoption) with reduced maize grain yield penalties, diversifying cropping systems in Brazil.Implications or significance: Despite the production penalties for both crop species, considering different relative values, specific management practices and climate conditions could minimize yield penalties. Scenarios favoring maize yields may be preferred for intercropping systems focused on improving soil quality; in contrast, Brachiaria grass biomass may benefit the integration of crop-livestock systems focused on ensuring forage production.

TI  - Quantification of Ecosystem Services from Urban Mangrove Forest: A Case Study in Angke Kapuk Jakarta
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal urban areas in Indonesia commonly encounter complex environmental problems, including bad air pollution and high risk of flooding due to sea level rise and land subsidence. The existence of urban mangrove forests potentially contributes to mitigating the environmental problems. Preserving mangrove forests in coastal urban areas requires continuous support from all stakeholders, which can be strengthened by good understanding on the comprehensive benefits provided by these ecosystems. This study aims to quantify key ecosystem services from urban mangrove forest, with a case study in Angke Kapuk Jakarta. Four types of key ecosystem services were quantified, i.e., carbon storage, air pollutant absorption, microclimate regulation, and nature recreation. A vegetation survey was conducted in 30 sample plots to collect data for carbon storage, which covers above-ground carbon, below-ground carbon, and carbon on deadwood. The absorption of six pollutants (CO, NO2, O3, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5) was analysed using the i-Tree Eco model. Field measurements of air temperature and humidity, as well as interviews with 99 visitors, were performed to analyse microclimate regulation. This study found a high quantity of carbon storage within mangrove trees and deadwood in the study area (111.6 tonnes C/ha) as well as high amounts of air pollutants absorbed by mangrove trees (11.3 tonnes/year). Mangrove trees in the study area effectively regulated microclimate conditions, indicated by a significant difference in average daily air temperature and humidity between inside and outside the mangrove forest. Meanwhile, the number of visitors benefiting from its recreation services has fluctuated during the last five years, with an average of 138,550 people per year. We discuss the implications of the findings of this study for urban mangrove forest management, including how to integrate ecosystem services quantification into mangrove preservation and rehabilitation.

TI  - Amazon plinthosols: carbon stocks and physical properties under different land uses
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The population growth and the climate changes impose challenges to society, especially regarding food supply and the maintenance of desirable soil conditions. Besides, it is necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Hence, there is a necessity of studies addressing the understanding of soil conditions under different land uses, as soils can become carbon pools or sources depending on management practices. This study was conducted in soil profiles of Amazon Plinthosols under different land uses: undisturbed forests, cattle ranching pastures, and mixed crops. Soil density and carbon fraction were assessed at four depths (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, and 20-40 cm), while particle size and mineralogy were examined at 0-20 and 20-40 cm. Soils under undisturbed forests presented lower densities and higher carbon fractions when compared to other land uses. These soils also presented the highest carbon stock; however, the Tukey test indicated no significant differences. Soil densities were lower in forest environments. Cattle ranching pastures presented higher carbon stocks when compared to mixed crops (at age 10 years). Our results indicated that proper soil management practices are needed to maintain the soil productive capacity after converting forested areas for other uses. Plinthosols, due to its textural and mineralogical characteristics, presented high amounts of quartz, demonstrating how sensitive these environments are to changes in the landscape due to deforestation and how unstable the maintenance of carbon stocks is because of such conditions. This study provides useful information to the understanding of the carbon stock in Amazon Plinthosols. It may be helpful to improve the Brazilian Inventory of Anthropogenic Emissions and Removals of Greenhouse Gases and to understand the impacts of land-use change.
